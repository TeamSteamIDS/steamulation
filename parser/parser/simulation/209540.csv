												A colorful space shooter hampered by mediocre controls, it's a step above its arcade cousin by having a storyline and a more gradual difficulty curve. It proved impossible to play with mouse, keyboard or even joystick, requiring me to plug in a gamepad, much to my disgust. Its flashy graphics are often overwhelming, to the point I more than once had difficulty actually seeing the enemies past all the explosions. A lack of variety in enemy ships and tactics and too much reliance on timed missions (especially the absolutely terrible final mission) hampered my involvement with the title. Still, it frenetic combat had its moments and - especially given the desert of space-sims these days - I could hardly turn my nose up at any offering. Flawed it may have been, but still fun.			"

												I was really having a great time at first, and it felt like X-Wing or Wing Commander had jumped forward in time a couple decades. Then I got the Strike Suit, and the game started to feel like it had a weird split personality, and half the time I was playing one of those games, and the other half I transformed into a giant robot in space and played Zone of the Enders instead. It did not seem like they fit together at first, but after playing a little more, things started to work out. However, with the ability to only save between missions and the very, very sparse checkpoints, I rapidly got very tired of having to repeat the long, easy parts of levels just to get another chance at the hard bit at the end. It got frustrating enough that I wished I had a physical copy of it so I could throw it at something. Then I uninstalled the game, even though it's otherwise fun, because I have better things to do with my time than play the boring parts of a game over and over again.Edit: Just for the record, Strike Suit Infinity addressed my main complaint with this game, and I found myself enjoying that a lot more because of the faster pace and ability to jump right into the heavier action. Ironically, I probably wouldn't've been able to get into that as easily and have as much fun with it if I hadn't spent some time playing this one first.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is a space flight combat game and takes its inspiration from numerous different franchises, most notably Homeworld, Freelancer, Colony Wars, Star Wars, Gundam, Macross and Freespace. As a huge fan of Mecha animes and space combat in general i just have to love this game.Just finished it and sadly its not that long, but maybe there will be some cool dlcs. Pick it up if it goes on sale, right now its not worth its full money, sadly.Its a good game, but they could have done better, for example entering huge ships and destroy them from the inside would have been awesome.Lets hope for good DLCs or other devs that grab that idea.

												If you like taking part in large space battles as a one man fighter (or bomber or 'strike suit') this game is competent at delivering that experience. You get to do strafing runs on Cruisers or Frigates, and taking out their turrets or weak points is very satisfying. Using the strike suit is a blast once you get the hang of it. At rapid pace you can lock and then launch about 40 missiles at varying targets, either severely crippling a smaller capital ship or thinning out a fighter formation.The story is somewhat interesting, but mostly only serves to tie together the levels. Checkpoints are plentiful towards the beginning of the game but become non-existant at the end of the game when you need them most to save yourself from having to redo sections that are cakewalks leading up to some very challenging sections.Unfortunately for me personally the frustrating checkpoint system really hampered my enjoyment during key moments of the game. For instance in mission 13 of the standard campaign a character essentially just monologues a bunch of story explanation at you while you navigate some incredibly tight tunnels for about 7 minutes before reaching your destination. There are two major problems with this. First of all the game up until this point does not in any way prepare you for precision flying, with every other level taking place in a wide open space battle. Secondly there are absolutely no checkpoints on this mission and this means when you inevitably die on this level, you must hear the explanation monlogue again... and again... and keep redoing the same simple manuevers.At it's best the game is a well put together space combat game. At it's worst it is an exercise in frustration. Overall I would say that it is slightly above average, and recommend it only to fans of the genre.			"

												This is the sort of game you -want- to like: an indie Kickstarter darling that wants to bring back the space-shooter with style. Unfortunately, it's just not very good, in many different ways.A quick overview of SSZ: obviously it's a space-""sim"", or what I call a space-shooter. It is not, as you might expect, a game based on the old X-Wing/Wing Commander/Freespace style of games, but rather a 50/50 blend of Japanese space shooters and Freespace. Your aiming reticule is not fixed in the middle of the screen, but floating around, and some missile weapons allow you to 'multi-lock' by sweeping over multiple targets while holding down the missile button. Aesthetically, the anime influences the music (think Ghost in the Shell, not anime schoolgirls). and your transforming ship/suit . Wing Commander/Freespace influences everything else, with capital ships that use both torpedoes from Wing Commander and Beam Weapons from Freespace.To begin with, even starting the game leaves a bad impression. The game's menus are very poorly optimized for mouse control, and its design suggests the devs at some point were trying very hard to prepare to the game for a console release that never happened. In addition, the game defaults to 720P, and inexplicably will change to 720P if you alt-tab to a different window, regardless of what setting you had it on before. The control rebinding is also very clunky, needlessly splitting up the keys into multiple categories based on the state your ship is in. It allows you to have the same key bound to multiple actions without warning you, and this is exacerbated by that fact that some actions will not conflict with each other (e.g. movement keys in the different ship modes) but others will. Which is which is up to you to experience and be frustrated by.Second, the writing is a complete throwaway. The space-dogfighting genre for whatever reason, has a history of having good writing, or at least interesting plots. From Wing Commander to Tie Fighter to the eternally classic Freespace, they all had writing to keep you interested. Not so here. The devs had exactly two ideas: to create a space shooter, and that it should involve a Macross-style transforming space-jet-fighter. There is no interesting dialogue; only one of the characters are even given the barest of characterizations (and he disappears after three missions). Even the backstory to the war in the game is vague and illogical, and contradicts itself in some of the loading screen expository background information texts.Third you get to problems with the gameplay- to put it succinctly, it's simply not fun. The game bounces between far too easy dogfight sections and extremely tedious destroy-the-torpedoes capital ship protection sections. The console heritage is noticeable here, with none of the weapons/shield energy systems management from classic space shooters. There's even a lack of targetting buttons to cycle through targetting enemy ship subsystems. It's all much simpler than fully Western-influence space shooters. Unfortunately, the Japanese influence on the game doesn't add much either. The transforming jet that is so poorly justified in the writing is also poorly justified in the gameplay. You need build up 'flux energy' to even be able to transform into 'mech mode', but the power of it isn't even so impressive. Essentially you use it to be able to spam infinite missiles at Capital Ship hardpoints while you have the transform meter, and to allow yourself the ability to turn much faster than in jet mode. It's not at all exhilarating, which is pretty damn disappointing for a game's central gimmick.A note on the game's Freespace 2 inspirations: when Freespace 2 was released, it was highly praised for how exciting the capital ships made combat, with flak shells exploding around you and massively powerful beam cannons being traded between capital ships. SSZ superficially copies all of this, but completely fails to capture any of the emotion. The sound design is completely lacking, so you barely notice any of the capital chips around. Flak Shells make feeble buzzing on your shield. Completely missing is any of massive weapons rocking your small fighter around in the battlefield. Capital Ship Beam Weapons also lack both a sound effect punch and the actually gameplay punch. They may light up between capital ships, but the damage is actually still done with lots and lots of torpedoes. In essence, all of the aesthetic are 'cargo-cult' ish: capturing the appearance but none of the essence.Lastly, something so terrible it deserves a section it's own, the game's final mission. The developers responsible for creating the final mission should never be allow to design anything again. They should not even be able to voice opinions about other games. The very existing of this game's final mission is a crime against gaming itself. The final mission unfolds as follows: instead of the gameplay from the previous 95% of the game, you find yourself suddenly just flying in a narrow tunnel. Your only objective is to avoid hitting the walls, which will drain your shields and armor, eventually killing you if you scrape the walls too often. The tunnel makes frequent 90 degree turns just so it's not too easy. In addition, all the tunnels look alike, and it is very easy to bounce off a wall, and get turned around without realizing it. This goes on for a minumum of 6 minutes, even if you're holding the thrust button down the whole time, and this is =all without checkpoints=. At the end, you get to make a choice about whether to destroy something for 1 briefly narrated ending, or to flying through more tunnels (timed!) to destroy something else for a different briefly narrated ending that isn't any better.If you are a decent human being, the last mission of the game alone should be reason enough not to pay even one cent for this game. Seriously. Go play something else.			"

But the game could be better.7/10 Graphics - The backgrounds universe is beautiful, but the screen is still somewhat simple and crude.9/10 Sound - The game has its distinctive music, I enjoy myself when flying and fighting. People who have bought the mega bundle can download them.6/10 Difficulty - People may find it hard to control the plane well, omni-directional flight can also make someone dizzy.7/10 Lasting Appeal - Just singleplayer mod with 3 level of difficulty, you can play over and over again to reach a high score, but times you must find it boring.Total Score - 38/50 Sehr Gut			"

												I have been wanting a fun space shooter for a while. My friends and I used to wear out Freelancer, Starlancer and Tie Fighter (the all-time king of space sims IMO). Strike Suit Zero was a fun diversion, had some cool moments, but towards the end had a very rinse-and-repeat feel to it that took a bit of the wind out of my sails. Target capital ship - lock on with unlimited missiles - fire missiles to destroy subsystems - fly to other side - target and lock on - fire unlimited missiles - and done.It is a fun game, and thats what matters, though, once I got the strike suit and learned to use it effectively, the game got too easy. I got all Platinums and all upgrades and after that there wasn't much point. Its also a tad short I think.Fun ride while it lasts. Its cheap and enjoyable, but not a ton of content really. Mission objectives are pretty much always, go here and kill this before X dies. I enjoyed it but I wont be coming back to it much.6.5/10			"

												This game is a fantastic shooter/sim.  It doesn't have all the controls of a proper sim, but the handling and vastness make if feel more than just a shooter.  The best I can compare this game to is a PS1 series called Colony Wars, which I felt was also a really good game.  The controls are very easy to learn, and quite solid and responsive.  Your HUD is simple and tells you everything you need to know.  Definately recommend playing with keyboard and mouse if you're not using a flight stick, controller seems a little lacking when trying to execute tight maneuvers.			"

												Strike Suit ZeroRating: 7/10  Overview: Solid Space Combat with some questionable design decisions.  The Good: + Graphics are fantastic, fighting ships in space with explosions everywhere, capital ships firing laser beams and seeing a beautiful planet in the background all look amazing and does a great job of immersing you into the game.  + Multiple ships and weapons that you can select before each mission, some missions however force you to use the pre-selected ship. + The main ship and the premise of the game is that one of the ships can transform into a mech that can easily dispatch enemies. Knowing when and how to use your mech is key to winning a lot of missions. + Bonus objectives within each mission allows you to unlock upgrades. You are also awarded medals at the end of each mission depending on how well you did although completing the mission under target time usually gets you the highest medal. These provide good incentives to replay the level. + The controls may take a little time getting use to but once you get good you will be tearing apart ships very easily + Achievements are not too hard to get and may take a little time, a found them to be the right mix of fun and challenging.  + Good soundtrackThe Average:Each mission has a checkpoint system and although its fine in the earlier missions, some of the longer missions could have used a few more checkpoints. There is a story...it involves you and a ship and other people and things start happening...and.....there are explosions...To be quite honest although I'm sure the overall plot is decent the story just isn't presented all that well. It's so difficult to care about any of the characters or the plot.The Bad:- One reason why it's so hard to care about the story is that each mission is very repetitive. Every missions involves the exact same thing....blow up enemy ships..over and over and over again. The only difference between missions is the amount of enemies you have to fight. - The game has some really odd difficulty spikes. Some missions you will beat very easily only to be stuck in the next mission.  Conclusion:This is a game that has such strong core mechanics that work well but is held back by some very poor design decisions. I would love to see a sequel that really adds diversity to the levels. You don't have to be a fan of space combat games to enjoy this as I found it to be pretty easy to learn all the mechanics but it does have difficulty holding interest for long periods of time. "

												It's always been a little odd to me that an idea as freaking cool as mecha has be so minimally explored in games.I guess the easy answer for that would be because making a quality mecha game is a lot harder than it sounds, which Strike Suit Zero exemplifies even as it comes possibly closer than anyone to pulling it off. In the same breath it also attempts to revitalize space combat shooters, again succeeding to a commendable degree yet still failing to shake the nagging issues that quickly present themselves. Strike Suit Zero's potential and ambition never wanes, but that doesn't stop its aspirations to come crashing down when they collide with reality.Strike Suit Zero as stated before, is a merging of large scale space fighter-pilot combat and screen filling mecha insanity, by way of the titular Strike Suit which can transform between a fast, maneuverable ship and the extremely power mecha form. The dynamic of swooping around picking off stray fighters and then switching forms to annihilate larger enemies is strategic but also just super cool, making you feel like the all-powerful terror your enemies supposedly see you as and gives developer Born Ready Games an excuse to blow the particle effects out during massive space battles that if nothing else are incredible to look at.There's a weight to your ship that feels powerful, but without the limited mobility that often comes with higher firepower. It's balanced by requiring you to charge up your ship by killing enemies before you can transformed, and this limited fuel makes combat fast and frantic, as you chain together attacks to keep your meter full while trying to keep track of the situation. Strike Suit Zero excels at making you feel like just one small part of the giant battles going on around you, but still one capable of destroying giant cruisers and chasing down fighters.Unfortunately Born Ready Games has flown a little too close to the sun as the scale of the game quickly seems to get away from them, and the experience as a whole suffers quite a bit for it. Pacing is on of Strike Suit Zero's biggest opponents, and a concept it's fairly unconcerned with. Early missions are plodding, slow excursions as stiff bombing ships before you're given the Strike Suit, but even after missions have a tendency to stretch on and on as they continue to pile on new objectives which look very much like the last. Mission variety is virtually nonexistent, giving you largely the exact same scenarios each mission but ratcheting up the difficulty to uncomfortable levels.These difficulty spikes and the unequaled number of checkpoints intensifies the lack of mission variation, which may have gone unnoticed for awhile but becomes hard to ignore when you already had to complete said objective dozens of times do to some untimely deaths. The vagueness with which objectives are explains only makes things worse, often overwhelming me with different tasks to where I didn't even know how to start or simply saying one thing while expecting me to infer the actual objective myself, usually by watching my ship explode and then reloading to hopefully get it the second time. Or the third. Or the forth. That's if I'm lucky.Much of this difficulty could likely be the result of having missed upgrades the game expected me to have, as each is tied to a specific optional mission objective which are typically much harder to achieve than the original scenario. You can likely see the problem with a system like this, as it rewards skilled play but leaves everyone else in a state of incapable inferiority. The only option then is to replay old missions attempting to unlock the necessary upgrade or pray you can somehow scrape through anyway, which in my case usually involved copious amounts of perseverance and luck.If not for the constant interruption of a cutscene I'd have likely forgotten there was a narrative here at all, one note and vague on details, delivered with monotone voiceovers telling of events you don't care about and characters you can't remember. There's the basis of something really interesting here, but it waits until the last moment to tell you any of it and by then it's too late to salvage much of anything from a story which for all intents and purposes is just you blowing up countless enemies that for some reason hate your guts.The moments when Strike Suit Zero opens up, when the pieces click into place and its firing on all cylinders, are amazing and what kept me playing despite them being perpetuated with frustration and monotony. Born Ready Games has so entirely nailed the feel of the game they wanted to create, if only the scenarios you were placed in could keep up or give you any reason to want to continue on with them.You can find more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												I tried to like this game. As a huge fan of Wing Commander, X-Wing, and Colony Wars I was so ready to love a new space combat sim, even if it leaned toward the arcade side of things.Ugh. Boring missions, terrible voice acting, and lousy checkpointing really strained by patience. The story is kind of fun, but the characters are all broadly-drawn stereotypes that completely undermine anything really interesting about it. The space combat is solid, but when you're grinding through another ""destroy 20 enemy fighters"" objective for the fourth time in the same mission, it gets a little old.Worst of all, the strike suit itself actually sucks. It has a few powers that are essential to your mission objectives, but using it in regular dogfighting makes you far, far less effective. The controls change, so you're disoriented, and by design not as mobile. So you take a ton of damage as you spin around, trying to lock on to as many things as you can with your multi-missiles. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't, but it always felt like a bad idea.It's a really, really pretty game though, and the music's amazing. Just, not much else about it is.			"

												Oh c'mon.It's a puzzle game.Anyone that is complaining about the difficulty isn't playing the game.The game is figuring out what combination of weapons you need to accomplish the mission.  You need to switch weapons fast and frequently to pass the level.  You will die, but try a different method.  Fight from far, dog fight, strafe, anything that will rope you a win.Checkpoints are spaced out a bit far, but that is also part of the strategy.  If you blow all of your rockets early, you might miss out on bagging a capital ship later.  Replay value is built into the difficulty.  I think the balance is excellent.  Well done Born Ready!  I'm in for whatever you got.The puzzle is the right weapons combination, the right tactics, and the right execution.It's fast and furyed....and Fun!			"

												One day I was watching Top Gun and I felt the need for speed and dogfighting. I have a 400+ game Steam library. I did not own an aerial combat game. I did not even own a flight simulator. I did own Strike Suit Zero. Close enough.Sometimes I forget SSZ is an indie game. It's absolutely beautiful and the game mechanics are very well done. The Strike Suit combat compares favorably with Zone of the Enders and Omega Boost. Everything is smooth and responsive. The story is basically nonexistent but that's alright. The ship designs are simply a joy to look at, even though you won't really be doing a lot of that when missiles and lasers are flying everywhere.On a sidenote, I've been rolling through the Discovery Queue recently and I have to say I am seeing a lot of indie games, maybe 10/12 every round, and the bar of quality has really dropped. I guess they just let anyone put anything into the Steam market now?			"

												I will recommend this game but extremely cautiously as you'll have to be an arcade FPS flight fan. If steam had a ""so-so"" button, I would choose that over a thumbs up. I enjoy this genre but I have a feeling majority won't. I should also mention you cannot freely fly around in space. You may freely fly around the battlefield. You are a fighter pilot from United Nations of Earth versus galactic colonies. Generally, you will be assigned minor to major roles as the battle rages on. This may include taking out turrets, specific ships or guarding one of your own friendlies. As you fight, your teammates will be doing their own thing against the enemy. This is a neat concept but the game didn't go as in-depth as it could have. Essentially, you can change your targeting system to whomever you'd wish at any moment but unless your specifically supposed to take out 7 enemy fighters, you'll have no idea how many enemies are left. The game controls themselves are okay. The rolling feature is okay but doesn't feel extremely effecting in dodging opponents fire. The flying itself takes a bit of time to get used to. Once you are accustomed to the style, most likely you will excel in the art. There are no cool gimmicks to do loop-to-loops like Star Fox or any crazy barrel rolls. Boost at least was included as well as a feature to ""brake"". They did add an arsenal of weapons to choose from. The basic weapon given is an energy weapon in which you can choose to shoot it rapidly over time or all in one burst. This weapon needs time to cool down in order to be fired efficiently again. Pressing the D-pad to the right will switch from an energy weapon to a chain-gun/machine gun sort of weapon. I personally like this one as the enemies health can quickly degrade. Missiles are another feature within the game. These can also be changed given what you like most or what you deem important for certain missions. Upon completing a few missions, the player will be given the opportunity to use other ships and even transform their ship into a space mech. The space mech can only be used when the player accumulates enough flux from landing their shots on enemies. Upon pressing A to transform, the mech utilizes it's own special set of weapons and missiles that can literally fire at many targets. This is a high light feature of the game. Overall, the flying experience is pleasurable and the combat experience is mediocre at best. The visuals are very nice and use somewhat of a luminescent look. The sounds are decent as well as the dialogue. There isn't much variance when it comes to explosions or when weapons are being fired. A cockpit view as well as a ship view is available to choose from which is greatly appreciated!As I've stated, a few people may find this game exceptional while others may stop playing a few missions in. It is fun, but it can feel like a grind after a while doing the similar missions over and over. I also found the difficulty to sort of jump at times.RATING : 6.85/10 Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots : Cockpit view  "

												Strike Suit Zero is pretty cool, I guess. You play as a pilot of the Earth Federation United Nations of Earth, which is thrust into a war against the Principality of Zeon Space Colonies  who are on their way to totally player hate on Earth by dropping a colony on it using a mysterious super weapon. Luckily, the rag tag forces on their way to stop the Colony fleet from reaching Earth pick up the powerful new weapon, the Mobile Suit GundamVF-1 Valkyrie Dancouga Galvion Gaiking Jeeg Valverave Mazinger ZGunbuster Actually, a Gunbuster or Mazinger game would be really sick Strike Suit!Fight Jacket One is a game inspired by science fiction classics like Free Space, Homeworld, and some anime I totally never heard of and/or watched. You take control of a fighter craft early on that works just like you would expect a space fighter to work. You can choose from several weapons ranging from the usual cannons to scatter guns, homing missiles, swarm missiles, etc. It's a very competent space-dog fighting game like this with an emphasis on being a small part of a large conflict.See, while you're tasked with an objective, there are dozens of friendly star fighters roaming around the battlefield in between larger ships that all shoot about as straight as I pee. But it helps in making you feel like you're fighting in an actual war instead of just being a single fighter going from mission to mission.But there's also Strike Suit's most standout feature!...The uh...The... The Strike Suit. The Strike Suit kind of turns the game on it's head and makes it feel like a really updated version of those Macross games that used to come out on the PS1. It works as a star fighter, yes, but you can charge a super mode via EXPLOSIONS, once you feel comfortable enough with what you've charged you transform into a mecha style mode and tear up anything in front of you with a complete missile massacre that makes your enemies go ""Wow, that's a lot of missiles!"" The Strike Suit itself loses speed, but it makes up for it with a dash as well as overwhelming fire power, it feels great to just unleash hell on everything in front of you with a well timed barrage. Should you play Kerfuffle Coat Two? It's a very competent space shooter with a nice gimmick. But there's a few things that ruffle my tomkins. There are a lot of times where I got stuck in an endless loop trying to get an enemy into my crosshairs, but that just may be because I'm high all the time. Some of the battleships during escort missions lose health so fast you'd think that someone was smashing everything in the engine room with a crowbar during the battle. And speaking of which, the battleships don't seem right to scale.Like I don't think the capital ship could carry all those fighters, or even yours, the starfighters look surprisingly large compared to the ships themselves. Does this review even make sense? I don't know, I wrote it at midnight, but I think I got my points across hopefully probably not. Strike Suit Zero gets 7 people reinstalling Freespace 2 out of 10. Deep Space Nine was actually pretty good. The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												This game is quite fun and a good challenge. Best played with HOTAS joysticks, but supports keyboard+mouse and game controllers, as well, for those without a good joystick available. However, the lack of any sort of multiplayer detracts from the experience, but not too terribly. I also found everything well-made graphically and often rather pleasing to the eye. In terms of gameplay, the titular machine really feels like a force to be reckoned with; however, while all the vehicles feel different from the others, the Strike Suit is the one that really stood out for me, as it most likely has and probably will for others who have piloted or will pilot it.Overall, I give this game an 8.5/10			"

												When I was a kid, I played a lot of spaceship dogfighting games, especially Star Wars ones like X-Wing vs Tie Fighter and Rogue Squadron. It's a genre that's curiously disappeared from gaming despite the same appeal -- fast-paced action, reflex & skill gameplay, gorgeous sci-fi settings -- still being alive and well.Out of the blue for me came Strike Suit Zero, an underdog sci-fi dogfighting adventure about gunning down ships, bombarding frigates, and launching 50 missiles at the same time while barely jetting out of crossfire with no shields and sliver of plating between you and space-explosion, all to a pulsing, adrenaline-pumping soundtrack. And let me tell you, it feels awesome.While Strike Suit Zero is not as meaty in content as some classics I mentioned, it is a tremendous feat by an indie studio rivaling the look & feel of many an Ubisoft or EA game, and for the most part focuses on what lean dogfighting action it must.So despite its occasional loose threads (the last story mission is a failure, unfortunately), Strike Suit Zero is a finely-crafted action experience that I'm glad to have discovered, and remain extremely excited about whatever the team pulls off next. Let it be said: I'd pre-order a sequel in a heartbeat.			"

												The funnest flight/space sim I've played since Rogue Squadron on the N64—similar structure too.You'll get the basic patrol mission stuff to start, then you're slowly introduced to combat. The missions are relatively straightforward to begin with. Like Rogue Squadron, eventually the missions start evolving halfway through—simple missions become heated dog fights as enemy reinforcements arrive.The learning curve is a bit steeper than something like Rogue Squadron though; there are a lot of dynamics involved that the game trains you in at a good pace. This is how it's supposed to work.I definitely recommend a gamepad. I'm a keyboard user, but this is the sort of thing gamepads are built for. By the last missions, you'll be twitching and flicking buttons without hesitation or thought.One more thing that makes this fantastic: the soundtrack. The blend of synthetica, ambients and old school woodwinds gives you something along the lines of space-age maritime music. I can't quite nail it down, but they definitely nailed the mood. Cruising towards the black fleet to the harrowing tune of a clarinet (oboe?) doesn't seem awesome on paper, but it is.			"

												This game suffers of death by a thousand cutsAt first, i was very much taken in. There aren't many space games anymore so it was nice to have one. The presentation of the game was nice, with voice acting for important characters, and the combat was decent (even though the controls are extremely clunky).However, after a few hours of fun, you start noticing the many problems this game has :- Dogfighting is almost inexistant. It's so hard to aim, you're better off using homing missiles to blast small ships.- Since small ships are not much more than flies, you keep encountering middle-sized or big ships to make it an actual game, but the number of different ships is very limited, so the game soon gets very repetitive, blasting one big ship after another one.- Also, the arcade gameplay means you can crash into a space station of a big ship, and you will only lose your shield, which soon regenerates. I don't ask for a strict simulation, but this is too much on the arcade side. You have no fear of big ships or close fly by, because the worst that can happen  is losing your shield temporarily- The HUD is a complete mess. All enemies icons are the exact same red. A big ships can have 10 or even 20 icons on her, because there is one icon per gun. So unless you get way too close, you usually are never sure what the heck you're actually shooting at. You can't even make out the difference between a fighter and a gun of a capital ship.- The sound effects are highly annoyings. Low health ? You get a constant beeping sound. Being targetted by missile ? another slightly different beeping sound. You locking-in on another target ? ANOTHER beeping. And you have to listen to theses constant beeps very closely because you have to notice the ""being targetted by a missile"" sound (you have to use your EMP at the right moment to avoid it). That constant beeping is driving me nuts.- And finally, the checkpoints. Born Read Games said they wanted the game to be difficult. Well, spacing out checkpoints, while reloading all ammo (making it easy to choose the low ammo, high damage weapons), and refilling all health wasn't the way to go. Especially when all checkpoints are in the ""dead"" moments of the gameplay. Usually reloading a checkpoint means you have to suffer through 2-5 min of nothing much happening, before finally getting to the part that is actually giving you problem. More checkpoints, but no health/ammo reloads would have made the game much more enjoyable, and maybe even more difficult.I will stop that list here. There are other smaller issues, but i don't want to flog the dead horse again and again. Especially since i wanted to like this game, and actually enjoyed the first few hours on it.On the whole, Born Ready Games had good intentions, and i know they had a limited budget, so they probably couldn't do everything they wanted with the game. However, there are way too many small things that make the game annoying, repetitive, and just a chore to finish on any difficulty except easy (which is way too easy).			"

												While this game is interesting and fun, it is somewhat hard to get the hang of. Do not attempt to use just a keyboard and mouse to play this; the best option would be a 360 wireless controller. Even with that you may still be left with playing with the controls. Including the game has a horrible time remembering you choose to not use  inverted controls...The music is decent, however I felt it was not very fitting of the game play, this is also one of the problems I have with it. While the music isn't the focus of game play they could have done so much better with which scores they choose for one. Good example of this would be the temps from eve online. Of course eve onlines music becomes pland after a while, however it takes a rather long time. Within the first 30 minutes of playing this I switched to custom music. (I also own the OST of this)The spikes of how hard this becomes go from, not hard at all, to extremely hard. While that is alright at times, the active save points are horrible and you will be replaying 'segments' over and over again since some things tend to vary.If you are into this kind of thing, or like 'Gundam'-like space play, this may be for you.

												where do I start? this game is simply amazingFirstly, the graphics are gorgeous though a little taxing on the computer, you'll defintely want something near the mid range to run this at the low/medium graphicssecondly, it has a great storyline and awesome gameplay, cutscenes in the middle of fighting can feel a little intrusive, especially since enemies keep moving during them but you don't, giving a few ""I would've had that guy!"" moments but it's not a big complaint from me.the variety of ships you can choose from is pretty standard, a total of 4 (Fighter, Bomber, Interceptor and Strike Suit) and you'll struggle to find a good reason to choose something like the fighter or interceptor over the Strike Suit unless you fancy a challenge, The Bomber you can choose if you want to decimate Capital Ships rather than letting your allied capitals do it.the heroes of the fleet campaign is a nice little addition too, giving you a bit more re-playability to the game seeing as you can try to beat your high-scores and all that guff that I'm not really into.If you like space dog-fighting games from A third/first person perspective, and having a ship which is somewhat similar to a scene from some anime I once saw, then this game is for you, if you're skeptical, give it a try, you can always get a refund if you don't play more than 2 hours.

												Fun space dogfighter. The skyboxes are very pretty, and the ships have a clean visual style. Combat is exhilarating and the difficulty curve is paced well throughout the game. The four ship types are not balanced well, and you will want to spend most of your time in the Strike Suit. However, this ship is awesome, as you can transform into a flying space-mech and unleash huge barrages of swarm missiles, taking out large numbers of enemy fighters in one fell swoop. Some of the later levels get very hectic, and it can become tough to keep track of the battle around you. Capital ships can be annoying as they are bristling with many different turret types, and locking onto and destroying the correct turrets can be finicky. Story is passable, but nothing special in the slightest. Soundtrack is really great, it sounds like a mixture of electronica and Indian hymns.			"

												I don't understand some of the posited reviews saying that this game is too hard or chaotic or bland. The game is not too difficult, it just has a bit of a learning curve. Truly, I thought it was too easy at first. If you're a passable shot in Wing Commander or Ace Combat or anything like that, you should be a dead-eye marksman in this. I went through the first three levels not using the lock-on function. It was only later that I discovered the game has a freaking target-lead reticle. If you cant shoot using that, don't say anything about it because you're a walking advocate for gun control. Of course, then comes the part where you get a mech. Maybe that part was easier for others. I had no idea how to use the damn thing at first. I'll tell you this much; it's not a fighter, but once you get the hang of it and get some strike mode upgrades it's hell on...legs. The Strike Suit is unbelievably maneuverable, not the slow thing some would have you believe. I became an ace with it fairly quickly just by spamming random momvement input and keeping the cursor on-track. Anybody can do that. As for chatoic; yeah, it's chatoic. Gloriously chaotic. Ever play ""Homeworld"" and wonder what it would be like to be an interceptor pilot in one of those mad dogfights where everyone is set to evasive tactics? That is this, glowing contrails and all. Even so, it is not unmanageable. The ""F"" key will helpfully direct you to what you're supposed to be shooting at. Just use it and use it fast because you will need time to orient yourself to which side of the a capital ship or somesuch your target is actually on. An improvement to this game would be to make targets with no LOS a different shade of red. Then there's blandness,  an argument I have seen in every video review. There aren't enough varieties of enemy ships or varieties in missions. I can sorta see that; everything boils down to attacking or defending, rather than including the more diverse missions of space fighters, like attending airshows or flying to Cancun for a weekend. I jest, for there is some merit to the argument. Why doesn't the mech do more mech things, for instance. Well, for starters this began as a freeware game and doesn't have the engine for that sort of thing. For another, it's a Japanese mech so it doesn't have to make sense. It's all about awesome battles set to goregous backdrops and great music. Call me crazy, but getting those out of the way is a major step to making a decent game, so I don't regret a cent of the cost for the steam mega bundle. That said, one of the really nice surprises in this game is not just the chaos, but the frenetic pace of the action. Hands up if you've played an ""intense"" game where something needs to be done ""right now"" and it turns out that you've got forever and a couple of sick days to do it. Not so in SS0, thank the powers that be. When told to ignore the enemy fighters and flak, it's no joke most of the time. You really do have to be quick, especially if you want the juicy upgrades.   It's not a game for everyone. If you don't like explosive arcade flight sims, you won't like this game. If you think the Strigoi Squadron in Ace Combat was too easy, you need to spend a few hours in a centrifuge to learn some respect for gravity due to acceleration, but if you're somewhere in-between I think you'll like this game.

												Graphics: It has great atmospheric graphics. While the graphic itself is not comparable with Crysis for example, it still is stunning how it all looks. The background, the ships and even the tracers of weapons.Controls: The controls were really complicated. But after the first 2 missions you get used to it and experience how you can do anything you want. From fast barrel-roll dodging to sprint-dashing to an enemy sentry. You have to get used to the game in general. Gameplay: It was absolutely lovely. Pure greatness. It's fast space-combat while you're in the middle of massive ships shooting at each other with an army of tiny ships flying around you. A great space dogfight.  I had a lot of fun playing this game, while the missions were quite monotone I still enjoyed every mission as it's kind of a 'kiting' game. Attack, when your armor is low fly away, get back when your armor is replenished. And honestly: It wasn't even boring.As I got the Strike Suit, the gameplay completely changed! It was still a kiting game, but as soon as I had enough Flux (the power to be the Strike Suit and shoot with it) through my normal ship even as I had low armor I was still offensive with my Strike Suit because you had the opportunity to dash away and had a new fighting system.I absolutely loved it.Story: There are 5 different missions with every of them including something for the story.You're a guy who has been sent in deep in space to join the forces of Earth while they're attempting to intercept the fleet. You're in an interstellar war: Earth's forces (U.N.E, United Nations of Earth) fighting against fearless enemies to protect a planet which is shortly before destruction.You begin as a low-priority guard near Earth. You have an Apex Ship which can't transform into a Strike Suit yet.After an attack, Earth's command say that the enemies are intending to end the war with one decisive strike.They've amassed a colossal fleet and are bringing it to Earth.The story is ok, it gets you fast into gameplay.Music: It pumps you up, isn't obviously repetitive and fits with the atmosphere and the art of fighting.Endings: There are multiple endings. You can choose which one you want. For example, the secondary objectives you choose to complete directly affect the state of Earth and the end of the game. With multiple endings, preventing Earth's destruction is your immediate concern but preserving its future is your ultimate goal.Unfortunately: The game doesn't get any of it's promised updates, which is annoying and sad.And all that for 19€. (18€ with the Director's Cut)I would definetly play it again.Looking forward on buying ""Strike Suit Infinity"" (6€) which apparently puts you in waves and waves of the decisive war.			"

												This game has been abandoned by the developer. Having both Strike Suit Zero and Strike Suit Infinity, it feels as though they split the story mode and gauntlet skirmish mode of one game up into two separate games that should have been sold as one game at a slighty higher price. The base and DLC campaigns are enjoyable to play through the first time and total to 18 missions evoking themes that make me remember the Homeworld series campaigns. However, there is very limited replayability beyond trying a handful of different ship and weapon loadouts on the same missions.Further, a graphics update, an additional strike suit from Infinity, and a new strike suit design were released separately to a Director's Cut edition. I understand other people may disagree with me, but I feel that these upgrades should have been sold as a DLC for this version. The Director's Cut steam page also has negative reviews noting that the developer abandoned that version as well, with new bugs introduced into that version left unfixed.Unlike Infinity, Zero is mod-able with Steam support. However, few mods have been produced for this game and the community appears to be defunct. There is no mission editor.I cannot recommend it due to the above points. It may have acceptable value if you are only looking for a space combat title to play through a few times then uninstall - even so, I would only buy it during a sale, and I would suggest that you buy Infinity over Zero or the Zero Director's Cut due to Infinity's relatively higher replay value.

												Remember Homeworld? Just add new graphics, space mechas, a space-flight/mecha sim, and less plot and that's what Strike Suit Zero is to me (which is just as well, since the composer is the same as Homeworld's, in a very noticeable fashion).If you don't remember Homeworld, however, I'll break it down: Strike Suit Zero is a space-flight/mecha sim hybrid with a story that takes you and a small fleet far away from home and into deep space. The objective, or plot, is to take Earth back and a new development in technology, the Strike Suit, will make it possible. The damn thing is the Deus Ex Machina device of the game, and you control it. That doesn't mean that it's necessarily overpowered, however. The ""mecha"" funtion of the ""suit"" is limited to how much you shoot with it. Kills and general destruction grants a special 'fuel' for it to allow you to transform from space ship to mecha form, and unleash pure death. You have to conserve this great power, since your ship-mode isn't the best against all of the enemies you will face, so some strategy and tactics along the way are necessary to stay alive and complete your objectives.The game, overall, is short but challenging. I'll say that, after a few months of picking this up, I haven't touched it much since I finished it, but it's a bit of a guilty pleasure as well. It's hard not to appreciate firing thrity-odd something missiles at multiple targets, and even harder doing the same to large-scale capital ships. And it's in space. And it has great OST.This isn't a game that anyone can really tell you about; this game is an experience. The blend of music, gameplay, and setting makes it good while it lasts. The ending (or endings) isn't the best, but it's not worse than Mass Effect 3's, so the good characteristics mentioned prior more than make up for it.			"

												On paper Strike Suit Zero should be right up my alley. I am a sci-fi buff and I love to fly fighters (on rails or not) across striking space vistas. So I jumped in this game fairly excited.First the story, or should I say something scramble together that only serves to move the game forward; Humans discovered space travel, humans colonized other worlds, humans divided into two factions, humans fight...and that's pretty much it. I understand this is an indie game but the folks at Born Ready could've worked harder. A great story is usually free.Visually I found the game to be stunning. Even though most backdrops had a ""paint"" feel, everything was most pleasant on the eyes. Sound effects were top notch as well. Explosions, collisions, warning cues, felt meaty and had impact. On the music side things weren't so nice. A good ""Mass Effect"" ambient music is peppered here and there, but during most missions the music defaults to a theme build on arabic rythmns and instruments. To say that it clashed with the visual is an understatement. Gameplay felt solid, controls (with a 360 controller) felt just right, though the default binds are not the best, I urge you to customize them. The screenshots might give you the feeling that this is an on rails game but it is not. There is a mission area with more than enough room to let you try different strategies. On the flip side, mission objectives are all linear and most are accompanied by a countdown.Where things crackle is in the overarching mechanics. The game has 13 missions, each of them long and segmented. The game relies on checkpoints to save your progress and they are NOT evenly placed. On normal difficulty, the game can be hard. More often than not, once you die you will have to replay a big stretch of the mission, any sense of progression is lost and the game becomes a chore.You can also earn upgrades for the suit, but they don't seem to make a lick of a difference. For instance you gain a shield upgrade, but in the next mission the shield is still the same lenght and diminishes at the same speed as before. Furthermore, the only way to gain those upgrades are through secondary objectives, which is fine by me. The problem is that in some missions the game won't offer any visual cues to inform you on your progress OR the secondary objectives are so hard/impossible to accomplish that you simply give up.Pros :-Striking visuals-Solid controls-Variety of ships (you get to fly more than the suit!)Cons :-Some gameplay mechanics and checkpoint system makes the game a chore-Subpar and inadequate music-Upgrade system is useless-Enough with the countdowns-Final mission is a joke-Achievements are a grindFinal note : I can only recommend this game to hardcore sci-fi shooters. Born Ready shows promise though, if they can spend more time refining their mechanics their sequel can be great. PS. The game offer VR support, If I ever get my hands on the Oculus Rift I will play Strike Suit Zero again. On VR this game should be a blast!6/10			"

												Almost 10 years ago, I played a mecha action game on the original playstation called ""Omega Boost"". It was fun, frenetic, had massive battles and bosses, and also had a great soundtrack. My game console broke, i lost the CD (still got to pay my friend for that...) and the game faded in my memory...Now, after all those years, I found a game that brought me the same joy I felt back then. If you enjoy space combat, mechas, sci-fi and neat designs, this is a must. Also, some guys in the development team worked on the true RTS masterpiece, Homeworld 1, which is another reason to buy and play this pearl.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game. It has so much going for it, and I wanted to enjoy it quite a bit. The controls, however, render it all but unplayable.It's a beautiful game. Built by a small team, it looks fantastic. And if you're like me, you've wanted to strap into a transforming starfighter mecha for a long, long time. This looked like the perfect little game - not too long, not too short, and leagues of potential.It started rough, piloting a starfighter for a couple missions and blasting through debris, enemy fighters, and some small capitol ships. It wasn't perfect, but I accepted a bit of a learning curve (I've never been great at dogfighting segments of other games, so I was ready to have to work up my skill here). Once I hit the third mission and was given the titular Strike Suit, it all went to hell. Immediately bombarded with far more targets and action on the screen than up to this point, it was extremely hard to tell what was happening, where to go, or what to do. They give you a nice targetting arrow, but when the whole screen is constantly flashing red and the sounds of explosions are flooding everything, that little red arrow is tricky to find. So it's total sensory overload, but even that could be overcome IF the damned strike suit could maneuver with any degree of control. It cannot.I reduced the mouse sensetivity to the lowest possible settings, and still the slightest twitch of my hand had my targetting reticule flying all over the screen. I spent 20 minutes trying to get a handle on how this was supposed to work, but finally gave up. No matter what I did, the strike suit careened around wildly and utterly out of control, making it impossible to try and pursue objectives, lock onto targets, or generally have any clue what was going on. Maybe it's me. Obviously others have played and completed the game, and obviously some have really enjoyed it. But my experience was that it was impossible to control the ship, and so impossible to enjoy the game. Perhaps using a flight stick controller makes a difference, I don't know. Maybe players more expert in flight games can make a better go of it.But, if you're like me and are a starfighter/mecha enthusiast but not an old hand at flight games, you might want to give this one a pass. I got it for $5 and played for around 2 hours before walking away. That's about the return on investment of a movie ticket, so I'm not angry, but I can't say I'm happy either.			"

												Another day, another Kickstarter. This time it’s Born Ready Games and their first foray into the space combat genre with single-player-fighter-turns-into-mech game: Strike Suit Zero. Raising $174,804 with the goal of $100,000 and achieving the stretch goal of mod tools, Strike Suit Zero is another shining example of what crowd funding can do for small time developers. Strike Suit Zero—or SSZ—is a space combat game similar to classics like Tie Fighter and the Wing Commander series, but with one big caveat: you can turn your fighter into an anime styled mech.You take on the role of Adams, a faceless, voiceless pilot who has apparently fallen out of favor with his superiors. You have to earn the trust of your commanders and comrades in order to be allowed to take the helm of a fighter again. You know, a real rebel story, where you’re Starbuck and everyone else is completely incompetent. The story hinges on some cliché elements, like a woman fused with an AI construct, a commander searching for his white whale, and Adams being the chosen one, all of which are totally mismanaged and telegraphed from the get-go.You spend most of the game with your wingman and commanding officer, Reynolds. She’s a fiery, but effective, leader who will deliver such witty monotone one-liners as, “You know the drill, Adams” and “I’ve got your back.” It’s unfortunate that the voice actor seems as if she’s taken twelve Ambien and just wanted to go sleep instead of offering a moderately appealing performance. That seems par for the course when it comes to all the voice acting in the game. There was plenty of opportunity to use the voice work tactfully, but for some reason the best mechanical use is, “They’re going after Adams.” This line is repeated constantly with no context and sometimes no real reason other than to fill quiet time. It’s unfortunate that Born Ready Games didn’t seize more opportunities to use voice chatter as a mechanic rather than ambiance that breaks immersion and falls flat.Mechanically, the game is pretty simple: cycle targets, shoot targets, win the game. It’s fun for a while, but becomes repetitive. Missions are long and don’t vary much. You’ve got the typical escort, kill, bombing run, and capital ship battles that are tried and true tropes of the genre. You can unlock new weapons by earning medals and special objectives, but you really don’t need to grind in order to progress. There’s nothing really new or earth shattering, either. The controls work well, but you’ll likely find a flight stick or gamepad better-suited to gameplay than a mouse and keyboard.The defining disappointment though, is the very thing that separates the game from the rest of the genre. The mech—also known as Strike Suit—is incredibly underwhelming and mostly boring to use. You gain a resource called Flux, which powers the fighter’s Strike Suit mode by dealing damage to enemies, thrusting, or taking damage. Think of it as a rage meter from World of Warcraft. You use Flux each time you shoot or fire rockets from Strike Suit mode. You can gain Flux while meched out, but the amount is reduced greatly in order to get you to use it more strategically. It just feels like the mech could use more unique abilities beyond shooting and firing rockets to make it more appealing.If there is one thing SSZ does well, it’s visuals. The space-boxes are beautiful and do a great job of immersing you in the universe. You really feel like you’re in space, dog fighting, looping, and bombing. The ships are all nicely rendered and have a distinct visual style inspired by countless space operas and animes.If you’re into future-tech animes and flight combat games, you should have plenty of fun playing SSZ. If you like the idea of a fighter that transforms into a mech and expect to get something out of that, you’ll be disappointed. Only around one third of the thirteen missions feature the Strike Suit, which you don’t even use in the first couple of hours. There’s about 5-6 hours of content though, so you will get decent bang for your buck. If that’s not enough for you, there’s always Freespace 2 and the mass of mods being made to this very day.This review was based on a day one retail copy of the PC version of Strike Suit Zero developed by Born Ready Games			"

												For what it's worth it's a great looking and sounding game but the dynamic of the space combat is largely disinteresting, boiling down to hosing down waves of enemies or making passes at larger vessels. The only ""tactic"" in this game revolves around the Strike Suite, a contrivance that technomagically charges itself when you destroy enemies. A mechanic that once aquired evaporated any verisimilitude I may have had towards the experience.For all its polish, the mechanics of the combat left me dissatisfied and wanting for more. This game should drop the ""Simulation"" tag and call itself what it is; an arcade shooter.			"

												To hear my full thoughts on Strike Suit Zero, listen to the review on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]I found that the game hits a sweet spot between a simple arcade-style shooter and a complex spaceship sim. As such, it is relatively easy to learn and control but has a fair bit of challenge and you can really feel yourself improving as you play. SSZ is also a highly focused game. Story, graphics, and sound design are all good but not great and it only has a relatively short singleplayer campaign, with no multiplayer or other game modes. However, the core gameplay is definitely strong enough to carry the game and make it worth playing. Flying along an enemy capitol ship and blowing up its turrets and fighters in a space mech is very fun and empowering, even if you end up doing it a lot over the course of the game.Overall, I'd recommend it to people who like singleplayer space combat sims, especially the Freespace series.

												I really enjoyed playing this game. It just looks really pretty and that your space ship can transform is just funny.And i really liked the fac that objectives are clearly noticable on the map because i usually lose the way in this kindoff games.The only problem i had were that in the last map if you hit a wall its just hard to get control again over your space ship.The game itself is a bit short in my opinion but i really enjoyed playing it and it was definitely worth my time and money.So in easy words:Pros:- Beautiful Game- Your ship can suddenly transform ( To funny )- Different endingsCons:- For somereason the controls arent that easy- If you hit a wall you are mostly marked to death in the last missionRating: 7/10 "

												I can't say exactly what is wrong with this game but due to some reason it couldn't grab me. I've finished the rather short campaign (13 missions 10-15 minutes each). The story was unremarkable. The charcter you play is unremarkable. In short - the whole game is unremarkable. It does have a remarkable number of DLC's though.			"

A fair warning, once you get the strike suit, this game will start getting very strong on the fustercluck of enemies, bullets, and missiles.I only got it recently as of this post but I already like it alot*Edit* I don't like the last level but the rest of the game is really fun.

												Strik Suit Zero is a very refreshing take on the tried-and-true SpaceDogfighting formula, and has drained away a lot of my time, despite Steam claiming otherwise. The gameplay is phenominal, it's like playing the balls of god- if they were deep-fried and required a gamepad. The visuals are very flashy, suprisingly bright, and very pleasing to look at; despite not being ""up-to-par"" they definately deserve some praise, because I've never seen so many ♥♥♥♥ing light trails. Not even in Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack is a very calming, yet tense J-Pop-esque compiliation of themes that give me eargasms, and when combined with the sound effects, will make you spaz out in a pool of your own urine. The story sucks. There's nothing that could redeem it, really, read a synopsis. It sucks. Luckily, you'll be so immersed, that you will care about every character anyways, two-dimensional or not. Also, the A.I is pretty great if you ramp it up to hard, other-wise you might find it a peice of cake. HOWEVER difficulty is insane if you want the ideal upgrades on hard, requiring borderline suicial amounts of replays to accomplish. Overall, pick this up over the DX unless you really want an actual story or ninja mechs.			"

												I really liked this game, it's quite rare to me see space shooter game where you witness the pure destruction of enemies battleship. It's like that old PS1 game Colony Wars and other space shooter with transformation and space wars, also this game is quite colorful and beautiful to watch and scenery just amazing. Even though, I find this game sometimes repeating some parts and it maybe be quite short story, also it doesn't have checkpoint on when you done the first part of the mission, just after you're finished mission, but it is really good game and I had fun time with it,  I really higly recommend this game when it got this discount and if you're really into space shooters, I also recommend the Strike Suit Zero: Infinity, it is quite fun arcade type of this game and quite challenging.

												Very fun! Story is great it actually gives you alternate endings and you can unlock quiet a bit of things in the game, best way to discribe it is flying and mech space shooter, if that makes any sense. It can get tedious as times with the constant ""kill this group"" in every mission but I think it is worth it, especially if you love Gundams or space ship shoot'em ups.Music and imagery is just gorgeous. Controls can be either mouse+keyboard/ Controler or joystick. The controls take a little bit of time getting used to but after that it gets pretty fun.I have to say the most frustrating part of this game is the checkpoint system and the end mission is nothing like what you are doing throughout the whole game which is just all kinds of frustrations, other then that I think the game is worth a paythrough at least.

												Strike Suit Zero is a great indie title. I am sorry I waited so long to play this game. I bought it as a bundle and the game sat on my inventory collecting cyber dust for several months. It is a great standard space shooter. If you just want to get better at dog-fighting, this is your game. If you are looking more of a space sim with trading and stuff, this is NOT your game. However, the game is very good at what is does. The battles go from easy to hard in the blink of an eye. You will find yourself fleeing away from enemy fleet laser cannons and turrets quiet often.  Contrary to popular belief, I found the controls of this game to be very good and responsive. I can see how people who are not very good at dog fighting can argue that the controls are bad. Don't listen to them. The game is fast pace and YOU need to be fast, YOU need to be responsive. I found myself switching between weapons and third/first person mode CONSTANTLY, just so I could get the shot I wanted for the easy kill.  The game has bright colors, great music, and explosions...lots of them!!  Strike ModeI loved the concept of Strike mode. Basically, as you progress along you get a new ship that’s has the ability to transform into a mean robot looking beast that takes out everything is its path. The best thing about it is that if you are not into that sort of thing, you don't have to use it. Simple! In short: The game is very good at space combat. It is hard (hard=good) with good controls and I'm yet to see a bug or crash. Once again, great Indie space title. Play it!			"

												Strike Suit Zero is a sweet space battle action shooter.Compatible with Oculus Rift, the well opimized animations and graphics give the player a good sense of diving into the emptiness of space right into the faces of enemies riping them apart with canons, missles and torpedos.A great variety of types of ships will make you set priorities on your targets in order to keep the allied fleet alive. From fighter ships to huge Frigates and Titanic space carriers.The targeting system is awesome, the explosions are nicely tone, you can even see the debris left behind from the ships killed.The battles are impresive and well set.The game also introduces you to a great feature which is getting a ship that can transform into a mecha, changing your movements into vertical and shoot some kinda AA Gatling canons that rip your enemies into shreds.2 things i didn't like on this game.-Having played Strike Suit Infinite (awesome game as well, same features - arcade mode) the music started getting very boring and repititive and had to turn it off at some point.-The final mission of the game is not like the rest. They literally took every concept I hate from all the 90s games and put it in it. Narrow close quarter paths with obsticles, spicky ♥♥♥♥, lasers and a ♥♥♥♥ing timer above everything.And finally I have to say I wasn't satisfied enough with the controls. Not many people seemed to have the same problem with me so you can say it may be just be on this but things seemed a bit too sharp for me.General input: Recommended if you love space action and flying a ship into battles.Do not let teh final mission take down the average experience from the game.Do buy the Strike Suit Infinite for unlimited battles and lots of fun.CheersPS: sorry for crappy grammar, i did this review really fast.

												Having spent my childhood playing great space combat sims like Wing Commander, Conflict Freespace and Starlancer I was looking for a fresh modern take on the genre in Strike Suit Zero.After a very promising and artistically accomplished introduction (reminiscent of Homeworld) I looked forward to launching into epic space combat with giant robot suits, against a backdrop of an engaging universe and back-story.The game certainly delivers on the former - once the Strike Suit is obtained, there is ample opportunity to rain gloriously intense, multi-directional death on your enemies the likes of which I've not seen in other space combat sims.Unfortunately that's really the only selling point. With your superior firepower, the game quickly becomes an arcade shoot'em up as you take down endless waves of enemy fighters and capital ships. There are the odd stealth or escort missions, but generally the gameplay suffers from a lack of variety. Performance upgrades to your ship can be earned by achieving optional objectives as an incentive to replay missions, but unless you're into maxing out achievements, I did not feel that this was a compelling enough reason to revisit missions. The missions themselves are linear - so if an objective is failed you simply have to restart from a previous checkpoint.The backstory of Colonials vs Earth, alien artifacts and AIs had a lot of potential, but this was not fully explored. The enemy is simply a faceless evil armada hell-bent on the destruction of Earth while your rag-tag fleet are the good guys standing in their way. What prompted them to this extreme course of action? What atrocities did Earth commit to warrant this genocide? Nothing is explained. The characters are equally forgettable. While the voice acting is fairly decent, character development is non-existent: they are simply there to give you orders.With better variety, pacing and story-telling, I would have considered this a great game; it certainly falls short of my childhood favourites. However, as the product of an indie studio, this is still a slick and polished product that is short and fun if you're looking for your fix of gratuitous space battles. And giant robots.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is an interesting space Mecha game. Although the Mecha designation might not be the best here. First of all you are the only who can transform from a normal space ship fighter to a mecha which is much more powerful, however also more stationary. And there is only ship capable of transforming and you don't even have access to it all of the time. Most importantly perhaps is that your time in the Mech mode is limited, you can transform as soon as you gather a little bit of energy (which you can do automatically and very slowly over time, or quickly by destroying enemies), but you also quickly expend that energy simply by firing on your opponents. It seems that the only way they managed to balance the game is by limiting how long you can stay in the more fun Mech mode.The targeting system also isn't very helpful, and there is no overview of what kind of enemies you're fighting. So the only way for you to get an overview of the situation is by actually looking around. That becomes very problematic in the later missions when you're tasked with protecting your fleet and you've got multiple enemy cruisers coming down on them, with your main objective being to destroy the beam cannons which do massive damage to your fleet. However as there is no overview there is no good way to be sure that you've actually neutralized the biggest threats. Unless you know for a fact how many of each ship is out there, which of course you'll only learn once you've failed the mission and that is simply not good game design.Background music for the game is very nice, however it can become quite repetitive as there isn't much variety there.The story itself is very generic, but still passable and kept my attention to the end (which comes quite quickly though), which is more than most other similar games can do.All in all, the game isn't anything special but it's fun to play, at least through its short campaign.6 / 10			"

												After playing several space games, this is finally a superb game for action lovers! It's still enclosed in some kind of story, but you can fly and roll around and blast (almost) everything away. :-)  The graphics are not too overloaded but still great - exactly right for a shooter like game. It runs on Ubuntu 12.04 64 Bit very smooth with everything maxed out on a passively cooled nVidia GT430 card. Joypad Logitech Rumble Pad 2 is perfectly supported and you need all sticks and buttons to controll the most important functions. It's a real blast for gamers that prefer action over strategy.2016-05-22: reinstalled and played again on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 Bit with integrated graphics AMD APU 7850 and AMD APU 3870. On both computers it runs very smooth with medium settings in 1920x1080. Only in very heavy action FPS goes down. The game seems to have problems when played with a joypad (Logitech Rumblepad 2) as after a few minutes the game just minimizes. Playing with keyboard+mouse, this doesn't happen. Great space 3D action shooter with nice graphics, good effects and very good sound effects. The latest version supports 3 degrees of difficulty (easy, normal, hardcore).			"

												Strike Suit Zero is one of the best space battle games I've come across. You take the place of U.N.E pilot Adams as he is given a prototype strike-suit in an attempt to stem the advancement of the Colonials in a really good story-driven campaign. The game is quite challenging and some of the battles are of epic proportions with hundreds of vessels of various sizes fighting at the same time! The strike-suit brings my thoughts to the good mecha-anime-series and it is pretty bad-♥♥♥ but not invincible. The game is unfortunately a bit spoiled by a very frustrating monologuing last chapter that would be fine if it wasn't so unforgiving due to the somewhat wanting control mechanics. Still, it's a fairly minor issue with a game that is otherwise awesome so it still gets a recommendation!			"

												This game is too hard. I like hard games, but i like hard games that are fun while they are being hard. This game is not. It's really unfortunate because the graphics are really cool and i haven't played a game that made me feel so much like i was in a space opera since TIE Fighter or Babylon 5: I've Found Her. But this style of game has dated a lot, and Strike Suit Zero emphasizes the worst parts of the genre (combat) while neglecting the parts that made it good (storyline, dialog, wingmen, flying around massive space stations in awe...)I could overlook the fact that your wingmen shoot blanks and your capital ships just float around waiting to be destroyed by insanely slow-moving torpedoes, if it wasn't for the cheesiness of being tasked to single-handedly take down enemy capital ships in a puny fighter that never stops flying forwards. Nevermind being able to fire thrusters to strafe around your target - you can't even come to a dead stop. It makes the whole game feel like Rebel Assault or some other oldskool rail shooter, except for the fact a turret will take you out in about 0.42 seconds. And if you do manage to somehow waste your target, don't worry, you won't get any time to enjoy the scenery, because the mission will either immediately end, or (more likely) another three capital ships will drop out of warp to blast you back to a checkpoint half an hour ago. Great concept, poor execution.			"

												This game is getting way to much hate, hence the reason I felt writing this review, since it has caught my heart as being one of the best space flight shooters I've ever played together with that PS1 game back inte the days, what was it called let me look up... ah yes, Colony Wars, awesome game.So there seems to be a lot of complaints about the difficulty of the game. Let be break it down to you, the type of incompetent people that like achievements nonetheless that brought WoW from the glory of its TBC days to the disgrace of post WotLK days, are also the same type of people complaining about the difficulty of this game. If you're one of those people, stay away from this game, and any other game that has an exceptional potential for stimulating gameplay, because we don't want you ruining them.Else, you'll have an absolutely thrilling experience as the game progresses. I still have fond meomeries of the intense, adrenaline rushing and stimulating gameplay as the story and missions kept escalating. The finish was awesome, as were the extra missions added by DLC, especially the ""Impossible Mission"".The music adds an amazing atmosphere and works well with the graphics and artstyle, creating a great experience beyond just merely the gameplay.Now there are only two downsides. The first being optimization for the final mission, which they might have fixed or at least improved since I last played it, which was quite a while ago.The second is that, since the experience is so great, it also feels a bit short, although having some replay value due to its stimulating gameplay.All in all, I'd love to see a sequal, building upon the good that this game already has and improving it even further.Pros:(+) Stimulating, exciting and escalating combat and gameplay.(+) Great music.(+) Nice atmosphere.(+) Sufficiently good story.Cons:(-) Possibly lingering optimization problem for final mission.(-) Would be great if the game was considerably longer.

												Strike Suit Zero was, if I'm not wrong, one of the first successful kickstarted games and it delivered exactly what it promissed. Strike Suit Zero manages to provide you with a fast and frantic space combat, either on 3rd person mode or cockpit mode. It will probably remind you of early space games on the PC market. The game takes place on a raging conflict between the Colonists and the United Nations of Earth (U.N.E.) where you fight alongside the U.N.E. forces on a struggle to save Earth from total destruction and uncovering a hidden mystery about an alien ship that was found on one of the colonies. Visually, the game is stellar, providing you with total immersion during each fight, specially during massive fleet battles between carriers and cruisers with tons of explosions and projectiles. Now, the soundtrack is absolutly great it really reminded me of the old days when I used to play Homeworld 2 and Strike Suit Zero actually made me feel like I was piloting one of the fighters from Homeworld because the setting is so similar and I'm pretty sure it was one of the inspirations. Other than that the story at first might not be all that great but on the last missions it starts to get interesting and it will tickle your curiosity. The combat does an amazing job, it feels extremely satisfying both when using missiles or rockets or when using your main gun, probably the best fighting sections will happen with the actual Strike Suit Zero. I have one complain about this game however, I found the final mission extremely hard and frustrating and I fould myself raging, it does not feature any kind of enemies but what it does feature is a corridor ""racing"" segment which ended up with me going against the walls 95% of the times. Other than that, this was a total blast to play and I highly recommend it, it is definitely one of the best space fighting games I've ever played. "

												Like most space shooters, this game has no variety. All you really do is zoom blindly around space while trying to maintain the odd and disorienting controls. As ""Blast all of the bad guys!"" is the game's motive, my interest was instantly withdrew, and I go back to playing Space Invaders on my Atari. The controls are very unstable, and every gameplay session feels bland and plain. This game requires a lot of patience, but what good is that for video games? The whole point is to have fun, which, sadly, this game does not offer to me. The only reason that this game is in my library is because it came with my computer, I've played it twice and got bored after two missions.Who knows, you might like it more than I do. You can give it a shot, if you'd like. Just remember that Steam Refund is always an easy ticket out.			"

												I really enjoyed Strike Suit Zero up until the point that I didn't. For the most part, Strike Suit Zero was a really fun and well done starfighter-like game. However, the very last mission was poorly made. It's dull and requires you to listen to a very long dialogue from a certain character. If you mess up, you got to start all over again and enjoy getting your ear talked off. I don't want to say much about the final mission at the risk of spoiling something for those who might want to see for themselves. But a fair warning to those who pick up this game, it is quite literally unplayable. The design was not built for mouse and keyboard controls, maybe a joystick... but it sucks so bad visually that I don't think even that would help.Despite all that, I had a fun time playing Strike Suit Zero. Some of the missions proved to be frustrating with their oddball objectives that required you to do things in a very specific way to avoid failing the mission. But for those of you who remember games like Star Wars: Tie Fighter or Rogue Squadron might like to check this one out.Final Verdict: (3 out of 5)Rating may have been way higher if it wasn't for that final mission.

There are ""only"" 13 levels, but they still offer more hours of play than many overpriced AAA games.Game was not good at release. You couldn't change difficulty and checkpoint system was completely terrible. They fixed it and now it works perfectly.If you are huge fan of mecha anime (like me :-D), buy it. Models are Macross inspired. If it only had G mode so you could glide in the capital ships like Rick Hunter on the Zentraedi capital ships... Story is the copy of classical Gundam story - there is a war between Earth and colonies, and the main weapon which will change war is Gundam, I mean Strike Suit. I'm perfectly fine with it.			"

												Have to say this game is awesome, by far the best space sim ive played since Freespace 2 back in the day. It takes awhile before you can control the strike ship well but once you do your love it!! Go for it..... its time to strike :)			"

												Buyer beware! Although the game is technically controller ready, it is practically unplayable. It's painfully obvious that the whole aiming system was designed with the much more accurate mouse in mind, using a controller the ship has the maneuverability of a pregnant whale and the grace of a dead cow floating in a rocky mountain river.

												Fun at times. However it suffers from the usual stuff devolpers can't seem to bother with. Your teamates are useless and every mission depends on your craft to perform almost every task. The only good thing your teammates do is absorb bullets. And there's the other problem. Several missons you are forced to defend these useless teammates. Your are forced to run around the whole battlefield to intercept missiles and other crap your useless team can't stop themseleves.The story shares many things with homeworld series. (not very original).Was able to reach lvl 12, then I had to turn it down to easy to make it past that lvl. Made it to the last lvl and what was the designers thinking. This lvl is among the worst I have ever seen design wise.			"

												PROS:Combat is very fun in the fully 3d environment.Music is pretty cool.Ships are different enough to make each one interesting.Can replay missions with new ships, aka can strike suit all the missions if you want.Weapon variations are equally fun.Target system is a joy.Full controller support (took me awhile to get the hang of it with 360 controller).Story is so-so but fully voice acted.CONS:Last mission is a giant steaming pile of horse you know what.Sometimes the music cut out for me.Kinda short.BOTTOM LINE:Would recommend on sale, it's a fun game. It has decent replay value. Just REALLY wish they didn't have that utter crap final mission.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is a game that has me completely and utterly engaged in space flight and combat.  I cannot stress enough how fun this game is!  If fast paced frenetic action with a lot of stuff blowing up seems like something you could have fun doing then by all means stop what you are doing and buy this game right now!  I have to say that this game is not for the faint of heart because it will have you moving on from one enemy to the next and then wishing the level didn't end because you had so much fun blowing stuff up.I have only encountered one problem and that I am getting a pretty horrendous screen tearing, even with a Nvidia GeForce 770m.The lack of multiplayer is also a little bit depressing as I would have LOVED to blow freighters and carriers up with my friends and even partake in dogfights in huge strike suits over vast open space.This game needs to be played.  I'm a firm believer in giving this 9/10 because of the price, the arcade action, the visuals of constant explosions, and the amount of insanity on screen.  I only wish it was longer as I'm on the last mission already.			"

												Awesome game for the little money it costs. Reminds me a bit of Battle Engine Aquila, that I used to play when I was just a kid. Played it for 5 hours now and I'm at 51% through the campaign, but missions are getting harder and take longer to complete them.Graphics are good (1920x1200, graphics options maxed out), but not outstanding. The engine handles the big fights with lots of ships and explosions at the same time very well, with almost no framedrops. Would be nice though if the background had a higher resolution.Controls are very intuitive, but there is quite a learning curve to use the ship optimally. I see some people complaining on the web about (lack of) checkpoints, but there are plenty in my view. About 2 or 3 checkpoints in every mission (missions take 10-30 min), you can't manually save however. Storyline is not that great, but who cares, you get to blow up fighters, bombers, frigates and sometimes even cruisers, and lots of them! You can also fly in realistic in 3 dimensions, meaning you are not stuck in a sort of 'plane' that some space games have. Personally I like the soundtrack that comes with the game, but that is of course very subjective. One thing irritates me bit though, the game has a lot of very loud explosions. In (real) space you wouldn't be able to hear any sound at all.			"

												Pros:1. Fun space/flight shooting with flashy effects2. Overall very smooth3. Not very hardware-taxing (old game, of course)4. MACROSS MISSILE MASSCAREEEEEEEE (when in strike mode of course)5. Implemtation of transforming like Macross/Zeta Gundam allows stationary firing in a dog fight which is interesting to play with6. Controls are easy and to-pointWanted improvements (tho Born-Ready is gone so i doubt if it will be fixed at all)1. Sometimes doesn't hit objects even you visually saw it hitting head-on, probably a hitbox bug or sth2. Multiplayer is completely absentCons:1. Plain-♥♥♥ storyboard - sorta like Gundam 1-year-war, except no enemy characters are seen and essentially has no plot whatsoever, which really hurts a mecha-based game (and no improvements were seen in Director's Cut). Characters also sometimes doesn't make a lot of sense over the course of the story, although this is circumvented in Director's Cut where most characters were given backstories, have more emotion express, but still overall not good2. Bland voice actor/actresses - The blandness of characters are further worsened by the voice acting which is also as bland as hell. Probably a result of plain storyboard and non-professional voice actors, causing extremely tense fighting like Part 12 doesn't sound right when Raymond doesn't sound too concerned about the large numbers of enemies. Circumvented in Director's Cut where most character's (especially Raymond's) voice are more expressive and coped with the situation3. Last chapter is really a pain in the ♥♥♥ to play with - I mean with all the fightings you've experienced in 1-12, you suddenely end up piloting the fighter in tubes of flashing light, which makes already-hard-as-hell navigation and piloting extremely difficult, especially when you are already used to the broad space you've been with.Overall a good game tho, recommended despite the flaws in the game.

												It's a shame we live in a world where a 65 rating is considered bad and not just average. In light of this, screw Metacritic.SSZ is a straightforward, arcadey space combat game with a twist. Being able to transform into what's essentially a Gundam is a great spin on the genre, and you get a real sense of power when you do; casually swatting away swarms of enemy fighters and missiles like they were nothing. Yet it balances this power with an energy bar of sorts, the more enemies you destroy, the more the it charges, making you swap between the two forms often, which keeps the pace of the action high and stops it from degenerating into constant dogfights.Strike Suit Zero is a pure fun. If you like streamlined, action oriented space games, this is easily one of your best options available. It's a simple beast, but it's also a fast paced, satisfying, and damn good looking game.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is one of the best space simulators to come along for a long time, and is comparable to Freelancer, Homeworld and O.R.B. in terms of enjoyability. While it has striking similarities with Project Sylpheed, it concentrates more on action, fighter-to-fighter dogfights, and smaller realistically-powerful weapon loadouts. The story is somewhat watery, but is a tried and true plot; the interactions with Control (and the A.I. 2.0) are amusing and probably simulate true intelligent and powerful A.I. There is a wide variety of settings for playing the game, and even the mouse and keyboard (for me) worked wonderfully. I would give this a 9, 9.5 maybe out of 10, and would recommend buying this, especially if you can get it on sale, to any lover of space games that aren`t strategy.			"

												In the nineties space combat was a thing of the present and many series became part of gaming history. Then history apparently decided to move on and the genre has been lain dormant for years. Strike Suit Zero is the debut from indie studio Born Ready Games and gives ample reason for both nostalgia and anticipation.Developers have clearly studied the genre classics but I did not see Strike Suit Zero as mere retro but rather as classicism. All the lessons learned from the past are condensed into a clear, timeless form. There is no extra weight anywhere. No side paths are taken nor excess features added. You can shake and batter the game all you want but nothing will come loose.This principle extends to the writing as well for there is no characterization and virtually no lore. I enjoyed being spared expositions and lore dumps but on the other hand missed the sense of history or touches of everyday life. The game world is elegant and pure but cold, almost metallic, and this will not appeal to everyone.There are thirteen missions in the campaign and most of the criticism towards the game have been directed at the level of difficulty. It has to be said that many missions required complete restarts and in some cases replaying earlier missions for missed upgrades. Whether or not this is a bad thing is up for debate. I enjoyed the challenge and the general mission design where things escalated in a logical fashion. There are typically two checkpoints per mission and restarting from one will restore both hull and ammunition which makes things more manageable. The titular Strike Suit is powerful to say the least but requires skill to master. The missions are so intense and tightly knit that a precise execution of the objectives is always required.For a Kickstarter title I was continually stunned by what I saw and heard. The soundtrack is the equal of any recent sci-fi game and was composed by Paul Ruskay of Homeworld fame. Even better are the fantastic visuals. Seeing the screen lit up by capital ships' beam cannons and dozens of fighters and bombers fighting for survival is spectacular to say the least. The potential for screenshots is great indeed, especially given the various backdrops ranging from misty nebulas to a destroyed planet. Voice actors sound calm and clear throughout and fit the atmosphere admirably. Developers clearly believe in their work and have been very active with the community, posting on the Forums, adding free mod tools and patching as needed. Given the fact no one can jump out of themself and think as a bodiless ghost objectivity is a hard thing to achieve. Accordingly I cannot say how Strike Suit Zero would feel for those unfamiliar with the genre. On one hand the game almost expected that I already knew space combat beforehand. Weapon and targeting systems seemed familiar and so did the process of supporting capital ships in major engagements, et cetera. On the other hand there are no serious post-millennial competitors out there at the moment. Strike Suit Zero is like space in more ways than one: cold but beautiful in a way that appealed to my personal tastes very much indeed and will more than likely do the same for anyone wanting to embrace the void for the duration of this gaming experience.

												Strike Suit Zero is a love letter to your nerdy, nerdy childhood - a time when it was reasonable to buy several $200 flightsticks and throttles just to pretend you were flying around space, chasing bandits down and wondering just what made that strange backdrop of exploding stars happen. The combat is quick, making it feel very arcade-like most of the time but there is still plenty of room for tactics, which become necessary to master towards the game's ending. The story element is presented through decent dialogue, but I never felt that i was really into it for that, this game is for those that love dazzling fireworks in a free moving environment, and not for those that get motion sickness at all. Definitely one for the couch, too - the trails of your missles create an atmosphere unto themselves that is at once exciting and zen-like to behold.If you can handle the anime-touched sensibilities inherent in the ship & character designs, and the idea of a transforming ship makes you smile, you'll have a good time with SSZ, worth the asking price for those who've missed good space shooting for the past decade (and a no brainer for everyone else when on sale).

Storyline is not that great, but who cares, you get to blow up fighters, bombers, frigates and sometimes even cruisers, and lots of them! You can also fly in realistic in 3 dimensions, meaning you are not stuck in a sort of 'plane' that some space games have. Personally I like the soundtrack that comes with the game, but that is of course very subjective. One thing irritates me bit though, the game has a lot of very loud explosions. In (real) space you wouldn't be able to hear any sound at all.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is not a pretentious game, but in its simplicity it's an astounding space sim. Controls are easy to learn and responsive, the graphics are crispy (not fabulous, but they do their job very well), the music give this game an anime-like mood... and most importantly, the game is insanely fun, with battles against both fighters and capital ships. If you like games like Freespace, don't miss this, you won't regret it.			"

												I held off buying Strike Suit Zero for a long time because I figured there was no way it would be as cool as it looks. Seeing it on sale at Steam was the final nudge I needed to pull the trigger and I can now say it is actually cooler than it looks. I’m sorry I waited so long to pick up this title.SSZ will appeal to anyone who was a fan of games like Rogue Squadron or Colony Wars on the PS One. It’s not quite up to level of depth that X-Wing or Wing Commander had since this is more arcade shooter than simulation. If you liked those games, though, I’d still recommend SSZ since the whole space dogfighting genre seems dead and you won’t find better nowadays. SSZ has fluid and intense gameplay with great graphics & music. Voice acting is spotty but not bad.The controls may take a little getting used to but once you master them you’ll feel like a boss in the titular Strike Suit. Spamming your swam missiles has a very Robotech/Macross feel and never gets old. I played this with a Xbox 360 controller for PC and found the controls very tight & responsive. No idea what happened to some other reviewers who say the controls are clunky. They may be trying to play with keyboard & mouse but I learned long ago rule #1 of space shooter games is to bring a joystick or gamepad. The missions have a nice variety and are thrilling to play through. The narrative is pretty solid, too, and keeps you interested in moving along. You get scored on each sortie and can also unlock a particular upgrade if certain optional goals are met. Once you beat a mission, you can replay it using any new fighter craft or weapons you’ve unlocked. Some people complain the missions get repetitive and are impossibly hard. I didn’t find them repetitive and they may be too hard if you don’t get any ship upgrades. I’ll admit I went back & switched the difficulty to easy mode to pick up a few, which is an option for anyone who thinks it’s too hard.Best of all, there are checkpoints inserted into the sometimes lengthy missions. This is a welcome feature since you don’t have to keep replaying the same thirty minutes of a mission over & over again when only the last five minutes are giving you trouble. Checkpoints are frequently placed right at those optional parts required to unlock upgrades which again is very nice since, if you miss the optional goal, you do not have to start the entire mission again from the beginning.SSZ isn’t a perfect game but some reviewers are going overboard on their criticism of it. This space & sci-fi combat genre is one I miss a lot and I’ve had a blast playing this game. If you are a fan of any of the titles I mentioned above, you should definitely pick it up. It feels like a blast from the past & a new experience at the same time.			"

												It's a shame we live in a world where a 65 rating is considered bad and not just average. In light of this, screw Metacritic.SSZ is a straightforward, arcadey space combat game with a twist. Being able to transform into what's essentially a Gundam is a great spin on the genre, and you get a real sense of power when you do; casually swatting away swarms of enemy fighters and missiles like they were nothing. Yet it balances this power with an energy bar of sorts, the more enemies you destroy, the more the it charges, making you swap between the two forms often, which keeps the pace of the action high and stops it from degenerating into constant dogfights.Strike Suit Zero is a pure fun. If you like streamlined, action oriented space games, this is easily one of your best options available. It's a simple beast, but it's also a fast paced, satisfying, and damn good looking game.			"

												Quick Summary: Strike Suit Zero is like a slightly inferior version of Freespace 2, but still a good game. You also have the option of transforming into an ♥♥♥ kicking space robot, so that’s a plus.About 300 years in the future, mankind receives a signal containing instructions on space travel, leading to a glorious age of exploration and colonization. Of course nothing good lasts and the Colonies eventually want independence from the United Nations of Earth (UNE). Things come to a head with the discovery of alien technology that massively tips the scales in favor of the Colonies. Too bad you play a pilot for the UNE so you’ve got your work cut out for you.Strike Suit Zero starts off as a space fighter simulator game very similar to Freespace, but with less weapon and ship customization and you’re not the “squad leader” so you can’t order your teammates around or call for support. Your ship has guns and missiles for weapons, and shields + EMP for defense. The EMP is like a flare that you fire off right before a missile hits you to deflect it. Some of your missiles have lock-on capability and are good against fighter craft, while others may be dumb fire and be good for hitting large slow capital ships. Yes, the capital ships have turrets and weak points that you can destroy to keep them from chewing up you and your teammates. A few levels into the game you gain access to the Strike Suit, a prototype fighter with the ability to transform into a humanoid robot with superior weapons after gathering enough “flux.” You gain flux from killing fighters or shooting turrets off of the larger enemies. Think of it as a kind of hyper meter that you constantly gain and spend by transforming into the strike suit and firing your weapons. In strike mode your main gun becomes like a flak cannon (moderate damage but auto-aiming) and your missile weapon becomes a super-fast lock-on homing missile that can acquire large numbers of targets before firing (with infinite ammo). Basically if you have to wipe out waves of enemy fighters, switch to strike suit mode and just spray them dead.Pros:+I like space fighter games where you fight large enemies mounted with large numbers of destructible turrets. With patience and accuracy your fighter can take down corvettes, frigates, cruisers, and even carriers.+Some nice music to blast your enemies to.Cons:-The story is mediocre-You need to have the game’s DLC to get about half of the game’s steam achievements.Overall the game is fun and actually less difficult that it seems. I played Strike Suit Infinity first and got my ♥♥♥ kicked. I should have started with Strike Suit Zero since this game actually has a story and slowly ramps up the difficulty. "

												A good old-school arcade/action space shooter. Non-stop action, explosions and very little plot in-between them; do not expect a complex backstory, or an open-world game like Freelancer or the X series! Just blow up your enemies wave after wave and then fly to the next waypoint/mission!PROs- very good visuals- system requirements are not demanding- good soundtrack- non-stop action- you fly a FREAKIN' TRANSFORMING MECHA WHICH SPAMS 40 MISSILES AT TIME- some missions are quite challenging, even for a veteran (which is a good thing in 2014)CONs- clumsy targeting controls (for fighter mode), targeting then becomes irrelevant in Strike Suit / Macross Missile Massacre mode- once you master the Strike Suit, it becomes a mindless slaughter- it is quite a short game (took me 10 hours to complete the main campaign and to unlock all the upgrades/titanium medals)- to add a few hours of gameplay you have to buy the Heroes of the Fleet DLC, which is another 6€ if not on sale- upgrades unlock in some missions requires you to actually replay such mission many times only to avoid the death of a certain non vital allied ship or to kill an Heavy Cruiser with a light figher... Definitively not fun			"

												SSZ is the kind of game you're either going to love or you're going to hate. For me, I absolutely love it. While I am definitely not the best at combat simulation games such as this, I do love them immensely. Strike Suit Zero increases that love with the transformation of the fighter into the strike suit, a type of semi-humanoid mech. It's in the same vein as Macross, and in fact takes inspiration from Macross (the missiles in the generic strike suit are called Circus, while the Raptor they're called Itano). The soundtrack is great as well, and many songs have a very Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) feel. It doesn't hurt that you're part of a fleet of ships either.All in all, if you love mechs, fighters, and lots of explosions, I recommend this game.			"

												Supposedly this game got a lot of criticism, but I really enjoyed it. Few games have helped fill the 3D-space-shooter void that Star Fox 64 left behind, but this comes close enough. The combat is challenging but feels pretty good (with a controller, mind you), although sometimes it can be hard to aim at fast enemies in the disorienting 3D environment. Still, it feels really good to play, and the great soundtrack is the icing on the cake.			"

You should pass up this version for the directors cut (which has more content, better visuals and a more interesting plot). There is also a stand-alone game for those who dont care for the story, where you just blow things up in waves that get progressively harder while upgrading your fleet to fight alongside you (Strike Suit Infinity).But if you want to opt for the cheaper version of the game, by all means.

												If your looking for a game similar to No Mans-Sky, I say Strike Suit Zero is close to it with a few twists.  The enviorment you fly around in is beautiful both in a third person view or in cokpit view.  The graphics are way much better in this game than in the first game Strike Suit Infinity.  The core gameplay in Strike Suit Zero is balance between simulation and arcade shooter, creating an excellent combat experience so says IGN: games and entertainment media company.  So yes the fighter craft combat is very welldone and is very enjoyable, it will be hard to control at first but as you continue playing through, you'll get the hang of it and then the gameplay will be much more easier.  Also this game hs a great storyline to it with awsome cutscenes. Heres the idea of what the story is like: In the year 2299, an interstellar war rages on. In a bid to save Earth from destruction, you must take control of the Strike Suit – a revolutionary fighter craft with the ability to transform into a lethal suit of space armor. Immerse yourself in massive fleet battles where your dog-fighting skills will directly affect the fate of the cosmos.  Discover a colorful and vibrant universe, with an epic story where the fate of Earth hangs in the balance and your actions will determine the outcome: preventing Earth’s destruction is your immediate concern but preserving its future is your ultimate goal.Other than that I highly Recommend you to play Strike Suit Zero.

Summary-Do not buy at a price more than $5 (In another words, only buy during sale)-Buy for the experience, not for gameplay, not for storyStorylineI did not bother with the story. It appears you are just a pilot that is participating in a war and you act on mission objectives given, there is nothing more than that.GameplayYou control an array of planes depending on the given mission and you shoot down enemy units in a dog fight. You have 2 sets of weapons: The main gun and missiles. The main gun does consistent damage on the enemy while missiles does large amount of damage but needs time for them to reach their target. There are additional variations of weapons for the 2 main set of weapons. In my opinion, the weapon balance seems okay as every weapon has its pros and cons. The controls are easy to learn but hard to master, easy in the sense where you can get used to the controls fast but difficult to completely avoid evenmy fire through evasive manuvures.This game is playable with a mouse and keyboard.However, there is one major annoyance over the control is the fact that the mouse sensitivity of every machine you use is different, so everytime when i am required to use another plane in a new mission, the first thing i had to do is to go to the settings and adjust them. What should have been done was either to make sure that mouse sensitivity is consistent in every unit or make seperate options for each units.ExperienceEngaging in an epic fight in space was an awesome experience especially in the first 3 missions. In fact those were the best times i had in my entire playthorugh. I loved the shooting projectiles of the main gun, i loved the cluster missile movement and i loved how enemy interceptors get shot down.Switching into strike mode is also amazing because they deal a ton of damage and the firing of rockets at multiple targets is very satisfying. The best part is that you can instantly dodge missiles and projectiles by just double tapping to do a short dash.While i loved the experience of shooting down enemies, i really hated the mission layouts to the core. After enjoying sweet dog fighting in the first 3 missions, the rest of the game was essentially a speed run and I hate them in general. You have to complete your mission within a time limit before your capital ship explodes and you fail your mission. More than half of the play time clocked were spent retrying the mission only to fail again. I don't mind failing a mission because I got shot down, but failling a mission over something that you have little or no control over really pisses me off.Another thing that I am extremely upset about is that the target system in this game is inflexible. They only target on the objective and completely ignores all other targets. This completely defeats the purpose of having ' target nearest enemy'   button when it continues to target a carrrier miles away when I was flying right beside enemy torpedoes. Due to that, an attempt to even delay the destruction of the capital ship was impossible.A game that was initially enjoyable suddenly became stressful and irritating to play to the point that I took months break twice from the game. Final WordsTo me, the game experience is mixed, while I loved one thing, I hated other things even more. Therefore, I feel that this game worth nowhere near $20.			"

												I wanted to love this game, I REALLY did.  Mech fighting suit in space?  Why aren't there more like that?But it just doesn't work here.  The suit is hard to control and feels sloppy.  The battles are repetative, mostly because you die so easy and so have to hide all the time.  Nothing really that cool looking in space, which is sad.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is excellent, though to reach it's full potential I find that a controller or joystick is best.The combat is it's strength. Combat is SSZ is fun, first and foremost. The game does an excellent job of providing a degree of power fantasy while still giving a good challenge.Graphics are phenomenal. It's a cinematic game to say the least. Not all the designs are the most original (the main fighter looks like a Terran Sabre from X3:TC), but I didn't notice anything deliberately stolen, and there's nice variety.The plot is mostly a device for getting from one place to one place where you feel like a badass or get your ♥♥♥♥ wrecked to another place where you do more of the same.I would note, the Director's edition fixed my main complaint of *giving* me the shiny new death machine, but then not letting me *use* it half the time.In any case, I enjoyed the game thoroughly. I recommend the DLC as well.			"

												Strike Suit Zero (SSZ) is a frustatingly beautiful game; the personification of a game with excellent gameplay marred by horrible enemy variation and an outlandish story. You are a pilot of a fleet taking off to exterminate an alien threat. The game's namesake ship however isn't even obtainable until the third mission - and even then you are charged with taking other ships such as the interceptor (a variation on the starting ship) and a bomber (which was actually pretty cool to operate). The aspect of the game that makes it most difficult is the combat: I want frentic warfare - not a jumbled mess. The dogfights are engaging if only for a moment; taking down capitol ships is an exercise in bullet/missle-sponges; and using the strike suit is like drunkingly blasting ships. Plus it leaves you more vulnerable to attacks - which makes no sense because you have to garner flux to use it and equipping (transforming) the suit should make you more of a bad ♥♥♥. Instead it makes you a sitting duck that relies on wobbly shooting (granted, lock-on firing is available). The story actually has a good conclusion but everything before it is wonky. At some random point there is a grand coupe de tat that is massively overlooked because you are too busy trying to master the controls to even pay attention to the dialogue.The game's greatest weakness is that it doesn't flaunt the suit! Let me free fly with this piece of machinery. Make it more controllable. Make it worth garnering flux! Sadly, the game falls flat for me, and beating it was a months-long mission whose only vincidation of knocking off one more game off my protruberent Steam library.			"

												So let me begin by saying: If you enjoyed the space combat in ""Freelancer"" you'll probably slide right into this without a hitch.I did enjoy freelancer a lot, but the combat wasn't the only thing in the game. So that's where the similarities end. Strike Suit Zero is entirely combat missions. That's it.Shoot the baddies in space, fulfill the requirements and get an upgrade to your ship's stats (which really don't seem that noticable, max ranked shields feel about as sturdy as rank 1) and as you check off missions in the list you will get new weapons.There really isn't any customization, and upgrades aren't that big a deal. Some ""upgrades"" come with a cost, such as using up more energy for a better gun... but you can't really upgrade your energy -on demand- so you're going to choke after firing 5 or six shots.You have about four ships to choose from barring the purchase of any DLC (Strike suit- is butts outside of strike mode, Fighter- basic ship, more boolets/missiles than strike suit's basic mode, Interceptor - a little mosquito, Bomber - infinite slow as dirt torpedos, fires ping pong balls for bullets, decent amt of missiles)The eponymous ""Strike Suit"" only becomes available after three missions of flying a basic little fighter craft around, and comes with it's own kind of annoying mechanic: a ""Flux energy"" bar, which is powered up by blowing crap up, You can then expend this flux energy to go into Strike mode: a robot suit, instead of pursuit mode which is your base crappy ship which has less armaments than the starter fighter ship. Strike mode lets you actually start killing things and operates like a dream. Really they should give you some kind of option to play with an infinite flux bar, because the strike suit is basically where all the fun lives. You can instantly track targets with a press of a button, you fire cool dancing missiles that wreck enemies, and you can -STOP MOVING- which is probably the MOST IMPORTANT PART OF STRIKE MODE. If i could put my ship engines on full stop the way strike mode can hold position, I WOULD.Strafing runs are crap, but all the ships except the strike-moded, flux using strikesuit, are forced to do strafing runs and it is garbage. In Freelancer you could -gasp- STOP YOUR SHIP and sit there FIRING AT THINGS. It even comes with it's own built in downside so you don't need to balance it with ""stop fuel"" or something ridiculous, because YES you're a sitting duck BUT you can focus fire those annoying stationary battlecruiser turrets and such.There are a LOT of stationary targets you're expected to either burn all your flux energy on or do a zillion strafing runs at.Graphically it FEELS like everything is at 1/2 scale. Like I'm playing with minatures or something. enemy ship models could stand to be increased in size by about 1.5x to 2x.Really if there was a way to use points from missions to upgrade my ships further (add more guns to the underpowered pursuit mode of the strike suit) a button to mash for -FULL STOP- on any ship so you could sit and fire like a turret at a stationary target, and a few more weapon options (energy missiles, some kind of missile without ammo aside from flux) this might just scratch all my space ship itches. Is the tagline ""Space combat reborn"" accurate? No, it's freelancer style space combat without some of the key moves (cut engines & drift, stop) and without any real customization (you get a energy gun, a machine gun, and pick a missile type.)As it stands, Strike suit zero isn't a bad game for what it is: a short space combat mission-y romp.Is it worth the current asking price of 20 bucks? Ehhh... Get it on sale/bundled or something, there's not that many missions.			"

												I took down my earlier review after giving up trying to reconfigure my logitech gamepad and settling with KB+M.  Since I play most of my games using the latter, I don't know why I initially tried to shoehorn the game controls to the former.  The only thing I rebinded were plasma shot/missle selection and single/double shot toggle to the scroll wheel and mouse button 3 respectively.  Then I lowered the sensitivity of strike suit mode to match that of the ship.  After that the gameplay opened up and I must say that it is now smooth like butter.  Nothing is more satisfying than whizzing around a capital ship in strike suit mode and stripping away all of its turrets leaving it as a defenseless husk ready to be taken down.  Anyways, the story is not anything worth writing home about, but it serves its purpose in moving the game along.  The backdrops are beautiful and the gameplay works for me after tweaking some of the lackluster default bindings.			"

It is about flying around in space, going fast, dogfighting other fighter pilot aces and making awesome torpedo runs on capital ships.  Everyone I've ever heard talk about it who played it also liked it.  The transform-into-giant-robot thing is also cool and not anime.  Buy asap if you like being a space fighter pilot.			"

												The name ""Strike Suit Zero"" comes from the fact that there are no ""Strike Suits"" in this software, but what does come packaged is a great Tax Filing software. This terrible rebranding of the famed ""Turbo Tax"" software series is initially disapointing, but very helpful in filing for a mortgage on your home.			"

												If you watch the trailer, and stopped for a second to think ""wow this game looks pretty good"" you should stop right there and buy it. Personally, its brilliant - combat is fast and frantic, dogfights against impossible odds have you diving, rolling, and charging - guns blazing - around the map. Thats not to say combat is easy. There are moments when piloting elegantly and unleashing the variety of weapons in your arsenal becomes extremely difficult - and this is completely forgetting about the ability to rapid transform into a flying combat mech that can wipe out entire fleets with missile barrages and cannon fire while dodging incoming missiles.Cons of the game? No free play, just campaign. Lack of enemy units. Enemy units prefer to use swarm tactics to beat you - individual fighters have no combat skill. But the pros of the game outweigh its cons by far. Get the game, if you like games like this.			"

Игровой процесс сводится к переключению на ближайшую цель/торпеду и стрельбу в ""точку гарантированного попадания"". Единственное, что реально круто - саундтрек. Это по большому счёту единственное, за что игру можно купить. Играть при этом не обязательно.I love space simulators both arcade and sim, but this one is total rubbish. Standart fancy graphics, standart prescripted missions, standart ""good vs evil"" plot, and standart console action ""switch to nearest enemy-fire till it blows up-repeat"" game process. The one and only real bright side of this game - gorgeous soundtrack. It worth to wait for a sale and buy with soundtrack DLC. Playing isn't necessary.			"

Steam was nice enough to refund my purchase to my Steam Wallet, even though this, according to their EULA, they don't do.

												So... it's a starfighter that transforms into a Gundam suit. Spaceship shaped like a person is still the dumbest idea ever (yes, even dumber than the double-decker couch). In addition to being a stupid idea (seriously; why does a spaceship need legs? They don't do anything), it's poorly executed.The first three missions of SSZ are solid. Great game. It's freelancer with a bit of a facelift and no trading business to distract from the action. Then you actually get the Strike Suit and the game becomes unbearable. On top of the absolutely useless targeting system, the redundant (and pointless) HUD elements and lack of control customization, controlling this thing is just an absolute mess.Yes, they finally patched-in the ability to re-map the controls but not all of them. Dodge is still hard-bound to ""double-tap a movement key."" So when I have all my movement bound to proper control axes, dodge is physically impossible. I can't ""double-tap"" my flightstick to the left. Also: the Strike Suit can't roll.Bottom line: consolized beyond playability. Not a PC game. Absolutely do not buy. Whatever you want this to be, you probably want it to have the basic requirements of playable one expects in a PC game, which it doesn't have.			"

												Strike Suit Zero seems like a good game. It has pretty backdrops, some fun and exciting music, and the promise of a robotic mech spaceship to annihilate enemies. But the gameplay is so frustrating that playing it is a chore, and a frustrating one at that.The basics combat system is good enough. It's fairly easy to get the hang of picking off enemies and sending missiles in every direction. In fact, Strike Suit Zero feels the best when it has you fighting against dozens of enemy fighters, honing in on enemies to build up to the moment where you can transform and unleash hell. But that's a small part of the game. At least 50% of the game is attacking larger stationary ships, taking out cargo, or blowing up turrets, all of which is so boring or frustrating that it brings down the little bit of fun the dogfights provide. To make matters worse, there is a constant barrage of turrets, cannons, and other non-evadable damage that not only steadily drains health but keeps the screen in a disorienting panic that's less exhilirating than it is confusing. Many missions, especially the incredibly tedious ones that involve picking off every turret from a large cruiser, turned into me going for an attack, then flying aimlessly while my shield recharged before trying again. Rinse lather repeat.If you're looking for your fill of space dogfighting, I don't think Strike Suit Zero is your best bet. There are many older games, and even some very recent ones that are starting to fill that hole better. If you're dedicated to playing every space game out there, you'll probably have fun with it, but otherwise I'd sit this one out.			"

												This game feels like a generic space shooter. It is like Freelancer except that you can't go wherever you want, and you can't take the missions you want. I was looking forward to using the strike suit, but that is also disappointing. In strike suit mode all you get is more damage to your normal guns, missile spamming abilities, auto-aim (if you want it), and the ability to dodge incoming attacks. Dodging in strike suit mode actually seems less effective against missiles than using the deflect ability in normal flight mode :(.  Strike suit mode also runs out very quickly when you try to use a lot of missiles, and then you are just back to normal flight mode. Most of the levels are just fighting waves of enemies and blowing up large carrier space ships, which gets old fast. The final level feels like it is trying to be more like Star Fox and it doesn’t work out. There are no enemies, and you just navigate through tight corridors. This game isn’t worth your money.			"

Unique to this one is the ability to use Strike Mode -- temporarily transforming your fighter into a powerful mech capable of free three-dimensional movement.  This game is fast-paced, but encourages a strategic approach to combat and completing mission objectives, switching between Strike Mode and the standard fighter as is appropriate for the task at hand, managing energy efficiently to maximize Strike Mode's effectiveness, and targeting weak points and weapons to cripple enemy ships while defending your own.It's a great game, lots of fun, and surprisingly intellectually engaging as well.Totes recommend.10/10, would mech again.

												You will only find the targeted missles useful, unless ur dealing with relatively stationaly items, you are guaranteed to miss (and thats where the targeted missles come in), but don't waste them, you only get a certain number for the ENTIRE mission, not one section, the ENTIRE thing. Don't waste your ammo, you dont want to be running around with no ammo, however, you do have to kill quite a few ships or you will fail, so the the question is: when does the mission end?			"

												Great game that is realy fun and can challenge your spacial reasoning a little.  Don't buy it expecting to find a long and complicated story line, what you will find is a nice game that is very mechanics based, with little focus on the story, but hey, if you were looking for a story, you would go read a book.  The perfect solution to several hours of boredom.  HOWEVER, I would recomend that you buy the director's cut, as it has the DLC built in, and it is (at the time of writing this) the same price.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is a game weighed down by difficult mechanics and a predictable and lazy storyline. Strike Suit controls are goofy and despite being a ""sim"", feels more like an arcade shooter. The visuals are bright and pretty, but feel out of place and uninspired in the context of total war. It's only an indie game, but a game's a game.			"

												If you like mecha anime like Macross Frontier, play this game.In it's normal mode, the fighter combat is pretty solid although most weapons feel like pea-shooters.However despite what some say, I feel that the game's a bit too easy on the normal difficulties. In fact, most of the time I end up dying due to rubbing my hull against an enemy ship than from enemy fire. Another complaint is that the controls for the space-mecha mode are broken to the point in which you can basically give up on manually aiming. I end up selecting my target beforehand and hit-and-running my target into submission.Despite it's flaws, it's a really solid game. I throughly enjoyed it and I would recommend you buy it.			"

The controls take some getting used to especially once you get to the strike suit itself (which is also the most fun), but once you got those, you'll have tons of fun slaughtering hordes of fighters and bringing down capital ships.My only critiscism so far is the lack of explanation on weak points on capital ships, which is done in Strike suit infinity and I only played that after I finished Zero.

Once you know how to play you can beat any mission, and some missions are fun to go back and beat by piloting different kinds of ships. If you are looking for a playable, compelling story, it's here.

												this game reminds me most of ""Mobile Suit Gundam: journey to Jaburo"". this is a very, very bad thing.  i cant make it past the second mission, and i can't tell if i'm a moron or its just that difficult. if i'm not being slaughtered by the corvettes then the frigate is destroyed, its proving impossible to find a balance between the two objectives, and even if i achieve one i'm shot down by the capital ship. i have rage quit no less then four times to count. i haven't even got to pilot the eponimous strike suit. THE HELL! seriously why don't i start out with a strike suit! why aren't my wingmen more useful!? why isn't the mercury any damn help!?  why can't an XX billion dollar space frigate more effectivly defend itself!? why has it caught a sudden case of ""white base"" and despite it being a state of the art capital ship its basicaly made of paper mache!? why do my missles have such a short lock range!? why cant they hit flak turrets effectivley!? finished Gundam, and despite the difficulty i felt i had achieved something. even if i do by some miracle finish, no, even just make it past the second mission: i still have no idea whats going on in the story and its so stock i don't think i care. i can't even think of my C.O.'s name. ... it looks really cool though, space is fun. ... i don't want to play it with the keyboard. ... i shouldn't have to. tldr SAVE YOUR MONEY.

												We need more games like this. I feel like the Mech genre of gaming is dying out, and that's sad because mechs are awesome. Theres so much potential in this genre and if Strike Suit Zero hasn't struck gold, it's at least found that glimmer of hope that will lead other developers to this field of gaming. Twinstick, VR, or just Mouse and Keyboard, we need more games like this one.			"

												The game is absolutely breath-taking. The graphics alone are worth the price tag. The story is well done, it wastes no time throwing you into the action, and when it's time to deliver this game brings out the big guns. I honestly cannot imagine anyone regretting purchasing this game.It truly is a fun game, and worth every minute.I'd say the main testament to this game is the fact that I am re-installing it right now, because I want to run through it again.

												A solid arcade style space combat simulator with respectable graphics, great gameplay, and a great soundtrack.  If you're a fan of space combat flight simulators and a fan of mecha, this will be your cup of tea.  If you're looking for the hardcore, unbridled space fighter simulations of old reborn, this isn't quite there, but it's a good start to revitalize interest in the genre.  Still, this game is fun and presents a fair challenge.Controls are responsive and defaults are well planned out for keyboard/mouse users.  A few different classes of fighters, each with a customizable loadout of weapons you unlock as the game progresses are available, though most of the non strike-suit ones are one offs for particular missions (but they are selectable in others once you complete the mission in question.)  Going into strike suit mode is very reminicent of classic mecha anime where you can heavily damage or eradicate many of your enemies in one fell swoop if you're good enough, a bonus for mecha anime fans of series such as Gundam and Robotech.It's fairly short, but for the price, it's a good experience.

												really cool space war game. The mecha action is there but very limited bursts like around 10 seconds until you are out of flux and then you have to be in ship mode for the other 95% of the game. I guess they do that because in mech mode you are extremely powerful and can easily wipe out half the guns on a cruiser or take out corvettes with ease while side stepping gunfire. But don't let the beautiful space scenery fool you though, you will hardly have any time to enjoy it and only during the beginning of the mission. Within seconds you'll be under heavy fire from fighters and warships and you do your best to stay alive while trying to attack. But if you do want beautiful scenery while cruising space then SSZ isn't for you. There is no cruise control! only full on attack!			"

												I've only got a few hours on record, and only made it to the fourth mission. Considering I got this on sale for $5 I'm as happy as could be! This is the first space combat sim I've found that feels really authentic, where aggressive posturing, liberal use of secondaries, and strong piloting skills make a real difference. Getting your first mech is friggin awesome, though it is difficult to control.Controls for the game have me a little worried. I'm using a Kinobo Playstation USB controller that I've mapped for the game specifically. It kinda feels necessary to make it work given the high number of controls you really want to have access to at your fingertips, especially given that the difference between your fighter controls and mech controls is very noticable and you need to be able to move between either without blinking. Mouse and keyboard might be able to make it work, but it feels like a bit of a gamble. Investing in a controler is definitely worthwhile.			"

												I'm veeeeery mixed about this game. I love its combat and the fact you feel as though the fights you are fighting are of something bigger in the level. You aren't the main focus. The ship design is awesome and the various weaponry are amazing. The one big flaw with this game, and I cannot stress tis enough, is its controls. It is very difficult to play this game with keyboard and mouse. Where does tis shine? The last level!Strike Suit Zero is an amazing open space dogfighting game. There is no denying this. However, when the last level takes EVERYTHING you have been doing in the former 12 levels (The very open space for movement and maneuvers) and throws it away. Instead, you get one of those precision and closed space levels where your ship is carefully navigating the relics NARROW, LINEAR spaces. Not the open place you have been fighting for all of the game. I would not have minded this if the controls were changed... But they aren't. You play as though you are in that open space. The controls are still either super touchy or not touchy enough in this level.It simply bad level design. Adding to this is the fact you have 10 MINUTES to complete the level. It sounds like enough, right? Not in this level. The corridors are long and the time getting to the core takes up about half the allotted time, more if you are trying to be careful. Bumping the walls WILL immediately drain your shields. You will die a lot. If this level were different, I would have loved every aspect of this game. However, I cannot beat the last level because everything I did in the former levels meant nothing. This game demanded precision in a game where it is not necesary.If you want to get this game, I recommend you do it... If it's on sale. If you are on PC, I would recommend Strike Suit Infinity if you want a fun game like this one, but without the story.			"

												Taking part in dogfights in space is both exilhirating and unforgiving. The transformable Strike Suit itself makes mince-meat of grunt-level enemies, but taking down larger ships can be rather tedious. Most of the levels are highly replayable for gettting better scores to unlock various upgrades, but you're in risk of a nervous breakdown when applying that to the final levels. The DLC also adds longevity to the experience with some extra levels and a new transforming model, the Raptor, which is LUDICROUSLY fast compared to the Strike Suit. If you have nerves of steel, it's worth checking this game out.			"

												This game tries to hard to be the next Zone of the Enders... But falls flat on the execution. While the idea of changing between fighter and suit modes are interesting, it still feels limited on what you can actually do. Enemies are another issue where there are a few types of fighters and then larger ships that you go up against but.. Beyond the corvets going down to suit-mode missiles or just taking a long time doing strafing runs with your normal weapons, the frigate and cruser enemies just have a load of gun hardpoints that don't actualy factor into the enemy ship's health and it takes ages trying to kill them on your own.. Which, while you have NPC help, oftentimes it feels like they're just there to make pretty explosions around you. And remember the cool bosses that ZoE had? Like that giant sphere Zakat! Nothing like that here unless it's at the very last level... Which I honestly can't be bothered with getting past chapter 10 of 13. Honestly, it's a good basis but it doesn't capture the same fast and frenetic feel that you might be looking for as from the ZoE series. On those grounds, I can't reccomend this title			"

												Game's hard and will catch the unprepared and beat them hard. Now that rhymes.A rare of its kind - a space battle theme and you control a gundam-esque robot. Across a series of 13 linear missions or so, you'll be required to complete objectives, from defending a spaceship to eliminating enemies. Being linear, that's it, replayability is minimal unless you want to try harder difficulty. Some missions can be somewhat aggravating especially if you are required to protect a frigate, for example. Not only can't you fly freely far away from the objective, you also need make sure to eliminate incoming threats (and often in full force) while fending off the attacks towards your own suit. Thankfully you have the transformation ability that's incredibly useful to maneuver thru the battlefield and get a better shooting stance faster.That said, metacritic should've been 80. That comes from people whining about difficulty level - a sign of a good game.And being indie, graphic is impressively well made. Just try to check the trailers/screenshots around to see.Until the replacement comes, this is the best space-sim action game on Steam. Grab it when it's on sale.			"

												Straight to the marrow of bone this game is nothing but. Flying around in your strike suit, launching a circus parade of missisle and escaping. It's a video game, it's not trying to be deep or thought provoking at least I hope not because the story is terrible. It's just fast and dumb fast. If you get the game and feel like dropping it, wait until you get the strike suit it changes the game completely. It feels unfinished but it feels like a video game which is nice.It's complicated to recommend because I got it for free, but it's a fun game.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is generally an OK game. The gameplay is fun and exciting, I mean, YOUR FLYING IN SPACE, but some moments are rather boring, and the mechanics can be a bit irritable a lot of the time. It's worth getting the game if you have a lot of time and/or money, but other than that it's not the best game out there.			"

												Silly, atmospheric, shallow entertainment. This game has none of the depth and little of the character of the Freelancer games, while seeming in some respects a love-letter to them, despite its other inspirations. It is nonetheless a great deal of fun, with good music, good voice acting, decent if clichéd writing and enjoyably varied and balanced weapon systems and loadouts for your missions.It has good short term replay value due to the bonus objectives and unlockables, and the difficulty is well-balanced, to my tastes, for someone with a bit of experience with space fighter videogames.I highly recommend it at or below the price of £8-$15, as a loose sum across currencies, momentary exchange rates be damned.

												While this isn't a bad game it sure ain't a great one.  Probably my biggest complaint of this game is the gameplay.  It just felt like a slightly improved Battlefront 2 space battles.  Probably the only cool component of gameplay was the Strike Suit (which you dont even get until a hour in).  Another thing that ruined the game for me was the missions.  They were way too long and generic.  It was go kill these invaders...oh look more of them go kill them too.  The story to go along with it was alright but nothing too special.  The graphics were great for an indie game.  The ship graphics were okay, but the backgrounds (space and planets) were awesome.  Probably the best thing about this game was the soundtrack.  I usually don't even think about the soundtrack when playing games but this one was different, its amazing. Too bad the game wasn't on par with the soundtrack.			"

												Move along, you've played this game before.If you've ever had a story about humans colonizing space, you know this plot.If you've ever played any space shooter at all, you've played this game.In fact you know what? Just go download Freespace 2. Download the launcher, it'll come with mods that will have the same graphics as this game. The plot will be a little more interesting and the controls will feel more like you are actually controlling a space ship.I've only played through the first mission, but it's so boring I can't get to the second one.If you've never played a space shooter and know very little sci-fi, this game is for you! There is nothing specifically wrong with it. It's just meh.			"

												At first this looks like a good space fighter sim with some Zone of the Ender mechanics, but man did they ever get it wrong. Whoever did the game balance doesn't know what they're doing. Maybe they used to make board games? I'm not sure. But the regular ship takes forever to build up one volley of shots. This means taking out 20 fighters (a common objective in the first 3 missions) can take about 20 minutes. Why would they do that? Restrictions are fun! Let's restrict everything!Like the Strike Suit. You'd think, ""okay, cool robot form that's even in the game title: Of course you should be able to change that whenever you like, right?"" Wrong. You have to destroy debris and enemy fighters to 'power it'. How does that even make sense? Shooting in the Strike Suit turns into Motion Blurr City, which is extremely laggy. There's also no lead targets in Strike Suit mode, so good luck hitting anything with primary fire. The suit itself seems terribly underwhelming. Its best attack when you first get it is a volley of missiles. Not very exiting, and doesn't make you feel powerful.The game was advertised when it came out as if this was a successor to the Zone of the Enders series. No. Its just a cheap powerup gimmick in a space sim with a standard engine (think Star Wars: Star Fighter on the PS2, but not as easy to control or as intuitive). The balance is abismal. The story seems interesting, but every time you think a level is going to end you get ""wait, we've got 50 more fighters inbound"" and it just makes me sigh. I gave up after 10 minutes of the Strike Suit being seeming utterly useless and unable to kill even one turret on an enemy frigate.Maybe I'll come back to it one day and find out something I missed, but man does this game make me want to cry. Look at my name. How disappointed do you think I am?			"

												I love flying shooters, from arcade style sideways shooters to planes and everything in between. From all the space shooters I have played this one is the worst. The game looks pretty, has great music, and seems to have a decent story, but the controls and everything in between are terrible. With a controller the flying is on the right thumbstick, Not sure who thought that was a great idea but let that set the stage for the rest of the crap playability. The dialog is so low its practically muted, meaning you need to crawl through setting until you adjust the audio to where you can hear it.  This game is a classic case of how developers build a world but are clueless about making it enjoyable for players, from the audio, to controls, to the junk ship you ship, this game is a waste of space.  Gameplay fatal flaws:Also being a 3D shooter, there is no distance to target over the lockon icon for the enemy you are tracking, and their so small but the icon stays the same size its impossible to tell when their right on top of you.  There is a distance thing with a picture in the lower left but I cant look at that while chasing these  mosquito enemies.The enemies suffer from the syndrome of them flying all over like their hopped on drugs with no pattern or logic to what their doing.  Its like those sniper games where for no reason enemies run back and forth in place while sniping you from across the map with their guns while you with a sniper rifle are helpess. Your ship is soooOOooo slow until you beat the mission and unlock the other ships.  HEY DEVS! how about just making it fun to begin with?  Picture a Volkswagen bug chasing a Ferrari and you get this game. This is a game where there are other ships but you cant access them until you beat a map, which means playing the crap way then later hey you can have fun, no thanks, your game sucks. The nail in the coffin for me was the shooting mechanics, to fire a missle its right bumper meaning you must stop firing your machine guns to fire a missle.  What modern plane would be designed so terribly that only one weapon works at a time, this is the future right, I mean their in space.   Rating: 0/10 Value: $0.00			"

												Repetitive, increasingly larger enemy waves between cutscenes every mission with no strategy in sight (despite it being claimed as within the genre) and extremely clunky controls makes the game boring and void of depth at best and frustrating at worst.If you're looking for an arcade shooter (which this is), you can find much better for far cheaper.

												Awful game, combat is as follows: Left or right click at a target, projectiles automatically follow the enemy. The ""checkpoints"" are hardly checkpoints at all. You can complete three large objectives and still be thrown right into the first bit of the level again, difficulty is absurd, enemy ships have obescene amounts of health where as three missiles will instantly kill you on easy difficulty. There's an escort mission with a ship that literally doesn't move or protect itself in any way, while you have to kill the enemy ship which has 8 flak turrets and 7 missile turrets, you can't stop in one place and the range your weapons work at is so low that you'll end up flying into the ship and being instakilled.

Oh did I  mention that each ""mission""  is 3+ parts long where you don't know how long you are going  so if you so much as think about firing a few extra missiles or rockets just to make sure you will run out on the 3rd section AND THEN  when you die/fail the mission and it respawns you at the last checkpoint the difficulty is increased noticeably. 2nd mission in and I'm like, I'm bored and fatigued from staring at the glowing red and trying to  see what's going on.

												I got this game on sale thinking it was another good single player space fighter with some cool giant robot elements. While it delievered in some of those areas the actual flight mechanics of the game bother me. I play a lot of space engineers and such I really noticed the lack of the last 2 axis of movement, or the up/down straff. Its not a game ender for some people but I don't like space fighters that fly like aircraft.Then theres the very repetitive nature of the missons. Once you've done 2 or 3 you've seen all your going to see. The last mission was also a big let down.			"

												Wow, Steam, please give me my money back?In all seriousness, though, this game is an exercise in frustration, what with scarce checkpoints, clunky controls (how many times have you hit a ship's hull losing your shield?), TIMED objectives and everything. And I absolutely hated destroying capital ships (which most likely were the game's prime selling point), due to respawnable turrets that shoot at you from further away than you can shoot at them and lack of intelligible weak point indicators, making you dread such mission goals instead of enjoying them.

												I'm not sure what to say, the game is great until about the third level, where you get switched into a different ship (the strike suit) and pretty much everything you've learned up to that point becomes invalid, and you suddenly have to learn a completely new control system while the enemies only get tougher. What's worse, it seems utterly impotent compared to the previous ship, but perhaps that is only because there is no explanation on how to properly use it?? Its weapons can't even shoot down torpedoes (which typically just go splat), how are you supposed to fight entire enemy fleets?The artwork is beautiful, even if the special effects are a bit half-baked (cutscene hyperspacing?). I wish You could iron-out that spot where the gameplay just stalls and release it as an update, because up to that point it is a very fun game.			"

												I only made it 45 minutes into the game before I got tired of it, so it might get better, but I found that huge ammounts of armor and shields plus fire-and-forget missles made the combat an excercise in tedium rather than interesting. More importantly, where the hell is my Mech? The only interest I had in this game was doing the Gundam thing, and apparently that's something that you have to put in a bunch of work to unlock?

												I have not played other space flight simulators extensively, so I cannot review this game based on how it compares to others in the genre. I can say that the graphics, controls, and level design do deliver on one thing - immersion.When you're making a hard turn, going upside down to try and flank the ship on your tail, the tension is real, as is the feeling in the back of your mind that you are travelling through endless, empty space. When another computer controlled ship in your squadron swings by and bails you out of something or steals your kill, it feels like a real, chaotic dogfight.Possibly the most important immersive part of the game is, once you unlock the Strike Suit, how much it really does look and feel like you are piloting a Gundam. When you first get it, with the music playing in the background and all of the swarms of enemy ships, you completely annhilate almost everything you can see. Then, in the next mission, the learning curve picks up, and you start to feel the limitations of this awesome machine. Quickly, because of how powerful the strike suit is, you get thrown into messes that are too much for the ship alone, and you have to knuckle down and enhance your skills to keep up. Meanwhile, the war rages on, and its emotional toll is felt by all.Doesn't that sound just like the plot of most Gundam shows? I was impressed by how the designers used their game's difficulty curve to reinforce the feel of being that one pilot with the super weapon on whom everything depends. This game is pretty hard, or at least it was for me, and as the best hard games do, it pushed me to get better and really hunker down to get specials from the missions so that I was well equipped enough to handle later ones.The story is nothing to write home about, and some of the combat scenarios get repetitive, especially since you often have to replay missions to get power ups. But the overall atmosphere of the game? Superb. And that makes playing it a joy, even if part of you is thinking 'torpedos? Again?'			"

												SSZ, not as exciting as I thought it would be. Would probably need an endless mode or something to make it replayable, probably even a ""free roam"" gamemode. Anyway, I'm stuck, one mission is damn too punishing I can't finish it. Worth it? Sure. Does it give the space combat in a strike suit feel? eeehhh, sure, I guess. You'll probably staying flying around as a fighter ship, than a strike suit (it only exists as a strike suit for a limited time and under certain conditions) Those aside, SSZ nailed space combat pretty well. Charaters dialogue may need to be freshen up, however. Nonetheless, it's damn good game.			"

												This is a game that tries to continue a strong, and lately forgotten, pedigree which includes the likes of Wing Commander and FreeSpace.Dogfighting does bring memories of those classic games, and coupled with some very impressive visuals that borrow a bit from Homeworld (fused with some Japanese aesthetics) and a great soundtrack, it's a very strong offering.The game is unforgiving. Really, really unforgiving. The difficulty curve suddenly spikes upwards and in the end you are required to not hesitate at all in your decisions. You 'must' be able to achieve that zen-like state of mind to overcome the final levels, and if you're like me, the kind of person that completely loves that......then there is no other quite like it.

												This game's value, like any, is dependent on what it is being sold at. Regardless of how much man power and energy went in to making this, the effort you need to expend in this game is very minimal and mindless. At it's current sale price (as of 12/13/2013 at $4.99), it's way more than worth it. When I bought this game originally it was $20, the marketing behind it led me to believe it would be on the same level of quality as Freespace and Homeworld but don't be fooled. It's a pretty repetitive space shooter with a nice visual flair to it. The call backs to many different space genres of cartoons and games is nice but it's shallow and not too engaging. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have $5 to spare and are very bored at the moment.			"

												This game is pretty good. The controls for mouse and Keyboard combos is pretty solid. Sensativity will need adjusting, however, especially in Assault mode. The visuals are gorgeous and the gameplay is easy to understand after about 30 or so minutes of playtime. The mouse though can be a bit slow at times and the visuals can lag at some points. It is not enough to significantly hamper the gameplay but it is noticable, especially at some of the higher resolutions. The cockpit mode is awesome and adds a new dimmension to this game. I give a solid 7-8/10. Reccommended for the people who space shoot em' ups or is looking for something a bit different.			"

What more do you want?- I wish Gundam or Macross had a game that plays like this- Premise is nothing new: humans colonized the stars, and the colonials want freedom from Earth government; premise is same with Gundam, Zone of the Enders, and a bunch of other similar settings- Lots of flat one-dimensional characters, although I was too busy owning enemy fleets to be bothered by this- Pretty short game, although I found the whole thing to be sufficient, considering the price- A few bugs here and there, including one crash incident that happened to me:

- I hope there's gonna be a sequelThoughts on improvements:- Upgrade system is weird. You complete achievement-esque goals per mission to get upgrades (finish mission in 15 minutes or less to get a shield upgrade or something.. what's the context for that?). May have been better using a purchase system (as in, you would earn some sort of credits/resources after every mission and purchase upgrades for your ship).- Controls could do with some simple improvements. For targeting, there's only ""target nearest enemy"", and ""target nearest objective"". Later on you will realize that you will need a ""target nearest enemy torpedoes"" because ♥♥♥♥ those torpedoes.- The cutscenes in the middle of battle takes away your control and shows whatever it wants to show you in some pretty camera angle. This breaks your flow, especially if you were shooting at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ interceptor when the cutscene triggers. They should implement a picture-in-picture style instead.			"

												In a word: forgettable.Ship unlocks don't carry forward to new missions, only previous missions - and there's no real reason to replay them.Side objectives - which are your sole source of basic upgrades (armor, shields, etc) - are only gained from completing side objectives, but with no radar, it's hard to pick out side objectives from the swarm of angry arrows swirling around the edge of your screen - nevermind that you must cycle target priorities until what you want pops up. This is especially agonizing as many side objectives are ""stop all the torpedoes""; there are no audio or visual warnings for when torpedoes are launched, so unless you are constantly mashing 'F' to see if any are in-flight, you have absolutely no way to tell - and if even one hits, the side objective is failed...but it gets even worse! When you fail a torpedo side objective, you don't even receive a notification - so you don't even know you failed it until you've sunk ~15 - 20 minutes into a mission and see the results screen. On top of that, on every single mission that has a ""torpedoes"" side objective, you are required to constantly monitor corvettes, capital ships, and fighters - which you cannot really find unless you set your target priority to each in sequence by tapping 'T'...but since there's no warning when torpedoes are fired, you have to constantly cycle target priorities and mash 'F'...and then you find out 20 minutes later when you've cleared the mission (hopefully) that one single torpedo must have snuck past ya - no unlock for you!At one point I was boosting away from an enemy cruiser to let my shields recharge - note that this was a good 14 minutes into a mission - and I was abruptly greeted by a ""MISSION FAILED. YOU WENT AWOL. EVERYTHING BLEW UP. EARTH BLEW UP. ALL THE PUPPIES DIED. GAME OVER."" screen. There was no warning, no audio or visual queue that I was getting close to the edge of the zone like a better game would do, NO - it just springs a ""GAME OVER"" on you.Your AI allies are comparitively crippled, dealing significantly less damage and having less hull/shields than enemies. They also pretty much suck at covering you when you're in a slower craft, like the bomber you are required to fly in a few missions.While the ship agility is fine for open space where there aren't really any obstacles, the last stage will have you smashing your face through your screen trying to guide your ship through 9 minutes of obstacles inside a tunnel.Altogether it's not a terrible game, it's just underwhelmingly 'meh'. I plowed through it in probably < 8 hours on normal and do not care to play it any further. The issues mentioned above are pretty darn pervasive and aggravating throughout the course of the campaign.			"

												Those who grew up watching Japanese mecha-themed anime (like anything out of the Gundam universe) will enjoy this game for it almost-perfectly captures the sense of overwhelming power and superiority one might get when piloting the proverbial weaponized suit. That feature alone can carry this game to a ""good"" rating from most fans of anime and the space combat genre. Add colorful and vibrant graphics, a wonderful soundtrack, intense gameplay, and scalable difficulty (from ""Grandparent-friendly"" to ""WTF""), then you've got a wonderful reason to give the developers your time and money.

												A really well made indie game.  The graphics and gamplay mechanics are increadible, and the special strike mode of the Strike Suit(While limited) makes you feel like death incarnate.  And the weapons are truely balanced.  Better, more powerful weapons have less ammount of charge or supply.  And the scale of the second to last level is amasing.  250+ enemies fighters, a horde of friendly fighters, and scores of large starships.  And with those graphics, I didn't even lose frame rate on my simple, 11 inch Macbook Air.			"

												An inteligent, fast, smooth, and unfailingly beautiful game.  The game is small for the sheer enjoyment it brings, and with the Mega Bundle coming wth the full soundtrack and a kick-♥♥♥ artbook, it's what I recommend to buy.  This game is an excelent sci-fi experience in a rich and well rendered universe, the characters are distinguished but not obtrusive, letting the game speak for itself, and boy does it.  Enemies are inovative when given the chance to be, and showing any weakness will result on them mercilessly pursuing you.  Not to mention the incredibly active and powerful capital ships that power through space as you dart around every nook and cranny chasing enemy fighter craft away from your ship's critical systems and opening enemy ships up for attack.Chase and dogfight your way through swarms of enemy fighters, then switch to 'Strike Suit Mode' and completely erradicate the lot.I recommend this for any space combat fan, even if dogfights aren't your thing, the vistas, music, and watching massive ships slug it out around you is well worth the price.

To me, the controls are very clunky (I know I can remap them) and it is very difficult to control  the fighter in Strike Mode and I just don't understand why Strike Mode fires the weapons that it does.  On Normal difficulty I find it too difficult to struggle with the controls well enough to accomplish objectives in order to unlock upgrades on the initial levels.			"

												I don't want to fly ships or missions that don't involve the strike suit in a game called ""strike suit zero"". I don't want to defend missiles, protect other ships, or anything else that involves a plot.  It gets tiresome to play ""protector"" every mission, while you are expected to kill everything on the other end of the battlefield. It is nonsense back and forth.  I do not care about the crap story or its lame characters.  All I want to do is fly around in dog fights and kill everything.While that being said, this is still an ok game.  It would be an amazing game if it was just a pure arcade type scenario and all you did was destroy everything, with the occasional side objective. Ironically, the developer made this game after the fact, called Strike Suit Infinity. However, this game is exclusive for windows only, with no love for mac and linux users. WTF.

												An old school space sim with new mechanics.Strike Suit Zero is one of the early titles developped for the Oculus Rift but if you aren't that lucky yet, don't worry this game is still great.The universe is very immersive, with it's great open spaces and impressive color palette, the game is visually striking. But it does not end there, there is full support for any type of control method (Mouse+Keyboard, Gamepad, Joystick+Keyboard, HOTAS) and the button mapping is really intuitive (just be sure to select Joystick+Keyboard when playing with a HOTAS). However, when it comes to controlling ships, there's not much to choose from. Being a recruit you'll start with a standard fighter then shortly after you'll unlock the Strike Suit and further down some other 2 ships bringing it to a total of four ships to choose from, which is not much. But the game being named Strike Suit Zero, you already guessed what the main ship will be. It's main feature is that is can transform into a Transformer like mech and fire lock on missiles and heavy caliber both using Flux as energy, this Flux can be regenerated over time and be destroying enemy targets. So yeah, it's pretty badass. But the game does not let you be badass for long as the didfficulty of missions ramp up very quickly and the ally AI is utterly useless, forcing you to always be at your best to triumph. The old school difficulty also applies to the ranking system, if you do as you are told you might get a medal, but if you do everyones job you'll earn silver or gold. Keep in mind that there is Platinum above and since you've already won the battle to yourself there is not much left to do!Anyway, besides its frustrating difficulty Strike Suit Zero is a fantastic experience and a worthy one if you want to prepare for StarCitizen later this year (press time). With it's challenging but rewarding gameplay, this is a game that I recommend.			"

I've put in just over an hour of gameplay, and I've only managed to get to mission four. The lag spikes I experience could probably be fixed with a new graphics card, but it's interesting that it spikes while I'm in Strike mode and goes down when I'm not.It'll take some learning and some practice, but I would recommend this game to anyone willing to put in practice time to get better at the controls.

Pros: amazing soundtrack, nice variety of ships, enjoyable gameplay, good challenges and length of missions, ecstatic immersive pew pew space combat. Missions are fun enough to re-do on higher difficulty and once unlocked you can use different ships when going back to replay missions.Cons: Lack of customization in ships (you can make a couple choices in weapon loadouts but all other upgrades are tied to nailing mission achievements and don't come with options), targetting itself works well once you get past the learning curve but switching target priorities could be done a little more intuitively, story is so-so - decent enough in a generic way to move you on to more pew pew goodness.

												Definitely satisfied a Macross itch that needed to be stratched. Fire dozens of swarm missles at rebellious colonists as a mech. Fly around large capital ships. Chase down enemy fighters in dogfights. It is all there!However, the checkpoints within the levels are quite spaced out and I found myself playing some sections multiple times, especially during escort missions. My HVT would go half to zero health in a mater of seconds, which could be quite frustrating. There are 4 types of ships, although the ""strike suit"" was the most enjoyable. I felt that the customization was lacking and would have liked to see more variety than level 1, level 2, level 3 of the same three weapons. The story is decent for a short game and was enough to keep me going level to level. Definitely worth a playthrough.			"

												If you're into space shooters, this is a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of awesomesauce!  The controls and the 360-degree style of flight sort of remind me of the levels in Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire (N64) where you pilot the Outrider - it wasn't what I was expecting at first, but it doesn't take long to get used to.Performance-wise, I'm running this on a 4-year old computer with an Intel integrated graphics card and 4Gb of RAM.  Most of my games lag somewhat and use quite a lot of CPU, but I had SSZ on the highest graphic settings (which look amazing by the way), and there was no lag or drop in framerate at all!			"

												IF this was the studios first project, I am really excited to see what they do next.  For a kickstarter project, this game is really polished.  The controls feel really good once you get used to them.  I am playing with a 360 controller for PC and now I wish that all my old experiences with space sims were with this type of controller.  The dual joysticks really work well for giving you yaw.  I really like that they have different ship types and didn't focus exclusively on the Strike Suit.  Playing the Bomber or Interceptor was really enjoyable and added more variety and depth to the missions.  It was kind of nice that they control how much time you can spend in the mecha form, but I think if they would of balanced that form better, there wouldn't of been the need.  I just have a hard time with it being a sci-fi genre and them saying you need to charge the suit by shooting stuff.  Why not just have it be a thermal cool down thing or something.  The story isn't overly exciting, the main character is just a name, although they are trying to manufacture a bit of a story with him.  The story doesn't add too much depth to the game, other than serving as a minimal segway to different types of missions.  But the gameplay is really fun, and the graphics are really beautiful.  It feels really amazing when you barrel role over to the underside of a capital ship after making a turret run over the top.  It really feels like you are playing in one of the epic sci fi movie battles.  I don't think I have had a game get this right before.If you are into the space combat sim genre, check it out.  The mech suit transformation is what this game brings to the table, along with updated controls, graphics and sound.  It makes me wish these guys had a license to redo wing commmander or tie fighter, they just need a few new writers. "

												Strike Suit Zero starts out very strong, and hit me with a major nostalgia bomb when I first started playing it. It reminded me very strongly of several space games I had played over the years, most strongly the combat of Freelancer. The game's presentation is tight, with good visual effects and atmospheric sound design, but is plagued by poor optimization, resulting in increasingly intolerable frame stutter and worse, the video lagging behind my button inputs. In addition, over the course of only a handful of missions in the game total, the difficulty quickly spirals out of hand. The titular Strike Suit is difficult to employ properly, and oftentimes I found myself unable to take full advantage of its multi-target locking missiles. It is not unmanageable for the player to take down numerically superior enemy fighter groups, but multiple times the player is expected to protect flimsy friendly targets, some of which can be destroyed in seconds by withering hails of fire from the aforementioned enemies. If you hate escort missions as much as the average gamer does, as I do, Strike Suit Zero is liable to make you pop a blood vessel. I would be willing to forgive that, since I love space games that much- but here's where things get ugly. The frame stutter ultimately resulted in my being unable to finish the final level, and that's why I give this game a thumbs down. I was unable to finish Megabyte Punch simply because I wasn't good enough at the game, and that's not enough reason for me to dislike it, but the technical problems foisted on me by SSZ are simply unacceptable.

												I have mixed feelings about this title.The game is quite good, mechanics are definitely good, graphic is what you expect from a non-AAA title (still good and easy on hardware) but there are two big mistakes on this title: they tried to fit a story, in but feels more a joke than an actual story (or at least it's very plain and obvious) and the overall game (in normal difficulty) is way too hard.I would have liked more a ""short"" game with easy (read not-that-hard) missions and a better story, with the possibility to replay those missions in hard/maniac difficulty to get my challenge and my many deaths.So, would I recommend this game? Probably yes, because it's indie, graphics and music are good, there's linux/mac support and overall it's fun, but 20$ is definitely too much, this game at full price should have been 15$ or even less.

												Solid mechanics and really great gameplay. This whole game comes together and it’s simply a great work of art. Dog fights, strike mode, blasting capital ships, and getting high scores. Doing this and having a blast is what it’s all about. This fills the void of my desire for Ace Combat for PCs (I’m talking about a good Ace Combat mind you).Strike Suit Zero is entirely a campaign. The story itself isn’t stellar, but makes the combat feel real and each mission has some weight to it. There’s a great sense of an epic fight when you’re in the midst of a fight between capital class ships and hoards of fighters. As a player you aren’t some overpowered-one-ship-destroy-everything-and-do-anything since you have to rely on your allies to help fill the void in your weaknesses. On the flip side you can greatly assist your allies by targeting specific objectives and hitting the enemy where it really hurts. Probably a great example is if your capital ship is in danger from enemy beam cannons you can snipe out the beam cannons on the enemy capital ships. Another good one is sniping out AA turrets on capital ships so your bombers can take them out quickly and safely. The campaign does a nice job of mixing up what you need to do so it’s never a stale series of mission.			"

												A very interesting fusion between east and west.

If you only look for a good time in space combat, and listen to the music made by Paul Ruskay (Homeworld) and Kokia (Tales of Innocence, Gunslinger Girl: II Teatrino), then it is worth a buy.			"

												Interesting concept and very nice graphics. There is a level of strategy as well, for instance, when in capital ship battles, taking out various hardpoints on larger ships to give your fleet an advantage and so forth. My only complaint is the clumsy controls, especially for keyboard & mouse. Somewhat difficult for accurate fire that is often necessary in dogfights, and Strike Suit controls take some getting used to, since you're constantly switching between fighter and SS modes. Overall the game is enjoyable, a pleasant remenisce of the Macross series.			"

												i wanted to give this game a chance. It's pretty cool in concept, but the execution was shaky. I've had to rewrite my review multiple times because I'm not sure how to feel about this game.-random difficulty spikes to the point where the game is just cluttered with unnecessary bullets and explosions (and they don't pull off the ""crowded battle scene"" that often, but when they do, it's pretty cool) -controls are awkward, but thankfully are rebindable-the strike suit, which is the draw of the whole game, is a gimmick that only lasts 10 seconds, and has a pretty poor targeting system, which means you'll be darting about not hitting anything, though once you unlock a few upgrades, it becomes decent-might just be my computer, but I experienced insane slowdown even on the lowest graphics settings. I won't consider this a point against the game, because I've had slowdown issues before-battles are luck based, depending on if you hit the tiny area that you're supposed to, when fighting a bigger ship. Apparently you need to hit weakspots which may or may not be marked for your convenience, but shooting the turrets does some damage. Targeting system is also broken, as in you normally have the option to aim towards the closest enemy, or a mission objective enemy. Thing is, you can't just target them. You have to cycle your targets until you hopefully get the one you want, like the cruisers and carriers. It's a gambit, so you take what you get.-game is 90% escort missions, and your friendlies are thin as paper,-last mission is a pain in the port, and I won't even spoil it.If you have to try this, get it on sale. I'm talking less than 5 bucks. I still recommend it against my previous criticisms because it tried to be a cool mech game and gave us something to remember, and I was thoroughly challenged. After all, it's better to deal with a challenging game than one that holds your hand the whole way. As long as you get it on sale, you won't regret it, because the game does deliver to an extent. Had I paid full price, however, I wouldn't be as forgiving. Especially once I got that darn last level. If you play through this game, and/or you already played through it, you'll know exactly what I mean.			"

												A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was FreeSpace2. This Space Combat Sim became arguably the best in the genre. Sadly, when FS2 came out in 1999 the Space Combat Sim genre was slowly dying. It was the last of an era and no others that came after could hold a candle to it. I played thousands of hours on FreeSpace 2 and the various fan made mods for over a decade, all the while wishing for someone to come revive the genre with a game worthy of FS2's legacy. And it wasn't until 2013 that my wish came true with the release of STRIKE SUIT ZERO.STRIKE SUIT ZERO - CONTROLS -- The game gives Space Sim enthusiasts the ship control they crave while giving the casual player easy mouse control. After the first mission I was digging around in my closet for my old Saitek x36 Flight controller. Mapping controls was easy enough, but be careful if your rudder is messed up. Axis Z is hard coded to menu navigation and could make mission and craft selection a pain. I would hightly suggest turning up your X/Y Axis sensitivity as the default setting makes your fighter move like an overloaded freighter. GAMEPLAY -- The missions feel like those from FreeSpace, my meaning being your not the focus of the fight. Epic battles are being waged around you. You are only a small cog in the machine, as it should be. You have specific objectives assigned to you while other units perform their duties. There are only four ships to chose from in SST, but I did not find the selection lacking. They were easy to customize to my flight style though the use of weapon load-outs (which remind me of the load-outs you could pick in Freespace, just with fewer choices). SST adds its own interesting twist to the genre with the ""Strike Suit"", a craft that has the ability to transform into a mech like something out of an anime. At first I thought this was going to be a cheesy gimmick-like easy button, but I was pleasantly surprised. The strike suit mode was not overly powered and did require a decent amount of skill to use effectively. You have to charge the strike suit though ""FLUX"", which can be gained by dishing out damage or less so though damage received. Your weapons in Strike Mode use up FLUX and once it is used up your ship is reverted back to interceptor mode.CONS: The game is woefully short. I would have liked to see multiple campaigns and possibly a co-op mode. Also, you have no control over your wing-men. In my honest opinion that would have made the game better for me. However, this is just nit-picking. The game is awesome. Anyone who has played FS2, I highly suggest this game to you. When Born Ready boasts that SSZ is ""Space Combat. Reborn"" they are not just talking out their ♥♥♥. They delivered on that promise. Check it out.			"

												The default control layout for 360 pads could really use some work, but after messing with a bit, and giving the game a chance I'm really getting into Strike Suit Zero.  Efforts in the pure action space fighter genre have been weak to middling since Freespace 2 - I can now say that SSZ is comfortably cut above them.  It hasn't best Freespace 2's nigh unbeatable high water mark, but it is eminently entertaining and a good game in it's own right.  For a genre on hiatus (not dead!) this a laudable big step in reviving it.			"

												9/10: 30 hours of game play. Wide screen support. Multi-monitor support! Light strategy and simulation, but mostly just a space fighter RPG (transformer, sort of). Some replayability via difficulty levels and  with Steam Workshop content, should provide additional play. Well worth the sale price, but well executed in nearly every aspect. Game difficulty at normal can be challenging. Audio issues with voice actor is frustrating, too quiet, and being reported by others. No amount of tweaking corrected it. However, the album either as DLC or with the game, was surprising very good. I will likely pull it out in a year and replay through.			"

												This game falls into the ''criminally underrated'' category. Remember when IGN gave Godhand a 3 when everyone else gave it a 7 or 8? It's kinda like that. I'm not gonna spend too much time on this, but the reviewers that gave it a low score did so because they are inept at playing anything harder than Mario. ''It's too hard'' was the MAIN complaint, and it's pathetic because it's not.Anyway, think Star Fox 64's 'all-range mode', but with a lot more enemies. You get 13 missions with an unfolding plot, and upgrades along the way that are unlocked by completing optional objectives that present some difficulty, but hardly the difficulty the ♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ reviewers say it posseses. You're given objectives in the middle of the mission, but it boils down to killing ♥♥♥♥ and blowing up big ships. Each mission varies up the scenario to avoid repetetiveness: protecting a fleet, taking out a ship in particular (or protecting it), taking out incoming torpedos, loss of missile systems. Just a tip: press the camera button (default is 'C') to go into first person. You have to do this for both your fighter and the Strike Suit, otherwise you're in first person in fighter mode and third person in Strike mode. It makes the fighting a lot more intense and increases that sense of inertia.Incredibly fun; highly recommended; intense dogfighting on dogfighting action; buy it now.			"

												The game didn't leave a good impression on me early in, but I stuck through it until mission 12 hoping for it to grab me, and now I'm done with it.  The game just isn't well designed, and mission 12 fully expressed that to me.  The weapons you get are limited in selection throughout the level.  The objectives and things you do rarely change and deviate from a formula they repeat every other level or 2.  It's basically defend X, attack X, or attack turrets on X to then get to attack X afterwards.Worse yet is on larger vehicles you're supposed to destroy you get little in terms of visual or auditory feedback that you're actually doing decent damage yourself, or if it's just your friendly ally ships.  When the objectives change, the game will do a poor job explaining what you actualy need to do, and point out targets that don't remotely matter to actually finishing it.  The game just does nothing remarkeable outside your strike suite can lock on, and let you paint multiple targets to fire a large missile barrage.  Fun for the first few times, but quickly becomes a tedious activity, as you'll use it a bunch to ween down health on ships with inflated HP.			"

A game where you and your NPC buddies must fight insane amounts of bad dudes only to have your NPC buddies sit in the back diddling each other while the enemies forces themself on you.

												This game is really great. It has all the features of space combat simulation, and adds an extra gameplay improvement with the Strike Suit's strike mode.Pursuit mode is dynamic both when you're against fighters and capital ships (the big ships). The targeting system is very efficient and allows you to easily spot the best target. Strike mode adds a new gameplay with a different (and more interesting) movement control (especially efficient against capital ships) and deadly weapons very useful against fighters.The thirteen missions have a wide variety of objectives which make every one feel unique, and the improvement of both your ship and your pilot's abilities give it a high level of replayability.Even better with a joystick, in first person view.

I'm not quite done with the game yet personally, but so far I'm loving every second of it.The controls might need a little work, and the compatibility with existing controllers could be a little nicer and automatic instead of painfully testing each button.  But if you only play with Keyboard, then none of that will be a problem for you.			"

												Overall a good game, sadly not -great- due to quite a few things, but a worthy homage to titles such as Omegaboost and Macross. Goods:-Very nice graphics and design.-SOLID game play (Extreamly challanging even on Easy, yet satisfying when pulling off major kills/actions)-Missions are lengthy and mostly fulfilling in terms of mission content.-Controls (for a gamepad/xbox controller) are satisfying once you get use to them. Bads: -Game is BRUTAL frequently if you don't know what to do. Higher difficulties are painfuly hard and usually discourage further playing. -Game is short overall, even with buying DLC. (DLC isn't worth buying unless on sale) -Achievements are hard to obtain for some missions (further discouraging play).-EASY to get lost within missions due to their vast size, hard (often impossible) to tell 'up' from 'down'. Other:-Voice acting could be better.-Game could greatly benefit more ingame (outside of mission) content (ex: ingame model viewer) -Could use better camera options. -Could use better oriented DLC (ex: a strike suit that has higher performance for more diffictult situations)-Could use better story eliments and detail.-Would GREATLY benefit if a ""Free Mode"" was added (ex: free flight to just fly around, no objectives)-Multiplayer CO-OP would GREATLY help with difficult gameplay plus VS. Mode would add more content.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is an awesome game for it to be an indie genre. From the aircraft to manning the strike suit and transforming into the mech was stunning. The controls and maneuverability is an interesting up take. This is one of my first space sim game. The game however pretty much focus on the strike suit. Pretty much why they called the game ""Strike Suit Zero"" in the first place. Well, the other 4 aircraft can be fun and I wish they tailor the missions for them. For a game that uses flight concept, I wish they could do a little bit more. The allowance to have some flight team with us would be awesome. It would also be nice to have a dogfight mechanism. Currently, it's pretty simple. You just chase around and shoot.The Raptor DLC is another version of the strike suit and seems pretty okay but the use of flux is too draining. It is a close-ranged strike suit. Maybe it should be re-adjusted a little bit. The mission can get a little bit draggy with the cutscene. And for the final battle, wouldn't it be nice to see massive fleets from two sides with lots of interceptors / fighter aircraft fighting.It's a good game nevertheless. I'm really a fan of flight sim. And I hope there are others upcoming games like this.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I've had it in and out of my Steam cart for weeks at a time. It wasn't until I picked it up through a Humble sale that I was able to finally play it.What a disappointment.Well, kind of. It's a decent arcadey space shooter, but beyond that, the whole ""flying a mech that does stuff"" is pretty underwhelming. Sure, you can shoot a bunch of missles all at once, but missles don't really do much damage except to torpedos, so, hooray? The ""main gun"" in mech mode is pretty much worthless.Skip it and find a copy of Xwing vs Tie fighter or something.			"

												Strike suit zero is one of the first games to be funded by kickstarter. It is perhaps the best game I've played which integrates the mechanics of transforming a plane into a humanoid mecha in sace.In its completed state I would say that it is more like a proof of concept than a full game. The game is quite short, with only 13 missions, and no multiplayer. The difficulty curve of the game increases rapidly, but this is due to difficulties with completing the objectives/targeting the correct enemy. Yes, targeting is quite a nightmare, early in the game when there are fewer enemies, SSZ's targetting system works flawlessly. However as you progress later in the game where enemies swarm down on your fleet, it becomes an uphill battle to find the crucial enemy targets and hunt them down before they destroy your capital ships. However, when everything works smoothly and you seamlessly integrate pursuit (plane) mode with strike (mecha) mode to hunt down targets, you will feel like a complete badd ♥♥♥ ace out of Macross.TLDR/If you're dying to fulfill your fantisies of being a valkyrie pilot from Macross try SSZ then go ahead and buy the game, I look forward to Born Ready Games continuining with this IP to make more and more awesome games. They need to work on the targetting system and multiplayer!			"

												Trying to play this on a gamepad is just pointless as the controls there are far too sensitive, making you unable to shoot the broad side of a barn. Keyboard and mouse are a lot more easier to use and result in much improved accuracy. Visuals are fine, though nothing special. I honestly can't understand this games PC requirements being as high as they are. A complete lack of checkpoints throughout every mission I've played so far is also quite baffling and will lead to many ragequits. Weapons are pretty easy to use.All in all, it's an....OK game at best. If you want a simple space shooter (emphasis on simple) then go for it. But in all honesty, I wouldn't recommend. There are other games out there that do it better.			"

												This game is pretty good. The controls for mouse and Keyboard combos is pretty solid. Sensativity will need adjusting, however, especially in Assault mode. The visuals are gorgeous and the gameplay is easy to understand after about 30 or so minutes of playtime. The mouse though can be a bit slow at times and the visuals can lag at some points. It is not enough to significantly hamper the gameplay but it is noticable, especially at some of the higher resolutions. The cockpit mode is awesome and adds a new dimmension to this game. I give a solid 7-8/10. Reccommended for the people who space shoot em' ups or is looking for something a bit different.			"

												Best mech combat simulator/space flight sim since Zone of the Enders. Gameplay is fast and fluid, offering easy of entry and an adequate difficulty curve as the game progresses. The story serves as little more than a backdrop for the absolutely massive space battles, but to be fair, did you really look into this game for a deep and thought provoking story, or just because you wanted to feel like a badass mech pilot? My only complaint is that sometimes tracking the location of your highlighted target can get difficult in the more frenzied encounters since the directional arrow highlighting it's location is the exact same color as all the other high priority target indicators on the HUD, (of which there will be many in later missions). It makes manually prioritizing your targets somewhat annoying, but not game-breaking in any way.			"

												I was a big Freespace and Starlancer player back when those games were popular. I was also big into Star Fox and its Nintendo 64 counterpart, in addition to an unhealthy addicted to Earthsiege, Starsiege, and the Mechwarrior series. Suffice to say that I love space combat games and sims, and it is a genre that has sadly lacked any real entries over the last decade to speak of. Strike Suit Zero fills that niche very nicely.When I started SSZ and began playing, it took a little bit of time to re-acquire the whole 'flying in space with a mouse and keyboard' feeling, but once I got the hang of it, it felt as natural as ever. The controls are nice and tight and there isn't a lot of slop. The graphics are polished but the animations during cutscenes can be a little janky sometimes. Voice acting is of far better quality than I would have expected - if you think the voiceovers are going to be as bad as, say, X3, you're wrong. Egosoft could take a note from this game. Graphics and style are overall awesome. I love the depth-of-field/blurring effect when boosting through space in cockpit view. My only gripes - the HUD situation sucks. Honestly. I hate that it's a bar at the top of the screen. It's jarring and unnatural; I would have preferred the HUD to be integrated into the cockpit in first-person view and at the sides or bottom of the screen in third-person. My other gripe - and this is going to be kind of an assanine gripe, as it centers around a key concept in the game - is the strike suit. I hate the strike suit. It just feels like a gimmicky, juvenile anime trope. I've never enjoyed mecha anime and I've never enjoyed humanoid mechs. I've always preferred the gritty down-to-earth mechs of later BattleTech and the hercs of the Earthsiege universe, they just seem more probable and more likely to exist. But I guess it's more a matter of taste, really. In gameplay the Strike Suit mode is very helpful and incredibly powerful - you can lock on to an insane number of enemies and launch cluster rockets that obliterate everything, not to mention the big giant plasma shotgun thing that wrecks face. It's definitely fun. It's use is balanced out nicely by flux mechanic, and I have not really felt the game get easier as a result of having the strike suit. The only real gameplay-related gripe that I have about it is that in strike suit mode you are forced into third person view. I hate that.It's a hard game, too. Really hard. It goes easy on you at first, but once you get your first strike suit, all bets are off. In particular the first level that takes place in a nebula is difficult (due to the fact that sensors, radar, and lockon missiles do not work- you have to rely on dumbfire rockets and visual sight). I love difficult and challenging games. The good:- Difficult- Beautiful visuals and style- Interesting concept in the strike suit- Unlockable ships and progression- Variety in space environments keeps things from getting stale- Feels like a natural progression of the space shooter genre- Music is very catchy- Voiceovers aren't half bad- Price- IndieThe bad- HUD design and placement is awkward- Music can be repetitive at times- Strike suit... mainly on aesthetic grounds- Forced third-person view in strike suit mode- Makes you wish for a modern FreespaceThis game gets 4 out of 5 cookies from me! I look forward to the next game these guys put out. I hope they keep this genre alive and renew interest in it.			"

												If your looking for a decent dogfighting game for fun this game is exhilirating except for the last mission. I found the controls a bit clunky but aside from that the only thing that continually frustrated me was the inability for me to lock on to the specific target I wanted. The brief in game explination hardly covers the use of the system adequately and knowing where those torpedos are when the entire screen is filled with explosions is quite difficult at times. All that aside I would recommend this game but wait and get it on sale. It is not a $20.00 tittle I feel it missed out on much needed development such as character development, story depth, and scenario design. Unlike what I've seen from the rest of the reviews I had no issues with the checkpoint system incorperated they were well placed and the entire point was to make sure you werent just throwing out a million rockets willy nilly so you would have the required resources to beat the end of a mission segment and reach the begining of another checkpoint. All in all the checkpoints did not hamper me in fact they were an asset once I figured out how they were placed and I knew when it was okay to waste what I had to make it to the next checkpoint after which it was acceptable to die and get more special weapon ammo and armor.

												I really enjoyed this game. Some of the main criticisms were with the control scheme and with the length of the game. Personally I got used to the controls quickly on keyboard and mouse, and if you have a controller they are supposedly better. They are also very customisable if you don't like the default system. As for the length, the game has a lot to offer for its price in my opinion, and at a reduced price you can't complain! Missions are a good length (though the checkpoint system can be rather punishing on harder missions) and it is an arcade style game in the sense that you get points for everything so replaying missions for platinum medals is encouraged.The other main criticism was that it wasn't enough like some other space flight game that the reviewer liked. Personally I don't see how this is a valid criticism for a reviewer to make who is supposed to be reviewing this game and not one that is over ten years old. This is its own game, go watch some gameplay if you are undecided, don't presume it will be like x-wing because thats what you want it to be like, you may be dissapointed.If you like bright flashy space combat and a game that rewards players that learn the mechanics and uses them instead of expecting it to be like that space game you played in 98 then pick it up!

												An old school space sim with new mechanics.Strike Suit Zero is one of the early titles developped for the Oculus Rift but if you aren't that lucky yet, don't worry this game is still great.The universe is very immersive, with it's great open spaces and impressive color palette, the game is visually striking. But it does not end there, there is full support for any type of control method (Mouse+Keyboard, Gamepad, Joystick+Keyboard, HOTAS) and the button mapping is really intuitive (just be sure to select Joystick+Keyboard when playing with a HOTAS). However, when it comes to controlling ships, there's not much to choose from. Being a recruit you'll start with a standard fighter then shortly after you'll unlock the Strike Suit and further down some other 2 ships bringing it to a total of four ships to choose from, which is not much. But the game being named Strike Suit Zero, you already guessed what the main ship will be. It's main feature is that is can transform into a Transformer like mech and fire lock on missiles and heavy caliber both using Flux as energy, this Flux can be regenerated over time and be destroying enemy targets. So yeah, it's pretty badass. But the game does not let you be badass for long as the didfficulty of missions ramp up very quickly and the ally AI is utterly useless, forcing you to always be at your best to triumph. The old school difficulty also applies to the ranking system, if you do as you are told you might get a medal, but if you do everyones job you'll earn silver or gold. Keep in mind that there is Platinum above and since you've already won the battle to yourself there is not much left to do!Anyway, besides its frustrating difficulty Strike Suit Zero is a fantastic experience and a worthy one if you want to prepare for StarCitizen later this year (press time). With it's challenging but rewarding gameplay, this is a game that I recommend.			"

												I did not recommend this game for a few reasons:First reason: No multiplayer. I think this game, with tweaking, could be good for multiplayer, but that doesn't seem to be on the horizon yet. However, if you're more of a single-player type person, this point need not apply to you.Second reason: Does not offer a demo. At least what I could find. This game, at the time of this writing, is on sale %75, and I bought the entire Strike Suit Zero Mega Bundle for $9.99. However, that's ten bucks I could have saved had I tried a demo first.Third reason: Not what I thought it was going to be like. Let me elaborate on this a little. First, it was my clumsy fault that I didn't notice that this game didn't support multiplayer. Some of you may remember playing a little Microsoft Studios game called Freelancer, which was an amazing spaceflight game. If you're looking for a game like that, this isn't it. I completed the first mission, and sadly to say I got kinda bored; too bored in fact to finish the second mission.Overall, the game and its graphics are nice. I wish I had a nicer graphics card to take advantage of the wonderful effects I could see in the trailers. However, the gameplay is very repetitive with little reward.			"

												Iam at Mission 2 and the Game Balance is very very bad.The difficulty curve is growing so high in Mission two that I am so close to deinstall.Playing at Medium and its no Fun in Mission two.The UI of the game is 80% visually Non sense. Instead of pointing out where you get hit from in the 3D World theres just constantly Beeping and Exploding and Rumbling but you cant see from where.The HUD is messed up with visually Elements which makes no sense.The Menu on Gamepad is against all conventions a player is used to, so you will constantly close the menu when trying to confirm your setting.How hard can it be to make a Menues and HUDs that work?

												If you like Battlestar Galactica, Macross, or anything like that, you will like the combat featured in this game. Zero-G space combat where you dogfight, bomb, and morph into a OP robot form that rapes muppets. The visuals are very nice that demonstrates the scale of the combat. Controls with mouse and keyboard are pretty good but I'm sure joystick users would have it easier.			"

												So I wasn't sure if I would a space combat game or not since I haven't played many in the past  ... so I took the plunge and it's a mixture.  The graphical presentation was top notch and I kinda just wanted to abdandon the whole fighting aspect and go exploring around that wickedly burning planetWhilst I didn't find the actual combat immersive and I got bored of it very quickly I won't take my experience and label it a bad game, it's a very good game, just one that I strugled to enjoy			"

													For my first mech game, it was an amazing experience. The music was fantastic and fitted into every scene and fight. Speaking of the fights, the dog fights were epic. They kept getting bigger and bigger, with the stakes getting higher and higher. The keyboard controls took getting use to, but at the end I could handle everything. 	If you are looking at this game, I suggest getting the Directors Cut, because you can get more for the same price. You can get all the DLC, and a graphic and story overhaul. If you can get the directors cut, do so.	Speaking of DLC, It was pretty good. A nice change of pace from the main campaign. Each level had something unique coming and each had an unique challenge. It was worth it, The extra strike suit maybe not, but still this game was fun all around. 	The gameplay can get repetitive, but I never found it boring and was an exciting journey all around. Each battle was fun and the different difficulties add a little replay. The last level took a while and was frustrating at times, but it was such a small problem that whole experience wasn’t spoiled. If I had to give a score it would be a 9/10I would recommend this game to those who like mechs, explosions, and epic space battles.This was defiantly worth the money and has some good repayable levels.I pretty much 100% this game at 27 hours and still replay it every now and then!Enjoy.

A dogfight space-sim. As pretty alright as the soundtrack is and as pretty as it looks it's not a very big game, the story's not exactly the most engaging out there, and there are only 13 pretty-short missions to go through. The mission objectives themselves are all generally the same protect-this & destroy-these missions so it can be repetitious.When it comes to the base gameplay they work and control great. The combat can get pretty intense the more enemies you're up against especially when suddenly your targets are large fleets themselves with guns covering practically every surface its got and the sudden priority is to take out the things that fire back.Surviving involves you keeping your ship's armor (health) and regenerating shield up and as far as I know there's no way of repairing your ship's armor without reloading a checkpoint or getting it repaired when told in one particular mission. The reload-checkpoint-to-recover-everything deal looked to me like an exploitable mechanic of sorts even though there aren't very many checkpoints throughout the game, especially the later missions with their longer mission times and limited amount of checkpoints.Each mission has an optional objective you can do that will unlock an upgrade but each one are just shared stat upgrades for all of the ships you have. What you're to do and what you can unlock are shown in the mission select screen upon preparing for the mission chosen. New ships and weapons are unlocked through progress of the missions.After a few missions you'll eventually unlock the ""Strike Suit"" ship which basically transforms into a straight-up mech (Strike Mode) if the ""Flux"" bar it comes with is filled enough through received or given damage. It's able to move more relatively freely in the three dimensions its got, has a very capable auto-locking targeting system on chosen targets within distance, and can target & lock-on to large numbers of targets for use of the barrage of the seeking missiles it can fire. The Flux bar starts to drain upon use of Strike Mode's firing capabilities but if used efficiently the Flux bar can prolong its usage without transforming back to ship mode.Kind of surprisingly the Strike Suit you use is the only mech in the game. No ally or enemy has anything similar although the mech may as well just be a temporary ship with a few more capabilities.There's not a whole lot else to this game outside of the well-done space-dogfighting.

												This game is a lot like Freespace 1 and 2. Basically, if you took those games and gave them a modern engine, it would be this. The only big difference (so far) is that after a few missions, you get the Strike Suit, which can either fly (when it's in ship mode) or hold relatively still and fight (in robot mode). Robot mode lets you turn a lot quicker, and it can lock onto lots of targets at once. Highly useful. However, the game (so far) doesn't have some of the stuff I miss from Freespace, like missiles designed to take out specific ship systems. Pretty good for an inexpensive game.I feel like there are a lot of keys to memorize, but it's easier if you keep your left hand on ASDF.			"

												I wish my x52 pro would work with this game on my rig, there are too many control issues for me to recommend this game to anyone.  Everytime I attempt to play it either there is a issue right off the bat, or shortly after launching something will occur(usually BSOD, error message or control issue)  I've downloaded and re-installed this game on so many different occasions since launch on steam, everytime hoping for some sort of fix for these issues.  So far nothing, back to the back catalog where it belongs.  I doubt it will ever work properly.			"

												Concept works, controls works, when overwelmed theres moments where you feel badass.Downside is that those are short lived because:- too small veriety of enemies making your progression feel very slow moving-objective feels too stretched on certain missions and lack veriety-effort on story telling feels drowned out from how boring everything is on top the fact the story itself is kinda awful.I want to like this game but by the 6th mission, I felt so bored.

												I have not played other space flight simulators extensively, so I cannot review this game based on how it compares to others in the genre. I can say that the graphics, controls, and level design do deliver on one thing - immersion.When you're making a hard turn, going upside down to try and flank the ship on your tail, the tension is real, as is the feeling in the back of your mind that you are travelling through endless, empty space. When another computer controlled ship in your squadron swings by and bails you out of something or steals your kill, it feels like a real, chaotic dogfight.Possibly the most important immersive part of the game is, once you unlock the Strike Suit, how much it really does look and feel like you are piloting a Gundam. When you first get it, with the music playing in the background and all of the swarms of enemy ships, you completely annhilate almost everything you can see. Then, in the next mission, the learning curve picks up, and you start to feel the limitations of this awesome machine. Quickly, because of how powerful the strike suit is, you get thrown into messes that are too much for the ship alone, and you have to knuckle down and enhance your skills to keep up. Meanwhile, the war rages on, and its emotional toll is felt by all.Doesn't that sound just like the plot of most Gundam shows? I was impressed by how the designers used their game's difficulty curve to reinforce the feel of being that one pilot with the super weapon on whom everything depends. This game is pretty hard, or at least it was for me, and as the best hard games do, it pushed me to get better and really hunker down to get specials from the missions so that I was well equipped enough to handle later ones.The story is nothing to write home about, and some of the combat scenarios get repetitive, especially since you often have to replay missions to get power ups. But the overall atmosphere of the game? Superb. And that makes playing it a joy, even if part of you is thinking 'torpedos? Again?'			"

												Played it, loved it, but it's too short a game (about 12 levels). Overall, it's a pretty decent game, and if you're a fan of the Armored Core series, then this is a game for you. The layout is pretty much the same, and has its own twists to make it a bit more enjoyable. Unfortunately, even when played at the most difficult setting, I was able to fly right on through each level without much effort. See, the game allows you to hire troops, and if you have them all, then playing it becomes way too easy. If they removed that aspect, then it'd be more enjoyable, in my opinion, anyways.			"

												Ideal for space cowboys.  Linear storyline rather than open world, but contrary to some reviews, I relish the frantic action and storytelling of SSZ.  It's such a nice change to have a game with some challenge to it.  The 3rd person view of the ships reminds me of ye olde Battlestar Galactica.  Taking out the gun turrets on the larger cruisers looks impressive.  Trying to get on the tails of your enemy using piloting skills and thrusters requires some perseverence in order to blast them into oblivion.  SSZ runs very well on my modest AMDm gpu.  It gets quite hypnotic at times, certainly not one for epileptics, and the in game audio is atmospheric.  I must admit i'm not one for the combo exploiting SSI sequel, but it's more of the same I suppose.  I think it was also this game that you can actually get skinning mods for several sci-fy favorites for!  7/10 whilst I await Elite.			"

												An inteligent, fast, smooth, and unfailingly beautiful game.  The game is small for the sheer enjoyment it brings, and with the Mega Bundle coming wth the full soundtrack and a kick-♥♥♥ artbook, it's what I recommend to buy.  This game is an excelent sci-fi experience in a rich and well rendered universe, the characters are distinguished but not obtrusive, letting the game speak for itself, and boy does it.  Enemies are inovative when given the chance to be, and showing any weakness will result on them mercilessly pursuing you.  Not to mention the incredibly active and powerful capital ships that power through space as you dart around every nook and cranny chasing enemy fighter craft away from your ship's critical systems and opening enemy ships up for attack.Chase and dogfight your way through swarms of enemy fighters, then switch to 'Strike Suit Mode' and completely erradicate the lot.I recommend this for any space combat fan, even if dogfights aren't your thing, the vistas, music, and watching massive ships slug it out around you is well worth the price.

												A game from a tiny developer with a successful kickstarter project, Strike Suit Zero is an accomplishment I'm sure many will remember. What this game lacks in complexity, it more than makes up for elsewhere. If anything, all you can really complain about is that it feels as though there's just not enough of it! So you want to know what this game is, what it does, etc. Well, imagine for one moment if the RTS game Homeworld, was smooshed together with the TV series Battlestar Galactica, the pacing of Super R-Type, the mecha styling of Mobile Suit Gundam, the atmosphere and vibrance of Zone of the Enders and infused with the soul of the X3 series. Now imagine that all of that comes together in an orgy of frenetic 3d-space combat, beautiful, vibrant graphics, a challenging AI, a good selection of ships/mecha and weapons and a soundtrack reminiscent of the musical stylings of Talvin Singh.Bottom Line : If you love your twitch gaming, but also want an atmospheric, challenging, not to mention stunning, 3d space shooter with an engaging story and an AI that'll keep you on your toes, then look no further. This really is a gem, and at under a fiver on steam, you've really got no excuses if this kind of thing is your cup of tea!Overall : 9/10Audio : 9/10Graphics : 9/10Gameplay : 9/10 "

												While I'm sure I'm missing out on a lot of the game by not having a triple monitor setup, I've gotta say this is a really nice game to just boot up, gawk at the nice nebulas, and get shot out of the sky. As I only have experience with Rogue Squadron II as my scifi flight sims, this was a nice step up. I found the game worked best with M/KB over gamepad, and the controls themselves were fair smooth. Overall I'd reccomend it if you're not yet tired of being an earthnoid tied down by gravity, as I think the game would've been much more fun to play on the colonists' side, since they were a bit overly demonized.

												This game is hit and miss in many ways, but overall enjoyable. I was able to bring out the old HOTAS setup and have it work perfectly, even with pedals. The graphics are pretty, especially with swarming missiles. The missions are standard fare, and I have no real complaints there. I bought the game after the patch that added checkpoint saves, which are definitely needed because some missions are quite long.Issues with the game include:1. Difficulty scaling is absurd. I can play a mission on Easy level and get Gold or Platinum, but playing at Medium get nothing, not even Bronze. It is not the difficulty that is absurd, it is the rewards system for completing the level.2. Heroes of the Fleet did not engage me. The first mission has a frustratingly hard section that made me say screw it, especially since it was not all that engaging.If they were to release more single player, campaign-based DLC, I would probably buy it.Rating: 3/5			"

												If you're into space shooters, this is a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of awesomesauce!  The controls and the 360-degree style of flight sort of remind me of the levels in Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire (N64) where you pilot the Outrider - it wasn't what I was expecting at first, but it doesn't take long to get used to.Performance-wise, I'm running this on a 4-year old computer with an Intel integrated graphics card and 4Gb of RAM.  Most of my games lag somewhat and use quite a lot of CPU, but I had SSZ on the highest graphic settings (which look amazing by the way), and there was no lag or drop in framerate at all!			"

												No regrets picking this up (on sale at least). Pros: amazing soundtrack, nice variety of ships, enjoyable gameplay, good challenges and length of missions, ecstatic immersive pew pew space combat. Missions are fun enough to re-do on higher difficulty and once unlocked you can use different ships when going back to replay missions.Cons: Lack of customization in ships (you can make a couple choices in weapon loadouts but all other upgrades are tied to nailing mission achievements and don't come with options), targetting itself works well once you get past the learning curve but switching target priorities could be done a little more intuitively, story is so-so - decent enough in a generic way to move you on to more pew pew goodness.

												SSZ, not as exciting as I thought it would be. Would probably need an endless mode or something to make it replayable, probably even a ""free roam"" gamemode. Anyway, I'm stuck, one mission is damn too punishing I can't finish it. Worth it? Sure. Does it give the space combat in a strike suit feel? eeehhh, sure, I guess. You'll probably staying flying around as a fighter ship, than a strike suit (it only exists as a strike suit for a limited time and under certain conditions) Those aside, SSZ nailed space combat pretty well. Charaters dialogue may need to be freshen up, however. Nonetheless, it's damn good game.			"

												Genuinely surprised at the mediocre-negative reception this game is getting from sites like Eurogamer. The story and presentation leave a little to be desired (as to be expected from an indie title) but the gameplay itself is rock solid. It's difficult but not unfair, just as space flight sims should be. The addition of a Macross-esque transforming space ship mechanic is so well done it's a wonder how these types of games ever did without it.			"

												This game is a mix of style from Omega Boost, and Colony Wars for PSX. Although this game was short (only 13 missions that last about 10-20 minutes per), the action was good, and worth the price. The storyline is predictable (the usual save the earth spiel), the controls need a little extra configuring (if you're using a gamepad), and the physics for space are not ideal (no drift).But as much as I am complaining about it, I still had a lot of fun, and look forward to any mission DLC they may develop.

												Got the game on the autumn sale. There aren't many games that I try to complete 100%, but this game is good enough for it. It has a very arcade-like feel for some reason- the story isn't anything special and it creates a lack of depth to the missions. This isn't really a bad thing though since the gameplay is fun and original. The first time you get a strike suit is extremely exciting and the story and dlc doesn't drag on. All in all it was a great experience and definately worth giving a try!			"

Now imagine you're playing that game, except the bad guys are space ships and the things you're escorting are huge, slow, moving targets that are completely vulnerable at all times. Though to the game's credit, the space backdrop to all your allies' slow inevitable death is beautiful even when it's frustrating.The story is also complete ♥♥♥♥, but that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.

												With a clever soundtrack and new take on space ship fighter combat, Strike Suit Zero is well worth the $15.00 pricetag on it's head.  There is an immensely gratifying feeling when you activate the Strike Suit's transformation mode, watching your ship spin into a giant mecha to level entire fleets.Some of the elements of the game in combat can feel a bit frustrating (trying to lock onto a target while your ship sways and overcompensates comes to mind), as well as loading times that have no excuse.Overall, I call this game a buy.

												Interesting concept and very nice graphics. There is a level of strategy as well, for instance, when in capital ship battles, taking out various hardpoints on larger ships to give your fleet an advantage and so forth. My only complaint is the clumsy controls, especially for keyboard & mouse. Somewhat difficult for accurate fire that is often necessary in dogfights, and Strike Suit controls take some getting used to, since you're constantly switching between fighter and SS modes. Overall the game is enjoyable, a pleasant remenisce of the Macross series.			"

												Trying to play this on a gamepad is just pointless as the controls there are far too sensitive, making you unable to shoot the broad side of a barn. Keyboard and mouse are a lot more easier to use and result in much improved accuracy. Visuals are fine, though nothing special. I honestly can't understand this games PC requirements being as high as they are. A complete lack of checkpoints throughout every mission I've played so far is also quite baffling and will lead to many ragequits. Weapons are pretty easy to use.All in all, it's an....OK game at best. If you want a simple space shooter (emphasis on simple) then go for it. But in all honesty, I wouldn't recommend. There are other games out there that do it better.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. Some of the main criticisms were with the control scheme and with the length of the game. Personally I got used to the controls quickly on keyboard and mouse, and if you have a controller they are supposedly better. They are also very customisable if you don't like the default system. As for the length, the game has a lot to offer for its price in my opinion, and at a reduced price you can't complain! Missions are a good length (though the checkpoint system can be rather punishing on harder missions) and it is an arcade style game in the sense that you get points for everything so replaying missions for platinum medals is encouraged.The other main criticism was that it wasn't enough like some other space flight game that the reviewer liked. Personally I don't see how this is a valid criticism for a reviewer to make who is supposed to be reviewing this game and not one that is over ten years old. This is its own game, go watch some gameplay if you are undecided, don't presume it will be like x-wing because thats what you want it to be like, you may be dissapointed.If you like bright flashy space combat and a game that rewards players that learn the mechanics and uses them instead of expecting it to be like that space game you played in 98 then pick it up!

												A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was FreeSpace2. This Space Combat Sim became arguably the best in the genre. Sadly, when FS2 came out in 1999 the Space Combat Sim genre was slowly dying. It was the last of an era and no others that came after could hold a candle to it. I played thousands of hours on FreeSpace 2 and the various fan made mods for over a decade, all the while wishing for someone to come revive the genre with a game worthy of FS2's legacy. And it wasn't until 2013 that my wish came true with the release of STRIKE SUIT ZERO.STRIKE SUIT ZERO - CONTROLS -- The game gives Space Sim enthusiasts the ship control they crave while giving the casual player easy mouse control. After the first mission I was digging around in my closet for my old Saitek x36 Flight controller. Mapping controls was easy enough, but be careful if your rudder is messed up. Axis Z is hard coded to menu navigation and could make mission and craft selection a pain. I would hightly suggest turning up your X/Y Axis sensitivity as the default setting makes your fighter move like an overloaded freighter. GAMEPLAY -- The missions feel like those from FreeSpace, my meaning being your not the focus of the fight. Epic battles are being waged around you. You are only a small cog in the machine, as it should be. You have specific objectives assigned to you while other units perform their duties. There are only four ships to chose from in SST, but I did not find the selection lacking. They were easy to customize to my flight style though the use of weapon load-outs (which remind me of the load-outs you could pick in Freespace, just with fewer choices). SST adds its own interesting twist to the genre with the ""Strike Suit"", a craft that has the ability to transform into a mech like something out of an anime. At first I thought this was going to be a cheesy gimmick-like easy button, but I was pleasantly surprised. The strike suit mode was not overly powered and did require a decent amount of skill to use effectively. You have to charge the strike suit though ""FLUX"", which can be gained by dishing out damage or less so though damage received. Your weapons in Strike Mode use up FLUX and once it is used up your ship is reverted back to interceptor mode.CONS: The game is woefully short. I would have liked to see multiple campaigns and possibly a co-op mode. Also, you have no control over your wing-men. In my honest opinion that would have made the game better for me. However, this is just nit-picking. The game is awesome. Anyone who has played FS2, I highly suggest this game to you. When Born Ready boasts that SSZ is ""Space Combat. Reborn"" they are not just talking out their ♥♥♥. They delivered on that promise. Check it out.			"

												An awesome space combat game. Think of it like Macross the video game. Combat is challenging, but fun and very flashy. Game starts off a bit slow, but picks up after mission 3 once you get the Strike Suit. The game can spike in difficulty very randomly, but never to the point of impossibility. The only thing I would hold against it is the bonus upgrades. Some of them ask you to complete a secondary objective of some sort. However, many of these objectives go against actually doing well on the mission. Very often, when I replayed the mission to get the secondary objective, I ended up doing far worse rating wise then I did just playing the mission normally.All in all, a fantastic dog-fighting, large-scale, space combat game and well worth the price of $20. Even better when it's on sale.			"

												This game falls into the ''criminally underrated'' category. Remember when IGN gave Godhand a 3 when everyone else gave it a 7 or 8? It's kinda like that. I'm not gonna spend too much time on this, but the reviewers that gave it a low score did so because they are inept at playing anything harder than Mario. ''It's too hard'' was the MAIN complaint, and it's pathetic because it's not.Anyway, think Star Fox 64's 'all-range mode', but with a lot more enemies. You get 13 missions with an unfolding plot, and upgrades along the way that are unlocked by completing optional objectives that present some difficulty, but hardly the difficulty the ♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ reviewers say it posseses. You're given objectives in the middle of the mission, but it boils down to killing ♥♥♥♥ and blowing up big ships. Each mission varies up the scenario to avoid repetetiveness: protecting a fleet, taking out a ship in particular (or protecting it), taking out incoming torpedos, loss of missile systems. Just a tip: press the camera button (default is 'C') to go into first person. You have to do this for both your fighter and the Strike Suit, otherwise you're in first person in fighter mode and third person in Strike mode. It makes the fighting a lot more intense and increases that sense of inertia.Incredibly fun; highly recommended; intense dogfighting on dogfighting action; buy it now.			"

												Very nice game. It's like the combat part of Freelancer (one of my all time favourites) and it's done very well.There is a degree of customisation, which is nice.Some of the checkpoints are very long, so if you die at certain points you can expect up to 20 minutes of replaying before you get to where you died, which can get frustrating at times. This isn't all bad though, as it makes you more careful and not just recklessly charging into 20 enemy ships just to see if it works.Varied optional objectives that unlock ship upgrades are also present. These are really fun to go for an are appropriately rewarding if you complete them.Also, the last mission is utter nonsense, but it's only 10 minutes long so it's not a too big of an impact.			"

												This game is awesome. It's a confusing 3-D bullet hell of a grind fest, but for once I'm happy to go back and grind in a game because it's so much fun. Also the grinding time gave me enough time for the subtle plot to finally sink in to my head. By the start I was confusedly and awkwardly floating around space in a clunky machine and at the end I was a master of space in a mech suit that shoots interstellar death torpedoes at hundreds of disposable enemies.Also, the conclusion of the game caught me way off-guard.If you like a) Being a mech b) Being in space or c) Playing Starfox 64 over and over to get the medals on every planet, this game is your messiah.

												Strike Suit: Zero is an awesome space fighting simulator that scratches an itch that few other games in recent times have.The story is told sparsely, which can be good or bad depending upon how focused you want to stay on the gameplay. The dual-nature of the Strike Suit is the central focus of the game, and it really does change combat completley when the ship transforms.You're given the option to unlock new weapons as you progress through the campaign which can also turn the tide in combat drastically. For most missions, you're locked to the strike suit (despite having unlocked other fighters) for the first playthrough. After the initial playthrough, the other fighters become unlocked and you can have another go at the level in a different ship if you so wish.The difficulty curve is fairly consistent, though the final level is just stupidly designed and plain boring. If you're not an utter completionist, leave the game at the second to last level and call that it.The Heroes of the Fleet DLC adds a new ship (the Marauder) and some new combat scenarios in the training simulator. Like the main campaign, the final level is horribly designed and gets to be an unfun grind session retry after retry. Up until then, the few missions in HotF are quite enjoyable and a nice change of pace.Ultimately, a great game marred by poor game design in the later levels in the developer's attempt to artificially ramp up difficulty.

												An old school space sim with new mechanics.Strike Suit Zero is one of the early titles developped for the Oculus Rift but if you aren't that lucky yet, don't worry this game is still great.The universe is very immersive, with it's great open spaces and impressive color palette, the game is visually striking. But it does not end there, there is full support for any type of control method (Mouse+Keyboard, Gamepad, Joystick+Keyboard, HOTAS) and the button mapping is really intuitive (just be sure to select Joystick+Keyboard when playing with a HOTAS). However, when it comes to controlling ships, there's not much to choose from. Being a recruit you'll start with a standard fighter then shortly after you'll unlock the Strike Suit and further down some other 2 ships bringing it to a total of four ships to choose from, which is not much. But the game being named Strike Suit Zero, you already guessed what the main ship will be. It's main feature is that is can transform into a Transformer like mech and fire lock on missiles and heavy caliber both using Flux as energy, this Flux can be regenerated over time and be destroying enemy targets. So yeah, it's pretty badass. But the game does not let you be badass for long as the didfficulty of missions ramp up very quickly and the ally AI is utterly useless, forcing you to always be at your best to triumph. The old school difficulty also applies to the ranking system, if you do as you are told you might get a medal, but if you do everyones job you'll earn silver or gold. Keep in mind that there is Platinum above and since you've already won the battle to yourself there is not much left to do!Anyway, besides its frustrating difficulty Strike Suit Zero is a fantastic experience and a worthy one if you want to prepare for StarCitizen later this year (press time). With it's challenging but rewarding gameplay, this is a game that I recommend.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. Some of the main criticisms were with the control scheme and with the length of the game. Personally I got used to the controls quickly on keyboard and mouse, and if you have a controller they are supposedly better. They are also very customisable if you don't like the default system. As for the length, the game has a lot to offer for its price in my opinion, and at a reduced price you can't complain! Missions are a good length (though the checkpoint system can be rather punishing on harder missions) and it is an arcade style game in the sense that you get points for everything so replaying missions for platinum medals is encouraged.The other main criticism was that it wasn't enough like some other space flight game that the reviewer liked. Personally I don't see how this is a valid criticism for a reviewer to make who is supposed to be reviewing this game and not one that is over ten years old. This is its own game, go watch some gameplay if you are undecided, don't presume it will be like x-wing because thats what you want it to be like, you may be dissapointed.If you like bright flashy space combat and a game that rewards players that learn the mechanics and uses them instead of expecting it to be like that space game you played in 98 then pick it up!

												The game didn't leave a good impression on me early in, but I stuck through it until mission 12 hoping for it to grab me, and now I'm done with it.  The game just isn't well designed, and mission 12 fully expressed that to me.  The weapons you get are limited in selection throughout the level.  The objectives and things you do rarely change and deviate from a formula they repeat every other level or 2.  It's basically defend X, attack X, or attack turrets on X to then get to attack X afterwards.Worse yet is on larger vehicles you're supposed to destroy you get little in terms of visual or auditory feedback that you're actually doing decent damage yourself, or if it's just your friendly ally ships.  When the objectives change, the game will do a poor job explaining what you actualy need to do, and point out targets that don't remotely matter to actually finishing it.  The game just does nothing remarkeable outside your strike suite can lock on, and let you paint multiple targets to fire a large missile barrage.  Fun for the first few times, but quickly becomes a tedious activity, as you'll use it a bunch to ween down health on ships with inflated HP.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is influenced heavily by the classics. The ship design takes inspiration from Macross, Homeworld and Gundam, and the gameplay borrows elements from Freespace, Wing Commander and the X-Wing series. It makes a solid attempt at reintroducing what seems to be a lost genre, then makes an even bolder attempt at  adding to it.

												Note: This is my impression after playing the base game without DLC or the Director's Cut, depending on the changes in the Director's Cut, some of these complaihnts may have been resolved.A space game in the vein of games like Star Wars: Rouge Squadron or Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance.  Due to the lack of games in this genre lately, I was greatly looking forward to this when I first heard of it.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite meet the mark.  The story starts out farcical, becomes mediocre, and then decides to be incomplete and farcical again on the final level.  When I first started playing, the controls felt too sensitive for me to fly straight, but this was solved by turning up the blind spot on the controls.  The difficulty spikes a couple times throughout the game, typically due to the targeting system not highlighting the targets you want it to in some levels, the ease of having your vision obstructed by explosions or damage preventing you from visually locating important objectives, or the dense, hyper-accurate turret concentrations on carriers.  The game also leaves you to figure out which weakpoints on large craft are actually important to kill in order to not fail the mission instead of telling you what the symbols mean.  It took me a while to come to the realization that the Strike Suit was mostly useful for its ability to kill massed enemies or bombard targets from beyond your normal range.  Also, collisions deal fixed damage regardless of speed or impact angle, which can frequently result in your instantaneous loss of all your shields from drifting too close to something while trying to kill a target.  Also, I found that it was necessary to rebind most of the weapon control keys to something else in order to not keep hitting the wrong button accidentally.Strike Suit Zero generally manages to be a game from a dead genre that reminds you that you want more games in the genre, but rarely manages to be even average at what it tries to do.

												Like the IGN review below, it IS a unique blend of arcade combat mechanics with good ole' fashion space combat simulation movement. The graphics are lovely, and the soundtrack is like something out of Ghost in the Shell ( a quintessential cyberpunk anime). The difficulty spikes greatly within two missions, and the battles can be very frantic to the point of being distracted by EVERYTHING on screen. The game has some replay value, and allows you to use unlocked strike suits/ships on previous missions, as well as leaderdoards for each mssion.Unfortunately, it lacks a multiplayer, but the developers aren't ruling out a multiplayer function in the future, as well as an SDK for mods.A definite buy for space combat/mecha junkies, but if you want multiplayer, you might have to wait a bit.

												I really want to recommend this game. I really do. But I can't. While it is fun to play, there's a few poins that, in my opinion, reduce the fun significantly.+ Gameplay is fun (most of the time).+ Graphics and sounds are great.+ Mouse/Keyboard controls are responsive and intuitive.- Playing with controller is difficult. I have an XBox360 controller for windows. The left stick is for rolling the ship (pretty useless), the right stick is for gearing. I'd rather have it the other way round. Since you also shoot with the right hand, I play the entire game with the right hand. And there seems to be no way to change that. Thus I resorted to mouse and keyboard.- You get additional fighters during the game, and you get a ""choose your ship"" screen. However, even if you already have other fighters, you can't choose freely. Most of the time, you're stuck with the Strike Suit.- The Strike Suit is annoying. You play it in pursuit mode most of the time, meaning it's basically a mediocre fighter. The standard fighter you get in the beginning has more firepower. When you magically charged your Flux bar by killing enemy ships, you get a short moment of the Suit's ""glory"". The Suits cannons are useless and effective only against enemy fighters. When attacking a capital ship's turrets, it likes to target turrets that are on the other side of the ship (and thus can't be hit) or the ship itself (for which it has way too little firepower).- Attacking capital ships is hard, even in easy mode. You get barraged with plasma cannons, beam cannons and flak, which can tear you apart within seconds. Which is why I never made it past mission 8. The bloody carrier is too much for the flimsy Strike Suit. Especially since there are no other friendly fighters, this it focusses all of its attention at me.- I'm not exactly fond of vocals in background music.			"

												Trying to play this on a gamepad is just pointless as the controls there are far too sensitive, making you unable to shoot the broad side of a barn. Keyboard and mouse are a lot more easier to use and result in much improved accuracy. Visuals are fine, though nothing special. I honestly can't understand this games PC requirements being as high as they are. A complete lack of checkpoints throughout every mission I've played so far is also quite baffling and will lead to many ragequits. Weapons are pretty easy to use.All in all, it's an....OK game at best. If you want a simple space shooter (emphasis on simple) then go for it. But in all honesty, I wouldn't recommend.

I really have enjoyed this game so far and currently trying to fight my way through the 5th level. I don't regret buying this at all and believe this is worth every penny I spent.

												Those who grew up watching Japanese mecha-themed anime (like anything out of the Gundam universe) will enjoy this game for it almost-perfectly captures the sense of overwhelming power and superiority one might get when piloting the proverbial weaponized suit. That feature alone can carry this game to a ""good"" rating from most fans of anime and the space combat genre. Add colorful and vibrant graphics, a wonderful soundtrack, intense gameplay, and scalable difficulty (from ""Grandparent-friendly"" to ""WTF""), then you've got a wonderful reason to give the developers your time and money.

												This is one of the most satisfying games that I have ever played. I am a fan of mech anime and an even greater fan of Star Wars, so this game was everything that I could have ever hoped for. Gameplay-wise, the controls are smooth to the point where you wouldn't even know that this is an indie game. The missions are a pretty decent length, with action over at every moment. I can't say that I really feel for the characters, but that wasn't what I bought the game for. If you are hoping for story, do not come any further, However, if you are hoping for action packed, literally explosive awesomeness, come much further! The battles in this game are spectacular. Instead of just shoting the capital ships in any random spot, the game urges you to go for many of the weak points and weapons that bristle of each of them. As for graphics, this may not be The Last of Us, but the graphics are good enough to make for a beautiful game at every moment. The backgrounds are spectacular and gorgeous, with vibrant shades of colors, the best probably being the shades of purple and blue. When it comes to the soundtrack, Paul Ruskay and Kokia di an amazing job, with the ambiance of the game enhanced tenfold by the fastpaced songs. This game is definately worth the price, as well as the counterpart, Strike Suit Infinity. I have not bought a PC gaming controller, so I have no idea what the difference in playability between the two formats are.			"

												Luckily I bought this game after they fixed all the major issues, so no complaint there. Game works fine for me.I've played this game the whole way through, and I can safely say I had an absolute blast. The combat was fun and fast paced, the ship designs were neat, though definitely more variety was a must there, yet overall the game had a very stylized look and feel to it. Plus the music was pretty damn bad ♥♥♥ as well. The fighting in the game seems so visceral, I love it in games where your the queen in a very large chess game. Also, the strike suit itself is pretty damn cool, shooting out tons of missles a la macross.Although I must admit, the controls are pretty wonky. Not being able to flip around or do a quick 360 or anything like that is pretty annoying, not to mention the overall awkward control scheme you need to get used to. Voice acting and story is also pretty mediocre, could've used definite improvements there. Also, the missions get pretty repetitive, and the ones where you have to blow up specific buildings or such, with no fast way to turn around it really gets annoying fast.Overall though, if you like fast action space combat games, this is one you should definitely get.

												The default control layout for 360 pads could really use some work, but after messing with a bit, and giving the game a chance I'm really getting into Strike Suit Zero.  Efforts in the pure action space fighter genre have been weak to middling since Freespace 2 - I can now say that SSZ is comfortably cut above them.  It hasn't best Freespace 2's nigh unbeatable high water mark, but it is eminently entertaining and a good game in it's own right.  For a genre on hiatus (not dead!) this a laudable big step in reviving it.			"

												I did not recommend this game for a few reasons:First reason: No multiplayer. I think this game, with tweaking, could be good for multiplayer, but that doesn't seem to be on the horizon yet. However, if you're more of a single-player type person, this point need not apply to you.Second reason: Does not offer a demo. At least what I could find. This game, at the time of this writing, is on sale %75, and I bought the entire Strike Suit Zero Mega Bundle for $9.99. However, that's ten bucks I could have saved had I tried a demo first.Third reason: Not what I thought it was going to be like. Let me elaborate on this a little. First, it was my clumsy fault that I didn't notice that this game didn't support multiplayer. Some of you may remember playing a little Microsoft Studios game called Freelancer, which was an amazing spaceflight game. If you're looking for a game like that, this isn't it. I completed the first mission, and sadly to say I got kinda bored; too bored in fact to finish the second mission.Overall, the game and its graphics are nice. I wish I had a nicer graphics card to take advantage of the wonderful effects I could see in the trailers. However, the gameplay is very repetitive with little reward.			"

												While I'm sure I'm missing out on a lot of the game by not having a triple monitor setup, I've gotta say this is a really nice game to just boot up, gawk at the nice nebulas, and get shot out of the sky. As I only have experience with Rogue Squadron II as my scifi flight sims, this was a nice step up. I found the game worked best with M/KB over gamepad, and the controls themselves were fair smooth. Overall I'd reccomend it if you're not yet tired of being an earthnoid tied down by gravity, as I think the game would've been much more fun to play on the colonists' side, since they were a bit overly demonized.

Anyway, I'm stuck, one mission is damn too punishing I can't finish it. Worth it? Sure. Does it give the space combat in a strike suit feel? eeehhh, sure, I guess. You'll probably staying flying around as a fighter ship, than a strike suit (it only exists as a strike suit for a limited time and under certain conditions) Those aside, SSZ nailed space combat pretty well.

The AI is actually quite challenging, and the vanilla game provides a good experience alone. I would say this is a great game if you have a controller or flight stick for input, but the keyboard and mouse setup isn't bad either... However, with a flight stick, the way the HUD reacts to your movements is quite immersive.. If you have a flight stick you owe it to yourself to play this. Expect an arcadey experience for progression through the game.

												A good space shooter which can really recall nostalgic of those old days. The strike mode might feel awesome at first, but it lose its magic after you're used to its limited maneuver. It really got most of the important gredient. But unfortunately with some apparent shorts:1. The strike mode need more attack pattern or functions. Probably consider something like infight.2. Story is not well-written. The settings are spilled on the player suddenly in last mission.3. Enemy AI is too simple. And there is no other spacecraft being a threat to the strike suit.4. The last mission is totally a mess. You shouldn't put this so lengthy.But overally speaking, this is still a game worth your time.			"

												Very nice game. It's like the combat part of Freelancer (one of my all time favourites) and it's done very well.There is a degree of customisation, which is nice.Some of the checkpoints are very long, so if you die at certain points you can expect up to 20 minutes of replaying before you get to where you died, which can get frustrating at times. This isn't all bad though, as it makes you more careful and not just recklessly charging into 20 enemy ships just to see if it works.Varied optional objectives that unlock ship upgrades are also present. These are really fun to go for an are appropriately rewarding if you complete them.Also, the last mission is utter nonsense, but it's only 10 minutes long so it's not a too big of an impact.			"

												I have a very short attention span.  This game is very enjoyable.  The combat takes skill to learn but once you have worked it out - and changed your keyboard keys to the ones that suit you - the space battles are very satisfying.  It does take skill to wipe out all targets.I usually only play FPS games but strike suit zero has shown me a new genre of games that I didn't expect to enjoy but they are actually more fun than FPS games.  The shooting and battles are more intense and really get you immersed.The ship upgrades and tutorials are all part of the game and aren't overwhelming.  I can't stand games with endless menus on how to change how you can fart in your suit.  But this game makes you want to upgrade your weapons and ships.  Because you know those battles are going to be even more intense.I really recommend this game.  There are no boring protracted sequences or endless dialogue episodes.Become a super accurate space warrior who likes to destroy all kinds of stuff and you feel empowered and not stifled.  This is new and fresh and I'm so glad I found this game.If you're like me - with a short attention span.  You'll like the immediacy and intelligence of this game and game mechanics.Get it. !!!And take your shooting skills and precision to a whole new level. "

												This game is pretty good. The controls for mouse and Keyboard combos is pretty solid. Sensativity will need adjusting, however, especially in Assault mode. The visuals are gorgeous and the gameplay is easy to understand after about 30 or so minutes of playtime. The mouse though can be a bit slow at times and the visuals can lag at some points. It is not enough to significantly hamper the gameplay but it is noticable, especially at some of the higher resolutions. The cockpit mode is awesome and adds a new dimmension to this game. I give a solid 7-8/10. Reccommended for the people who space shoot em' ups or is looking for something a bit different.			"

												Best mech combat simulator/space flight sim since Zone of the Enders. Gameplay is fast and fluid, offering easy of entry and an adequate difficulty curve as the game progresses. The story serves as little more than a backdrop for the absolutely massive space battles, but to be fair, did you really look into this game for a deep and thought provoking story, or just because you wanted to feel like a badass mech pilot? My only complaint is that sometimes tracking the location of your highlighted target can get difficult in the more frenzied encounters since the directional arrow highlighting it's location is the exact same color as all the other high priority target indicators on the HUD, (of which there will be many in later missions). It makes manually prioritizing your targets somewhat annoying, but not game-breaking in any way.			"

												I was a big Freespace and Starlancer player back when those games were popular. I was also big into Star Fox and its Nintendo 64 counterpart, in addition to an unhealthy addicted to Earthsiege, Starsiege, and the Mechwarrior series. Suffice to say that I love space combat games and sims, and it is a genre that has sadly lacked any real entries over the last decade to speak of. Strike Suit Zero fills that niche very nicely.When I started SSZ and began playing, it took a little bit of time to re-acquire the whole 'flying in space with a mouse and keyboard' feeling, but once I got the hang of it, it felt as natural as ever. The controls are nice and tight and there isn't a lot of slop. The graphics are polished but the animations during cutscenes can be a little janky sometimes. Voice acting is of far better quality than I would have expected - if you think the voiceovers are going to be as bad as, say, X3, you're wrong. Egosoft could take a note from this game. Graphics and style are overall awesome. I love the depth-of-field/blurring effect when boosting through space in cockpit view. My only gripes - the HUD situation sucks. Honestly. I hate that it's a bar at the top of the screen. It's jarring and unnatural; I would have preferred the HUD to be integrated into the cockpit in first-person view and at the sides or bottom of the screen in third-person. My other gripe - and this is going to be kind of an assanine gripe, as it centers around a key concept in the game - is the strike suit. I hate the strike suit. It just feels like a gimmicky, juvenile anime trope. I've never enjoyed mecha anime and I've never enjoyed humanoid mechs. I've always preferred the gritty down-to-earth mechs of later BattleTech and the hercs of the Earthsiege universe, they just seem more probable and more likely to exist. But I guess it's more a matter of taste, really. In gameplay the Strike Suit mode is very helpful and incredibly powerful - you can lock on to an insane number of enemies and launch cluster rockets that obliterate everything, not to mention the big giant plasma shotgun thing that wrecks face. It's definitely fun. It's use is balanced out nicely by flux mechanic, and I have not really felt the game get easier as a result of having the strike suit. The only real gameplay-related gripe that I have about it is that in strike suit mode you are forced into third person view. I hate that.It's a hard game, too. Really hard. It goes easy on you at first, but once you get your first strike suit, all bets are off. In particular the first level that takes place in a nebula is difficult (due to the fact that sensors, radar, and lockon missiles do not work- you have to rely on dumbfire rockets and visual sight). I love difficult and challenging games. The good:- Difficult- Beautiful visuals and style- Interesting concept in the strike suit- Unlockable ships and progression- Variety in space environments keeps things from getting stale- Feels like a natural progression of the space shooter genre- Music is very catchy- Voiceovers aren't half bad- Price- IndieThe bad- HUD design and placement is awkward- Music can be repetitive at times- Strike suit... mainly on aesthetic grounds- Forced third-person view in strike suit mode- Makes you wish for a modern FreespaceThis game gets 4 out of 5 cookies from me! I look forward to the next game these guys put out. I hope they keep this genre alive and renew interest in it.			"

												A pretty good arcade 3d space shooter. Don't expect anything complicated from the plot or missions. You shoot the enemies you get rewarded with explosions. I found it passible for what it was. The parts I didn't like were the constant escort missions and the controls. Just about every mission has you escorting something that you can not let get destroyed or it's mssion over. The wonky controls are hard to deal with sometimes. Who puts roll on the A and D keys instead of yaw? Also its hard to protect the ship you are supposed to escort since the action gets frantice and you tend to lose track of whats going on.			"

												An inteligent, fast, smooth, and unfailingly beautiful game.  The game is small for the sheer enjoyment it brings, and with the Mega Bundle coming wth the full soundtrack and a kick-♥♥♥ artbook, it's what I recommend to buy.  This game is an excelent sci-fi experience in a rich and well rendered universe, the characters are distinguished but not obtrusive, letting the game speak for itself, and boy does it.  Enemies are inovative when given the chance to be, and showing any weakness will result on them mercilessly pursuing you.  Not to mention the incredibly active and powerful capital ships that power through space as you dart around every nook and cranny chasing enemy fighter craft away from your ship's critical systems and opening enemy ships up for attack.Chase and dogfight your way through swarms of enemy fighters, then switch to 'Strike Suit Mode' and completely erradicate the lot.I recommend this for any space combat fan, even if dogfights aren't your thing, the vistas, music, and watching massive ships slug it out around you is well worth the price.

												In a word: forgettable.Ship unlocks don't carry forward to new missions, only previous missions - and there's no real reason to replay them.Side objectives - which are your sole source of basic upgrades (armor, shields, etc) - are only gained from completing side objectives, but with no radar, it's hard to pick out side objectives from the swarm of angry arrows swirling around the edge of your screen - nevermind that you must cycle target priorities until what you want pops up. This is especially agonizing as many side objectives are ""stop all the torpedoes""; there are no audio or visual warnings for when torpedoes are launched, so unless you are constantly mashing 'F' to see if any are in-flight, you have absolutely no way to tell - and if even one hits, the side objective is failed...but it gets even worse! When you fail a torpedo side objective, you don't even receive a notification - so you don't even know you failed it until you've sunk ~15 - 20 minutes into a mission and see the results screen. On top of that, on every single mission that has a ""torpedoes"" side objective, you are required to constantly monitor corvettes, capital ships, and fighters - which you cannot really find unless you set your target priority to each in sequence by tapping 'T'...but since there's no warning when torpedoes are fired, you have to constantly cycle target priorities and mash 'F'...and then you find out 20 minutes later when you've cleared the mission (hopefully) that one single torpedo must have snuck past ya - no unlock for you!At one point I was boosting away from an enemy cruiser to let my shields recharge - note that this was a good 14 minutes into a mission - and I was abruptly greeted by a ""MISSION FAILED. YOU WENT AWOL. EVERYTHING BLEW UP. EARTH BLEW UP. ALL THE PUPPIES DIED. GAME OVER."" screen. There was no warning, no audio or visual queue that I was getting close to the edge of the zone like a better game would do, NO - it just springs a ""GAME OVER"" on you.Your AI allies are comparitively crippled, dealing significantly less damage and having less hull/shields than enemies. They also pretty much suck at covering you when you're in a slower craft, like the bomber you are required to fly in a few missions.While the ship agility is fine for open space where there aren't really any obstacles, the last stage will have you smashing your face through your screen trying to guide your ship through 9 minutes of obstacles inside a tunnel.Altogether it's not a terrible game, it's just underwhelmingly 'meh'. I plowed through it in probably < 8 hours on normal and do not care to play it any further. The issues mentioned above are pretty darn pervasive and aggravating throughout the course of the campaign.			"

Pros: amazing soundtrack, nice variety of ships, enjoyable gameplay, good challenges and length of missions, ecstatic immersive pew pew space combat. Missions are fun enough to re-do on higher difficulty and once unlocked you can use different ships when going back to replay missions.Cons: Lack of customization in ships (you can make a couple choices in weapon loadouts but all other upgrades are tied to nailing mission achievements and don't come with options), targetting itself works well once you get past the learning curve but switching target priorities could be done a little more intuitively, story is so-so - decent enough in a generic way to move you on to more pew pew goodness.

The dogfighting mechanics are top notch. The lock system for both missles and free fire is smooth as silk and the story is intriguing but doesn't get in the way. If anyone read my review of Dawnstar on The Gaming Rig (http://thegamingrig.co.uk/index.php/pc/46-dawnstar) THIS is the game I wanted it to be.

												Strike Suit Zero is a very unique game. It's offers a level of immersion that other space opera games lack. This is a heavy action-oriented game and the story is not merely a vehicle.  Controls are not complex and only several keys are required and the game doesn't dump a rediculous ammount on you, forcing you to stretch your hand all accross your keyboard. The plot is not pointless too. It will fool you into thinking it's a total linear story line. So SPOILER ALERT: at the very end you have a choice.Combat is very satisfying. Ships are graceful, fair, and not clunky to handle. Controls are simple, easy to operate, and convenient. The story surprised me as stated above.If you like mecha games such as armored core, military themed areial combat, space opera, then you will love this game and it's sequel Strike Suit Infinity.

Although this game was short (only 13 missions that last about 10-20 minutes per), the action was good, and worth the price. The storyline is predictable (the usual save the earth spiel), the controls need a little extra configuring (if you're using a gamepad), and the physics for space are not ideal (no drift).But as much as I am complaining about it, I still had a lot of fun, and look forward to any mission DLC they may develop.

												do i enjoy the gameplay? YESdo i enjoy the missions?NOescort missions are NOT fun, and there are way too many in this game. If you want to PLAY this game get the INFINITY version, that way you won't have to endure almost an entire campaign of annoying escort missions.			"

												Excellent fun so far and for the sale price you just can't go wrong. Using a controller for this, haven't tried keyboard and mouse with it. I am even replaying missions (something I tend never to do).			"

												My personal GOTY 2013. Indy devs continue to amaze as they incresingly show up big AAA developers who turn out crap product after broken product.			"

												If you like Battlestar Galactica, Macross, or anything like that, you will like the combat featured in this game. Zero-G space combat where you dogfight, bomb, and morph into a OP robot form that rapes muppets. The visuals are very nice that demonstrates the scale of the combat. Controls with mouse and keyboard are pretty good but I'm sure joystick users would have it easier.			"

												It's like 1 part Freespace, 1 part Armored core, with a bit of Gundam thrown in. It's got loads of explosions, and though the pacing seems a bit off at times, the ability to jump from playing Freespace The New Age, to Armored Core In Space is just hilariously fun and can really keep the action going, though I can't recommend if you can't stand being in the Freesapce mode longer than the Armored Core mode. But that's just like, my opinion man.			"

												Genuinely surprised at the mediocre-negative reception this game is getting from sites like Eurogamer. The story and presentation leave a little to be desired (as to be expected from an indie title) but the gameplay itself is rock solid. It's difficult but not unfair, just as space flight sims should be. The addition of a Macross-esque transforming space ship mechanic is so well done it's a wonder how these types of games ever did without it.			"
