												Really, this is THE game to get from the classic pack. You've never played anything quite like this except for Pirates. Take Pirates's combination of minigames into a piracy sim and instead of swashbuckling swordfights and sea battles you have sneaking through enemy offices, placing wiretaps, decrypting memos, and trying to stay one step ahead of a terrorist plot that unfurls in game time. It's a little unwieldy, the sinister plots are reused constantly and the ""true end game"" of capturing all the masterminds is a pipe dream of a LOT of repetition. Dr. Pasture will be kidnapped at least six hundred times before you can reach that goal, but the core mechanics are good fun.It plays in DosBox and plays perfectly in this day and age. Just read the manual as the stealth controls are a bit unwieldy. Numpad to move, crouching's importance, what to take along and why, and disguises and how you use/lose them are all explained there in a way that would be tough to figure out just from playing it.

												One of my favourite classic games ever, it's great to see Covert Action available on Steam.  The Infiltration Mini-game is like hotline Miami except instead of caving thugs heads in you sneak around and search through all the cupboards.I love the driving sections although the cars could use more camber and the Cryptography section is just like the Code words puzzles in the Sunday papers so I always feel like a professor when i complete one.Just make sure you have a pen and paper to hand if you're thinking of catching a mastermind on anything above national threat difficultyI also love the splashscreen recommending other microprose games when you close the game.  When is knights of the Sky comming to Steam?			"

												10/10. One of Sid's early classics. I really miss the maximum replayability of 90's video games. For its time, I can't think of a single thing that would make this game better, even after 20 years of playing it (and STILL not being brave enough to go past the bottom difficulty level! XD)If you want to talk about games using random generators for each session of playing, that's this. EVERYTHING is perfectly randomized EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I love it. Maximizes the playability. :DBut no one knows the feeling of your heart sinking when you find a floor safe, photograph it, and it has only grenades, a floor plan, or (worst of all) NOTHING!!! Come on, man! I wanna turn this dude into a double agent! :'(So yeah. 90s ingenuity and maximum replayability are huge factors in this game. Shoot, I'm still playing it 20 years later!How many modern games do you think will be playable again and again in 20 years? What titles?			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played.This game is from the era of Microprose games that expertly combined mini-games using a cohesive big picture to give them context and motivation. Its siblings are Sword of the Samurai and Pirates! (the modern remake of which is available on Steam as well, at , and also highly recommended).You play as freelance spy Max Remmington, contracted to the CIA, and your job is to foil terrorist attacks before they can occur. You do this by gathering evidence against the members of the conspiracy through wiretapping, stakeouts, infiltrating and searching their hideouts, or simply following them in your car. Once you have the evidence you need, you pounce on them and bring them in. The trick is to let the conspiracy progress far enough that you can implicate everyone involved without spooking them and sending them to ground, while still preventing the attack from actually happening.How you approach the case is totally up to you. You could wiretap the local cartel hideout in the hopes of catching some encrypted message, then take it back to the CIA office to crack the code. Or you can infiltrate the hideout yourself, plant bugs, photograph documents (with your super spy camera) and slip out before the guards notice you. When it's time to haul in the bad guys, you could go in with guns and grenades, or you could go with a high-speed car chase.Each conspiracy you thwart gets you one step closer to identifying and capturing the leader of one of the terrorist factions involved. The overall, eventual goal of the game is to wipe out every one of these organisations by arresting and convicting each leader.This game is dated in its interface and graphics, but otherwise stands up remarkably well. When I say this is one of the best games ever, I do so with no nostalgia goggles on - I first played it 15 to 20 years AFTER its release in 1990, as abandonware. I've bought it now for the first time.The one flaw in the game that jumps out is that the number of different encrypted message texts are rather limited considering how many cases you need to play if you want to capture every single terrorist leader. After a while you recognise the texts fairly quickly, which makes cryptography quite easy. Still, you'll be tens if not hundreds of hours into the game by the time you reach this point.Note also that you will need to read the PDF manual, as this game predates in-game tutorials. It's well worth it, however.edit: I see Steam doesn't actually include the manual yet, which is inexplicable to me. It's worth tracking down. At the very least, you will need the controls, which I've found at http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=20219&tab=controlsedit again: it turns out pdf copies of the manual and technical supplement (which is where the controls are) are actually included in the Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Covert Action. That said, my technical supplement is apparently ""Handbuch.pdf"" and is entirely in German. Not as helpful as if it were in English, but it's a start! ;)Overall: highly, highly recommended.			"

												What can I say about Covert Action? Crap graphics, crap sound, no mouse support, very slow reactions to the controls, and despite all that - completely playable.This is one of those rare games that you will enjoy if you can get past the superficial and enjoy the gameplay; there has been no other game like it and that's why it's still enjoyable today.The basic premise is investigation - no handholding here - you're given the basic details of a plot at the start of a mission, and depending on the difficultly level, you'll get some starter info - maybe a name or two, or a face and perhaps an intercepted communication. It's then up to you to expand on the information, putting names and faces together, identifying groups involved, who is doing what, with who, where, and when. You do this by wiretapping and/or breaking into buildings, and following suspects to see if they lead you to anywhere/anyone else.Once you've got the evidence you need; it's time to strike - don't take too long otherwise the plot will come together and end up being completed! Break into the buildings containing the suspects and either arrest or, if you're lucky, turn them into a double agent. Arrest them at the wrong time and other plotters will get spooked and hide because they can't complete their mission, and you lose the chance to get them. Turn them and they will carry on with the plot but send a copy of every communication sent to and received from their co-consipirators back to you so you can see how things are unfolding.Stopping the plot is the most basic of wins; the more participants you can arrest or turn, the more points you get, capture the elusive masterminds (who don't actually actively participate in the plot so you don't get the luxury of intercepted communications) and get even more points; and there's even a 'Mr Big' apparently behind the scenes that's even more difficult to find.This game is utterly immersive - even in 2015.If someone simply remade this as-is but with updated sound and visuals, it would probably do well.... If someone had a good look and tweaked the gameplay a little and added some modding support, i'm convinced it would be a hit. "

												One of the greatest game I played as a child.  Controls are a bit wonky, but it's worth trying it out.  You create your character simply from Male or Female, then from 4 skill sets; Combat, Crypto, Driving, and Electronics which all have a rating to them.  Then you in a free roam world to a degree, you hang out at the office, review the case files, place a wire tap, break into a suspect's building (stealth or loud), tail a suspects car to a new location, travel to exotic locations.  It's a great game that shouldn't be missed! Matter of fact I still own the original and couldn't figure out out how to get 3.5 floppies to run.  Here it is ready to go!  Thanks!			"

												This is probably in my 5 all time most favorite games list.   It is the proper way to make a game made up of many integrated mini-games that come together in one big beautiful package.  This and Sword of the Samurai are two of my favs that I'm really happy found their way onto Steam.  The controls are a bit tricky to get the hang of at first in this game but once you've got the hang of everything you'll fall in love with this game.  My best recommendation for this game is to play at the harder difficulties once you familiarize yourself with the game because it unlocks so many more encounters in-game and really adds to the action.  The only drawback I'd say from this game is that the ""Driving"" minigame is probably the most lackluster portion of the game but it's just one of several options at your disposal to locate the criminals and you can avoid it altogether if you wish and just go the cryptology/wiretapping/breaking-n-entering route.

												A wonderful game! I can't believe this was released in 1990! It has great graphics, depth, and functionality for the time period. Reading the 60-70 page manual is a must. If you can commit yourself to that, there's a very immersive game waiting for you.What I really like is the subject matter. You are Max Remington, the world's only free-lance spy. So good, you only work at the direct request of the American President. At his request, you'll investigate vast conspiracies, uncover clues, find the culprits, and arrest them before they can commit their devastating crimes. An intriguing premise (if not the most realistic), but what really makes this game stand out is it was made at that special time where the Berlin Wall had fallen, but the Soviet Union had not yet collapsed. As such, your enemies aren't the KGB (though the KGB has a presence) but other international terrorists. It's really fascinating from a historical perspective.I hear that Sid Meier himself was not pleased with his game overall. He said that the game of having combat with enemy agents detracted too much from piecing together clues to solve crimes, and vice-versa. From this experience he created the ""Covert Action Rule,"" where a game should not divert its attention. For example, in Civilization, if a unit fights another unit, you don't switch to a RTS game and fight out the battle, you just resolve it and move on with the Civilization game. To Sid Meier I would say: ""You overestimate this 'flaw'!"" Look at how popular the Total War series is, which does exactly what he describes! Personally, I don't think the combat game detracts from the 'solving mystery' game at all. It wouldn't feel like a real spy game if you couldn't break into hideouts, photograph evidence, and capture criminal masterminds.If you can stand playing old DOS games and have free time to commit to learning the game, I wholeheartedly recommend it. I wouldn't expect a remake to ever happen: we're just too far away from Cold War politics for a game like this to work in the modern Global War on Terror-era.			"

												I found this while looking for other Sid Meier games and bought it for only .97! Covert Action is a great game from way back (I still have the original 3.5 in disk.) Can't believe I am still playing it 25 years later. If you feel a need to kill terrorists, this game will do it in a low-intensity way.If you are looking for state of the art, forget it. This is very retro and very simple, yet addictive. Big pixels, keyboard controls, and music from the dawn of audio cards. But the game is still loads of fun, in a midless, relaxing way. You chase spies, unravel conspiracies, break codes, and, if you want, plant bugs, tap phones, and track cars (the latter are not totally necessary to win.) Mostly you break into safe houses and crack safes, shoot the guards, and hack the computers. The Steam version actually seems patched/improved in some ways. There are more passwords for computer access. The guards are not quite as stupid, and some old cheese (like tossing a stun grenade into a room of 'dead' guards to bring them back and loot their stuff) is missing. Not that the graphics are sharp (256 color VGA anyone?), but they seem a little better. Also the conrtrols are stiffer, adding to the challenge. My scores have actually gone down since playing my freeware version just a month ago! Bottom-line: Covert Action is a throw-back, like vintage toys, to a time when you needed an imagination to pretend you are James Bond or some other super-spy. But each new crime shuffles the deck so that no two games ever seem the same. You can fly off to exotic pixels and prevent all the crimes you wish you could in real life. It makes a nice change from the news! And for ninety-seven cents, what are you risking anyway???			"

												I loved this game when it was fairly new, and I still enjoy it, though I do wish it would be remade as a smoother product.  This was from Sid, so you know it's solid.  The gameplay is a spy themed game that is a cross between Pirates and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiago?  You stop plots that actually are going through actions, over time agents are activated, payoffs and equipment made.  You can stop a plot by preventing key actions (if the assassin isn't paid, he ain't shooting anyone,) and using logic you can figure out the plots.  The controls are slow, and the music and graphics are top notch for a game that is over 20 year old.			"

												I played this game years ago (along with the other 2 ""minigame"" micropose games, Sword of the samurai and Pirates) and ever since all other spy themed games have come up short. There's a weird sort of disconnect between the gameplay modes as each section of the game (Combat, driving, crypto, and electronics) however the overall theme ties them all together to make the player feel like they are in fact a spy working on uncovering some form of terrorist conspiracy. This is the covert action's greatest achievement.On to the flaws side, the game is very text heavy. It's important to read almost everything so as to make informed decisions on your case and thus I would say if your against reading in your video games perhaps best if you go elsewhere. The other flaw would be the dated graphics. If you are looking for something thats graphically impressive I suggest not looking at games released in 1990 (24 years ago at this point).Overall this is an amazing game that I look forward to sinking many more hours into.

												I played a ton of this game back when it first came out and it is one I fondly remember. It was a great game in it's day and is still well worth playing but it is a very simple game layered with a thin veneer of fake complexity. Tailing someone, tracking someone, doing wiretaps are all the long way round to get the info you want. The best and fastest way to get loads of info in this game is to break into a place and crack some safes and take some pictures. You'll walk out with loads of intel that would've taken you hours to get any of the other ways.It's a fun game for a few hours and worth it for the nostalgia but everyone out there who is saying it needs a remake is dead wrong. The elements of Covert Action have been done in dozens of other games in more modern implementations. Deus Ex: Human Revolution does a lot of this stuff very well. Then there are the Splinter Cell games, Alpha Protocol and the newer Fallouts that all share some elements with Covert Action but have done them in more modern ways. And I suspect that Sid Meier is aware of that since it's one of the few games he hasn't seen fit to revisit.			"

												Before Splinter Cell, before “Metal Gear”, there was a game that felt like a true stealth/spy game: “Covert Action”. I bought this game when it first came out and it took up many weekends before my PC was upgraded from Dos to Windows. You’re a secret agent who is tasked with uncovering and averting plots. You’ll travel to a lot of places, do wiretaps, break in and gather evidence, follow suspects and do some crypto. Arrest or “turn” hostile cell members until you finally capture their Mastermind.  There might even be a double-agent and false leads to filter through. And if the faction you’re targeting is not in your city’s listing, then break or wiretap their allies and get the location that way.  This is one of those games where you have to actually think and remember. Keep a legal pan and pen on hand; you might need to jolt down a name or faction to look up in their computers to get a location. Then rinse and repeat. Some might think it’s boring and one-note, but I never felt bored by it. There is enough variation that kept me from that. This is one of those games that needs to be revisited and revised. The clock is constantly ticking and each false lead is time taken away as the plot is coming together. The cryptography minigame is a real gem and was what got me interested in ciphers. Ever since, it pains me that such a minigame is never repeated in future “spy/stealth” games since. Another game in the genre, overlooked and obscure, is “Floor 13”. For a Dos game that was about ten megs, I have to wonder why the install files are nearing 200 megs. Weird. Of course, there is no remapping of keys. No mouse support (but still joystick, again, weird).			"

												Maybe the graphics are a bit basic, but that doesn't matter as it's all about the different aspects of being an secret agent, bugging suspects, tailing their cars, snooping through their files and computers, wiretapping their phones, decrypting their secret messages to find enough clues to foil their plans, I loved this when it first came out in the early 90s and have loved it since and I was soo thrilled when it was available on Steam as I have lost the original floppy's.

												And obtuse puzzle game. Want to like it, but it's a game for someone with a ton of patience.Cryptography is not exactly the part of spy stuff I'm interested in. "

												I can only recommend this to players who research vintage games, like myself. $5 is acceptable, but the fun therein is exemptable. For anyone researching what made this game good in its time, I would direct you to look at how resources and time management add an interesting dynamic. Also, the mini games of hacking and cryptography are what made this a great title. I have yet to see other games go to this degree of puzzles and mini games as most mini games are dumb down to include a wider audience. You can also select a variety of automobiles which wasn't done again until Grand Theft Auto. Finally, the atmosphere for espionage is more believable than more modern spy games such as Alpha Protocol. Regardless, if you like spy v. spy style games I think most gamers would have more fun with Alpha Protocol which is also offered on Steam at a higher price, however.			"

												Played this originally on 3.5 floppy disc when it first came out from Microprose. (My 2nd favourite game company which included titles like this and the original X-COM game)Played this for years. Not hours, years. Every year I go back to it. Now it's on Steam. Going back to it again. :)The best espionage game ever made, even though Sid said he didn't like it after he made it because it had too many games rolled into one, but that is what I love about it. You can solve cases many different ways.10/10 (for when it was made, graphics were top of the line, today, people will complain about it)Gameplay is 100% of the best type of spy game.Prepare to have a pen and paper handy, or a notebook, or whatever you want to use to jot down notes because you will need it. You may forget which person is linked to which organization while you are breaking into a safehouse, and you can find the information many different ways in there including using a spy camera, placing bugs (to scan later) or cracking computer passwords to gain info. If you love this sort of thing, this is your game. "
