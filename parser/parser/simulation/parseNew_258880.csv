												Should be titled ""Tractor Driver 2014""...Career mode is just rinse, repeat....no animal dynamics/feeding etc....they just 'exist' in the background ala Agriculture simulator 2011.  To Sum up...Farming Simulator 2013 is the most feature rich, realistic farming Simulator currently released....and that my friends is a sad statement in its self....if you are looking for a simulator...'other than driving a tractor' then this is not for you.Have spent close to 20 Hrs trying to give it a 'chance';I consider this to be just a 3rd rate clone of an actual farm sim...you have to imagine everything...no ACTUAL substance...only the promise of what could be....limited machines, seasons are just for show, yields are the same pretty much no matter what you do...if you already own farm simulator you get nothing new here and less features..just a different view of barns and fields...gonna uninstall and then come back and check it out during the summer sale and see if they added any substance via DLC and able to get it at what it would actually be worth...usually 70-80% off...see you over in Farming Simulator land!

												DO NOT BUY this game. Remember this. The game has potential and is fun for some time, some thing are done really good. The farming is more enjoyable than FS2013, tractor controls are more realistic, physics are better and it has seasons. The map is better, you don't feel so alone. But everything is not done properly and lacks something. Feels like beta.Graphics - it would be good if it would support anti-aliasing and the bloom would be lower. Objects, trees are popping everywhere. sometimes graphics looks very nice. Morning or evening really looks amazing.Gameplay - it gets boring fast, because there's nothing more to do except for plowing/seeding/harvesting. There are animals but you can't interact with them, they just exist and give you some money. Aaaaand there are bugs. Career objectives sometimes do not register when you do them, so either do them again or load the game. And the interface.....all the tractors and equipment are in one place, there are no categories, you need to scroll through everything if you want to find something you need.And the WORST thing. DEVELOPERS ARE CHARGING FOR THE PATCH. Yes for the patch, not ADD-on or DLC but P-A-T-C-H. Soooo if you didn't bought the DLC you do not get the patch for the whole game. And there's absolutely no communication and support from the devs, they just don't care. Please do not support them, do not buy their products.			"

												I PERSONALLY prefer Farming Simulator 2013.In PF 2014 animals just exist and there is no feeding or keeping. Whatever you want to do (buy seeds, equipment, bank) you have to drive.  Driving from one place to the other takes a long time. I feel driving from one place to the other most of the time. Working a field requires plow, cultivate, seeding, fertilizing (optional). In FS2013 normally the fields are already plowed and from one harvest to other you just need to cultivate and seeding (can be done at the same time with proper equipment).I prefer the economic system of FS2013 with the prices tendencies, great demands and different places to sell the goods.I think there are more things to do in FS2013 and more ways to make money. Silage processing, wool selling, mixed rations for cows. In PF2014 with the seasons system I feel in turn based game. Probably seasons are more realistic but I prefer FS way.First farm sim I purchased was Agricultural Simulator. No comment.After that I was thinking between PF2014 and FS2013. I decided to buy PF2014 (full price). Finally I had to buy FS2013 which I prefer.I haven't spent too much time with PF2014 because after purchasing FS2013 I don't want to play PF2014 again. Probably after some further development the situation may change but so far, this is my personal opinion. Regards.			"

												I have a long history with UIG and in all honesty we both(UIG and me) would admit it has not been a great relationship. I was given pre-release access to this game so that, as I quote from UIG ""you will be pleasantly surprised"". Well as I played it....I was pleasantly surprised. You can find a thread labeled 'CE - This game delivers' in the profarm forum if you desire more info into all of that. Now with the review.Technical: Currently at the time of this writing there are about 5 people saying they have bad frame rates. This means this game runs fine for 99% of all buyers. Which when you think about it, is a pretty darn good ratio. No crashes have been reported from what I have seen. From my side of things it has run very well with only some minor technical issues that I would think will be fixed in upcomming patches. These issues include odd and overly bright reflections from the sun at sunrise/set and from headlights. The occasional piece of texture floating a few inches above the ground after plowing (only noticable when you have camera at the right angle. Some controller mapping issues. All in all though no serious techinical glitches or bugs that break gameplay or the fun level.Graphics: Graphics are better than FS13 for comparision. There are seasonal changes and with that the foliage and trees change colors and drop leaves ect. It is this area that you will find the small little glitches like I mentioned above. The skybox is well done, have not seen any weather yet so not sure how well that is done.Playability: The game plays very well. the career mode starts off with a tutorial that takes you through your first year and explains everything like how to use your multi-geared transmissions. Most of the complaints seem to center around these kinds of things. As many players have said why can I only go 24kph, only to get the reply on how to use the gears and achieve 42 kph. So if you do purchase this game, play career at least until the tutorial gets done after the first year. The map is good sized and pretty well done. There are only a single sales spot for crops and bales which is another source of some complaints. I don't mind since in say FS13 you go sell at the best price anyways so in the end your still only selling at one spot most likely. Which leads us to the area this game shines the most. that is farming realism. What I mean by that is with the seasonal structure of the game, the single sales point, the unhurried pace, is more the life of a farmer. I am surrounded by farms in RL and there is only buyer within about 500 mile radius. The seasonal change makes the whole game slower and more relaxed, much like the life of a farmer. Only under extreme situations a farmer might be in a hurry to get something done but the reality is hard work but not necessarily hurried work. Where I find myself in FS13 in a race against..something(time ect). There is no hurry here, no real need to hire helpers even if you own the whole map (although invisible helpers that charge per job are available). Basically it's get up, work til sunset, rinse/repeat. When your work is done you advance the season and start your work again. So maybe more simulation feel? I am sure some out there will not like this in comparision to its rival game. I myself find it a nice fit for a farming game. The equipment is well done on the inside but could use a bit of improvement on the technical/physics side(little things like tires momentarily going in terrain, sliding on a hill a few inches when you come to a stop ect). The amount of equipment is on the smaller end but there is always room for improvement(DLC,maybe modding ability in the future). For the price though there is nothing to complain about as you have everything you need and larger versions to upgrade to. There are 7 crops with one that is a winter only crop(i think) and this one cannot be stored. Crops wheat,barley,canola,corn,soy,peas,luvin. Animals are non interactive and just provide an additonal seasonal income per animal bought. All animal models are well done.Sound: This area could use some improvement. Some sounds are good some not so good so it is a mixed bag. there is a nice sound feature though. When you enter a vehicle your radio starts to play and you can insert your own music with justa little effort(for info on that how to ect see the ""CE - This title delivers' thread I mentioned above. So probably if I were to score this game by catagories this is the one catagory that would have the lowest score.All in all it is a good solid release at frankly a pretty darn good price. The devs at the moment of this review are active and it looks like they have the will and time/money to address issues. Hope this review helps those looking into this game.			"

												Hours and hours of going up and down in fields! What more could you want....maybe if the game would actually work!First of all this is the first time i have ever bought a farming simulator so I havenâ€™t got much to compare it with. The first hour you play is jaw dropping. You got spawned into your lovely farm. complete with a chicken coop stone sheds and a house. I think the whole place looks great! really well designed and created. Then you turn a corner and then say ""oh my god! Itâ€™s a TRACTOR"" you hit the shift key to put your heavy booted farmer into a over excited sprint, get up alongside, hit the enter key and fire her up! You hook up a plough and then out the road to one of your fields for a fantastic day of ploughing!Unfortunately this excitement is very short lived......After about an hour of playing you start to realise that there is one or two things a miss. After the 5th hour most people will surmise that there has been a HUGE amount left out of the game. To name but a few; No Workers. Just mythical pixies that magically transform your fields from different states with only a mouse click...There is uproar about this...You can spend 4 hours preparing fields for harvest only to skip to the next round to find that all your fields have been completely wiped clean. ""No Christmas this year kids...we have been hit by some plague?"" Loading a trailer with bales of hay is nearly impossible. The physics is just all wrongThe map is huge. I mean its whopper big! But it takes about 7 days to get anywhere! It is obvious that this game was rushed and incomplete. I think that it is appalling that this game wasnâ€™t properly tested before launch. Itâ€™s a rip off.I could go on and on. But itâ€™s all been said before. I urge you to check out the forums before you pay for this!!!			"

												This is a good start for a wonderful farming game however it needs much more to be worth your money. Sadly to say farming sim 2013 is better and has more thing to do then this game which is really saying something. To the maker please take some things from farming sim 2013 like saleing equpmient, modding, AND MORE! LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE AND ADD MORE STUFF!!!			"

												A great farming sim, which this is not, would have you do more than drive a tractor from point A to point B in the slowest speeds that are below any real tractor speeds, to do something that sort of resembles farming.Sure, there's great scenery along the way, but none of the buildings are usable or offer any use.  It's not like you can buy them, but what would be the point anyways, they're just part of the landscape.  The livestock is nothing but a non-existant part of the game.  Cattle, chickens, rabbits?  Haven't seen one in the game.  Sure, I've driven to the their respective barns/buildings but that's all you do.Anyways, in the end this game is nothing but a big disappointment.  I wouldn't bother trying the DLC since it would only add more 'nothing' to the game.  Well, you'd get to drive around different equipment I guess but that's all this game turned out to be for me.  A farming equipment driving simulator with LONG, LONG road trips, with very little actual farming happening.Feel free to go through my screenshots of the game which will offer you some visual assistance with what I've said.http://steamcommunity.com/id/warondar/screenshots/?appid=258880&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall "

												Lost the motivation after two hours. There is no need to do anything else in this game then pushing a few buttons to earn money. There is no reason to buy new machines, everything happens instantly. If you are using the machines it takes ages. All in all there is no objective, no goal you want to achieve.			"

												This is NOT an FS2013 clone so if you want a farm tycoon, farm management sim DO NOT BUY. If you want auto everything DO NOT BUY.This game is about BEING a farmer. It's hard graft and can get quite tedious. You do have AI of sorts but it's click-done AI, not a pixel farmer you can follow around.My review gets a + only if you understand that it's about BEING a farmer. If that's what you like, get it. You'll enjoy it.Now to flesh this out.- The graphics are pretty good and on on i7/670gtx, it hums along maxed out at 60 (with vsync). Some of the detail is very well done, albeit with a very Euro flavour.- The tute is on rails and must be followed but once you learn the locations and the techniques it's better to go freeplay.- Tractor driving is very manual and takes some getting used to. NOTE: *Look* at the lower left for how to change the gearbox ratios.  (And reversing is REAL reversing, not just pressing a down key).- Some machines are missing cruise control at time of writing. Missing as in, devs probably assumed it wasn't needed. They were wrong and as far as I know, will change it.CROPS- Limited but enough to keep interest. (and in reality, not all farms can grow all crops anyway)- Seasonal variations (a big feature) in yield work fairly accurately and devs are working on making it better.- Seed prices. Enough to make BEING a farmer worthwhile. ANIMALS- As good as non existent. Worth having for the extra income (3k or so per qtr) but there is no management or husbandry. (and it's incorrect for many to believe all farms have animals anyway - a common complaint. Most ""real"" farms are fairly dedicated enterprises. Such diversity is usually reserved for smaller hobby farms,  certainly in Australia anyway)EQUIPMENT- A bit short in this department (again devs are on it) but there is certainly enough to crop and harvest every field with ease.- The equipment shop is badly designed and laid out (imho) but equipment purchases are close to a one-off in RL anyway.FIELDS- Some nice looking layering is used for the various states and the PDA provides field status etc. as you work.- Crop yields etc. are RT as you harvest (F2 PDA)MAP- Big. Generous number of paddocks. No real monsters but you'll be working really hard if you own even a quarter of them.- Shop to shop transactions. Poorly done. You gotta drive to the bank, the seed shop, the tractor shop manually - everytime. Will devs change this? Unknown but can be very, very tedious. (see gearbox ratios above - take stock of it). OVERALL- A good game for players who like the down and dirty of farming. I reiterate though, if you want an ""auto"" farm managment game, DO NOT BUY. - Scenery is nice, gameplay is consistent. Some glaring anomalies but very easy to forgive.- Sound is pretty ordinary and equipment sounds are pretty lame. No engine load being the biggest let down. It won't take long to despise the music but a few well placed Oggs can fix that. There are some issues, some by poor design, some by poor release. Devs seem to be willing to listen and ready to take on constructive critique.I'd say a price of $20 is reasonable but it's relative. If you're tight for cash but love to farm, wait for the specials.7/10 "

Posted: March 6, 2014
												""5/10. Kinda playable. Best game published by UIG."" According to My Own Rating. (Played ver. 1.017) WARNING: If you haven't played a farming simulator such as farming simulator 2013 (still the best option), or this game's bugged siblings by UIG, make sure you watch some videos before you buy. They're not action games. Don't expect adrenaline rush, or intense experiences or anything happening at all. It's about farming, riding the machines to work the fields. And then hiring someone else to do it for you. Do not expect to be anything more than slightly amused. This is the kind of game you play when you're wondering if you should kill everyone at work/school or just your boss or a specific person. Then you spend hours looking at the calm scenery, listening to the sound of the engines and some soothing music until you're sure you'll make it to the next weekend without killing anyone and feel confortable enough to go play another game.As for Professional Farmer 2014, it fails to meet UIG standards of (lack of) quality, which is awesome. If you ever played other games published by UIG, you probably already associated their logo with frustration. It's pretty much a low quality unfinished alpha version game seal. However, for this game I only had a graphical bug that was fixed following the forum recommendation. No crashes, only a few minor bugs, some annoyance. No major issues. In other words, the game is pretty playable. On the other hand, being playable doesn't mean it's good. The game also fails to deliver most of what was promised. The game save folder can reach a few GBs mark so I'm guessing they really planned on doing all they promised. At least they're storing all the data they'd need for it. But it doesn't seem to have been implemented. And, no one would ever expect this from a game related to UIG, they've announced a DLC/Deluxe version that promises to do all those things this game promised but didn't deliver! Yeah, right... I'm pretty sure this time it will be for real. They'd never keep selling dlcs, special editions and new yearly version of the game until people stop buying and they have to relabel (Agricultural simulator, anyone?)...What they did deliver:Career Mode - It's actually a several hours long tutorial. For the first 5-10h the game will use season advance on its own and you can't hire people to do your work for you. That means you'll have to do all the work on your fields and your neighbour's. The tasks are set up in a very annoying system of waypoints that prevent you from picking the best path for the 20min long trip to the store or the bank. It's not worth doing what you haven't been told to. Chances are the game will send you back there to do what has already been done and make you waste time riding the tractor around. And you can't refuse to help your neighbour. You can steal his crops when he hires you to harvest, though. Anyways, on career mode everything happens extremely slowly. If you're new to farming simulators, it will likely take 6-8h of gameplay until you're able to harvest your first field.Free mode - No restrictions on how you play. That means you can do everything yourself almost roleplaying mode like in the career mode and spend a few weeks (rl time) getting the fields ready before you click next or you can just hire people to instantly do the setting up and skip to the next season (the only thing you can't hire people to do is fertilizing). The game can be anything from a few dozen clicks and then skip until harvest for a few more clicks to hundreds of hours of gameplay bewfore you're able to harvest.The seasons system actually made the game turn based. You click to skip to the next one when you're done setting up your fields. It does seem to make a difference on your yield. If you keep track of your yield, you'll come up with a rotation. Then you'll drop it because it doesn't really matter if you can get a better yield of a less valuable crop. The crop rotation doesn't seem to make much of a difference. Especially for the Lupin part. As for the animal husbandry, it's pathetic. You buy the animals and get some income everytime you click skip. You can see them, but there's no possible interaction. Also, they don't breed. You have to refill them from time to time.The challenge:The game is soooo challenging. You'll feel the urge to quit it but if you persist you can do pretty much anything and it will work out fine. You can start by rushing to the bank to get the highest loan possible, and to the store to buy all the animals the game lets you buy. That's it. You win. Your assests will increase like 2k each time you skip. If you want to play the rest of the game, with the remaining money you can buy the two largest fields and hire workers to plow, cultivate and sow soy on all your fields. To do that you should abandon your tractor at the store and teleport home to your other tractor. You can fertilize the nearby fields or just skip until fields are ready to be harvested. Then you hire people to harvest everything. Then skip back to spring and repeat until you have plenty of money to buy more of the larger fields. Repeat the process, maybe buy a faster tractor to ride to new fields. If you feel like trying the hard work, buy the best machinery and work the nearby small fields. Done.Minor Bugs:*Missing crops. Sometimes the game will lose track of fields (resetting to 0%). This may lead to losing the plowed pct info, the cultivated pct info, the sowed pct info or all of them. Which is an absolutely lovely thing to happen if you've done all the work on the field by yourself (2-12h rl time wasted). It's just a small annoyance if you're hiring people to do the slower tasks for you.*GPS and Map blackout at night. Yup. They both depend on sunlight to work properly. At night, you can only see crops due to their natural bioluminescence.*Closing menu. The menu will close when you hire workers for a task. This can't possibly have been designed this way. I refuse to believe anyone would be this stupid. It takes 3 key presses and 9 clicks to set up a field before you skip to the next season. And then another key press and 3 clicks to harvest. Anyways... since you're probably not going to want just a few fields, it scales up to hundreds of clicks per season. The ui is supposed to be well designed. If they didn't want the possibility for quick progress in the game, they shouldn't have hired work finish instantly. Maybe add a timer and worker queue if they don't want quick progress. But, nope. It's not worth clicking that much on a farming simulator.TL;DR: The game is playable. They finally completed Agricultural Simulator 2011/2013 (although the animal husbandry was better at the bugged unfinished siblings). It's almost 60% as good as their competitor's FS2013 (except for the appearance that is actually better than fs). If you really want the game, wait until they release the dlc/deluxe version to see if they delivered what was promised when they launched the professional farmer 2014.			"

												For now i cant recommend this game... Its just stupid that the maker of this game had released this game very to quick..The game wasnt finished when it was released.. Really a shame!!.The game have to much bugs in it, vehicles / equipment selling / buying goes on a very poor quality menu..It could be like more on Farming simulator 2011 / 2013.. I have all the three games so i can give my opinion on this game..FS 2013 looks in quality more better, but its getting to boring soon.. Dont like the system of buying seed in FS2013, cant upgrade the silos in FS2013, graphics in FS2013 looks to kiddy to me( i like to see more realism in graphics)So PF2014 have quality items in it: Buying seed, Buying manure, you have a shed to store bales in it. I like that the vehicles are washable, and that you need to buy a big stock of petrol on the gas station to refill the gastank on your farm... Those things make a farm sim more enjoyable.. FS2013 is just boring on the longer playtime, dont like the mods on FS2013.. They make the game less quality (because there is no standard that people need to guide to.) Then you getting bad quality mods in the game... So overall its an ok game if you look to the basics... But its needs more improvement and bug fixes..So i cant recommend it for now.. UIG isnt very help full on their forums.. Trying to get my account enabled.. PMed Heini two times, looks like they blind or so.. So they arent customer minded..			"

												After spending some time on this game and a long time Farming simulator player i have found this game to be fun and entertaining. The game looks great and runs great with little to no lag (FS2013 lags more witch is saying somthing as it dosnt lag much at all). The game has a few bugs that are to be excpected in the early release of the game. Looking are the past of UIG and the other games they have made it is a major improment in the level of game and a nice job by the developers who are behinde the core of this game. I recormend this game for any simulator fan out there and I will enjoy this along with my normal simulators I play. Good work cant wait to see where this game go's.			"

												You would think that in the year 2014â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥like this would never see the light of day, and to charge $20.00 for a game like this should be a crime.  I've played Farming Simulator 2013 and it gets old really fast lack of options and detail are bad. But this game went something like this:  enter tractor hold down gas pedel for 2 hr's (no cruise and max speed 24kh) go to machinery store check out limited machines, go to bank borrow 250,000E, go to another place of interest on map, ""nothing there"". head home, buy up all the fields on the way home some allready planted some not, by the time i'm back at home base i have about 25k euros left, that included buying 20 cows, 50 chickens and 50 ducks max limit on them all. (I have no control whatsoever with any livestock just pay for them and there milk, eggs, and ducks sell automaticlly every session) and buying a weather station, completly pointless and useless. and upgrading my silos wich is kinda cool but pointless cause everything you grow with a worker sells automaticly..... So now i'm standing in one place hiring workers who plow, cultivate, plant, and harvestâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥instantly. (no hiring to fertilize has to be done manualy but it doesn't have to be done) and it takes me a little over 20 minutes to get my bank back up to 100k just standing in one place never looking at a field or getting in a tractor feeding the ckickens or cows or ducks or purchasing one peice of equipment.......I would rate this game out of 10 stars: minus 50 by far the bigest wast of gaming money I ever spent.

												It should be called ""Very slow and boring driving simulator"" I am disappointed about this game :( Most of time spent in this game I was driving from one point to another very big distances with very slow vehicle and it is very boring. To go to market for seeds you need spend a lot of time just driving very slow. Same thing to go to bank for loan. They should have gave you a car with faster speed or just fast travel option trough map what by-passes that driving and then you could have to spend more time doing field works. Also lack of animal variety.			"

												Shadows on, all else off. All other options low.Couldn't even run this trucker at 40 fps. Got seriously much better performance out of F1 2014!Time to uninstall and fill my hdd and time with better stuff.Update 2016-07-30 0019hrsOk so i'm a little hasty, i think 40 fps is quite good 'coz i've been spoilt by Codemasters efficient game engine or coding. This i realized after playing Farm Machines Championships 2014. Both games use the same interface in their respective launchers and both performed at the same level but this game has a few more extra options.Because i enjoyed FMC2014 even though the frame rates is similar, i decided to try this again. FMC2014 is way simpler; you have farming tasks, among other things, but you gotta do it fast in a competitive way. It coudn't be easier.This one, from the trailer and screenshots, looks like it has more depth. I like both FMC2014 and PF2014 now and am gonna give this game a fair chance. It may not be as efficient as most games but it's very much playable; only drawback is that when the game recorder is running i get 20 fps less so i have to scale down my expectations. Of course this less than stellar frame rates is also due to this game running on my potato chips rig of i72630QM and Radeon HD 6770m with 1 GB DDR5. Had to run it at 800x600 to be able to play and record at the same time, otherwise 720p is still playable.Worth a buy when it's on offer and especially so if you get it in a bundle. I got this in a bundle for on USD1.99 for 12 simulators, definitely worth a buy and worth a try: https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/sims-mega-bundleFrom the above bundle, i already enjoyed playing Woodcutter, Airport and Warehouse & Logistics simulators and i'm happy with that purchase. Where else can you find similar uncommon titles? Granted not all of them will be good but 3 out of 12 ain't bad for me. Your satisfaction level will vary of course. For me it was worth a little risk. So as of this update, i'm giving this game a recommendation, though a cautious one. General score at this time would be 5/10. Hope to write more as i discover more about the game.Update 2016-07-30 0308hrsAt approximately 1.9 hours of playtime i'm beginning to like it now. Everything seems to be in order.			"

												Playing Professional Farmer 2014 since Christmas. Some glitches along the way but with adequate developer response I think. The lack of complete controller mapping and a limited fuel, fertilizer and seed acquisition system are the most negative for me.  If I purchase all the fields, I should be able to use every farmhouse, etc. I am Glad I bought Farming Simulator 2013 yesterday when it was on sale for $8.39 as I thought it may be better. I am sure it will be fun but a tour around the map and quick use of some of the equipment gave me a real appreciation of Professional Farmer 2014. FS2013 did have some of the features I wish PF2014 had like thorough controller mapping and more plentiful supply acquisition locations but the lesser equipment/landscape detail, ambiance and immersion quality is immediately apparent.A hint for new or frustrated farmers who are not bootstrappers for getting started:Play the career mode to acquaint yourself with the nuances of PF2014.Move to free play, drive to the bank and borrow 250,000 euros.Drive north from the bank and buy the two largest fields, 8.06 & 7.06 hectares. (Fields #1 and #2 for me)Drive home and purchase 19 more cows, 45 more hens and 50 ducks from the Ag store menu.The new fields are already plowed, cultivated and sown, turn the season until the crops are ready to harvest (check by hovering the harvest selection over the fields). Use the workers menu to harvest the 8.06 and 7.06 fields as soon as they are not too young.Your seasonal yield from 20 cows, 50 hens and 50 ducks will be 3,600 euros and your bank note will be 1,050 euros making a seasonal profit of 2,550 euros on your animals.Check your animal population at each turn (F3), purchase more from the Ag store as soon as you lose one. Add a cow when at 19, 5 hens at 49 and 5 ducks at 49 (maximum will be 20 cows, 54 hens and 54 ducks with your seasonal profit more with the extra hens and ducks)After the first harvest of the 8.06 and 7.06 hectare fields, turn your seasons a full year to early spring.Plow, cultivate and sow the 8.06 and 7.06 hectare fields via workers. (make sure you rotate crops in subsequent sowings, I go down the list in the workers menu. Some crops are more profitable).As you worker manage the big fields you can use your equipment to plow, cultivate and sow the two small fields that were part of your farm. Harvest them using the worker menu until you have enough money to buy the Massive Combine, Grain Heder and Corn Heder.Your animal husbandry and workers will generate wealth to start your crop farming quicker.Repeat this cycle until you accumulate enough wealth to purchase the equipment and fields that you desire. Make sure you will have adequate worker funds remaining before purchasing additional equipment or fields.I highly recommend Professional Farmer 2014.Grow something.			"

												What a HUGE let down this game turned out to. I use the term lightly; expecting the game to shine brightly after the very popular farming sims of past. Yet this was not the case and I took certain factors for granted when I bought it. One of them was the driving; anyone who releases a game that involves driving and then skips any support or settings for a steering wheel what so ever should be shot in my opinion. No settings at all in fact and if you try to set up your wheel useing the wheels profiler, you will end up with some very unplesent effects. The problems mounted when trying to steer at all and was left frustrated after 2 days of problem searches on the internet. You seem to have fewer controls than The last games too, so less to think about and do!So I have not been able to play it yet, I was told to try using an xbox controller and when you start the game your given an option to choose the controller and so via ""The BIG PICTURE"", you enter the game to find the controls reverting to the keyboard and with no support for any manual settings at all, what a total waiste of money.On starting the game the first buttons you should see were missing for me, so a re-start already! The landscape has been made to look bright and cheery when you start, nothing wrong with that if you like over saturated autom colors. I could see alote of gaps in the geometry and the road patterns did not line up properly. Even the tractor models were of a very low quality with graphics set to the highest. I thought the realisum in this game was lacking, so living into the role might prove  difficult for some. To summerize.An attempt to make a fast buck here and nothing more, a cheap looking alfa, that has been packaged to look like a finished game that you canÂ´t play. If you want to use a keyboard for a sim thats about 95% driving, then you are better off playing Pacman. I managed to let off some steam here at least (no punn intended) and can not recomend this in itÂ´s current state.			"

A definite step in the right direction for UIG. It may not be the most robust of simulations, but updates have added a number of improvements and even a little content along the way. For a new IP (although it is admittedly very similar to Agricultural Simulator) it is a great starting point. I am very interested to see where this game goes in the future. For $20, I have to say it is worth the purchase if you enjoy games like this.			"

												I am a big fan of Farming Sims, but I was hoping for more than is offered in PF14. Graphics are great, seasons are plus, and the list of equipment without DLC is great, but... there is really nothing new here. I was excited about the campaign mode, but it didn't really add to the experience. I gave up after 5 hours of play. The game has potential, but it currently doesn't match the gameplay and features of its competition.			"

												I found this game in my library and thought let's play it. So I installed the game and started it. My first problem was this game took my intel graphics card (first game that chooses this one instead of the nvidia card). So I changed this and restarted the game. I started the career mode and I had to plow my field when I did that I had to cultivate it. When I did that as well I had to go out to buy some seeds. So I followed the circles allong the road. In my opinion that was pretty annoying. Why didn't the developers choose to just draw a line to were you need to go? All right on my way back home a friend and I wondered what would happen if I would collide with another vehicle. The next thing that happend was that I drove over another car. Pretty strange.When I arrived home I just wanted to sow my field. Only the game thought nope, you are going to plow your neighbours field. When I did that I also had to cultivate it. When I was done doing that I could finally sow my own field. You are never going to guess what I had to do next. Indeed I had to sow my neighbours field. So I started doing that. When I was almost finished sowing the field, my sower got empty. So I drove back home to get some more seed. And when I came back the field was reset. At that point I quitted the game. Oh and I almost forgot to mentoin that if you want to drive inbetween trees, that is not possible because there is not enough room even though you can see there is.			"

												Absolute rubbish.  The game is rather choppy. Even the mouse cursor moves as though you're trying to move it through molasses in January.There are no tutorial ""missions"" within the game to help new players figure out what they need to do. Instructions, such as they are, are vague and/or incomplete.  For example: Plow field.  Simple enough, right?  One would hope so, but no.  Once you're in the field, you're left scratching your head over how to get the plow into the ground. Likewise with ""Get in the tractor"".  I circled all around the tractor, pressing every key on my keyboard as I went.  Nothing.  I only found my way into the tractor by accident - I quit the game, but when I went to play it again I was somehow magically already in the tractor.  Can I get out?  Who knows?  And more importantly, who cares?			"

Horrible game just driving around in a tractor and nothing else.The fields are too large and you can't hire a worker to do some stuff to, however in Farming Simulator 2013 you can just go ahead find a field grab the tool and hire a worker, then while he's working for you just go ahead and do what you want like go sell your grains or something good and worth while unlike what you can do in this game. Professional Farmer 2014 is just horrid and should be renamed Tractor Simulator 2014. Just Horrid.			"

If I had to rate it out of ten, I'd probably give it a 6.5-7.5 so hopefully that gives you all some idea of if you'd like the game.I recieved this key from the Steam Group: Accidentally Reviewed.

												I never thought I like this game but .. wow.. the depth. so many vehicles and tools to play with just amazing detail graphics. so glad i pick this up on the bargain bin for 5 bucks.  best buy ever.  same thought I have when I first bought Euro truck simulator 2, I mean really.. never imagine the thing that p*ss you off while driving on the road big slow taking all the lanes can be a one enjoyable game.  had to verify install. to fix the crazy lag. after that went to the main folder and activate the dirext x to install from there. and couple of verifying files from steam, no more lag. just pure awesome graphics.

												This game is good and realistic but WARNING: it is very tedious and to many it may come across as boring. The tasks in the game are very repetetive (but then farming itself is supposed to be like that). Game progress is also slow and takes lot of patience. It is great for relaxation but is not suitable for quenching the need to finish lot of accomplishments in a very short span of time. You need to have patience with this game.- It has good interesting landscape and the environment does not seem very lonely as other tractors and farmers will be seen moving around- Graphics optimization could have been better though; it is not very good and is a bit glitchy. Overall, one should try this out if you are into farming sims. It has nice features and is different from other farming sims. So the experience is worthwhile if you are fan of farming sims.			"

												Hmm, it is brutally slow like real life farming (yes I've done it). There are a lot of missing configuration items like inverting mouse and whatnot. Otherwise it works OK. Do NOT skip a waypoint for a mission. It does not autoupdate to the destination if you take a shortcut. PF2014 is extremely sensitive to Steam updates. If your game is running very slow (~5 fps), drop out and make sure Steam isn't whining for an update.There are a few let's plays to show you equipment options (rather thin), seed options (about six or seven) and animal options (only 3). No workers, etc. So far it's basically an Agricultural Simulator without the terrible bugs and such. I do NOT like the way a field updates to the next stage at 95% (like Agrar Sim) and you aren't penalized for missing spots, etc. like in FS series. As long as you get to 95% completion of each stage of farming (plow, cultivate, seed, fertilize) it gives you the fixed total yield for the whole field.			"

												I like this game, but it is a budget game and very limited in scope.  You will find yourself repeating the same process over and over again: plow, cultivate, plant, fertilize, advance 'season', harvest, repeat.  Don't expect much variety other than a small variety in plant types all of which are harested with the same machinery except corn which needs a different header and hay which needa a forlift, baler, and trailer.There are also some basic features missing from the game.  The button configuration menu is very limited as is controller support.  You sell your grain at a single location with no foreknowledge of what you will get for it.  Hiring workers  is done instantly (you never see them working) with a pop-up on the screen saying the work was done.  At this time there is no official modding.There are a number of additional features of the game that are stripped down or missing entirely.  It feels like they started the game by making the graphics engine and driving physics and then found out that the budget was actually 25% what it was supposed to be and development time was cut by the same amount.

												After reading the awesome game description below, i decided to buy this instead of the other farming game, oops! I wish this was the game they describe below, but so far i have seen its not even close. Firstly, ""starting with a small estate"" i thought that i could buy a bigger one later, wrong. ""Planning by season""? i am not a farmer in real life, i actually know almost nothing about it, so i was kind of depending on the ""expert knowledge"" that isnt in the game. I dont know what to do with the combine tools FF DF PF? Guess i will have to google them as there is no way to learn what i need to know in the game. ""Crop rotation""? guess i will have to google that too, because your on your own after the first year where your only growing wheat. ""Care for animals""? no, you just buy them for a return at each change of season. There are cows, ducks and hens. ""Countless tractors""? well i can do that for you, 8. There are 5 combines and a sprayer too. I have only played 32 hours so far, maybe things will change with updates, but please stop making this game seem more than it is. I payed $19.99 for the game described below, but what i got is totally diferent    UPDATE; i am changing my recomendation to a positive one, after buying the Americsn DLC this game got 100x better, there is more equipment of every type and even tho i still wish there was a guide for crops and equipment, and the game still has a ton of bugs, it is still real fun to play, i think i am getting addicted somehow.

												I had decent Hopes for this game but it fails for me on many levels. It does do some new things such as having seasons but they don't seem to have any effect that I have been able to observe. The interface is limited and making purchases of any type  requires driving all over the map to each individual store. The machine and implement selection is very limited with ne apparent partnership support. Hiring workers is like sprinkling magic pixie dust to achieve goals as you can literally stand by a field and watch it instantly change ploughed, cultivated and seeded status mere seconds after ""hiring"" a worker to perform a task. Other games in the genre do this far better as they require you to own the necessary equipment and it takes the workers the same amount of time as it would for you to do the task. Hiring workers should be about performing multiple tasks at once not wishing them done. No multiplayer support and no apparent mod support. Not a pleasurable experience. If you want to play a better game then get Farming Simulator 2013.Addendum: Or get Farming Simulator 15. Giants seems to have a lock on making playable and enjoyable farm simulators.			"

The game lags like nothing I've ever seen before and there have been multiple accounts of people complaining about not being able to enter or exit any vehicles. Wasn't it brilliant of the developer to release this game without a key rebind for entering and exiting vehicles? I bought this game a month before it released, in anticipation that it would be something great. I was sadly disappointed. $25 down the drain for a game that doesn't even work.			"

												This game is very realistic, farming is just as hard in the game as you would expect it to be in real life. Personally, I got bored of it after spending at least 15 minutes ploughing less than a quarter of a field, it takes a lot of time and effort to successfully prepare a field to have crops planted on it. If you are considering investing into this game then make sure that you are a patient person, I am fairly patient myself, but I couldn't sit down for about an hour just to plough a field knowing that when I finish I would then have to do it all again to plant the actual crops. The thing that annoyed me the most is that when I stopped ploughing and exited my tractor, I couldn't do anything until I completed my current objective which was to plough the field. I really wanted to look at the hens and buy another cow, but I must have still been doing the tutorial.This game is a decent buy for those who like simulator games, but if you have never played one before, like myself, then I would not recommend buying it. It is harder than it looks trying to keep the tractor straight and I would rather spend an hour playing something more fun and enjoyable.			"

												Clunky clone of Farming Simulator with some interesting additions that could have been much better enacted. I have played over 200 hours on FS2011 and 2013 and was looking forward to perhaps experiencing something fresh and different gameplay ideas. Sadly it was not to be. What I got was a poor imitation of FS2013 that despite looking pretty, laced any significant difference to the more mature game. Sure, the idea of seasons, having to change gears and diminishing yeilds seems like a good idea but that's about it. Whilst I have some gripes about the realism of farming in FS2013, this game is worse. My biggest complaint is having to drive everywhere in order to achieve anything meaningful such as order seed, fertiliser, visit the bank or trade equipment. Really? Not heard of telephone or internet? These types of gameplay functions should be handled by drop down menus. If you are going to force players to travel to do these things, at least give them the same busted up old car/pickup that all dirt poor farmers use!!! In addition, (and this is a criticism that holds for FS2013 as well), if you are going to have an expansion that deals with ""large area"" farming such as USA or Australia then at least provide a disc plough not some tiny 2.5 metre Euro plough that is just NOT used in reality.

												They rebranded and renamed Ag Simlator and pushed out this turd. Then now I herd they did same thing with this game again for 2015. So was it worth the buy? No. More bugs then any game should have upon release. Rude customer services back when it was Ag simulator. Wasted my money. Want more of the same buy Farm Expert 2016 which is this game with very little graphic improvement. Want a better game? Get Farming Simulator 2015 by Giants. Least they have mods and decent controller support and better costumer service.			"

												The game is good however if you are looking for variety I would choose Farming Simualtor over this but this game does have the graphics side which are pretty good for a simulator. Tractor and other implement chocies are very limited that maybe also in Farming Simulator but there are hundreds of mods to chose from where this game has only 5-10 mods so i wouldn't recommend this game entirely except for the graphics.

												This is a bad copy of farming simulator.  You can't exit a vehicle to continue the tutorial if you remap your keys, so do not remap the keys.  You will be stuck.  You can hire workers to do most of the work for you, and the work completes instantly so you don't really have to do much which takes away from the game, you don't even need the equipment to hire workers to do the work.

												Maybe I missed something about the appeal of this game, but as far as I could tell it essentially consists of driving a tractor around on grass-colored ice for ten hours at a time.With the amount of time it takes to farm virtual crops in this game you could literally actually grow crops in real life.If I had to rate it though on how accurately it is a simulator for farming, I'd have to give it 10/10. I used to live/grew up on a farm, and this is about how it goes. Though you spend less time digging goat droppings out of your boots in this game. Not sure if I should count that as a plus or not.

												How can this even be sold? the interface is incomplete and annoying, the physics are barely functional, the game is horrible in every aspect. Semi tractor's can't articulate the trailer more than 30 degrees, vehicles take a while to get to speed and stop instantly the moment you let off the acceleration key.. it's just stupid. Get Giant's Farming Sim 2015/2017. Much better.			"
