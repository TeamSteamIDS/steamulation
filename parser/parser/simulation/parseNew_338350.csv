												So far I played the 3 tasks or so in the tutorial. I recommend doing the tutorial first. The game seems pretty decent so far. There are a variety of buildings to choose from and they interact together. You design the farm areas, satisfy your guests, and they buy different products which help you make money. All the animals and guests have various needs.There are some different maps to choose from, and the mape size seems ok; although it could be bigger. I did just find one 'large' size map which I'm going to try now; it did look like it's a pretty good size.For the price I'd say pick it up; I'm still learning all the game has, but it's pretty fun so far.

												Not that bad, though I have not played that long. I could see it getting pretty repetitive placing the same things over and over. Not that many things to do, but if its updated frequently with better changes it might be great.			"
