												When I first saw this game released on Steam, my inner child squeaked of excitement: finally a MMO in which you can play as a teddy bear, how awesome is this!!! Five minutes after I started the game, the enthusiasm was replaced by a huge disappointment because I realized it's a game heavily based on micro transactions despite the fact that it is advertised as free to play on the store page. It is free to play indeed, but only until you reach level 10 (out of 50 currently possible); after that you need a monthly subscription to progress further. I decided to pay for 1 month, because I wanted to explore the whole content and maybe reach the end game.The target audience being mostly children, this game was designed to be very accessible and enjoyable for kids. The story is very simplistic: you need to protect the world from Queen Vexa and her minions called Nix. There is no actual combat; “fighting” is done by running over the minions. The graphics are cute and very colorful and the fact that there is no violence in this game turns the gameplay into a very optimistic and positive experience for a kid. But if you’re an adult, you’re probably going to feel out of place (don’t read: “pedophile”), both because of the simplistic nature of the game and because of the community.Half of the gameplay consists in completing quests for the NPCs, which in turn award you with experience and some silver coins that you can spend in the game shop to buy decorative items for your personal home. Each quest is a mini game of different sorts: either a jigsaw puzzle, or driving a car and collecting items, or some very basic platforming bits and many others. There are some group activities as well, in which you need to collect things or run over the enemies. The quests are very repetitive and become boring very fast. There’s no difference in being level 50 or level 10, except for the fact that some of the items from the shop are locked for lower levels. So in my opinion, there’s no reason or motivation to pay for a subscription and level all way up to 50.The other half of the gameplay consists in gathering numerous collectible items. And here’s the catch: you can obtain around 75% of them from the shop or from the group activities, but for the other 25% you need some special in-game currency (gold coins) that is purchased with real money only. Of course, each of these collections is linked to a Steam achievement, so if you want to go for 100% achievements, be prepared to throw big money at them. This was one of the things that set me back a lot, since I consider that a game that offers special items for real money should at least be free of charge (no subscription needed). Or if a subscription is required, then this special currency should also be obtainable through other means in game, without having to pay for it (unless you really want to do so). Even more so, I consider that the achievements for these collections, which can be completed only by spending $10-$20 on each, should be completely banned from Steam. Until recently there was no way to obtain these gold coins by only playing the game without a subscription; however, since they increased some of the prices a lot and added many new special items, they decided to add to the group events some occasional rewards consisting in very small amounts of this currency. For every group event you are now eligible to obtain 20-50 gold coins, which means that you need to participate in hundreds of these events, bordering to 1000 for a couple of achievements, and all this assuming that you get something every time you play. This is practically a sad and lame joke from Ganz’ part.Bottom line: I don’t recommend this game since its sole purpose is to drain your wallet. And don’t show it to your little kids either, since they’ll probably start begging you to buy them silly things that cost a lot of money.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

So, where is the problem?It is supposed to be F2P, but when you reach level 10 it says that you need a membership to level up and reach higher levels and a lot of objects in the world shop are for members only.So this game is like: ""Hey i give you drugs for free!""

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												On the Seventh day, God rested. And on the eighth, he created Amazing World. That's right, this game came straight out of the fingertips of God himself. Here is my review of the holy artifact known as ""Amazing World.""The game opens up on a revolutionary new order of events in the story. You create a character and do the tutorial BEFORE you create an account. That's right, BEFORE. AS IN NOT AFTER. I began to cry at this point in the game, my heart could barely handle it. The gameplay rivals that of any AAA title. It exceeds it, this is a AAAAAAABaaAA title. Thats 11 A's and a B. Thats like a 3.85 GPA or something. That will get you into college. But why go o college when you could play this game instead?This games graphics made my GTX 420 and my Intel 69-core procesor begin to smoke/melt/condensate into rainbows and glitter, which made this game look like even more of a blessing to the human eyes. My cat walked in, saw this game and turned into a griffon. Here are my pros and cons of this game:Pros: -Cured my cancer-I now have apet griffon-I left my family to play this game-I self-amputated and sold my legs on ebay to play this game- I am always turnt thanks to this gameCons:-There are only 24 hours in the day to play this game:( not enuff-needs to be added to EVO in 2015A list of things this game is better than: HitlerStalinMaoWest Nile DiseaseThe KKK9/11Saddam HusseinYolo and SwagDead or AliveDark SoulsCODBF4The Homosecksual agendaSo overall, This game is a solid 420/69., It taught me how to Be Faze clan MLG quickscope420. - A Review bySouthern Home Magazine			"

												Definitely a good children's introductory MMO game. Kids would be introduced to the world of quest grinding which involves loooots of running around and occasionally play simple platform-type and other various minigames. There are a number of co-op/team play features and it involves..... more running around (yay). I'm not kidding. You will be spending 80% of the time running around to level up. Because violence is a no no ;D. The remaining 20% of the time would be either playing those minigames or customising your garden and home.I'm not recommending it because firstly, you need to pay a monthly fee to get past level 10. I suppose the first 10 levels could serve as a demo for this ""free to play"" MMO. But I'm sure there are other better and more ""educational"" games out there than this one. Or you could just get your children to play in real life~			"

												Just a heads up. This game has a premium currency called e-Store points in trade for your real cash. Available in separate packages shown here: http://www.ganzestore.com/estore/catalog/points , or with a membership purchase you can gain set amounts per month. In 2015 Ganz also added the option to win small random amounts from Team Play (mini games) which will no doubt take a lot of real time but requires no extra cash. Moving on. If you are downloading this for your child it is a cute starter MMO and they will likely enjoy the bright cheerful characters and colorful world with no questions asked. If you are a teen+ who enjoys cute games its a fun way to kill some time with casual games and quests but you might find it all becomes repetitive. And without paying for a membership it can feel pointless as you can't increase your level passed 10 out of 50 levels.Achievement Hunters Be Warned: It feels like this game could be attached to your Steam Wallet as Ganz has started pushing the in-game collections (which double as steam achievements) to require premium currency. Or just invest a lot of time with the option to win at team play to gradually chip away at the collections that require premium currency to purchase. - April 2016 update - At this time Ganz might have seen the light. The last collection to double as an achievement that I noticed was October of 2015 as my Comments below show. Just hope to see this continue so the buying/spending premium currency feels more optional as it should. I mostly wrote this review because even if it fell on deaf ears I felt gamers need to start speaking up against sucking our purses dry. Also not wanting to see this trend in Amazing World continue with more future collections requiring premium currency. Which I will note in the Comments of this review.Despite the negative reviews saying it was not free to play as advertised it was cute so I gave it a try. I had a positive review up until the Sushi update in May, 2015 which began a trend of releasing collections requiring e-Store (micro transaction) purchases to complete. Previously items were won in Team Play games, Karma's Wheel, and purchased with common coin purchases. A rare few were also Moneyz which were earned from opening pages on their website[www.ganzworld.com].At some point in 2015 I feel greed hit with new staff and I should have realized something was up when extra spins on Karma's Wheel increased from 100 to 500 premium currency. Unfortunately I didn't until the new collection (and also achievement) ""All You Can Eat"" came up and requires 10,000 premium eStore Points to buy 3 sushi items in the World Shop. It has no place being a steam achievement without a second option in my opinion. I guess the option is the introduction of earning a very small amounts if you manage to win at Team Play. But just to put things in perspective. I won 45 eStore Points playing Groggy team play. So give or take if you were lucky enough to win every time and get that amount. I would have to play and win 223 times to finish that one new achievement. - But my next win was only 25...which would make it 400 wins to get the needed amount. - My third win I got zero eStore Points. On the positive side. Their Customer Service when using the Ganz web form has been outstanding. When I first found AW I paid for a year membership and that gives 5,000 eStore monthly. However, I had a glitch that it didn't automatically happen so I would have to contact them to get it, and the reply always pretty fast. - On Oct 15, 2015 CS said this was resolved.			"

												At first i was expecting  wWorld of Warcraft killer and then i realised that this game is changing the meta of standard MMOs. At the start of the game i chose my class which was Yellow Bear didnt see any skills but i was happy with choice the leveling system is pretty unique. You dig holes and pick up fruit and leve up its genius Blizzard take notes plz.The graphics are on point and the 5 second opening cutscene took my breath away. I was spooked by the plot of *removed for spoilers* Trust me Witcher 2's graphics look absolute garbo compared to this work of art.The music has been made by artists such as Skrillex, Deadmau5 and some nursery rhymes by 2pac and Biggie Smalls. I did think i heard some DMX in the login screen but i dunno its pretty hype doe not gonna lie. DMX dlc plzOk now onto the meat of the review, the combat system. This where Blizzard should be taking the most notes. Remember when i chose the yellow bear as my class ? Yh i didnt realise how kush his abilities were he can summon dark masters from within the earth and call the undead to fight for him but i opted into just running into them and getting points in their World events. They much better than that crappy MMO Guild Wars 2 (only when you compare it to this 11/10 game)The Ui is also a great aspect of the game not cluttered random skills and chat. Oh the chat is hard my mum didnt get the email so in couldnt use the chat soz guys.But this game is the Best MOBA I have ever played 8/8 gr8 b8 m8. PS did i say you can buy afros in the game because dam. If you wanna hear the soundtrack

												I don't even think this deserves to be on Steam.First, it's not even F2P. It's a bit like Club Penguin, in CP you pay to get upgrades and items to wear and different coloured pets and stuff like that. Personally don't see too much of a problem as long as children aren't stealing credit cards to pay, but in CP, you can play for however long as you like for free with the only limitations being you can't wear certain items/obtain them. Plus both Amazing World and Club Penguin are aimed at children. After Level 10 of Amazing World, you can't earn xp or do much because most of the quests require Level 13 or above. You CANNOT level up without PAYING A SUBSCRIPTION TO BE A MEMBER. That is NOT F2P.The missions are just the same things over and over, run to speak to this person, pick up things in that corner of the game, a small platformer type of game then TP back to the quest-giver. It's just that over and over, there's no creativity in the missions.The description does not mention that it is capped at level 10. It's a misleading pile of bull. It shouldn't be on Steam and deserves to stay on it's own website. I would not recommend parents get this for their children, I wouldn't recommend a child getting it for their parents, I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE... or $30 for 12 months access to level up, wear clothing and do quests if you really want to repeat gameplay and missions.

												It's like Webkinz and Club Penguin, but it's much deeper. It offers a rich and original story, and innovative gameplay.When you first launch it, it may seem intimidating, but as you delve deeper, it becomes a lot easier to understand. This game does not hold your hand the whole time in that it offers no tutorial, so the learning curve is a bit high for someone who doesn't play many action games such as this, but it's worth it once you learn how to play. The controls are fairly simple, too.It also offers a fully fleshed out combat system. It'll be amazing when the game eventually gets VR capabilities.All in all, it's a fun game, hundreds of hours of enjoyable gameplay. It's definitely worth it to pay the monthly fee of $3.99 to get the full experience of the game.			"

												The game advertises itself as a f2p game, and sure, initially, once you start the game everything is fine. There are certainly some items that cost real money to unlock but that's understandable for a game that needs to sustain itself.Then you find out that private chat requires a membership. Okay, that's not TOO bad cause you can just talk in public with your friends right?Then, you realise some skills are locked, so you cannot do all the quests that paid members can. Still, that's entirely understandable. So, you miss out on certain content but you get to enjoy a majority of it right?Wrong. Once you get to level 10, you are effectively done with the game as a free player. You will not be able to gain any more exp unless you SUBSCRIBE as a member. It's not even a ""pay to unlock more levels"". It's ""keep paying monthly to get more levels"". You might think that you can just do quests and ignore the levels but as most items require you to be level 11 or higher, you're stuck with the few items that are below level 10.This game had so much promise, and the game actually could attract a very wide audience (even adult youtubers have started to play the game), yet the way the game has been monetized has ruined any chances of it of being popular with anyone other than kids with rich parents.Don't bother with the game unless you're going to subscribe. It's a waste of time otherwise.			"

												~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TIGER~~~FACTS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~***************************************Down Below*************************************The tiger is the biggest species of the cat family.Tigers can reach a length of up to 3.3 metres (11 feet) and weigh as much as 300 kilograms (660 pounds).Subspecies of the tiger include the Sumatran Tiger, Siberian Tiger, Bengal Tiger, South China Tiger, Malayan Tiger and Indochinese Tiger.Many subspecies of the tiger are either endangered or already extinct. Humans are the primary cause of this through hunting and the destruction of habitats.Around half of tiger cubs don’t live beyond two years of age.Tiger cubs leave their mother when they are around 2 years of age.A group of tigers is known as an ‘ambush’ or ‘streak’.Tigers are good swimmers and can swim up to 6 kilometres.Rare white tigers carry a gene that is only present in around 1 in every 10000 tigers.Tigers usually hunt alone at night time.Tigers have been known to reach speeds up to 65 kph (40 mph).Less than 10% of hunts end successfully for tigersTigers can easily jump over 5 metres in length.Various tiger subspecies are the national animals of Bangladesh, India, North Korea, South Korea and Malaysia.There are more tigers held privately as pets than there are in the wild.Tigers that breed with lions give birth to hybrids known as tigons and ligers.

												Oh my goodness, what a game! The story is top notch, and I was biting my nails the whole time. I could really feel the characters' struggles. Of course, I didn't pay for premium membership so I didn't see about 90% of the character's or missions, but oh boy, what an adventure I had! The movement is so refined, and the handling of the vehicle which you are given access to is so accurate and is in no way absolutely godawful. Be warned, this game will be very intensive on your pc, this is some next-gen level stuff! As an aging man, my wife told me that she would divorce me if I didn't stop playing this game, but let me tell you something: she is gone. That is all I will say about my wife. She isn't in the way anymore. Amazing World is infinitely better than the woman who once loved me. I can't wait to get back to my adventures in Amazing World, the scale, the depth, the everything, I don't want to live in a world without Amazing World, because Amazing World, is MY world.			"

												I really have mixed feelings about this one. Its created by Ganez the company who produced Tail Town Friends on Facebook and deleted it because it wasn't making enough money...The game promises to be an open safe haven game for children to play. It's definitely designed for children as the level of difficulty is simply to walk into most things. The abundant amount of colors in this world is like someone threw a grenade in a paint factory. Everything is awesome. Everyone loves everyone. All characters are so cute you want to take them home. You start to notice simple things like that the birds are singing, the hills are green, the flowers are vibrant and that your in love with all these gerbils. Just when all things are peachy. The dark clouds of 'WE WANT MONEY' start rolling in at level 10. Seriously you have to cough up $30.00 a year at least if you want to continue past that point to play the main game play.I'm not sure how many of the side quests you can still do without the coughing up of real money, but the announcement sure does serve as an eyesore, like as if someone just grabbed your head and held it over a steaming hot plate and said 'pay up!'.The story is that you have to save the world from Queen Nix who rules a bunch of cute grey colored critters that brandish sledgehammers and start smacking away at the world causing zero damage. They are easily defeated by simply walking into them. Some how doing household chores like gardening will eventually train your super powers of walking into things and eventually save the world...???The side scrolling platform games look great and really had me interested because of it's unique look. The 3D open world is also huge and interesting to explore, the game does give you your own decoration grid and a massive catalog of decor items. However there is not enough in the game for me to warrant $30.00 a year.Is it really a safe haven? I found it to be very easy to add people in there and start chatting away and since it is designed for children, you would expect predators in there would you not? It does seem to be monitored though. One person reported that he got banned simply because he jokingly typed 'come touch my meat'. All jokes aside i think the adults sometimes forget there are children here, so the banning side of things is welcoming.Simply put, there isn't enough of the game and it's not involving enough to inspire me to make any long term investment and there is no once off payment to make either. One would question how popular this really is as a baby sitter since we have so many cute games to entertain children thanks to Nintendo. While this might not be PC, there are such things as emulators to incorporate those games to PC.One more thing I forgot, many found that at certain points the loading of the various worlds would crash and send you back to Steam. The only way I found around this was to play the browser game direct and get past the load point and then return back to Steam so Steam Cloud could catch up to where you exactly are in the game.My suggestion is, if your really looking for a game to entertain your children. Try board games, they don't require $30.00 a year...			"

												(not serious review)To put it simply, this game stopped me from killing myself. I was so angry because there were no games where you could do absolutely nothing but frustrate yourself at the wonky controls and disabled plot line. But finally Amazing World came out and I was overjoyed!(serious review) This game is trash, and even if you're five you probably won't find this entertaining for more than five minutes. The controls are wonky, the voice acting is garbage, and most of all the plot and the game mechanics are worse than any white girl you might find on the street slurping up starbucks, taking selfies, wearing short shorts, and eating nutella like she hadn't eaten in months. But seriously though, how do they stay so skinny with that diet? But that's a story for another day			"

												Amazing World has some fantastic features. For young children it is an ideal introduction to online gaming. It is cute, easy to play, safe, and best of all the characters have voice actors. But as charming as this game is. A monthly subscription is required to have full access to everything it offers. This will sadly drive people away as they finish what they can.I suggest waiting for Castaway Paradise and A Hat in Time.			"

												Sixteen minutes. Sixteen god ♥♥♥♥ing forsaken minutes. In that short span of time my life spiraled out of contol, people I bumped into on the street turned into pixie dust and dissapeared. They screamed. God, help me, I still hear the screams. The plushies in the corner, the codes on their tags, abandoned, their eyes concentrated on the monster before them... me. Furious, unrelenting animals looking at me as if everything is just ♥♥♥♥ing peachy, but their gazes penetrate my soul as I sit in this empty house, contemplating, waiting. Just. ♥♥♥♥ing Waiting.I feel the cold metallic taste of the barrel in my mouth, and I feel the gazes and I hear the screams and I see them, laughing, taunting as I cry for them, pixie dust rising from mine and their skin.I pull the trigger. Pitch black. Every memory I ever ad of them is now splattered on this cheap Motel wall.I'm safe. So finally safe.

												First thing i have to say is it is a great first mmo for kids but when it comes down to it you can only be level 10 with out paying for a member ship. This is not to say you cant do anything after this point you can repeat pretty much the same quests over and over again and your kid probley wont know the difference. i played this game for about 2 hours before i got bored of it. you basicly go around walking over things to complete quests and you can unlock items for your house or special hats and if you get high enough level in a skill you can buy maybe 1-3 special items from that skill shop like a full on space suit. ill recommend it because little kids wont notice these things and just walk around like wooo i am playing a game as a cow or something. i am still waiting on the pvp expansion where i can use my koala space drone to 1v1 some other animals. if they get rid of the level cap on membership and give you full access to the game it would be fun and i would recommend it more. 6/10points lost for level cap and repeatitive quests and music. bonus points for multiplayer world quests and some decent gameplay.

												One word ""Amazing""This game Is just like it says it is, Amazing, But the game is basically club penguin mixed with rainbows and cute puffy animals. When I say that I mean that it is a game that you have to pay to do anything in. plus this game is extremely buggy. Examples: If you parkour on to a wall you are shown that you are fazing in and out of it, you can use taunts early game that you can't use till later game for no reason at random times when you open your taunt menu.Do I regret getting this game: NoDo I suggest you try this game out: YesDo I think its a good game: No			"

												I have spent the last 30 years of my life in and out of prison. For years I commited felonies and crimes I cant even speak of here. But in the last week I discovered the miracle of something beautiful to turn my life around. Move over Jesus because Amazing World is here. Finally a game that expresses in my inner self. Running around as a pantsless pink elephant has turned my life around from a life of filthy crime and hanus atrocities. Thank you Amazing World, I am now on my path to a brighter future. Everyday I login and look forward to tending my garden, meeting new 12 year old friends and mingling with the local townsfolk for some real quality fun time. No more back alley shankings for me, I am an Amazing World convert.			"

												I used to have friends, I used to have family but thanks to this game i no longer have those worthless things.  Amazing world is like mike tyson coming into your house and murdering you friends and family in front of you. There is no longer life only amazing world.  Amazing world is my everything EVERYTHING EVERYTHING.  On my first day a mystical teddy bear taught me how to live.  She took me to all corners of my body, not a hole unfilled not a crevasse untouched.  Ive never felt so alive as the needle slowly sank into my arm.  They said i murder 69 people but i think, i wish it was more.  and my final thought was amazing world. Only amazing world.  only amazing world and that bear's sweet magical mouth.			"

												surprisingly, it's actually a fun game. if you aren't <12, then there's a high chance you might not enjoy this game for very long. Sucks that after level 10 you have to buy a membership, and to trade too. || Edit:You can play after level 10, but you don't get any exp towards the actual level bit.||Edit 2:I just wanted to add in a bit of extra detail, there is some gameplay quality with each of the characters, but after a while it just gets boring. There are simple puzzles, those moving tile things and collect ""this"", ""that"" anf the ""third"". It gets very repetitive if you're looking for actual gameplay, it's quite adorable and I found that in all of my time playing, I had a wonderful time with the person I played. We made a few friends in the game.			"

												Cute game, child friendly, violence free, good voice acting and missions. If I had a kid I would probably choose this over club penguin. Do be warned that you will probably have to talk to your child about the value of money before they start playing. The game has a sub fee and a lot of features are taken out if you're playing as a free user (good news though, it's only 3.99$ a month or 29.99$ for a year! One of the cheapest MMOs out there that I've seen), but at the same time you can buy extra in-game special currency that can be quite pricy (priced anywhere between 9.99$ to 99$).Do you need items from the in-game shop to enjoy the game? No. But first make sure that your child won't throw a tantrum over it. :)			"

I looked at it and said this is ridiculous, then looked to my friend and said... we got to try it. So we did and after that it gave me a couple hours of fun. But that's all. Think of amazing world as webkinz and runescape had a baby. You have certain skills such as cooking and gardening, woodcrafting, and then the odd ones, icecream, singing and so forth. It is HEAVELY based on pay to win. So unless this game you are going to invest in with your young child. It is only for a couple hours of laughs.			"

												As an avid MMO player I'm always excited to play a new MMO, weather it be as a joke with friends or not.  As for this game, I was quite charmed, the art style is very bright and colorfull with very cute characters (im a sucker for cute stuff).However, this game is not Free to Play, it is a free TRIAL untill level 10.  After Lv.10 you need to pay a monthly subsctiption to progress.  Kinda lame of a company to expect children to have to pay a monthly fee.  (and by that I mean bug their parants to)There are better Free to Play models.   Unlock the entire game experiance for free, and open up a fair Item Mall where players can buy fashion items.			"

												One of the best MMO experiences I've ever had the pleasure of partaking in.I would rather play this game than make sweet, passionate love with a supermodel on top of a shark riding a dinosaur holding a lightsaber fighting Godzilla  on the Empire State Building. I would rather play this game than furiously masturbate, though I often do both at the same time, since this game only really requires one hand.The colours will make any man want to choke his chicken and instantly made me go through a second puberty; it was like a heavenly light shone on me and started fist♥♥♥♥ing me, chanting tribal songs as they made a sacrifice to Allah. Delightful.The game appeals to my love of beating animals with my fists while butt♥♥♥♥♥naked. Being able to do so while beating myself is just pure bliss. The PvP is so intense that it makes me as sweaty as a grandma that slept in a sleeping bag, covered in latex in a purely isolated room with five heaters inside with no windows or doors in the middle of August. That's how intense it is.That being said, the game can also make you rage due to the player not being so good at the game. I sometimes cannot quickscope fast enough, as I am not an xX3lite_420blzit_360noscope_proXx. This makes me rage with the fury of a thousand suns and the hellish maelstrom of pure mental assrape.All in all, though, I feel that the game is terrific, though it needs to be balanced. Being the Cow is OP, as it is much easier to quickscope somebody from across the map with much better killstreaks than the other classes. But seriously, I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, it made me into the man I am today, no longer a shriveling ♥♥♥♥♥, too afraid to play such spooky and intense games.Oh, and I couldn't get past the tutorial....I came.11/10			"

												This game was visually pleasing in both quests and surroundings. Kid friendly and fun for a rnage of ages even those who like to play a thought free game experience.the only downer i had that became a problem was that,as i played as a 'free player' since it was a free game they were an so many restrictions. Once you reached level 10 all game proression pretty much haulted and all i could do were small side missions.			"

												This game is mainly for kids but its fun for all ages. The games are educational some are just for fun but all are very enjoyable. The quests help the player gain items for your home base or Items you could wear. How you decorate or dress up is all up to the creative mind of the player. You could invite your friends to come play at your home. There is fishing (I believe the developers did a wonderful job capturing the excitement of actually catching something) loads of in game events happening all the time. Completion of these events award you based on how you did. Those that participated will always walk away with something. I even found a mini dungeon or raid (if you will) where you team up with other players to accomplish a goal very fun!! This game is guaranteed to put smiles on anyone face all the characters are so adorable. If you’re looking for a game for a young one starting to learn their way around a computer even an experienced player I would recommend this game. I would also recommend this game for anyone who is having a bad day like I said before it’s guaranteed to make you smile and if does not, you need to look for your inner child. Come on down and give it a try there is something for everyone.			"

												Act one:You are Bunny Mcebola, son of an incestuous relationship you have travelled back in time to prevent your own birth.A major part of the game is stealth, creeping around the mental asylum to make way to your parents dorm. As you dig deeper into the story of the game you discover the terrible tests conducted on animal and human sex cells. The final part of the game shows you the horrible truth: you are a half bunny half human abomination, you are placed in a matrix like situation where everyone in the world is a strange cross of humans and animals. Drugs running and prostitution are your main source of income and knife crime in multiplayer is a serious issue.Game of the year - 2069			"

												I can extremely NOT recommend this game. First off it is NOT free-to-play, it is a TRIAL game you get to play with heavy limitations (eg max level 10), and full ""Members"" access is SUBSCRIPTION based which it clearly does not display at all on the store page. There are also big billboards ingame advertising and trying to lure users to be full members, etc.I will very much make sure to warn all my friends and their familes to avoid this game at all costs. It is a real shame as if it wasn't for those problems this would have been a real nice fun game for younger players. Hopefully the developers will change these ""features"" and if so then I will totally recommend this game. But for now, as-is, I can not at all recommend and would infact strongly suggest avoiding this entirely at all costs unless you don't mind subscription based games.			"

												Coming from a 19 year old who has now played over 42 hours on this game, spent about $14.00 and can't STOP playing the game, this is an honest reivew to the best of my ability.Pros of Amazing World. -Tons of content to keep you busy. -Buildable relationships with characters. (Thngs you do actually improve things for them)-Big overworld that changes with the seasons.-Not having to pay for gold coins. (But paying for more does get them quicker)-Building up silver coins is easy.-TONS of customization, (Characters,clothes,homes,craftable items,yard items, dimensions)-Still getting updates even 2 years later.-Team attack games.-Well done boss fights.-Great customer service that actually responds.-Can reach max level in under a month. -Did I mention you can own your own dimensions??Cons of Amazing World.-Quests can get repetitive-There is a fee to keep playing after level 10. (But honestly if you can't afford $3.99 get off Steam and mow a lawn.)-Can't own two different accounts with member on one Steam account.-Controls could be better and are a bit hard to get used to.(Add controller support please)-Some craftables are not permanent, even though the items to craft them are hard to get.If I think of more Cons or Pros I'll add them, but as of right now that's it. You're probably wondering why ""GLITCHES"" is not listed in Cons, that's because the game is still being updates and we are bound to see those glitches go away with time, so putting that agaisnt them really isn't fair considering every game is going to have glitches.

												A good pc for young children, we don't get many children's games on Steam or pc in general. I myself played Amazing World a little bit, and I can have to say, it doesn't get anymore children's based than this. I want to be clear though this is for ""young"" children so The Ideal age range in my opinion is 3-6 years old, after all we know kids 7+ would all rather play the latest Call of Duty or something. I honestly doubt there are many children playing, I would guess that most of the players could indeed be older than the intended age range, especially since the game has come to Steam. Even with this fact I still think Amazing World is a decent children's game, and a good try for a children's mmo. The game is free (mostly) but you will find a lot of features locked, only available to  subscription, or paying accounts, You can give Amazing World a try yourself, if you are wary about letting your child play an online game as it is free to download and play right here on Steam.

												This game is extremely well polished, as it should be since its for children. When you sign-up it doesn't ask for your email, it asks for your parents email. Everything, including the bad guys are super cutesy. Overall the game seems great for kids, graphics are cute, game play seems simple and easy to get used to. One big problem I noticed when I got into a public space is a lot of people are spamming ""..."" which must be swearing and people saying stuff like ""Santa isn't real"", but i'm sure this will smooth out a bit after this game has been out a while. Okay another big issue is the pay wall. You can get a few levels but then you get stuck until you sign up for a membership. The prices for that aren't bad but the game is just stopped if you don't start paying. Overall it's worth letting your kids try it, or try it yourself and take some cute screenshots. 7/10			"

												This game (or should I say piece of art) has it all baby, it’s got the graphics, it’s got the story, it’s got the gameplay, it’s the soundtrack, this game is the true definition of a gaming masterpiece. You start out immediately with the ability to customize your customize your character in way that rivals the likes of Skyrim or even the Sims. You are then introduced to your companions on a ship above spring bay where everything is going to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Crime is at an all-time high and you’re the only who fix this crime ridden town. I can't say to much more about the game because I don't want to spoil the plot for all of you but it gets intense and the love story is beyond average. Imagine if 50 shades of gray if it was actually good and all characters were replaced by teddies that are both lovable and incredibly attractive. Another amazing thing about Amazing World (you see what I did there?), is its ability to be an both an mmo RPG and combine elements from such excellent titles such as Drake and the 99 Dragons, and Superman 64. This also manages to be an mmo where it's actually fun to farm and rank up. The loot system is also a great improvment compared to recent titles like Borderlands. My only complaint about this game is getting TO immeresed in the world and storyline, which is easy beacause  of how believable the charcters are and how well written the plot is. Overall I would say that if you havn't expierinced this game yet, I would highly recommend you do because it is a damn good game. I Give it A solid 10/10			"

You choose your character out of about 4 or 5 different animals, I chose to be a cow (there is also kitty, puppy, lamb etc). After you give it some clothes and a name you get to explore this amazing world, do jobs/help out other characters and complete achievements. Very cute.			"

												After playing a couple hours with my four year-old I purchased a year's membership -- and it's the best money I've spent on Steam so far.  My daughter LOVES this game: she continues to quest with Gelato and Cannoli after maxing out both characters.  (She's an adorable master of hot and cold treats!)  And then there are the hours of entertainment we've had watching her zing hop up and down on Howl's whoopie cushion trampoline, then go inside and sit on the ice cream chair  because after all that pooting she needs to go on the potty.  She's also working on hand-eye coordination, mastering 16-piece jigsaw puzzles, rearranging her yard, dressing and undressing her zings, going on quests and otherwise engaging with the brightly colored, gentle environment.  We haven't started using the ""Friends"" and ""chat"" features yet -- she just turned 4 and I think we can wait a bit on that one.  But we've certainly taken advantage of much of what this game has to offer, and would recommend it without hesitation to curious youngsters and the caregivers who love them.			"

												Cons: Parental control access is difficult to find if they access at all. This is not ideal seeing as this is a game that is clearly targeted to children.Not rated by the ESRB. Although it is not a requirement for games to be rated it is very helpful and useful so that an adult does not need to first sit down and play through the game to know what content is in the game. Not all that important but it is very helpful and convient to have the rating with some type of information to quickly decide if appropriate for a child or if the adult should sit down and play it first. Free to play is very limited. Free to play lasts only until level 10. Which took about 1 hour 10 minutes for me to get to but it could be longer for a child.Terms of service was not in the client window and is not required to be clicked to continue registration.Pros: When creating a characther name it does have a very good filter one that is a bit on the strong side the filter would not allow the name it randomly generated due to the word Shell.This game is adorably cute. So it is  good for children with mininamal violence. At most atleast until level 10 you just run into the the little Nix.It does have 2 types of access one via the steam client and one via the adventure world website itself. The website version is browser based and requires the Unity plugin.For an MMORPG membership is fairly cheap. A 12 month membership is 30.00 USD as of August 7th 2014.If you do click on the terms of services they do give you a link to COPPA which explains what it is and provides other useful information on it.Ultimately for a young child's game it is a decent to very good game. The limited free to play of the game allows you to let your child test it before you purchase anything in the game with real world cash. I would recommend this product only if you are looking for a game to introduce a child to the world of MMORPGs			"

												From time to time you find something you can't quite find the words for to describe it, but I think there is only one word that would do this game justice.Amazing.The graphics are top notch, the community acts mature, balanced leveling system and ofcourse free.I think I have to say no more.

												I absolutly would not reccommend this game. I saw it for free on the steam list and decided hey, might as well check it out, it could be a fun learning experience. But I was so wrong. Immediatly my character is attacked while on the magical flying pirate ship by some kind of furrie terrorists. And the ship crashed. It triggered me because I do not like 9/11 because I am a proud american.  My character did a life endangering stunt by jumping off the ship with a hang glider, wish was obviously designed for 1 person with 2 people! Kids could learn to jump off their roofs from that which in my books is not ok not one bit at all, nope. THIS IS NOT EVEN THE WORST PART YET!!!! I have already invested time creating a character, registering my username and surviving this sexist cutscene degrading women by having the female main character appear weak which really offended me. So I am finally at the town and I see another player. I decide this is my chance to make friends and possibly learn the ropes like how to customize my new home. I say , ""hello my name is tyrone"" in the chat it comes up at ""..."" I did not understand because the game did not tell me why. I typed it several more times then the game informed me I was saying something offensive. Then I figured it out. THIS GAME IS RACIST. The game would not let me say the name tyrone because the developers are all cis scum who are against feminism and probably are all white suppremist hitler worshipers. I became so triggered I almost had a panic attack. I took several deep breaths just like I learned on Tumblr then decided to inform anyone thinking of playing this not to. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!                                                    overall 3/10 would not recommend :/ "

												This game is fantastic! So far i am having a great time. This game is great for kids and is appropriate for all ages. With being able to level up, do quests, get achievments, and meet some new people this game will keep you entertained for quite along time. If your lucky you can also meet a staff member from the game inside the game and you can follow him and he drops money! You can also fish. Another great feature is that you can build a house and fix it how you want. Then you can invite your friends to your house to hang out with you.			"

												This is the most rage inducing RPG I have ever played in the first 10 minutes I could not decide between the 3 different pants and shirts so I just said screw it and went naked, I then snapped my keyboard in half because I was unable to name my zing, then I clicked the random name button until I recieved a name worth keeping.... In the next 10 minutes I found an old keyboard and defeated the Nix that were attacking the ship by ""scaring"" them... By that time I was so bored I thought about death.. I attempted to take my own zing's life my jumping off the edge of the ship but there was an invisible barrier preventing me from doing so.. when I finally got to a point where I was able to mingle with random people I found it insulting that all of these 1st graders were telling me that I needed to put some clothes on, One of them even went to the extent of getting his/her parents on the keyboard -_- they proceded to tell me that I was setting a bad example for their child and that I needed to get a life. I recomend this game to anyone that enjoys raging at video games and enjoys arguing with little kids over chat! 10/10yoloswagmuffins			"

												When I saw all the lovely reviews for this AAA MMORPG, I decided I would give it a try. Oh boy, where do I start? The character customization is out of this world, it has a variety of costumes available for your character. My character was a nudist bear who was inspired by the famous leader, Mao Zedong. The graphics out-class all other games I have played, my PC even froze for 28 hours whilst it was trying to render all the shaders. The voice acting and lip syncing is great, with a wide variety of characters including an autistic Koala.PROSNext Gen Graphics.Gameplay elite to all other MMOs.Even my Nan can play it.CONSGave me severe autism.Addicting.Graphics are too good.

												Before you start The Amazing World you pick a character, you can choose between a Cow, Bear or Bunny.You dress it up and your ready to go.You get your own house with a garden that you can decorate. You can buy items in the shop with money you earn by doing missions. Sadly you unlock items to buy by leveling but you can only level up till lvl 10 after that you have to pay.The Amazing World is super cute. There are alot of missions you can do and get alot of items for free!But after a hour you get bored fast because its the same sort of missions everytime.Jumping games, Memory games, sorting items games,catching items games and go to this person and this person.I dont think its much fun for the adults but this game is perfect for kids specially the little ones around age 6.Its one of the most childfriendly games ive ever seen.There is no harm in anything! It looks cute, happy music and alot to do.Its sad that you have to pay after level 10 or else i would have played it more often myself too lol.			"

												When you compare this game to other child games on consoles (mostly on the old Wii but also on the old DS), these games are badly made and mostly unplayable. Amazing World offers you a huge map to discover with different tasks to accomplish and items to unlock, it's amazingly fun to play. I'm 23 years old and I am not ashamed to say that I actually enjoyed this game, like most of you though since you're all frustrated you need to pay to play after level 10.Anyway, the game is new, so with some imperfections.First of all, the quests between the different NPCs are the same, only the design changes and it can be a hard work after a time. Educational tasks can be nice for kids to learn while having fun.Also, kids need more support, unless they play the game with a parent, they won't know what to do because in the end, you just have to talk to random NPCs to start a task. A Random event of an NPC, like events for the Teamplays, can be useful for them to play by themselves I think. This way, it would be easier for them to unlock the Icebox Blast or the Talia's Tower for example.Secondly, many glitches can be found, in the main map and in the Home Zone. In your home you can duplicate your items if you use them a wrong way.Despite that, the devs have made an excellent work to build this game up. Also, if you have any problem with the game, they have an incredible helpful support that will help you the best they can. Something I've never seen in any other game yet.This game is the start of great ideas for kids to enjoy MMOs, with friends or alone. These kind of games are known to be addictive, this one is nearly it. I hope this game will have improvements and adds to make it even more fun.			"

There might not be much of it, but the gameplay is so great that I don't even care how much there is. I will be purchasing a membership right after I finish writing this.

												I give this game an orca/5, it's got good gramphics, and it's got good grameplay. The game really has a great storyline, and I must say the the gecko gambling station probably was one of the best parts of the game. It is a very terrifying game however, as the main enemies are little blue and purple aliens. They also incorporated the elements of games like Spooper Wario bruhs, and with the difficulty curve that reminds me of Dark souls. The games MMO incorporation made it really come alive however, the people running around in realtime, and making the game much more hectic. However the Chef hat looks like a white and rainbow spotted scrotum, so I can't give this game a donkey/6, but only an orca outa/5. Overall, cancer is bad and we should cure it with this game. #merica			"

												After all the hype I was curious to see what Amazing World™ was all about. This might be the greatest game I've ever played and I'm really looking forward to never playing this again. For only about $30 a year you can enjoy the full pleasure of this cheaply made free to play game.			"

												 Its an amazing MMO designed for kids.The only bad part is after lvl 10 it becomes P2P AKA you have to buy membership to become a higher level.The membership is fairly cheap,its only 3.99$ a month.I still recommend the game,its full of happiness and colors.Still there is some minor glitches and the Springmobile's controls are ****.

After he beat me with his legendary weapons and stole all my loot I could see why.This game is massively pay to win and if you don't want to hand over money cash I urge you to stay away from this game especially from pvp arenas. Other than that the graphics are good as is the music however the weapon system could use a little work.7/10 would play again.			"

												Okay. My friend invited me to play this game as a joke. After attempting to say something that wasn't vulgar whatsoever, it was blocked. I then decided to type in every single letter of the alphabet. Most of them were banned. My account was silenced for 24 hours.The next day, me and my friend messed around on the map. I had managed to find an interesting, yet game-breaking glitch that allows you to clip out of bounds.

Like how sometimes in Call of Duty I just want to sit back and take a nap but still play the game. Oh and the voice acting is terrible! Just the way it sould be, I mean it really shows what a crappy world it is to live in. Oh and I almost forgot the BEST thing about this game! After reaching level 10 you have to buy to play it! YES!

												This game is amazing. Just like its title. It has about 45 minutes of core gameplay before level 10, which is the point where you have to pay to play more. There might not be much of it, but the gameplay is so great that I don't even care how much there is. I will be purchasing a membership right after I finish writing this. I very much recommend this game as it is great for all ages. Just kidding this game is terrible don't download it.			"

												When you compare this game to other child games on consoles (mostly on the old Wii but also on the old DS), these games are badly made and mostly unplayable. Amazing World offers you a huge map to discover with different tasks to accomplish and items to unlock, it's amazingly fun to play. I'm 23 years old and I am not ashamed to say that I actually enjoyed this game, like most of you though since you're all frustrated you need to pay to play after level 10.Anyway, the game is new, so with some imperfections.First of all, the quests between the different NPCs are the same, only the design changes and it can be a hard work after a time. Educational tasks can be nice for kids to learn while having fun.Also, kids need more support, unless they play the game with a parent, they won't know what to do because in the end, you just have to talk to random NPCs to start a task. A Random event of an NPC, like events for the Teamplays, can be useful for them to play by themselves I think. This way, it would be easier for them to unlock the Icebox Blast or the Talia's Tower for example.Secondly, many glitches can be found, in the main map and in the Home Zone. In your home you can duplicate your items if you use them a wrong way.Despite that, the devs have made an excellent work to build this game up. Also, if you have any problem with the game, they have an incredible helpful support that will help you the best they can. Something I've never seen in any other game yet.This game is the start of great ideas for kids to enjoy MMOs, with friends or alone. These kind of games are known to be addictive, this one is nearly it. I hope this game will have improvements and adds to make it even more fun.			"

												This game changed me.It started simple, I made Kanye, also know as the freshest zing around, but it soon spiraled out of control. I spun a wheel twice and made some cash then I made Kanye look hella fresh and then I hide behind some rubble 'cause some kids were calling each other bullies because one would never hang out and soon I found an alien and then I cut some grass and then I witnessed four bears inside each other and then there was a uni-dolphin and then there was a kid confessing his love but failed and ended up being called creepy and then...Well, that is about all that happened in my 1.1 hours of Amazing World so far. How can I not recommend?10/10 fast-paced social children beat-em-up game with tons of gameplay aspects, a masterpiece.			"

												Played this game as a bunny in a pink dress. Because I like pink dresses. I made some nice friends, a bunny and a pig. And when I asked them what they want to play, they walked away in silence. Obviously they wanted to play hide and seek, but I am very bad at this game, I never found them.A friendly lizard told me he would let me spin the wheel of fortune for free. I won some sunflower seeds. The friendly lizard told me he would let me spin again if I bring him money from my parents. But then the game crashed so I couldn't.A friendly Koala told me he wants to launch a space ship and I would just be the right bunny for his space program. He shot me into space to play a fun game with all my friends. That means I was alone in space. I still made the third place, though,A friendly bear told me I should bring him more money from my parents, I would get a nice pair of sunglasses from him if I do. I so love sunglasses! Nothings looks better in sunglasses than a bunny in a pink dress with a space helmet! But my dad said no. That is so mean!I love this game! But I got banned. I was told that even those the hints were crystal clear, this was still not an LSD market place.			"

You get to be a cute little aminal who goes on quests and plays mini games.The graphics are really nice for the type of game it is. It was actually fun! Up until level 10....The game Claims to be ""free"" or you can buy a membership. The thing is that there are level requirements on all the questsand you lose the ability to level up once you reach level 10.I would be fine losing the ability to buy the later on clothes, but the game is no longer ""free"" OR membership, when only members can play past 10. So I say if you want to destress and waste a little bit of time, go aheadlevel up a fuzzy basterd to 10. But stay away if you're seriously thinking of playing it.Unless of course you want to pay a monthly fee to play this.			"

The game has next gen graphics so you will need an ultra gaming computer. i was having fun until i reached level 10 and wabam they told me to pay money so i can level up but i was all like no. me and the game used to be best friends up to that point i made my bear look like an old man. I loved it so much i wish i had 5 dollars just to get my true love back and maybe buy useless cosemetic items.

												I tried to put myself in the mindset of the target audience when I was playing this game, but even when I did, I found that there were a few disruptive problems that make this quite inaccessible.The main problem, as pointed out by most of the reviews that don't recommend this game, is that you need to pay for membership to get past level 10, something that is often popped up in your face while you play once you hit that level. This wouldn't be a problem if a lot of the content was blocked to those below certain levels, making this a game that can only really be enjoyed in the long-term if you pay for a membership.The second problem that I found fairly intrusive is the janky jump and collision physics. There's a minigame where you have to collect fruit and avoid some demonic, spiky balls. If you touch these, you are sent back until you hit the next solid object; this means that if you jump while touching this, you are sent rocketing into the sky for a few seconds before hurtling back to the ground. This could be potentially very disorientating for a child playing.The third problem is one can't aim to collect certain matierals for crafting, since they are all given as random drops when completing missions. This means one can't really aim to make a certain thing to create for their home, which then makes the crafting system quite pointless.Overall, this is a nice game in terms of aesthetics, but I couldn't recommend it for children as an introduction to gaming or MMOs, or even just for anything in general. I didn't pay, so I don't know all the features, but it seems a little broken as it stands.			"

												Before this game I had a wife and 2 kids. One day I was browsing the steam store and I found Amazing world, at first I thought the game was a waste of time but then I came to find that Amazing world is Amazing. Overtime I came to love this game, I played and played to my hearts content until one day I realized that this game has taken over my life. I played so much that I completely ignored my family, my wife left and took the children with her, I spent on my money on a rainbow afro. I was broke, I had nothimg to live for until I realised Amazing world is life and it is love. It was Gabens wish for me to play such a game as this, it was the prophesy. I am Gabens Jesus and this was what I was born to do, and that being the coolest guy on Amazing world. Worth it10/10			"

												Amazing World is a must-own for nearly any Steam user, and especially for any PC gaming enthusiast. As soon as you start the game, you are greeted with a defining and well organized character creation screen. The selections to choose from and the options to personalize are endless, and customization has never been this user-friendly before in any MMORPG game. The in-game dialogue is similar to that of an award winning novel. An extensive range of vocabulary, with fabulous voice acting makes it seem like I'm listening to a conversation in real life. The game takes it a step even furthur by adding an in-game chat feature. With a parent or guardian's email address, you will have access to communicate with any other player in the game. Making new online friends has never been a fun and easy experience until Amazing World came along. You will be treated with crystal clear eye-candy visuals when playing this game. Never in my life have I witnessed anything on my computer screen this realistic. Your jaw will drop when you come face to face with this beautiful sight of video game graphics. Gameplay is well thought out and challenging, yet it remains to be extremely fun for the player and has a completely original aspect. However, this game is for babies and for that I will not recommend it.			"

We played a lot had some fun times and some scary times when we tried to paint. I do wish we could go farther then level 20 or that we could somehow get free primium membership so we can continue our adventure.  I would recomend this game to everyone looking for a great MMo experence. This game is great for new players and even better for veteran MMO players. I would highly recomend this ""Amazing"" game.

												This game is the game that heals all of your ills. As a matter of fact, the famous book ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" was a metaphor for this game. Most people downrate this game for forcing you to pay after level 10. But, what they dont realize is that with this game, you don't need a college education, or food, or a social life. No, gentlemen, let your beards grow long as you whittle away your hours being amazing, oddly-colored animals wearing no clothes.On the downside, there was a lack of quickscoping ability in this game, so I was unable to get a ""triple"". But, you can still be pretty 1337 if you so desire.Everyone, prepare your butts, because it's about to be slam time when you enter this new money sucking creation from the makers of Webkinz, the reason your parents couldn't afford food when you were younger. But, that's alright, because your soul will be filled with childish joy that you only experience when you are a young boy after successfully entering a random activation code for a Webkinz doll, knowing that you just ruined someone else's day.To summarize, this game will blow you away. This game will change you as a person. This game has more change than the Obama administration.3hunna/10 GOTY 2014			"

												Amazing World takes place 280 years in the future of Bioshock Infinity, enough time for cute living, breathing, stuffed animals named ""Zings"" to inhabit a whole world and set up a bunch of wacky errands and tasks for other Zings to carry out all on their own, while the threat of ""antagonist witch lady"" and her minions called ""The Nix"" messing with your mini games a little hangs over your world at every moment.Now, enough about story lets get to the actual grameplay.Most of the grempley is, like I said, completing a bunch of oddjobs for a bunch of other NPC Zings. These Zings include: Cannoli (AW's very own Walter White whose theme song is my JAM), Some Pink Bear Named Bloom, Space Koala, The Tf2 Sniper, and a whole bunch more. Did I happen to mention the gambling station!? Phenominal. Lizard Guy has you spin a weel and you bet your whole fricking Webkins account just to get a pink fricking shirt. Although, you DO get a hella FPS expansion pack when you type in the secret code from your Doritos and Mt. Dew you've been consuming to play this game night after night. They also managed to fit in a few Wario Kart, WOW, and Little Big Planet themed levels in there to represent the deeper meaning of modern day society. Which I found was very powerful and moving.Grampics are pretty cool for a cartoonish game but I really wish there was more horses like in the original Miami Hotline dlc pack. Also there wasnt as much yiffing going on here as was expected??? someone maybe help???anyway prettty stellar indie graphics, dude.

												If anything, Amazing World is a witty and well thought out Satire and created as an argument against modern MMO's released to the public. Instead of worrying about gearscore and using commands or a confusing skill bar of abilities, in the fashion of WoW, all enemies can be defeated simply by walking through them.  All quests are gathering and collecting, and the true reward is decorating your character and designing your own home. You actually have your own home you can design that many games and MMO's fail at.  You have to applaud Amazing World for being brave enough to slap every other game in the face, and it exists solely as a reminder that everyone needs to do better than it. The bar has been raised.10/10			"

												I was just a lonely guy...in a lonely place...but one day, the thug life chose me. I was in a tricked out car but then we were ambushed by Team Purple and capped almost all of us down. Me and my girl managed to escape and settled a new life with a new passport and a new identity. Now we're living the life: searching for the goods, dropping mixtapes, and taking down the enemy Purple gang. But soon after settling in, the cops had found me and had to charge me up to $29.99 to keep on living my life. So I ended it. Right there. 10/10 would play again ♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Never have I ever laid my eyes on such perfection. As soon as I started the game I knew it was going to be worth my while. I was blown away by the sheer amount of choices you were granted when choosing a character, which was an overwhelming total of 3. I chose the brown cow as my character and I was blessed with the family name of ""Babyaniltongue"" of which I hold great respect for. Upon arrival to Spring Bay, I almost broke into tears. I was completely and utterly flabbergasted by the amazing visuals this game possesses. The greenery looked as if I had stepped into a beautiful meadow, and the water looked so realistically ravishing that it made me feel parched and that the only way to quench my thirst was to drink of the holy waters of the game. I dare say this may be the best-looking game on Steam. After being delighted by the stimulative graphics, I was happy to see that the gameplay was just as gratifying. Not only do you have wasd as a choice of movement but the arrow keys as well, which is very useful for both right-handers and left-handers. There is no need for your mouse when navigating for you move only with the directional keys. The gameplay is very nonlinear and has much freedom. I was satisfied. This is indeed an MMO and you can play with others, as for chatting with them, only the parental-permitted players may do so. This is a high-grade, hardcore, horror/romantic/kawaii, video-game that is a must-buy. I give this a 10/10.			"

												This game is simply amazing. The moment I finished downloading it, I created my very own bear to wreck some kids. I met a female bear and suddenly, my dongerino began to rise and I entered a state of erectile dysfunction. Along my journey, my friend Reginald worked so hard in the jungle so his mother Wukong wouldn't have to. He got promoted to Sandstone 47 as a result of his hardwork.10/10, would eat with spaghetti.

												I don't even know how to describe this game....My friend and I decided to give this brightly colored game a try. When i started the game, i was flashed with a bright white screen that nearly made me blind. Even though my eye sight was almost ruined, i continued through the game. (Until I was stopped to pay for a membership). I was shocked at how great this game was, it truly is AMAZING. The entire time i was playing this game, i couldn't stop laughing. No.. seriously... i laughed countinously. I recommend playing this game at around 3 am with a friend. I also recommend turning down the brightness before you begin your experience with this game. Overall I give Amazing World a score of 21/10.			"

												I was playing that naked yellow bear called Necrophagist Hammerraiser. I found myself on an airship when it was attacked by those evil creatures called the ""Nix"". An also naked pink bear called Bloom told me to stomp every single one of them. Once I killed them, the airship was shot. It started burning and after nearly getting my head smashed in by a mast, Bloom and I managed to escape with a paraglider.So we landed near to a house in a forest. After saving a few flowers from the Nix, Bloom told me to follow her because she wanted to show me something. So I followed her into the bushes and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what that naked pink bear wanted to show me.There was a huge garden with pink and purple flowers. I thought I was on an acid trip or something. However, there was an invisible wall that would disappear after having completed the quest which didn't work because of a bug.I couldn't even finish the tutorial but I would totally play it again.

												English review, Italian review just below it:This is supposed to be free 2 play but don't get fooled as it's not really, it's more of a free trial.Amazing world is a nice kids-oriented MMO but it's free only until you reach level 10, then essentially you have to pay if you want to go past it and that's a bummer as the game is not bad.I wish I'd never introduce this game to my little nephew as he liked it, now I have had to explain why now he can't go past level 10.Italian:Attenzione, questo gioco è gratuito solamente fino a quando non si raggiunge il livello 10, poi se si vuole aumentare di livello è necessaria una sottoscrizione.

So unique, and teaches you vaulable motor skills that you can use in life. I chose to be a half nude rabbit and it has helped me understand rabbits nudity struggles. I don't like the fact though that the game made me wear a t-shirt in one mission. My nipples need to be free, and I will not tolerate this racism. Overall I rate this game 986/Meh.			"

												This game has elements of ocarina of time, CoD, LoL, DOTA, DMC, Metal Gear, and Pokemon all in a truely imaginative setting. This game is possibly the most important game of our generation. Giving this game a number rationg would be disrespecting this masterpeice. i now have hope for the modern gaming industry. But gamers beware, this game is very demanding on your system due to its revilutionary graphics and prand new engine. This is modern art at its best			"

												Serious Review. - Please also check out my video impressions - http://dai.ly/x232zi5While this game does charge a monthly fee to get past level 10 it is cheap compared to most MMOs. As a starter MMO aimed at children this is fun and friendly and enjoyable to play. There is a decent amount of parental controls that worried parents will find useful.I could imagien this being a very enjoyable game to play with your young kids and def one of the best ""child MMOs"" i have tried out.Check out the full video review below "

												Quite possibly just set the bar as one of the most innovative and original mmo-games in the modern era of video gaming. The whole opening sequence made me feel as if I could do just about anything. The controls are superb, the action is fantastic, and the voice acting is amazing. On the subject of voice acting, the opening sequence between the characters played by Zooey Deschanel (New Girl) and Kate Mulgrew (Voyager) literally blew my mind. You start off on a flying air ship, (CRAZY ALREADY I KNOW) everything is cool, and you're getting a tour to familiarize yourself with the controls right? WRONG, you don't have time to familiarize yourself because the ship is invaded by weird creatures trying to tear it apart! (I PANIC) You're literally running around flailing your arms with no idea what to do! Trying to escape with the character played by Zooey Deschanel and she's terrified which means you can be the hero! Dodging dangerous falling timber, the crows nest almost crushes you, escaping just before one of the creatures ends up biting through the only thing keeping the ship afloat in the air!...... You and Zooey end up pushing a glider off of the ship!!! Holding on for dear life as you plummet down while the ship barrels through the air and into the murky black sea below!It's like Mass Effect (Excluding 3), Dragons Age, Elder Scrolls Oblivion, and My Little Pony were all caught sleeping together and when the baby finally came it was AMAZING WORLD.I am at a loss for words to describe exactly how I felt during the opening sequence of the game. Try it, it is less than a GIGABYTE (WHAT!?!?!? I KNOW!). I gaurantee whether you are a hardcore grinder, full on role play dude, just for the loot, or a weird dude who likes to play as a chick and fool other dudes into thinking that they are talking to a chick and then sends said person pictures of some chick they know on facebook only to tell them a year later after they fell in love with you that you're really not a chick but actually a dude and you have been messing with me the whole time and breaking my heart... this is the game you have been waiting for. If the opening sequence I described is not enough for you the game really picks up the pace (AS IF THAT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE!!!) once you land your glider, possible only after fighting through a fierce blizzard, while Zooey screams all the way down!

												English review, Italian review just below it:This is supposed to be free 2 play but don't get fooled as it's not really, it's more of a free trial.Amazing world is a nice kids-oriented MMO but it's free only until you reach level 10, then essentially you have to pay if you want to go past it and that's a bummer as the game is not bad.I wish I'd never introduce this game to my little nephew as he liked it, now I have had to explain why now he can't go past level 10.Italian:Attenzione, questo gioco è gratuito solamente fino a quando non si raggiunge il livello 10, poi se si vuole aumentare di livello è necessaria una sottoscrizione.

												Best game 10/10. Had the best storylines that any game company could ever make, and so unique. Who would make a mission about FARMING!!! So unique, and teaches you vaulable motor skills that you can use in life. I chose to be a half nude rabbit and it has helped me understand rabbits nudity struggles. I don't like the fact though that the game made me wear a t-shirt in one mission. My nipples need to be free, and I will not tolerate this racism. Overall I rate this game 986/Meh.			"

												I have been playing MMOs all of my life, I started with runescape at a very young age and ever since then I was hooked. As soon as I heard that World of Warcraft was coming into fruition, I knew that I had to check it out. It blew my mind, I was having so much fun and made many new friends in that game. Over time the game got easier and easier and was trying to appeal to the casual audience. Many of my friends left the game and it seemed like we could never find another game to fill the void in our hearts. We tried all of the MMOs we could find, but to no avail. Then, like magic, Amazing World appeared on steam. All of my friends flocked to this game like the lost sheep that we were. This game was hardcore to the most extreme. It chopped out the endless fluff that held other MMOs back, like a combat system, abilities, and group content. We obsessed over this game. We became the first guild to beat the 20 part simon says raid boss. Now we are the top tier MLG raid guild for amazing world and I could not be happier.In short, Amazing World is one of the most hardcore games on the steam store today. I Give the game a resounding 11/10 for exceeding even my most extreme expectations. Play today. It will change your life.			"

												Amazing World is not only an epic, heart pumping mmo rpg, but the features included add on to the emmense experience. At first, I thought nothing of this game. But it turns out so dank, not even Satan can handle it. My adventure started off with my naked fox man, AvocatoSemen, on a flying boat invaded by gassy leopard creatures. Then, bae and I flew away in a hanglider and headed towards my new house. After we arrived, I bought used my swag money to buy a dank♥♥♥♥♥hat.

												This game is really cute, and I did enjoy it a bit while playing, but like the other reviews said, it becomes p2p after level 10, and it doesn't take long at all to get to level 10. If you have the extra money to spare and you actually enjoy the game enough to pay to get a level higher than 10, it's a decent game. It's cute, and it can be used to entertain kids while babysitting or something, which is always useful. However, if you don't have the extra money to spend on a membership for this game, then I suppose it's not really worth playing. There are also some issues with achievements bugging out and that's annoying, because I'm an achivement hound and I thought this game would be a cute waste of time that I could get achievements for, but I've already had two achievements not unlock for me. Overall, I'd say it's an okay game, and it's cute, but with it becoming p2p after only about an hour of gameplay and the achievements bugging out, I can't really recommned it.			"

Please tell gaben. Now all my son does is scream for Nyx to stop, the evil, evil Nyx.

												It started as innocent fun, attempting to bypass the chat system and see if any children would buy drugs I don't have off of me. Almost two deals were made, with only one chat warning. All was well, until the gameplay took hold of me, and the next thing I knew, I was buying myself a membership. I had no control, and I found myself destroying crops with my car and becoming a monster the Nix feared. I feared myself. Who had I become? This game brings out the worst in all of us, and sucks you down a deep dark hole which no one can recover from. No therapy can help me recover from this nightmare.Great for young children, 8/10, would recommend to anyone who wants to kill themselves.			"

												When I think of Steam, I think of a more mature demographic whereas this game is definitely a child's game. Possibly targeted towards Steam players with children. It's a alright game with basic ""go here, come back"" and ""find x amount of y"" mechanics to get kids into gaming with basic little quests and whimisical story, music, and art. It even uses something similar to area wide cooperation quests to boost teamwork. It's a very basic low requirement game that I'm sure can run on decent computers. It's nonviolent so if you happened to want to keep your children from fighting and such, then here it is. The game is a free trial up until level 10, then you can purchase a membership, the lowest being 3.99 for a month to about 30 bucks for a year.Personally, I don't recommend this game mainly because this isn't what I think of when I think of Steam, but there's a possibility Valve is attempting to widen the playerbase, but still. I'm personally not a fan of children's games so I have to make this recommendation a ""No.""			"

												It took me 10 mins.. 10 mins.. to realize this game is not ready for any type of release. When first entered the game, i was asked to make my name.. you get a selection of 3 characters.. You will then select your name.. after that it sends you over to the next task which makes you select your last name and it Glitched out and did not work, so i could not move on.. took me 5 restarts and tries before it worked, just when i thought maybe i am home free i realized i wasn't, i then has to run around touching some odd little animal kid things.. suddenly some type of boss game that i believe you were supposed to fight..well guess what i never got to fight the boss cause soon as the cut scene ended the game again glitched out and i was literally floating in the sky.. mean while im supposed to be fighting a boss that was clearly not flying in the sky with me.. To make matters worse.. in order to do this again you would have to start from beginning again.. NO THANKS. To make matters worse there was no options from what i seen that allow you to make any type of adjustments  resolution and anything else.. only thing i seen is an option at the top of the right hand side of the screen to close the screen, or switch it to full screen or Windowed mode.. and even while in windowed more you cannot scale it.. So far this game is total crap as it stands right now, i really do not have the patients to keep restarting the game because it keeps glitching out due to software issues. Update:So i made it past everything, and finally made it into the game, it wanted me to register my parents email? WTF? to make matters worse, once you sign up and all the fun stuff they want your parents to approve the email so you can chat in public chat lol.. why when i am playing this game do i feel as if ""CHRIS HANSON"" is following me around.I will continue to watch for updates and maybe try this game again later once they have fixed issues for now i don't recommend this game at all.

												While some of the sections above may sound either fanboy-ish or cynical-old-man-ish, that’s simply because there are so many either really good or really bad things that come with Mists of Pandaria.Pros:    Once again the collector’s edition is gorgeous. Blizzard does CE versions very well, and this is no exception. Sure it is a few extra bucks, but for that you get a great looking box, a nice art book, a mouse pad, a DVD, a soundtrack CD, and an in game mount and pet.    The new Pandaren race and Monk class are both really nice additions to the game. I love the whole panda thing, and have since they were introduced way back in Warcraft as an April fools joke.    The Monk class is cool as well since it offers another hybrid class that can tank (my favorite spec). Better yet the tank spec is completely different than any other tank spec, making it a whole lot of fun to play.    The overall look and feel of the game, as well as the music, voice, and storytelling aspects. There are so many more cut scenes included that the game feels like I am participating in a movie rather than just playing a game. It also helps that once again Blizzard has nailed the story lines in each zone, and that really pulls me into the game.    The new dungeons and raids look stunning and are a whole lot of fun to play. While the dungeons are not as hard as the Cataclysm ones were initially, they do have a lot more going on in them. Blizzard has really started to add more abilities to dungeon bosses since Cataclysm, and that makes them much more interesting to fight against.    For once the launch went amazingly well! The game just flowed right into the launch and while there was some congestion at key points in quest chains, there was never a serious holdup. This was probably the best launch yet for a WoW expansion.    Cons        The leveling in the game is once again way to fast. It is just insane to me that after all this waiting for a game players can power through it in less than a day. Sure there is a lot of end game content, and that is what most players want to get to, but it was still too fast by far.        The whole idea of adding Pokemon to the game is more than a little strange to me. While I know the idea is popular with the younger crowd, it seems downright disrespectful to the more serious gamers.        While scenarios looked to be an awesome idea, they fall seriously short. They are way to easy and require way to little cooperation to offer any serious lasting enjoyment.        The simplified talent system is just way to simplified. While I do agree that it offers more meaningful choice when compared to the old talent system, it does so at the expense of a feel of accomplishment or customization. Getting 1 talent every 15 levels doesn’t feel like you are accomplishing anything or able to customize your character at all. Worst of all, all specializations for each class all have access to the same talents. I can think of only one word to describe that: lame.			"

												My friends, I hope you're sitting down. It would probably be weird if you weren't, since you're most likely at a computer. What, you got some kinda standing desk? You think you're better than me?You have never before seen a game like this. While Elder Scrolls Online was busy whoring attention and clogging up all the hype in the MMO market, Amazing World quietly slipped in and is poised to take the market by storm. If you're one of those ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who loves getting in on huge things before they become huge, then jump your sweet, bulbous booty right onto Amazing World right now, because I can tell you that this game is about to blow. The ♥♥♥♥. Up. The control scheme is so god damned tight that you only need four keys and a mouse to do everything-hotkeys are a thing of the past, people! We all know mouse clicks are far faster and more accurate than key presses. With an engaging storyline, riveting, nuanced combat, and abundance of content for both beginners and endgame, Amazing World outclasses any MMO I've played before. Trust me, I've played 'em all: WoW, Perfect World, RIFT, Neverwinter, Ragnarok Online, Ragnarok Online 2, Gaia, MapleShit, and even Elder Scrolls Online. All fall flat on their faces when compared to Amazing World. The graphics are so tight, it's no wonder this is a PC exclusive. With draw distances of almost five feet and incredible 240p textures, it's like you're experiencing this--dare I say--AMAZING world in real life, especially since I can guarantee your ""real"" life will disappear after you become as addicted to Amazing World as everyone who experiences this incredible phenomenon does. I rate this game a 9.8/10. GOTY. Thank you based RIOT, Garen confirmed for best champion.			"

												To preface this review, I am an adult. No I did not get this game for my child or niece/nephew. It started out as an innocent joke. Then it turned into 2.1 hours of going around dazed and confused, constantly glitching out the game to the point it was nearly unplayable. Would I recommend this game for children? No. Would I recommend this game for an adult? No. Was it a waste of my time? No, I actually have very fond memories of this game believe it or not. If you have someone you can convince to play this game with you, you might just have a fun time. Other than that, I wouldn't consider it a good game in any regard whatsoever. That being said, amazing world, you have a dumb little place in my heart.			"

												The Amazing World is an MMO designed for children. The designer's consider it a collectible game akin to that of beanie babies. The point is to collect all the rare clothing and critter skins you can whilst levelling up.The problem? You have to be a VIP with a valid credit card to level up past ten.That does suck, but you are able to level up skills like cookin and such (which serve no purpose other than collecting skins clothes and furniture items).You may also use steam cash to pay for gold coins for more skins and special clothes.I would say anyone complaining about this game for the fact that it forces you to buy VIP after level 10 have missed the fact that VIP isnt even worth it because you can still earn your way to skins and rewards by levelling up your SKILLS. Not your XP level. So technically, you dont have to pay to play its an option and a really stupid one at that because you can earn everything in the game vips get off the bat and the mini games are designed for kids 5 and up. So its pretty damn easy to just spam missions to level skills for clothes and stuff. Other than that the game is cute and fun. But dont bother if you're looking for an epic mmo. This is quite literally, a kids game.			"

With an intricate arcing storyline that will keep you busy collecting rainbowberries for dog people and turning sparkly potatos into curly fries - you'll never feel a grind. It's exciting.

I also have a tripple monitor setup and there is literally no settings or options for it, so it spans across all screens, and I can't change it.These are frustrating enough that I'm going to be uninstalling it, I wouldn't recomend this for those reasons, I'm actually not sure if the game is any good or not, because she never got to play.

And now have to explore a new world, swing skills, search for treasure and complete quests to hunt for reklikviyami, etc., etc.. You can even build a house and arrange well the territory around it.The drawback of the game is very hard Donat, the in-game store a ton of gear, at some point it becomes clear that no further reals will be very tight.As for the cartoon and the age restriction. It can be seen that the game is for children, but this is the feature and some scandalous popularity of the game. Like the universe, My Little Pony game attracts some adults older than 18 years, as well as ordinary people with a good sense of humor (see. Gameplay video).In any case, 3 hours it is possible to play and pobesitsya, especially if you go to the game once the crowd. "

												Where to start.I recommend that if you are like me and you want to look like the coolest animal out there, then don't play this game. If you just want a game to play to pass the time, then go for it. One problem is actually a personal problem. One thing I don't like about this game is that there are certain quests where you have to pick up items. I am an impatient person, so when I got the item off the floor, I would be unable to move for 4 or 5 seconds. This really grinds my gears.The main problem is that it is a pay to get anything. I came into this game because I thought it looked cute and I thought I was going to be able to buy all the outfits and unlock all the achievements. I later on realized that you can't get all the achievements because there is a level cap for non-members. The level cap for members is 50 while for normal players it is 10. Since the level cap is 10, a perosn can only buy the level 10 outfits in the world store. I want to look cool when I play, so I would have liked to buy the cooler clothes. The second problem with the level cap is that there are only 4 NPC's that can give someone quests that is a non-member. You need to be a higher level to take quests from other NPC's and the game gets somewhat repetitive with the same 4.All in all, I would have to say it is an okay game			"

												I was able to do drugs and hang out with my new friends in Amazing World. I really like the PvP system where you can fight other players around town and kill the NPCs while doing it. Obviously the NPCs respawn after awhile. The twist with the PvP is that it's permanent death, so you have to make a new character if you die. What I really like is that it's pretty much GTA and that Naughty Bear game combined into one great MMO for everyone 17+. Letting your kids play this is a big mistake, as I have seen a few kids get PTSD from playing. The guides are also really helpful in surviving this game's complex system. Membership is totally worth it, trust me. You get the option to be in the Mafia once you buy the membership.			"

												Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Alright, so what the effects of the nitrous I took at the dentist haven't worn off yet? I'm fine. So, this game is great if you get off to tourturing yourself. Or if you enjoy...    Well ok, there's absolutley nothing enjoyable about this game, I've only played for like five ♥♥♥♥ing minutes and I had already glitched through the ♥♥♥♥ing map. I wan't even trying to. It just sort of happened. I never did find out if there were microtransactiong, though I assume you have to pay out the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥to play this game. Well, it sucks but there is one redeeming factor, the uninstall works perfectly! -99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10			"

												I love this game. This game loves me. It's been my life goal to play this game. I sold my house to play this game. I hate the NY Knix so killing the dumbass Nix made me feel good. No matter how many times I pull a gun to my head. I think for a second. Did God bring me to this game? I thought masturbating ferociously to this game with a gun in my other hand. I looked at myself in the mirror. And thought for a few days. Not eating. Not sleeping. Not even♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥little girls like usual. Somethings wrong with me. I'm 26 years old. My girlfriend's 9, I am a naked fox with glasses. I play this game and think of my childhood memories. The game reminds me of the movie ""Zootopia"" in a way. Ah. My parents suffered a double heart-attack after finding out that I was Autistic when I turned 3. I don't know how they couldn't tell because it looks like my mom did meth while I was in her womb. Did she? I look like my mom went on a drug spree and I developed downsyndrome. I NEED TO PLAY MORE! ONE MORE TIME!-Naked fox runs into a bunch of pink elephants.-Says ""ALLAHUAKBAR"".-Banned.			"

												Never before have I experienced gameplay as astoundingly superb and visuals as pristine and beautiful as that of Amazing World. Released for the Nintendo Gamecube November 17, 2001, Amazing World has become a huge hit in a nitch community that widely regards it as the definitive best competitive video game of all time. Amazing World isn't just a game, it's an experience. it is a eat, breathe, sleep, drink, and feel in ways you've never felt before. After playing Amazing World for the first time I was promptly sucked off by 100 4 year olds at the same time. Never before have I experienced such orgastic sensations. Overall, Amazing World is just as the name implies; Amazing. Never before has any game reached the magnitude of influence on my life this one has. Needless to say, Amazing World is by far the greatest work of art ever to be created by mankind. 7.8/10 too much water.			"

												Ok considering the target audience is the child-population this game is a great start. BUT - Like so many of my other ""Just Curious Reviews"" - it is not for the avid gamer, nor is it intended in any form to be similiar to a ""real"" MMORPG - although it advertises ""violence free"" there are enemies, but there's no attack animation, and the mobs just disappear when you run into them. Obviously not worth downloading if your above 13 years old or so, since you can find plenty of more age-appropriate games by then. Like it or not violence is the key to existence in the MMO market, or any sufficently advanced game market. Just putting it under cloak and dagger is not ""violence free"" it's ""delaying the inevitable"". BUT - Children need not be exposed to such until they are ready so this is a good go-between. Due to the wardrobe design I don't think this game's ""Dress-up"" was aimed at anything more than a 2 -  3 year old, and certainly is not ""girly"" enough to be aimed explicitly at girls (or the odd curious boy who likes things like that). Additionally as I feared before downloading it does not support humanoid player characters, quite the shame.			"

We could not stop laughing out loud.We felt ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the whole game is so much KAWAII ^^ that you have to be kicked in the balls to feel man again, if you are man, of course.So this game is made for children you could say- well it is not. Kids play CS:GO, BF4, CoD:AW and stuff like that with cool graphics.In this game, you will find mostly adults. Maybe much more older than me.The game has very strict comment censore, tho. If you do not type in english, every word is censored with ""...""Fun atmoshpere and relaxing game and you laugh a lot.Play it with friends.Have fun!			"

												This game is one of the most amazing things that I've ever played. This goeas ahead and shames every game before it with it's masterclass visual style, voice acting, superbly writen dialogue and tearjerking story. Since the story of Modern Warfare 2, I've been looking for a game that would just absolutely provoke as much emoition out of me as that did and now that game is finally in my hands. Best of all? It's free and I can play it with my bestest internet friends. 10/10: This game is literally enlightenment.			"

												I had downloaded this game for fun, I heard it gave people cancer and I thought to myself,""Surely it can't be this bad"".  And you know what? It wasn't, well, it was but more on that later. So anyways, there is a lot of good mmorpg games (if you can even call this game that) and fortunately, this isn't one of them. From what I can tell of the 10 minutes I played this game, it is this rpg type of game kinda like club penguin except way worse, and my main problem was, it wasn't fun, I found my self just walking around this town filled with five year olds who enjoy this game and I just couldn't wrap my head around it, I'd be running around, looking for a quest, and I couldn't find anything, the game had a real big pay2play problem kinda like tf2 but not really because in team fortress you can find items and it's not really pay2play. I spun this large wheel and I got 125 coins, what did I do with them? Absolutely nothing, I couldn't buy anything because I didn't have enough coins or I was a low level. In all honesty, don't waste your time on this game, please. There's much better games that are free to play like teamfortress, quake live,etc. And they are a million times better than this peice of trash, do I recommend this game? no, with the crappy mechanics it has, the crappy pay2play system and on top of that, theres no fighting, I understand it's a kids game, but c'mon there are some kids games that are better and still bad, but have a combat system. This game is trash and I will never recommend it. Don't waste your time and money. All in all, this game didn't give me cancer though, it gave me aids, darn.			"

Then you get thrown into a world for little 5 year olds that probably dont know what steam is. Like why the F*** is this Sh*t on steam?! Even the account making says: ask permission from your parents...Then I play for 10 minutes untill I decide that this is a game for todlers and not for people that use steam. Then I close it. What happens? It says that I'm still playing the game! It wouldnt stop for 24 hours straight. I had to restart my computer for it to actually say it was closed. 24 HOURS! I played the game for real only 10 minutes and like a bit of loading time.But the uninstall button works so thats 1 point1/10 Would uninstall again ( why is this on steam?)			"

												Ok so lemme get this straight,I installed this game to see what it was. It looked interesting. Then you get thrown into a world for little 5 year olds that probably dont know what steam is. Like why the F*** is this Sh*t on steam?! Even the account making says: ask permission from your parents...Then I play for 10 minutes untill I decide that this is a game for todlers and not for people that use steam. Then I close it. What happens? It says that I'm still playing the game! It wouldnt stop for 24 hours straight. I had to restart my computer for it to actually say it was closed. 24 HOURS! I played the game for real only 10 minutes and like a bit of loading time.But the uninstall button works so thats 1 point1/10 Would uninstall again ( why is this on steam?)			"

												Basically another one of those stupid, 'Hey welcome to this new ""free"" game where you can ""chat"" with mates and enjoy yourself. However, to look like a dapper♥♥♥♥♥teddy you gotta  pump your food money into it to wear a fedora or an afro. Also, why does this game have a chat filter? The infants playing this game will learn about The N4zi Invasions soon enough....would not recommend IGN 0/10Dont waste the 180mb (its really not worth that)			"

												(I played in a browser so the time on steam isn't correct) The game is great and provides many challenges, innovating gameplay and lots of loot to collect such as a squid backpack. It does however requires payment after lv 10 but you can go on playing quite a bit after that anyway. There are many proffesions in the game to level up so it's quite similar to Runescape. These include stuff like fishing, cooking and archeology. These have very deep mechanics and you can use the resources for many different things.The game is heavily inspired by Guild Wars 2 as well with world events appearing randomly everywhere. Together with your zing comrades, you have to complete them and you get rewarded based on how well you did. The game also provides a great PvP component where you have to battle other zings in the events to become the leading helper and get the greatest reward.Other features that are great include: Player housing. You can customise your garden, yard, house and many other thing with the gear you aquire in quests. Speaking of quests, this is another great aspect of the game.There are many questlines, each with unique skill rewards and loot. The quests range from simple ""collect x things"" to puzzles, racing, platforming and shooting segments. The questlines never get repetetive and thanks to a well made fast travelling mechanic, the game never gets tedious.Simply put, this is a great mmorpg with lots of variety. The game borrows mechanics from other games to create a truly refined and unique experience. The only downside is the membership requirment after lv 10. (max lv is 50). But the cost is low at 2,99 $ a month and I deeply recommend it for that cost.This is a game that deserves attention because of its finely crafted experience. Add me in game, my name is JiggleTitts. I give this game 9/10.			"

												I liked the artwork and the early story line; the early script and voice acting is much better than some more mature games I've played  - though it looks like it is designed for small children (in which case not sure why it's on steam seeing as you need to be 13 to use Steam), people with a simple mental capability need or those who like EXTREME in casual gaming. You are forced to be nice by filters in a multiplayer make believe world where you choose a character, dress it and design a home. To obtain decor and clothing you must complete simple quests with very easy puzzles or tasks and simple minigames to earn currency and/or items (some of which you can use in crafting.) On the plus side to being simple, it's impossible for people to be rude, irritating or steal your stuff!The membership is not expensive but the microtransactions for items are; by the time you've bought anything worth having you could have bought a much better fully functioning game with less bugs and without extra costs of membership and dumb microtransactions.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												While the sub fee of this game is almost nothing compared to a standard a MMO, at $30 per year, the game is not F2P, and is fundamentally a demo.I was very very interested in playing this game to see if a Kid's focused MMO could make the game, and it is, from the short of it, well made (or, at least, not thrown together haphazardly like so many wowclones)However, Valve doesn't give a damn about steam, because it just prints money, and now I can't even launch the game.Wish I could downvote Steam proper, but whatever.But, at this point, I have to recommend it, because it is Valve's fault for this posting, and the game is 2 years sub fee for the cost of a single AAA title...So ♥♥♥♥ valve, but try this game if you want to try something a little familiar but a little different.

												Amazing World is a fun little MMO aimed at a younger audience. That in no way means you should feel bad for playing it! Everyone can enjoy their time in Spring Bay! To help you make the most of the game, I recommend disabling chat and going it alone. The stories are charming and the characters are unique and surprisingly well developed. You don’t need to talk to the other players, even in cooperative games, and if you’re respectfully uncomfortable interacting with children, you’re better off not talking at all. I also recommend purchasing a one month membership, as you’ll probably be able to finish everything in that time and you can continue playing for free afterword. The benefits of being a member are numerous and well worth the small initial price to unlock the full game. You do not need to invest in optional decorations and additional playable characters, so the micro transaction system shouldn’t be a deal breaker for anyone. You can complete all of the character’s stories and secure a wide variety of items and properties without buying more in-game currency. You won’t, however, be able to get all of the achievements.

												A lot of people might give this game a bad review because they feel out of place and don't like the monthly fee. Well firstly, this game is made for kids, so no wonder you feel out of place. I quit after hitting 10 and being unable to progress, but it felt like the perfect game for kids, and even I was getting into it.As for the subscription, microtransactions would be bad in a game meant for kids. Subscription is simple, the parents decide if it's worth the money, then just pay once a month. What do little kids want with gear or exp boosters? Kids play games to actually have fun, not get to the top of the leaderboards.Overall, I highly recommend this game to any parents looking for a fun game for their kids (probably 9 and younger, but older works too if they like more simplistic pacifist gameplay), if you don't mind paying a monthly fee.

												This game.... is perfection. I'm being completely serious, never before have I had such a great spiritual connection with a game. You may think this is a childs game but I beg you to play it, it will open your eyes. Before playing this game I never thought that a simple man would be able to match God's creative power, but it has been achieved. From the astonishingly good character creation to the thrilling gameplay, nothing is below the barrier of utter perfection. NOTHING. That is why I can safely say that this is the best game, no, I shouldn't call it a game, the best work of art that can ever be made. ╠ýÃ/10			"

												First i want to say, that the term ""Free to play"" needs to be redefined.You can play for free until you become level 10, (You can still play, but not advance on your main xp) then you have to subscribe to a monthly membership.There are two kinds of progression, the XP and SP. you get SP (skill points) for certian missions, such as cooking, science, depending on which chacters you speak to. These missions and skills can be played and leveled foreverSome of the characters require you to be a certain level to speak with them (XP lvl), and that's the one that will only get to level 10 for free playersIt's a cute MMO, or just MO, it is not that massive. You run around questing, doing different mini games, chat with others, decorate you house, or whatever you feel like.decorations and outfits can be earned doing quest, or be bought using either in-game cash or eshop coins. I cannot comment on the story or what happens after a certain point in the game since i did not pay, but I enjoyed it, and would recommend it though its unfortunate free players don't get more than a small demo.

												Playing the first 10 minutes, it was fun. The game is clearly aimed at children, but as an adult (or perhaps I'm still a kid at heart?), this game seemed fun. Upon starting, you're on an airship as a teddy animal creature. You're heading to a new home, peaceful lands, ect, ect. Soon, an evil queen wants to wreck the world (Natural MMO storyline) and you've got to move into town to stop her. Ok, seems fun so far! Story quests to complete, simple game mechanics... Oh wait, did you forget to mention the part where 'free to play' secretly means 'we want your money because 'Insert reason here'.Yes, this game MAY be advertised as 'Free to Play', but it's so full of Microtransactions, it might as well be 'Free to Download'. I'd say steer away from this game, unless you plan to fork out for a lot of stuff			"

WHY NOT MAKE IT 30$ AND BE FREE FOREVER (in-game) ??? 29$ FOR ONE YEAR? YOU FINISH THE GAME IN 1 DAY IF YOU COULD PLAY NON-STOP! SCREW YOU GUYS!Pros :- as much as you progress as many thing unlocks- as much as you progress in story , many , many things will change visualy- you levelup fast- Many characters to have missions from- houses and gardens to customize- missions from the same character after completing the story from that characterCons :- you cant levelup higher than 10 without payinglol , that was all cons that i found ( beacuse couldnt get higher than lvl 10) ^_^Bugs/Glitches :- when in car minigames/missions sometimes you hit the air , and lose your speed- sometimes when digging holes in the starter missions , you get stuck in the full hole and you must type something to unblock you ex.  ...   then you can moveWith that less cons , and that small price ... YES , i recommend this game for your kids.  i would so like to have a credit card to buy membership... :(			"

												A lot of people might give this game a bad review because they feel out of place and don't like the monthly fee. Well firstly, this game is made for kids, so no wonder you feel out of place. I quit after hitting 10 and being unable to progress, but it felt like the perfect game for kids, and even I was getting into it.As for the subscription, microtransactions would be bad in a game meant for kids. Subscription is simple, the parents decide if it's worth the money, then just pay once a month. What do little kids want with gear or exp boosters? Kids play games to actually have fun, not get to the top of the leaderboards.Overall, I highly recommend this game to any parents looking for a fun game for their kids (probably 9 and younger, but older works too if they like more simplistic pacifist gameplay), if you don't mind paying a monthly fee.

												I both recommend and not recommend this game depending on what you're looking for. To be fair this game is free to play, but you are very limited if you keep it free. On another note, the subscription to enjoy the perks is also quite cheap but its still debatable to me whether its actually worth it, then again, although my inner child loves this, my inner child is also older than 8 and after a few hours of gameplay gets very bored. ACHIEVEMENT HUNTERS BEWARE!! The BAD stuff...Free to Play yes, but note that if you want ALL achievements or want to make it past level 10 you need to pay for a subsciption and spend over $100USD in the end to unlock everything. While the game is cute and friendly and great for kids, player beware your kids playing this will bug the hell out of you for all the premium stuff you cant get without spending the money. Although i can safely add my experience with it and that of my kids has been enjoyable, and safe (in regards to language filters, safety etc.) there are better things out there just as safe for kids that make premium stuff optional and do not impact the overall game enjoyment. If you want something safe for kids, better to sign them up for Neopets than this. I'll be stopping my subscription soon, its really not worth it. GOOD THINGS TO NOTE:If you're happy with the limited gameplay without a subscription or a vitual babysitter for small children (and i mean any older than 8 or they may start to get bored after a time) then i would actually recommend it. The graphics are adorable, pastel and colorful and certainly it does have a lot of potential. There are a number of mini games that are fun as well and rewards for winners that just enhance your character for a small duration of the time. Play out character quests to increase how they interact with you and see their stories develop. Make friends, play tag, collect your daily prizes from the wheel. Also note while curse words, common names, numbers and various religious words are screened, combinations of harmless word phrases to make obscene refs are not, so a parent has to ask themselves, ""Will my child be smart enough to realize these references are rude or am i just being paranoid?"". Unless your child is early teens like 10 onwards they likely wont get any of them and like childhood innocense find them hilarious. There is the option to report players anyway if necessary. The environment in general is friendly, and bad stuff doesnt exist. No evil, just miscrevious little creatures that cause problems sometimes. Your child will at least be safe here in this fantasy land of no death, gore and where everything is sugarpop rainbows with sprinkles on top~!			"

Then i found a pumpkin which gave me an item that left a green trail which looked like i was crapping my pants constantly, it also released the most terrifyingly empty sound i have ever heard, like a universal buzz which mutes every other sound effect in the game accept for the amazingly load water, of course. overall a very enjoyable experience once my ears stopped bleeding and the ptsd wore off.

												First i want to say, that the term ""Free to play"" needs to be redefined.You can play for free until you become level 10, (You can still play, but not advance on your main xp) then you have to subscribe to a monthly membership.There are two kinds of progression, the XP and SP. you get SP (skill points) for certian missions, such as cooking, science, depending on which chacters you speak to. These missions and skills can be played and leveled foreverSome of the characters require you to be a certain level to speak with them (XP lvl), and that's the one that will only get to level 10 for free playersIt's a cute MMO, or just MO, it is not that massive. You run around questing, doing different mini games, chat with others, decorate you house, or whatever you feel like.decorations and outfits can be earned doing quest, or be bought using either in-game cash or eshop coins. I cannot comment on the story or what happens after a certain point in the game since i did not pay, but I enjoyed it, and would recommend it though its unfortunate free players don't get more than a small demo.

												this is a game that sort of seems out of place on steam but also glad its on here. Was looking for a game to replace viacom's petpet park when it closed last year and so far, seems to win on that front.  Not going to tax most systems or need anything special for a video card which is nice. On the negative it does need a membership to fully unlock it, but its rather inexpensive really if your into these sort of games, 3.99 a month or 30 dollars for a whole year and theirs not a whole lot of customizing your zings with their apparances, but you sure get a lot of spaces for multiple ones. In general if folks do have chat enabled in this game, its friendly and generally helpful to what your doing. but keep in mind parents must enable the chat function so its rare to see kids using this.

												A lot of people might give this game a bad review because they feel out of place and don't like the monthly fee. Well firstly, this game is made for kids, so no wonder you feel out of place. I quit after hitting 10 and being unable to progress, but it felt like the perfect game for kids, and even I was getting into it.As for the subscription, microtransactions would be bad in a game meant for kids. Subscription is simple, the parents decide if it's worth the money, then just pay once a month. What do little kids want with gear or exp boosters? Kids play games to actually have fun, not get to the top of the leaderboards.Overall, I highly recommend this game to any parents looking for a fun game for their kids (probably 9 and younger, but older works too if they like more simplistic pacifist gameplay), if you don't mind paying a monthly fee.

												Amazing World is a much different kind of mmo instead of fighting action packed you get cute funny little animals. It focuses on taking care of your very own garden and help the the town from being took over by the Queen Vexa. Now your more of just running up to the nix and scaring em off but theres a lot more to the game then all that. Theirs cute and fun minigames that seem to be different every time to from a mario like side scroller to riding a cute little car or even fixing puzzles.  The down side of it is once you hit level 10 you hit the end of the road for free to play. Now $4 a month seems reasonable to me for this funny little game but if you don't pay no more game for you! Its would be good for any age as long as they like cute.			"

												Seriously, it is a good game... for a few minutes.First of all, I had trouble trying to set up my account. This was just minor though, fixed with a restart.The animations could use a LOT more work, and the minigame system is pretty lame. Oh, yeah, and you can only go up to level ten? And every nice aspect of your house is locked to members? Yeah, that sucks. It might be good for children whose parents are willing to pay for them to play, but overall I'd give this a thumbs down.

												You can only go up to level ten before you have to pay in order to advance to further levels unfortunately.I know it's a free to play game and has to get funding from somewhere but it's kinda ridiculous to make players have to pay in order to level up past a certain level.Not to mention a large portion of stuff in the shop was buyable by members only anyway so I don't think limiting leveling is really necessary.Either way I had fun for the short time I was able to play but I'd still not recommend it for the reasons above			"

												This game is amazing. It is also world. When those two things collide it creates something very magical. Would recommend to everyone except my cousin Larry (he doesn't like the video games). Very lore intensive for those who like to seek out hidden story plots. Pretty solid kid-friendly hardcore MMORPGFPSBBQ hack'n'slash sim game that has absolutely nothing wrong with it at all because it's simply just an Amazing World™.			"

The community of fellow ""Zings"" is fantastic, and any time you feel threatened by Nixx's they will help you.I rate this game a solid, gold plater, grade A 10/10, and I would genuinely recommend this video game experience, or master piece as I like to call it, to anyone who has the audacity to play something this ground breaking and revolutionary. This game will be the eulogy played out at my funeral for I believe that from this point onwards it will define who I am.Amazing World is the gift to the human race that God wishes he could give.Five Stars, please play. I am in no way affiliated with this game or the Zing people. Just an awe struck fan, turned away from the dark side of triple A filth.

												Amazing World is an interesting idea, and one that I can honestly say I enjoy almost completely. Despite being a child's MMO game, it has enough in it to interest most MMO fans, at least to a certain degree.Originally, I downloaded this game on my sister's laptop to see if she would enjoy it (she didn't really have anything except The Sims 2 & 3). We were both instantly drawn in to the cutesy style and well-designed world that the game presented, and played it for a day straight, max-leveling one of the accouts we made to the highest non-pay level. Once we got back home, I downloaded it on THIS steam account to see if the multiplayer worked. Amazing World is similar to Skyrim in that you cannot play it for just a few minutes, at least if you enjoy the game. Whilst I initally only went on to try the multiplayer, I ended up completing a full character story and earning about 6000 coins!Speaking of characters, all are well-voiced and each have their own personalities. While I won't list them all, the best by far were Annoying (a navi-like little probe robot with a very teenage-girl-like attitude and style of speech) and Brick (a carpenter who sees himself as fearless but gets scared very easily). Whilst some are locked until levels higher than 10, the ones that we have had a chance to meet are charming and well-made.Overall, whilst I do enjoy the game, I always feel a bit awkward playing it seperately to my sister (since we spent a while playing it on the same device at the same time). It's worth at least an hour or two of play even if you don't like anything about it. As my sister said, ""it's Moshi Monsters, but better"".			"

												Who cares what about what people who have played this game for ten minutes say. You can't just play a game for 0.2 hours and then confidently  declare it's a piece of crap. Go away. Bye.This game reminds me reminds me of Webkinz, also made by Ganz, and Toontown, a game by Disney recently shut down. I love both of those games and it was nice to see a combination of them. You pretty much just run around doing quests for various people around town. This game is meant for little children, so it does get a bit repetitive, but I still enjoyed it for the time I've played and I think I'll play a little more too. I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes MMO games made for younger audiences.			"

It is extremely cutsy, so if that's not something you like, definately steer clear. Otherwise, it has lots of different tasks to level up, clothing and house items to collect and environment to explore. The community seems friendly enough and my son and I are having fun playing this together!			"

												Before anyone says anything did i play a game made for mental paitients and babies? Yeh i did, And did i like the game? Yes i did, And you know what it don't care. Sure this game wasn't World Of Warcraft brilliant but what do you expect from a childrens MMO game?For a kids game though the open world was kind of impressive, Like i said before not WOW open world but still not bad for a kids game. The graphics aren't to bad either and the open world looks pretty as an old man flying away on a frat boy with wings.  (Wich if you didn't realise is very beautiful). One thing that made me ammazed is that you can levelup, gain money, do main story quest, side quest and even upgrade your home!I was also supprised that this game ran smoothly, I didn't have a single bit of lag through out my hole play through. Anyway now on to the main part of any game the gameplay.The game controls like resident eveil on pc wich takes a while to get used to. Most of the game consits of gardening, running around and doing chores and possible a few home decorations along the way. And it was fairly enjoyable.I like this game and guess what should i care that i do? NO I SHOULDN'T I DON'T GIVE A SINGLE♥♥♥♥♥♥ DON'T YOU DARE SENSER ME STEAM!....Son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. Anyways now to my final result of this game. And i would give it a.7.5 out of ten.Yes for someone who isn't a little kid this game would be meh. But for a little kid its brilliant and thats the way i have to review it, Through the eyes of a little kid.Anyways im gonna go play with my crossdresser in this game see you later!			"

												I'll admit it, I love quirky, childish-looking MMOs. I always have. Be it Grand Fantasia from Aeria Games, or this particular MMO, something draws me to them. I played this game for two hours before writing this review. I love the art style, the bright colors, the whimsical nature of the game itself. I was a bit concerned with the fact that it is only F2P for the first 10 LEVELS, with any leveling past that requiring a subscription (monthly, 6-month, or yearly). I appreciate the fact that it is marketed toward children, because there aren't a lot of child-marketed MMOs for burgeoning gamers (like my neice). However, I think the game should be like many other F2P that include subscription services in that the features are only lightly restrictive, not to the point that you CANNOT LEVEL AT ALL past 10. I will say this - the voice acting was nice, the characters are quirky, and I enjoy the humor. It is also runs very well on my netbook. I like that it has elements reminiscent of Mabinogi or Villagers and Heroes (fishing, owning and decorating a home, a garden), but I'd love to see what else this game has to offer. I suppose I'll cough up the $3.99 for at least one month to see how it goes. All in all, despite the issue with the restrictions on F2P members, I really enjoyed what little I've played of this game and will likely continue. I'd give it a 7/10 at this time. Give it a shot, at least.			"

And the support page they link you to to report issues dont get any answers from the staff. Am writing this as my toon is frozen in place after trying to do a simple quest. Cant say anything in chat since the email they send to enble chat links to a error page. So basicaly mute and stuck just because I dared to hand out books. And its not free to play since they lock you at lev 10 till you buy a membership. As it stands this game needs to work out all its bugs and make a effort to support its players better.			"

												Amazing World is the most horrific game I have ever played, heck, let alone game, it's the most horrific THING I've ever witnessed! Torture is a common theme in this psychological game, as the game's known merciless villain, Bloom, frequently feeds off of the tortured animals in her basement. Oh god the horror of this game. The Springs village has blood everywhere, rotten animal organs around every corner, with painful sounding moans, screams and wimpers as the game's soundtrack. One of the most effective part is where there's a scene where the character of ""Twinkle"" is decapitated slowly and painfully by rusty nail clippers in an incredibly explicit scene where you can see all of the pain in her crying face while it happens. Amazing World changed my life. It showed me how wonderful my life truly is for not living in this horrid civilisation, and I'm rethinking any negative thought I've ever had in my life. Which is why Amazing World is my favourite video game, heck, favourite THING in the known universe.Masterpiece.			"

												Amazing World is an interesting idea, and one that I can honestly say I enjoy almost completely. Despite being a child's MMO game, it has enough in it to interest most MMO fans, at least to a certain degree.Originally, I downloaded this game on my sister's laptop to see if she would enjoy it (she didn't really have anything except The Sims 2 & 3). We were both instantly drawn in to the cutesy style and well-designed world that the game presented, and played it for a day straight, max-leveling one of the accouts we made to the highest non-pay level. Once we got back home, I downloaded it on THIS steam account to see if the multiplayer worked. Amazing World is similar to Skyrim in that you cannot play it for just a few minutes, at least if you enjoy the game. Whilst I initally only went on to try the multiplayer, I ended up completing a full character story and earning about 6000 coins!Speaking of characters, all are well-voiced and each have their own personalities. While I won't list them all, the best by far were Annoying (a navi-like little probe robot with a very teenage-girl-like attitude and style of speech) and Brick (a carpenter who sees himself as fearless but gets scared very easily). Whilst some are locked until levels higher than 10, the ones that we have had a chance to meet are charming and well-made.Overall, whilst I do enjoy the game, I always feel a bit awkward playing it seperately to my sister (since we spent a while playing it on the same device at the same time). It's worth at least an hour or two of play even if you don't like anything about it. As my sister said, ""it's Moshi Monsters, but better"".			"

This game will show you that death is the only way out. I met a beautiful goddess of a bear named Bloom, can't wait to hit that♥♥♥♥♥♥ she wants the d she was telling me how I'm going to be her hero mmmm mmmm. This game, fron start to finish is more sexually stimulating than Nicki Minaj in a 10 man gangbang. I am now going to hang myself due to the fact that Bloom will never accept me as a human.

												Well to begin with the game is VERY cute. It is very easy to pick up and play and is child-friendly. There are definitely some bugs, but this is a new game so there is definitely hope of them getting fixed too. The first character I made I lost because when it got to the registration part it didn't work. I could not put in a username at all. So I restarted the game, made a new character, and then it worked. I was enjoying it until I kept getting very laggy as I phased in and out during the beginning quests, after you get to the town. Then I noticed a lot of adverts for membership. I also noticed some microtransactions. So this game is geared towards children and yet requires you to throw money at it. In my opinion, I do not like this. I feel like it lures kids in and then requires a membership and microtransactions for them to enjoy it. Its like baking a cake in front of a kid and then letting them lick the icing off of the spatula and then telling them to ask their parents for money so they can have a slice. So I guess this game is fine if you don't mind throwing money at a buggy game for your kid.TL;DR very cute, very easy to play, very buggy, needs membership and microtransactions to be fully enjoyed			"

												Amazing World is a fun little MMO aimed at a younger audience. That in no way means you should feel bad for playing it! Everyone can enjoy their time in Spring Bay! To help you make the most of the game, I recommend disabling chat and going it alone. The stories are charming and the characters are unique and surprisingly well developed. You don’t need to talk to the other players, even in cooperative games, and if you’re respectfully uncomfortable interacting with children, you’re better off not talking at all. I also recommend purchasing a one month membership, as you’ll probably be able to finish everything in that time and you can continue playing for free afterword. The benefits of being a member are numerous and well worth the small initial price to unlock the full game. You do not need to invest in optional decorations and additional playable characters, so the micro transaction system shouldn’t be a deal breaker for anyone. You can complete all of the character’s stories and secure a wide variety of items and properties without buying more in-game currency. You won’t, however, be able to get all of the achievements.

												You can only go up to level ten before you have to pay in order to advance to further levels unfortunately.I know it's a free to play game and has to get funding from somewhere but it's kinda ridiculous to make players have to pay in order to level up past a certain level.Not to mention a large portion of stuff in the shop was buyable by members only anyway so I don't think limiting leveling is really necessary.Either way I had fun for the short time I was able to play but I'd still not recommend it for the reasons above			"

												Despite being a young man with little money to my name, I relatively enjoyed this game. However, this is more ideal for anyone 12 and under, who have access to their parents' credit card.Pros Hello Kitty-esque game art for lolis. (What can I say? I like pastels.) Cute character choices that make one squeal like a girl. (Guilty. Don't care.) Hilarious randomly generated names such as ""Pompenstance"". Somewhat cringey dialouge that's actually amusing. Adorable outfits and accessories for your character. (Wow. I felt really gay typing that.)Cons Plot holes that leave you confused and in the dust. (Like did I not help on ship? And who is Vexa?) Poor camera and movement controls. Dead end quests that you can't fulfill due to glitches. Poor mini game designs with wonky controls. Poor shop design accompanied by a somewhat confusing monetary system. Level capping that you end up reaching without difficulty. Forces you to pay membership if you wish to get past the level cap.As you can see, the cons end up out-weighing the pros. Play it if you wish. But keep in mind that if you don't want to pay for a membership, your time playing this game will be short lived.			"

												This game.... is perfection. I'm being completely serious, never before have I had such a great spiritual connection with a game. You may think this is a childs game but I beg you to play it, it will open your eyes. Before playing this game I never thought that a simple man would be able to match God's creative power, but it has been achieved. From the astonishingly good character creation to the thrilling gameplay, nothing is below the barrier of utter perfection. NOTHING. That is why I can safely say that this is the best game, no, I shouldn't call it a game, the best work of art that can ever be made. ╠ýÃ/10			"

												This game is literally the best thing I've ever seen on Steam. I saw the game on the free to play list, and wasn't expecting much. Free games aren't always the most fun, but for some reason, this caught my attention. I installed it immediately, but then realized that all players had to register with their parents' information. I feared lying to the game, and knew that they only wanted to protect me, as the game is safe for children of all ages. After much begging, I finally got my parents' approval for this breathtaking game, and was ready to begin my journey. I entered the game, immediately blown away. These cute cartoons, these loveable characters, they were all so colorful, and just beautiful! The THREE different types of characters were so similar, yet at the same time, they all held a different story, ready to be created by the player, and after much debate, I settled with the blue bunny. There were about a whole five different outfits to choose from, and I was already very pleased with the amount of choices I was already given. I have never been so awestruck by a game before. I made my way through the tutorial, gasping at every turn of events the story held for me, and crying along with the characters at every scene that pulled my heartstrings. I had never experienced a more moving tale before. Once I passed the tutorial, I was transported into a town with many other players, all of which were enjoying the game just as much as me. The chat filter the game held protecting me, as well as the other gamers from any profanities, such as the words ""loser"", ""freak"", ""suck"", and anything of that nature. After putting so much time and effort into playing this game, I was very pleased with the results. It is a beautiful game, probably the best I've ever played. All of you should immediately download and play this game.In all honesty, this game would suck unless you're around the age of three. I gave it a try to troll the kids in it, but the chat filter is incredibly silly, and prevented my friends and I from saying any even slightly profanic words. I wish you luck if you are willing to play this xD.			"

												First i want to say, that the term ""Free to play"" needs to be redefined.You can play for free until you become level 10, (You can still play, but not advance on your main xp) then you have to subscribe to a monthly membership.There are two kinds of progression, the XP and SP. you get SP (skill points) for certian missions, such as cooking, science, depending on which chacters you speak to. These missions and skills can be played and leveled foreverSome of the characters require you to be a certain level to speak with them (XP lvl), and that's the one that will only get to level 10 for free playersIt's a cute MMO, or just MO, it is not that massive. You run around questing, doing different mini games, chat with others, decorate you house, or whatever you feel like.decorations and outfits can be earned doing quest, or be bought using either in-game cash or eshop coins. I cannot comment on the story or what happens after a certain point in the game since i did not pay, but I enjoyed it, and would recommend it though its unfortunate free players don't get more than a small demo.

												Despite being a young man with little money to my name, I relatively enjoyed this game. However, this is more ideal for anyone 12 and under, who have access to their parents' credit card.Pros Hello Kitty-esque game art for lolis. (What can I say? I like pastels.) Cute character choices that make one squeal like a girl. (Guilty. Don't care.) Hilarious randomly generated names such as ""Pompenstance"". Somewhat cringey dialouge that's actually amusing. Adorable outfits and accessories for your character. (Wow. I felt really gay typing that.)Cons Plot holes that leave you confused and in the dust. (Like did I not help on ship? And who is Vexa?) Poor camera and movement controls. Dead end quests that you can't fulfill due to glitches. Poor mini game designs with wonky controls. Poor shop design accompanied by a somewhat confusing monetary system. Level capping that you end up reaching without difficulty. Forces you to pay membership if you wish to get past the level cap.As you can see, the cons end up out-weighing the pros. Play it if you wish. But keep in mind that if you don't want to pay for a membership, your time playing this game will be short lived.			"

												Far too unstable. Tried to start a character for my daughter, the first time the game crashed hard during clothing selection. Later, it crashed when leaving the house area. The final crash that used up the last of my patience was after winning the gold in a random event game, catching chickens. When the game crashes, it doesn't always give you back control of your mouse, and I couldn't figure out how to force it closed in task manager using only the keyboard.After seeing this level of instability, I can't recommend this game. It appears that if it was technically sound, it would be quite a blast for kids aged 4+.			"

												This is a surprisingly good non-combat MMO. There is an in-depth housing system, public quests, group instances, collectible item sets, a full fishing system (complete with displayable fish), lots of minigames, and you can interact/play with a lot of the world and scenery. The Devs streamlined some features that other MMOs have to make it kid-friendly and have avoided a lot of problems that plague the genre. If you get a subscription the game gives a monthly gold allowance for the ""real money"" shop and the subscription price is peanuts (2.50 USD a month for a year or 3.99 USD for a single month) compared to other games that charge 14.99 USD. The Free-to-Play is more of a trial since you can't go past level 10.I really didn't expect to be writing such a positive review for this game, but there it is. It's really fun!			"

												Pros: has amazing graphics and animationsruns great on my toasterhas a tutorialhas a variety of different questsWell designed player housing systemCons:no mircrophone support.no zombies.needs a doge character.      This games name Amazing World is an understatement. It is the Best designed world i have ever seen in any mmorpg. The questing system is very solid and has so much variety. One minute you will be digging dirt, the next you will be jumping from bouncy bads a getting those nasty things. Its amazing how they managed to give so much variety to the gameplay despite the fact that all the classes are identical. I really liked how i could place my own stuff at my house because... i like stuff. I find some players but they were in a dog only club. so i guess i cant be friend with them. The world is very large and open. there is also lots of stuff to do. i found this game boring 10/10 "

												As a mom, I'm always looking for games that my daughter can play. This review is a mix of her opinion and mine.Graphics.Daughter - Pretty colors! I like being the pink elephant! Me - Very bright and fun graphics. No adjustable settings so quality is lacking.Gramplay.Daughter - ""Mom, why are people standing on top of each other?"" ""Why is there nothing here?"" ""I don't like this game, can I play Minecraft instead?"" Me - This is where the game quickly falls off. A lot of AFK'ers. I can assume that people with slower computers might actually start experiancing lag in certain areas. (Think Stormwind mailbox in WoW pre-BC). Huge areas have NOTHING. Just plain, open areas. Not even trees or flowers. Just green space. Sometimes you see water. Sometimes you see a random NPC. Either way, it's pretty dull and lackluster.I think they should have more mini games and maybe a few more educational elements?I see a lot of potinal in this title...but as of now, you don't have my daughters attention. Once again - very cute title, just need some TLC.			"

												this is a game that sort of seems out of place on steam but also glad its on here. Was looking for a game to replace viacom's petpet park when it closed last year and so far, seems to win on that front.  Not going to tax most systems or need anything special for a video card which is nice. On the negative it does need a membership to fully unlock it, but its rather inexpensive really if your into these sort of games, 3.99 a month or 30 dollars for a whole year and theirs not a whole lot of customizing your zings with their apparances, but you sure get a lot of spaces for multiple ones. In general if folks do have chat enabled in this game, its friendly and generally helpful to what your doing. but keep in mind parents must enable the chat function so its rare to see kids using this.

												10/10 best game 2016, took 15 minutes to get past first loading screen, i then created my character and was launched, literally, into the next loading screen! then my game froze and i found out in order to load the next screen you have to alt F4 then cancel, then it works! Then i found a pumpkin which gave me an item that left a green trail which looked like i was crapping my pants constantly, it also released the most terrifyingly empty sound i have ever heard, like a universal buzz which mutes every other sound effect in the game accept for the amazingly load water, of course. overall a very enjoyable experience once my ears stopped bleeding and the ptsd wore off.

												To be honest it's a very fun game, I fine myself playing it and just relaxing. I paid for a membership and the price is pretty fair, I enjoy the connect and the colors. It's a very different theme than all the other games I play.			"

												It simply is not true? I know, butterflies, more important than 300 deaths which are based on the number of high school, I have peace.Monkeys trained to fight, and I'm not a military sniper. You anything, but it was not. We wanted to determine the sex. I mean, I see the face of the earth.If you think you can find something on the Internet? Evo cars. Be prepared for hidden spy network in the United States to attack the larvae of intellectual property rights, I must say better. The storm destroyed painful memories. Half of the children died. You can do it anywhere and I can already killed hundreds of hands. This is wrong, but smaller oil reserves, like an old man ""that some phones Navy to play ugly."" But now we can not pay ridiculous prices. I do not want to disrupt their wounds.Half of the children died.How this game makes me feel.A true master piece if you ask me. would reccomend 10/01 Gamespot Gamsetop IGN			"

I then found his I.P and killed him at his home and broke his mothers spine. never mess with ""LaughingWalrus20"" no sir. I work for a mob boss who is a chef lion. He gave me a sparkly pink jacket as those are the gang colors. I gambled away my mommys money on this god damn pinwheel of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Great Game. Great ♥♥♥♥ing game.

												Literally the greatest thing to bless God's green earth. I almost explode with joy every time I even here the name Amazing World. Oh great... I just soiled myself with anticipation. Anyway everyone should get this game even though it's tiny without a membership which will cost you. So it's more like free to install not so much free to play and even then there isn't really anything to play.Platforming sections were aight...10/10			"
