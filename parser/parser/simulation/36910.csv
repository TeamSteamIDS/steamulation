												Its the ultimate game of all time, but poorly executed. however not as poorly executed by the one game that is similar to it ""Universal Combat"" which is just as much of a pain in the ♥♥♥.I dont reccomend buying this.			"

												DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, BUY THIS GAME!!!!! It is beyond terrible. If there was a rating under a 1, it would easily get it. I cannot put into words how terrible this game is... Just stay away!			"

												Its a mess, where the only people that could possibly think to use it to justify anything are its deranged developer *cough*derek*cough* and people that for a reason I will never understand fan boy the ♥♥♥♥ out over 3000ad.			"

												I purchased this game when it first game out. That was my first mistake. This game is empty, broken, and virtually unplayable. There is no explanation about how to play or WHY to play the darn thing in the first place. At $20, this game might seem forgivable, but it is not. There are better things to spend your money on, and even if this game goes on sale for $1.00, DO NOT WASTE THE MONEY ON IT! Pretty much everything written about the game features is a lie. It plays terrible, it sounds terrible, and it looks terrible as well. Don't waste your time with it.			"

												This could be great game, but it almost lacks everything what we expect from modern sandbox alike games. It has no army you can command, its hard and boring in many ways. If you enjoyed Battecruiser or Universal Combat, this is not even half of experience of these games in terms of wirtual life that takes place here.  All planet looks abandoned, nothing to do, and nothing to fight for, with no one at your side. BC or UC had living space, with some imagination You could have great fun. But this is just boring. Avoid.			"

												So - I bought this game a while back - All I have to say is that It is bad...Not even in a ""so bad that it is good"" kinda way... It is just plain bad.Here is why -1. Confusing - The game does not give you any form of orentiation and when it tries to it falls flat on its face in the attempt.2. Runs like crap - Long load screens for extremly low fedelity models and textures. 3. Multiplayer is non existant - There are no players on the servers.4. Crashes and lockups - The game tends to crash and lockup. This has to be my biggest gripe about All Aspect Warfare.In summary -This game feels like it was pushed out the door way to early. It is overall waste of money that I paid for it. Wish that I had not purchased this. My advice to any one else who is looking to buy this...***AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNTIL FIXED ***Advice for the developers to improve the game.1. Hire actual voice actors for the ""Training Videos"" and don't have the youngest member of the dev team do the voice overs. It honestly sounds like a 13 to 15 year old kid. Not to mention that he goes by a bunch of different names such as Lucas, Brad, etc. It is really awkward and this could directly hurt your sales. If you have to do it that way due to budget constraints. Then atleast do some audio editing so that she does not sound the same in each video.2. Spend more time on your games development - The game has its flaws, is bad in terms of performance, and prone to crashing/Lockup. Spend more time on Quality Assurance and Bug fixing.3. Host Community events to get more players in game - Lots of companies do this for their games. This also could help build a Community around your company and games.Anyways enough of my rambling for now.Peace out!			"

												For a change, positive review! A hybrid between Battlefield and ARMA games (simillar to planetside in fact), concentrating on the realism and gameplay. In essence, it's a large sandbox with vechicles, both land and air (some of them huge, allowing transportation of other vechicles) and multiplayer. Unlike other reviews, I do believe that all the features mentioned in the game description are present.However, the game needs some patience getting into. Much of it isn't exactly intuitive so you will need to do some learning and perhaps read the manual (GASPH). Like other games from this dev that I played, the game is heavily lacking in graphics however, being outdated and since kids nowdays don't care much beyond that...With not many people playing it, multiplayer is rather lonely, or it was back when I played the game at least, so unless you have a bunch of friends, you won't see much of that.Single player, it doesn't give you a 'corridor' to follow. It gives you a background, potential hints and leaves you in an open world. What you do is up to you. (Stop a disaster, or get the hell out and save your lives? Up to you)To summise: If you are an older player who appreciates a game for what it allows you to do and not what it looks like, you will enjoy the open ended game where you indeed have as much a freedom as a game can allow. Even better if you have many friends who can enjoy it with you.(For a taste of what you get on even larger scale, go to 3000AD page to download their 'Battlecruiser' games for free.)			"

												If you want an idea of how infantry conflict (without indirect fire) would be in the future, play this game.The scenario is that you are one of a surviving team of soldiers/airman (there's one pilot among you) on a planet that is essentially a live-fire training area for an enemy race's military.Yep, an entire planet that's really one big impact area with a few bases scattered on it.How did you get there?  Well, the spaceship that you were on was carrying a planet buster to plant on the enemy home world (yeah, the war's going *that* badly) was damaged en-route and crashed here.  After arming the planet buster, of course.You have a limited amount of time to either a) steal an enemy spaceship so you can GTF off the planet or b) find the planet buster and disarm it.You really can win without cheating, but you'll think otherwise more than once.If you don't read the manual, you won't be able to win the game.  You'll just die a lot.   Honest.You can play as the pilot, too.  I die a lot doing so, which tells me that my never joining the Air Force was a good idea.			"

												As it says in the manual, this is a thinking man's FPS.   Yes, it can be brutal but once you take the time to read the manual and figure out how the game works its great fun.			"
