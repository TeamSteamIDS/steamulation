												I was on here the other day looking for a Flight Simulator and i just so happened to come across Sky Gamblers.  I've playerd the IOS Version of the game and really like it, so i had to check it out. When i watched the trailer i was in shock with how much better the Graphics were compared to the IOS Version.  I bought the game thinking that it would have better detail, new planes, and more missions espicially with the price tag of $9.99.  I was wrong, when i played it for the first time i noticed that everything was exactly the same in comparison to the IOS Version. I was deeply disappointed knowing that i wasted $9.99 for a game that i already had for $0.99. Im not saying that Sky Gamblers is a bad game but i dont recommend the PC version when you can get the game for $0.99 on IOS.			"

												While the controls could use some refining, after 15-20min it will feel second nature.Includes a stack of content, not least of which being the plane selection, 29 of them (87 if you count alt stats).If you're not one for multiplayer, game provides some very enjoyable singleplayer campaigns (3 of them) which will have you shooting planes out of the skies, bombing ships, nuking tanks/transport vehicles and running night time surveillance missions. All while covering a multitude of different battles and memorable times throughout history. If you do enjoy multiplayer it offers many game modes, most of which can be played vs AI.

People have commented the graphics could use improvements, I think they are decent overall.Game is sitting somewhere between War thunder and WoP, closer to war thunder.Play the game for what it is and you'll enjoy the hell out of it. Just don't expect a simulation. :)			"

												I was in search of an arcade-style dogfighting game that didn't require reading a huge flight manual first.  Nothing against those games, but sometimes I just don't have the time to devote to them.Sky Gamblers turned out to be the game I was looking for.  It's easy to pick up and play, has a good variety of planes and combat scenarios, and it also supports joysticks.  After a short tutorial that teaches you the basics, you're off!The graphics aren't going to push a 980ti to it's limits, but the game still looks good.  Overall it's definitely worth playing if realistic flight mechanics aren't that important to you, but having fun is.			"

												One of the worst games i have ever seen. What this game is, is a mobile game that was ported to PC. Mind you, this game is $0.99 on the Istore. This company has the balls, to add $8 to this game, but not add any missions or anything! You can video game play here

												Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~First of all, I must say that I am not a fan of flight simulation at all. And there is only one reason for it, too hard to learn and play. Saying this, I was quiet intrigued with this game just because it looks fun. Let me tell you I was spot on. You do not have to remember how to start an engine and all the rest. All you have to do is to push up the throttle and you get to the fight within a minute and shoot planes. “RIGHT NOW AT 3 O’CLOCK!”All fighter planes from the era are well represented in this game. Graphically, this game could have been better but you can’t have everything. To be honest they are decent.For the controls side of it, I think using the mouse and keyboard is about as weird as it sounds. It will take you a little time to master both setups anyway.You can play as a single player and have 3 campaigns at your disposal (Pacific, Africa and Battle of Britain). You also have a survival, capture the flag, dogfight, team deathmatch and defend the base which can be played against the AI. Multiplayer mode is also available.Positives:~~~~~~~~ -	Challenging and really fun to play-	Plenty of modes including multiplayer-	Runs smoothly-	Stack of achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Controls slightly sluggishOverall, this game is worth $9.99 and I really enjoyed it! 8/10MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												Time for yet another review...well Sky gamblers: Storm Raiders has some good and bad points but then that's the same with many games made today, Firstly some good points the graphics are fair (medium) the music very good and gameplay is good too, There are plenty of missions to do and multiplayer is good too.It has a score system to increase rank and unlock new planes which you get from completing missions and shooting down planes or sinking ships or destroying buildings also the maps are not too bad.The game has easy controls which would suit any age.Now some bad points...Firstly i noticed when you play in free flight the maps seems to be always at night which i dislike as you have to strain your eyes to see what is in front of you and this is bad programming would of been nice if you had a feature in the settings to choose night or day.Also i find the guns are not accurate (you don't have to be 100% on your target with your sights to shoot him down) also they jam up too soon and very often.Also i notice when you unlock planes sometimes you unlock a plane you already have unlocked would of been better if you unlocked a improved version of the same plane such as better defence better guns and better roof limit and so on.Wish there was a feature for a MAP to open up and see everything and where you are located and your objectives and the enemy.My Suggestions....Would of been nice if there was also a Medal feature for outstanding bravery and achievements in line with the plane you are flying at the time...Example if flying ME109 you would get geman medals if flying a spitfire British medals and so onAlso would of been nice to get money for destroying planes/ships/buildings and completing missions to buy upgrades for your planes.Also to interact with your wingmen to promote them and improve their planes and award them medals too.So i hope there will be changes to this game and improvements with patches but as it stands i can only give this game 7.5/10 which is about average score			"

												This game is not a flight simulator pure and so who is looking for this will be disappointed, as they will find an arcade game. There are models of complex flight and there are not all the planes of WWII. In particular, he feels the lack of heavy bombers like the B-24 or B-17 Flying Fortress.But it's a really fun game with beautiful graphics and good campaigns. The dogfights are fun and then there is a chance for everyone to shoot down enemy planes, even in multiplayer.Hopefully the boys' Atypical Games add other planes and scenarios to play.From buy.Great price.

												An arcade WWII flight game, fun to play, no stress during missions or challenges. So far I think the only cause of mission failure is that you get shut down (duh.) or crash into something (if you're THAT stupid at all,) so complete scenarios in your own pace.Planes are well-modeled, the only bad part of this game I can think of will be the landing... stop inches above runways or decks and you can like drop onto the ground, that feels just wrong. But since you stay in the sky most of the time, it becomes not really that much of a problem.			"

It has joystick support and a nice selection of planes and missions and is very easy to get your head around.The Graphics look OK and the frame rate is good even on lower spec PC`s.I`m not usually a fan of ported to PC mobile games , but this ones not bad and isn`t too expensive so I quite like it.

												My eyes might be bad, but this game is still fun. When I was in school, one of my favorite games for the PS2 was Secret Weapons over Normandy. This game feels similar with a bit more contol, which is a good thing. There are lots of planes to unlock, ranging from early WWII fighters to jets that came in toward the end of the war. Different campaigns have you flying planes from both Allied and Axis sides. Combat is fast and fun. The music is pretty decent. If you're a person who needs every single aspect of flight rendered in perfect scientific detail, this game might not be for you, but if you're like me and you love WWII planes, this game is a great investment for only 10 USD. If you get it when it's on sale, even better!Cons to be aware of: No voice acting. All mission prompts are via text on screen. My vision sucks so I missed some. Several planes, but it feels like more could have been added. 99 cent DLCs with 5-8 planes would be nice.Music can get a bit repetitive, but you don't notice if you're fighting.I can't figure out how to lower landing gear.

												I have been a huge fan of Revo Games and the Sky Gamblers series for a little over a year now. I started with Air Supremacy, and purchased Storm Raiders as soon as it was made available for android. I love the game, and I am SOOO glad to have it on a 60"" HD TV right now instead of my Note 3. The game is actually smoother on the PC than on my phone, and the total lack of IAP's in the Steam version makes it worth the price. some of the planes in the game on IOS,OSX, and Android store versions are purchase only, as well as being charged for the ""weapon hanger"" which allows you to customize weapons and limited Paint packs which allow you to customize the paint on your plane. The steam version requires some unlocking (the baddest planes in the game require you to beat the last dogfight mission to get them rather than a purchase of $2-3 apiece.) All in all I'm VERY satisfied with the purchase, and overjoyed that this version of the game plays cross platform. it's always been interesting playing against Mac players from my phone, and I'm glad I can finally view it on the big screen myself!

												First impressions:This is an extremely fun & arcadey flight combat game.  It reminds me a bit of War Thunder a bit in that the game is very easy to jump into.  Some will undoubtedly complain that the game is cheaper on the iOS, but I admittedly don't have an iOS in which to base a comparison.  I'm not a developer nor do I have experience in publishing a game onto digital distribution services, but I'm assuming the fees may be higher which would account for the difference in price...then again, I could be wrong.  Regardless, $10 is still a good value for what you're getting here, what with the different game modes, campaign, and multiplayer.  It's an easy recommend for those who enjoy ""light"" flight sims focused more on ""pew pew"" as opposed to those that require you to commit eight hours in order to figure out how to turn the engine on.

Lovely and richly detailed worlds, smooth realistic flying, several hangers full of great aircraft to choose,  and a rich choice of game senarios. online pvp play is very good. Its an easy game to pick up but,(heres one small criticism but maybe not cause i dont what it changed) it can be a bit disheartening going up against players withhh even a bit of expiereance much less the seasoned pilots you will find.(especially in the capture the flag games) dont waste your time with anything less than a good joystick controller. Believe me, it will make a differance. one thing though, guys could you put the function that allows a player to  chance the photo in the cockpit like in the handheld version.(either that or PLEASE get rid of the picture of ""nelly Knickers"" that you have provided. excellant work 9.5 * out of 10			"

So i was pleased to see it come to windows pc's .Now i can play it on my cumputers big screen and use a flight stick. This game is very addicting.The campaigns are fun and the online play is what keeps me coming back. The flight models are not up to sim standards but the game play is fast and arcade like with great grahics. If i had to recomend just one device to install it on, it would be the pc Steam version.  The purchase price unlocks the stuff that was a IAP, saving you some money.  "

												Feels a lot like Blazing Angels to me... In fact, it's so close, I already know how to play it! I haven't even touched the campaign, but the multiplayer is pretty smooth overall; a few minor hiccups notwithstanding. Having a pretty good time with it so far, and there seems to be a playerbase of some kind (I haven't played long enough to really get a good grasp of the overall community). The mouse control is absolutely aweful, I seriously recommend a pad or stick of some kind. Also, a bit more information about the planes' stats and progression would be nice; however, the lack of info doesn't bother me so much, as I'm having a good time just flying whatever. Pretty fun if you're into arcadey WWII flight ""sims.""			"

												Nice WW2 action game, the graphics are ok and the controls work just fine. This isn't a flight simulator though, it's a simple action game. Your WW2 plane is equipped with radar and unlimited ammo, landing is extremely easy, you don't even have to care about your landing gear or such things. I think I would enjoy a little realism more, but the game is still fun, especially considering the price (I bought it at 66% off). And it works on Linux.			"

												For the current price of 3,39€ It's totally worth it even if you usually don't play games like this. 9/10Good fun both single and coop as those are the modes i play. 7/10Steering with mouse / keyboard / joystick/controller worked pretty good. 7/10Handling is good and feels responsive alloweing for some high action dogfights. 8/10You can configure main and secondary guns / cannons / rockets / boms and even smoke, aswell as set paint chemes for all your aircrafts. 8/10Sound / Music 9/10The maps ground textures feel somewhat bland because of the lower texture quality than the aircrafts but it's still good ( you can fly inside train tunnels for example and buildings are pretty good quality ) 6/10Game modes include Dogfights / survival / CTF / TDM / Base defence / Free flight / Last man standing / free for all % Campaign. 10/10All in all this game gets my 7/10 ( Compare to skyrim getting a 9/10 and duke nukem forever getting a 2/10 )			"

												Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders is the third game in the Sky Gambler series, previously released as mobile games. As a result, this is turn-and-burn only, but for a WW2 turn and turn, it's surprisingly fun and decently balanced with some interesting complexities should you wish to delve into such. For a mobile port, this game is actually quite good. Terrain and flying area is nice and big, objects are not oddly scaled (things are tiny in a distance). Details are not PC standard, but quite workable. Enemy planes break apart when you kill them, with a wing falling off, then the whole things spins and twists like a falling leaf. And so on. Ground targets can hide among trees but that's why you have rockets and bombs. Or for naval targets, you have torpedoes and bombs. The engine can be ""boosted"" for a short period of high speed, but engine will overheat after X seconds, and may shut down altogether (but it will restart once you cooled off). Guns will also overheat and prone to jamming should you held down the trigger for too long. The temp gauge on either weren't too obvious though. There's quite a bit of decent single player content (2-3 campaigns, plus survival mode and dogfight mode) as well as full set of mulitplayer games including Capture the Flag, Free for All, and so on. There's also three difficulty levels so rookies can feel free to dive right in. Don't expect too much realism, as you have P-40 Warhawks fighting the Luftwaffe, or Hurricane carrying torpedoes, and so on. A fighter here do often carry bombs. And many of the scenarios have you attempting to race to the airfield before your fuel runs out on a timer, not on actual fuel consumption. On the other hand, they can be quite exciting, and these missions do have checkpoints so if you fail, you aren't forced to start from the beginning. Controls are easy enough, though the gamepad support should be better, as there needs to be some custom mapping. For games that supports such, I do ""RC controls"" (i.e. stick one controls elevator and roll, while stick two controls throttle and rudder) and this game was able to do such, but it wasn't the default. On some game types you can customize your plane, both paint job and the primary/secondary weapons, and choices are plenty, some are good for ground work, some are good for air attacks. With four classes of planes (fighter, bomber, jet, and legend), there are plenty of choices and lots of customization options. Legend class contains very iconic fighters as well as some prototypes that never made it into service but were very good planes. The interface is a little weird as often you have to rely on dragging to show more panels as there are no obvious signs there are more choices below; legacy of coming from a touch interface. All in all, SGSR is a pretty good game, for the turn-and-burn crowd. Don't expect ""realism"", flight model, and so on.			"

												To start with this is an arcade game and not a simulator, it was ported from phone to pc I think and they did quite a good job of it.  I personally play it with a joystick and I have to say for a phone port this game has better joystick response than War Thunder when last i played that game.  I had no trouble mapping buttons or with responsiveness in Storm Raiders compared to the buggy and mouse bias War Thunder which is a flight simulation game.  That aside I really have been enjoying this game.Pros:-Very easy to fly, it's just throttle up and you're off, this is an arcade game after all.-3 Difficulty settings.-Simple 3 modes wingman support: Attack / Defend / Formation-Multiple control types supported, works great with a flight stick. (I use the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro)-Good graphics, effects, & atmosphere music with the exception of one of the campaign missions.-Larger scale air battles with large maps, you'll get into some decent furballs here.-Three short campaigns filled with fun as well as several solo game modes that mimic the multiplayer games. -Active multiplayer online matches. (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, & Destroy the Base.)-Unlimited bullets with a heat mechanic, recharged rockets/bombs/torpedos mechanic. (Also a con for those who want realism.)-Toggle Aim Assist, personally I found it easier with this disabled as I could kill enemies from outside the lead que range.-New aircraft are earned by completing the campaigns and leveling up, you don't have to purchase them like the phone version.Cons:-There's only one internal cockpit model used in every plane, very sad. :(-The campaigns are pretty short, about 5-6 missions long each it wont take long to finish them. (Also a pro for casuals.)-For those that like realism, there's unlimited ammo & a radar system. (Again, it's an arcade game.)-The physics are not the greatest but only really is bothersome when landing, if you cut your engine by boosting too much, or running out of fuel via campaign event. (There is no actual fuel consumption.) My first landing in this game dropped me dead from 2 meters up for a successful three point landing vtol style.  If you want a more realistic landing don't try to coast, go in low at 50% and grind the ground, wheels deploy automatically and then drop the throttle back. When you run out of fuel or kill your engine (temp only) you quite literally will start to drop straight down shortly after, there is no gliding in this game.Really there isn't a whole lot about this game that bothers me, I really like flight games like the Ace Combat series up to game 5. (Assault Horizon was just a disappointment.)  While this game isn't an Ace Combat with an amazing story I found the gameplay engaging and fun.  At $9.99 I feel the game is well worth it.			"

												This is an easy fun game to play. I guess you can use your keyboard, but I have a joy stick, and it seems to work  pretty well. The enemy planes, at times, seem to be too much to handle. The more planes you shoot down.....the more they keep coming to attack you. At times it appears that there is no end. The ""bombing missions"" airplanes are difficult to adjust too. I havn't yet passed that feature. But, the ""dog-fights"" many and are good. The ""Pearl Harbor"" Japenese bombing attack appears to be never-ending. I cannot shoot enough of the Japanese planes down to get to the next level or event. When I think that I destroyed their whole fleet of bombers and fighters, more and more seem to appear. But,  i will keep trying. Perhaps their isn't an ending?  At the beginning of the game, you have a choice of various planes...and ""load-outs."" The American P-40 is a good plane to fight with  during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 12/07/1942. During the Japenese attack at Pearl Harbor, the most logical plane to use is the American P-40. After all, its a historical fact, that the P-40 was the ONLY U.S. fightrer plane that was defending Pearl in the air. The other P-40's were destroyed on the ground at Hickam AFB and other airfields throughout the island. The Japanese, did their home-work, so to speak...they knew exactly where all of our planes were located...and unfortunately they were all on the airfield wide-open for the Japanese attackers to destroy. Unfortunately, the  American crews and their pilots were destroyed...i.e., even before they had a chance to warm-up their engines and get into the air. Only a few P-40s made it into the air. Those few were up against hundreds of Japanese fighters. The Americans did not have ANY other plane airborne to defend Pearl. The only exception was a flight of old B-17 Bombers, their were airborne and  coming from the east (Hamilton AFB a base near San Francisco, CA) destined for  Hickam AFB at Pearl. I can now see the faces on the B-17 pilots and crews when they appeared over Pearl...i.e., in the middle of watching the Japs attack Pearl  Harbor...i.e., with little or almost no resistance from the Americans. I think these guys were fortunate enough to land at Hickam, and their crews got out of their planes and ran for cover. The Japanese more than likely destroyed some if not all of the B-17s while on the ground at Pearl. The Admerial and General in charge at Pearl...quickly after the attack, were justly and  immediated ""fired""....because of their gross incompetency. Anyway, during the attack, there were only a few P-40s in the air, and.they were completely out-matched by the Japanese fighters. But, they did shot down a few Jap fighters and bombers.  At the beginning, of the game it allows you to choose what type of weapons(load-out)  you want on your plane.  Cannons, michine guns, or bombs. The British ""Spitfire"" is another good plane to fly. The German(Nazi) Jet fighter is also one of my favorite planes to use. The game keeps score, and after each event, if you did well, you are graded, and  just perhaps promoted. Overall I give this game a satisfactory score. The price is reasonable.			"

												If you played the mobile version and always wished to play it on your laptop/desktop/bigger screen, with better view of the action, then the time has come for your dreams to become true. (well mine has)I know, I know, for the first time players (who never played this on mobile) it will feel strange, yes, strange, all of it. (gfx, control, etc). But the good thing is that the controls are easy to get used to (ex: mouse is for lazy bones). Support for certain type of controllers might be lacking, but it compensates for the easy to get into multiplayer, where defeating other players will leave a nice taste in your mouth. Singleplayer part is quite good, considering it was made for mobile, it doesn't get boring (except for certain missions and situations), it provides enough action to feel like time has flown by. All in all if you want to play a flying game that is easy to get into and don't want to waste your time with endless tutorials or frustrating content, blockers etc....then this is the game for you. (as long as you keep in mind, this is mostly a game for the fans of the mobile version)Yes, graphics are a bit bland, fx are not top notch for our pc riggs, but keep in mind, this is not War Thunder or WoP. This is a casual flying fighter game, for those of us that wish to fly a plane and don't bother with the rest. "

												I wasn’t really sure what to expect about this game’s controls, knowing it’s a port from the Apple store… but luckily, the mouse controls worked fine for me. The action in the game is nice, I really love the variety of planes (I can already foresee some hours spent for going through all of them) and being able to fly a custom-painted pink plane really does it for me :) I really like to keep MP simple, by going solo in deathmatch games, but there’s a lot of game types out there for those that like to go into co-op, and also a multitude of SP game modes… I’ve not yet gone through all of them, but the skirmishes against the AI are quite nice when you get bored of going against others online. I recommend the game to those that like to have fun flying and shooting, this is what it felt like to me: fun. Oh, and I (for one) liked being able to shoot missiles.			"

												What I like about this game is the fast paced action and the fantastic graphics. Being a Scientist in imaging and laser physicist, I love the different feel of the airplane ballistics and the weapon firing. I must love the game, because I started with Sky Gamblers Rise of Glory, Skies of Glory, Air Supremacy, but above them all Storm Raiders is King! King over Battle Supremacy, over my high priced Xbox one and PS 4! King over even over our WII! What is most fantastic about this game is it's unbelievable quality at the lowest price conceivable! It is 5 tie 10 times lower then my Xbox games.I am and have already recommended Storm Raiders to many friends, with PC, Mac,  Ipads and Androids. I am also requesting that all new and older squad members of the Sky Corsairs make Storm Raiders a priority.All software systems have bugs and problems, because of my interest and love for the game I have looked at SGSR crash logs and will help when I can, to keep making this game and others as bug free as possible. I value time above money, me spending my time is the highest praise that I can give.[SC]Hammer			"

												I really enjoy the multiplayer side as it is action packed, there are lots of rooms available and you can choose exactly what type of game you want to play. The gameplay is arcade style, fast paced and it has really gooten a good hold of me for several hours in a row... in aerial fighters I'm looking for quick action and challenges, and being able to shoot lots of guys down mainly with bullets (as opposed to modern day aerial fighter sims that are riddled with missiles) was simply lots of fun for me.The planes look great, there are quite a lot of them, and I've appreciated being able to customize the plane's color scheme (which is available in various templates to start with) - being able to add custom decals would have been something I would have appreciated as well.Overall, if you want some solid MP action with fast kills, it's a good game to try!

I have not gone through the single player yet, but the MP part of the game was nice, I’ve liked the fact that there was a lot of fast-paced shooting and the mouse controls seemed quite responsive and nice (I don’t have a joystick, so I’m used to playing with the keyboard… but being able to control everything with the mouse in a smooth way was a clear plus). The game is arcade and fun, the achievements and ranking seem to be correctly balanced (I didn’t have that annoying feeling of getting achievements just for breathing) so I think it’s worth playing for everyone that likes having fun shooting others in the sky.

												View my first playthrough  Here This Arcade-style dogfighting game is a nice change from the horde of twitch-shooters currently on the market. It's one of those easy-to-learn-hard-to-master games that seems simple at first, but over time you'll learn there is depth to the combat. With close to 30 planes, all with varying stats and play-styles, you'll find something you like. The single player places you in one of three theatres of war across the globe during WWII. The difficulty ranges from♥♥♥♥♥♥easy to OMFG-EJECT EJEC-(explosion). You'll fly sorties for the British and the Americans fighting against Germany and Japan, all while utilizing various frames: fighter, bomber, and special role planes. Each with there own unique weapons. Frames are unlocked by perfoming  campaing missions or playing multiplayer. The weapon and plane specifications could use an EXPLINATION, however. I'm not sure what some of these symbols mean, but I'm sure there is a wiki on it somewhere. Multi-player is fun and has several modes: capture the flag, defend the base, deathmatch, team deathmatch, last-man-standing, survival (horde, you and team versus NPCs) and even a free-flight mode for the achievment horses to mingle! In a market thourghly saturated with hyper-violent, grim and sexual content, this game is a breathe of fresh air. I would feel comfortable letting my kids play this game. Final verdict: this game is good, not great, but with patching it has the potential for excellence. View my livestream at twitch for my first sortie with this game			"

												this is a pretty game, i wanted to like it. but i like gravitational pull on my aircraft, what i mean is, when i bank to the right or left the planes nose should start to dip down. For instance, fly upside down while playing, does the aircraft begin descending or does it fly straight as if in space with no resistance or drag? To some this may seem trivial, but to me i use this gravity to my advantage in dogfighting and most importantly, it adds immersion. Give it a try its a good game and i recommend it bc the developers look like they cared for this game and did a pretty good job for an arcade game. I bought this seeing the simulation tag and i believe that should be removed so as not to confuse others who are expecting a more simulating experience.			"

Campaign isn't especially challenging, and it doesn't take a lot of time to unlock every plane and varient, but the multiplayer is well done and there are many ranks that seem impossible to reach. Overall, it is a great game, and the fact that it is compatible with the mobile app means that you can play friends that don't have steam. I would certainly recommend this game to any of my compatriots, as you need a couple of friends to play to keep the game interesting.			"
