												As much of a gem that this was back when it was released, sadly it doesnt play very well on modern systems. Max resolution is extremely low, and controls (joystick and keyboard) are extremely clunky.			"

												A old game that is kind of a challenge right when you start the game. It is hard to kill other tanks if your not used to this game. It's graphics very old and blocky. The gameplay is not really great but can keep you entertained for a little bit. I wouldn't recommend this game to any army buff that wants good tank fighting. Make sure if you do decide to get this game make sure its packed with other games with it.			"

												Yes, its dated. Yes, some report glitches... but its pretty fun. Kind of reminds of a sim/rts/fps cross the way it plays a little. I think the game captures the team strategy thing (leading your group of tanks to victory etc - kinda like playing madden football but tossing a bomb is a bit more dramtic :) )Get it because your a tank buff and old graphics don't automatically equate to ""no good"" - sometimes old games with old graphics completely hold their ground when newer competing products comeout... some stay on top for decades - so you never know. I played this long enough to know its pretty cool - and due to lower graphics - you're out in the open more often - and you must use the terrain - period - I like that bit... :) Remember - you're getting an old game here - so unless you really dig tank sims, you might want something more eye-candyish... this is - get in - there are bad guys there, here are your guys - here is the terrain - good luck soldier! LOL - Some days - thats just what the doctor ordered...or general - whatever			"

												An old school simulator; Or what some people would call a “Grandpa simulator” this is as good as it gets. The missions are cut and dry and to the point. There is no messing around with settings. Just get into the game and learn how to drive a tank, then you're off to the races. Can't go wrong with this one.			"
