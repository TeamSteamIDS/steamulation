												Its so bland, everything about this is bland, even the guy who is constantly (and I can't stress constantly enough) talking to you is a computer generated voice, its not a person saying monotoned lame lines its a computer. the ship you dive down to see resembles the Titanic if the titanic was all one texture and all of the furniture in every room suddenly became nonexistant.

												The Idea of the game is good but is no real training using the sub, no emergency instructions the game let you die when the oxygen or batteries are getting down (you start underwater), the instructions about how move the sub to specific locations are terrible, no instrumental, no degrees, no angles, no radar, no continous sonar, no scaner, just a compas!. The graphics are from late 90's  the game is real terrible.			"

												I think I like this.  It's...different.  Part sim, part game.  You control a submersible, a small roving camera, and claws on each.  The game part involves accomplishing certain goals each day before your battery and oxygen levels run out.  There are 5 days in the story mode, then it looks like you get a free-explore mode.The good:  They did an excellent job reproducing the Titanic and you get decent touristy lectures from time to time highlighting points of interest.The bad:  The one voice in the game is your navigator and he sounds like Tommy Wiseau.  Thick accent, strange cadence.  And when you navigate it's only with him telling you a cardinal direction or up and down.  He's not familiar with ""northwest"" I guess.  This makes finding your objectives frustrating, given the time limits involved.  The jerk won't even give you distances.If you do play, save regularly, so you can restart a day that goes badly or so you can recover from an occasional crash.No manual.  Shame.			"

												The game will barely even start for me. It just crashes most of the time when i try to start it.. But from what i've seen from it then this game the times it choses to work is not at all far from the regular Simulator games that we see so often (The farming simulator, ship simulator yada yada). And for a game of this type that focuses alot on exploration and realism of a famus shipwreck then you must really focus more into Details and really give you the wanting to continue exploring (Like different furniture in rooms or the water particle effects around you. You also need to focus to make textures on things look really detailed and good, and even for game engines and such existing in 2010 then this looks at most part really hidius (The sub looks rather alright but the game doesn't really focus on the sub now does it?) Not to mention its price tag of 20 Euro! Just keep away from this game, unlike the other simulators, this one offers no funny gags in horrible physics or funny bugs, its just pure bad looking boredom.			"

												Alright  first off I would like to point out this game is for real, very real infact. I was looking for a pocket watch. I was told it was in Ismays room i believe it was. Well I have no idea where that is off the top of my head so i decided to test the game. I went Online and found  a map of the Titanic, all the floors. Found Ismays room on the map and followed the map and found the room IN GAME. That is pretty awesome. Love the Titanic, i recomend this game to everyone who respects that ship or loves that ship like I do.However I could go without a male monotone voice telling me to got ""Further"" or ""More to the left""  as he give directions over and over and over and over again			"

												“Dive to the Titanic” Review, 1 May 2015  To make Steam/TML Studio’s “Dive to the Titanic” more enjoyable, I’ve assembled notes from the forum, reviews, game files and my experiences at the (not very) “Easy” level. A fairly difficult game, it becomes more so with each dive. You will become familiar with the parts of the wreck in play and how to pick your way around debris. The game resembles a real dive: long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of terror and triumph. There’s more (or less) to see than you might expect; graphics, while dated, are effective. You must install DirectX 9.0c even if you have newer versions; later DirectX versions do not replace earlier ones. Some report needing to replace their version of Quick Time; an installed is provided. There are no add-ons, patches or updates. I use a modest older laptop with good results. Game specifications are at the end.  Expect to re-map the keyboard; key assignments are often wrong . Don’t immediately change the navigating, camera or claw operating keys or the tutorials in the first two dives will not sense the correct keys. Do any initial key re-mapping such as the number keys from ‘Settings’ in the main menu and fine-tune them later in the game after the tutorial by pressing ‘ESC’ for the menu; you can also use this menu to save a dive in progress. Check all the keys (use the ‘DOWN’ arrow to get to the later pages; click on the key’s assigned value and press the one you want instead. The left mouse button (button 0) does what you expect: in the sub and ROV outside views, click the right mouse button (button 1) then move the mouse to change the view. There are five dives leading to a free-roam exploration scenario, and three levels of play:o	Easy: for familiarization with the game. A grey visual cue shows the direction and distance in meters to the objectives, in order. There is extra time to look around. Use TAB to pause the game when needed.o	Normal: no visual cues, the battery charge and your range are reduced, so time is more limited. You will need to know where you’re going, how to get there, and what you’re looking for.o	Difficult: for experienced players. Operational parameters (battery, range etc.) are more critical; you have little time to spare.   At the Easy level, just follow the cues. Except on the last dive, you have some extra time to use to explore as you go. At the advanced levels you must plan your dives with increasing care so you know what you’re looking for, where it is, and how to get there. The map will help, but not everything is shown. Deck plans from the Internet help, but some game locations, especially cabins, don’t match the real thing. At the Difficult level you probably stand no chance without having a few practice runs behind you.   For a retailed step-by-step, see http://168.156.125.36/titanic.html "

												When I purchased this glorious game, I had visions of using my submarine to float down to the Titanic and view this magnificant ship in all it's glory..  I was curious what wouderous sights I would behold.  Maybe some plates, some chairs, some tables.. maybe I'd even see the Jewel of the Sea... (was the Jewel of the Sea real.. was it really on the Titanic.. dang you James Cameron)  Heck I would have been happy to see Jack's skeleton down there..Wait this game isn't the sequel to Titanic....  wow hold on a second, I need to readjust my review.. I was under the impression this was Titanic 2, sink harder..(inhale)In all honesty I don't know what this game is about, the controls are totally and utterly broken, and because of the broken controls I was unable to get past the tutorial... trying to teach me how to use the submarine..  I've been gaming close to 18 years and this is one of the few games that were so broken I couldn't even get past the tutorial..Thankfully I only spent about 2 dollars for this game..  So not much was lost, but if you see this game sitting there.. asking you to buy it... take my advice friend...  steer as far away as possible.  I suppose if the developer ever decides to go back into the game and fix the broken controlls I'll hop back in and alter my review, until then, save your money and watch some of the free Titanic exploration videos on youtube..  Not only will you save 10 bucks, but you'll have alot more fun than this game probably would have offered you anyway....I'm king of the world!!!!To sum it up, you'd be better off spending your money buying anything else other than this game..

												This is a warning. Do not buy this game. If you do, play it with no sound.The ambiance of the game is great. the actual history and such, incredible for what little I've seen of it.Two things seem... ♥♥♥♥♥♥. First, all the control presets are wrong. When it tells you to press something like pg up, it's really supposed to be insert. for EVERY. SINGLE. KEY. aside from the armature controls.What made me stop playing this in a rage, is that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice. The operator, your assistant. When you get him gabbing, it's enjoyable and/or interesting. But when he has nothing better to do, every five seconds, keeps telling you to head towards the dot with ""Go East. Head East. No, Backwards. the Other East."" Even when you're on course.  That's what the marker is for!  I know where to go! SHUT THE BLOODY ♥♥♥♥ UP! If you think you can get through the collapsed halls faster, YOU do it! Get lost, get nagged, get raged, rinse, repeat. That was my experience in a nutshell.			"

												I was excited to check out this game.  Since I was a child I have always been fascinated by the wreck of the Titanic, so the chance to explore it virtually was very appealing.  Sims are not usually a genre I invest too much time in, but I hoped that the control scheme would be simplified enough to get to the real meat of the game, exploring the wreck.  Unfortunately, while the game does have some nice graphics the control scheme is absolutely deplorable, and quite frankly one of the worst release day implementations I have seen.  The tutorial directs you to push specific keys in order to move the ship back and forth, but these keys do not actually work, as though the keymap is mis-aligned and pushing all the correct characters to another location on the keyboard.  Making matters worse, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to which keys have this issue and which keys legitimately work.  In short,  I was unable to even discover the Titanic wreck.  Skip this game.			"

												This is a good game that has some minor issues. The controls can be complex, the voice acting can be dull, the story is linear, the title screen is laggy, and you most likely could have an issue with Quicktime. If you get past all these issues, it can be a beautiful game.I don't recommend this if you have a fear of the ocean, I do and it scares the hell out of me every time I play it. :(			"

												Oh man, what can I possible say. Arguably one of the buggiest games ever. No keys corresponded to the tutorial. Had to re-map all key bindings to what they are actually suppose to be in game. Had a problem playing the game the first time due to a QuickTime update which apparently a lot of people had to deal with. Eventually got that right.Anybody who knows me knows I love shipwrecks and I have been fascinated with the Titanic since I first heard about it way before the movie as my great aunt was one of the victims so from the start I was amped to play it. To just get used to the controls was painful.It's an okay game to play if you are into drawn out passive genres.Not my cup of tea. I only recommend it to people fascinated with the wreck. Furthermore far from an eventful or exciting game. Worth the cheap price.4/10			"

												Forget these idiots who are too lazy to set their controls. The 'game' is not a game; it is a simulator. When you get the game and play the game, beleive me, it is about the most annoying thing you have ever endured. You will experience a weird guy with an unidentified accent telling you what to do about every 8 and 1/3 seconds, you'll know what I mean when you hear it. I'd personally like to punch the guy upwards on the nose. The payoff is that, when it ends, there are so many nooks and crannies that you can explore at your leisure. Mind you, there are plenty. Seriously it's a fun simulator once you get past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There are plenty of places to find; keep exploring.			"

												I bought this game to encourage my girlfriend's 10 year old child to play and learn more about the Titanic for a school project, and having played the entire thing myself it would, quite frankly, have been a better and less painful experience had I just drowned him in the ice-cold waters of the North Atlantic. This ""game"" is detritus of the worst possible kind, playing it is like having a sandpaper and vinegar♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it fails on every level a game could and whilst playing it I truly wished that like Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie I had died. It's not all bad though, you can turn it off and uninstall it save your money.  "

												Are you interested in the titanic?


YouTube™ Video: Dive the titanic  - going down? 

			Views: 53		

			An intersting underwater exploration sim of the wreck of the titanic, but does it steer clear of the icebergs?		

If so, then this game is worth a look. The visuals and atmoshpere of diving the wreck are awesome and it is probably the closest you will ever get to actually experiencing the wreck for yourself. It is also fairly educational regards to the events of 1912.  So as an experience is is very good. Sadly as a game it is slow and often frustrating, and some bizaree gameplay choices hamper it even further. If you have no interest in the titanic at all, or are easily frustrated by slow gameplay then move along, this is not a game you will like.			"

												Lets dive straight into it; As beautiful as it looks, its story line disrupts controls at crucial moments, your operator is constantly nagging and seems to crave attention too much, which wouldn't be a problem if there was some way to shut him up...the location sensor tend to not register you get in range, which makes it impossible to do missions, and nag nag nag...There is just too much that annoyed me about this game to keep playing it at all. If they spent more attention to the simulator aspect of the game, maybe even allow the player to investigate the wreckage by themselves and just give some hints here and there, as well as iron out some of the programmatic problems that seem to occur more than occasionally this could have been a real success.

												Dive to the Titanic is ridiculously boring yet at the same time deeply frustrating. The controls and physics feel very accurate to piloting a real submarine, but there's just nothing interesting or fun to actually do in the game.-Every single level is a fetch quest; go through the ship until you find two items to grab or photograph-Both subs move RIDICULOUSLY slowly, so it takes forever and a half to get anywhere.-The game's scripting breaks if you don't follow one EXACT path to each objective, causing key objective markers to disappear and leave you totally lost or photos of key objects to not be counted.-Objective markers are vague and confusing, often leading you to wrong floors or down completely wrong paths.-The game world is built with a ton of dead ends, so each mission inevitably results in a ton of back-tracking to figure out where you're supposed to go in a sub that crawls at an unbearably slow pace.-Your mission control chimes in about every 20 seconds (not joking) reminding you to ""go up!"" ""you need to go upwards!"" ""now move upwards!"" You will do yourself a huge favor just muting the game.-The game is now 7 years old and not optimized AT ALL. It takes a LOT of work and tedium to get the game to not only run but run with few enough bugs to be playable.-The interior of the ship is so featureless it doesn't even feel like you're exploring the Titanic. You're exploring a series of empty rooms laid out in a Titanic-like shape.-What I can only assume is a recurring glitch prevented me from being able to access the game's ending. The minigame at the end is horribly explained and takes a ton of trial and error just to figure out how to play it.-The default key bindings are utter garbage and if you change the bindings the tutorial button prompts don't change- it keeps telling you to press the default buttons, which are now wrong.It's just a lot of wandering down featureless corridors with the slowest movement speed ever recorded. It has nothing to offer flight or submarine sim fans and it has nothing to offer Titanic enthusiasts or history buffs curious on the topic. Completely useless.			"

												I recommend that all my friends stay clear of this festering pile of a game. Ok, at the risk of losing some of my street cred, I'll admit that I was fascinated at the movie Titanic... well the first 10 minutes anyways. I always imagined what it would be like to go exploring this piece of history and yearned for a way to do so (without becoming a scientist) and I thought this was finally the answer. How wrong I was.The screen shots look wonderful. I can't actually comment on how they look in game because I couldn't play it. Not because the game wouldn't launch; but because the controls in the game don't function as they are supposed to. The in-game tutorial directs you to push keys that do nothing so I couldn't even launch the damn pod.There are fixes of course but I gave up out of sheer principle that this game was launched in such a state and to this day remains unfixed. Like the Titanic, this game should be thrown in the ocean and left to decay.			"
