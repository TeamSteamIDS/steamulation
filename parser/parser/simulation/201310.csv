												If you live a life where you already don't have any friends, have no hope of ever having a girlfriend, and have given up on the idea of healthy productivity in favor of being a waste of talent then I would say this is the game for you.  Otherwise you best steer clear for fear of tripping and falling down a rabbit hole from whence your real life will never return.  Im only slightly joking.  There are two games I have ever played that I truly love on one hand and truly regret on the other.  The first is Dark Souls, which drained away my entire year of 2011. The second, is this game and its predecessor, Terran Conflict.  I have played X3 for probably 1000 hours and it was a major contributing factor to my college GPA dropping seriously about 3 full tenths of a point and leading to a few failed classes that I had to stay an extra semester to retake.  There were other factors too dont get me wrong, but seriously if you don't have a healthy lifestyle to fall back on and you are a sucker for space sim type games this game might hook you and never let go until one day you stumble out of your apartment, blinded by the sun, realizing you havent shaved in 8 months and have lost 30 pounds and arent sure what year it is or what happened to your life or any of the people you used to know.  It is simultaneously the best and most dangerous thing you can buy for twenty dollars.  Whats sadder still is my hard drive failed and so I literally have nothing to show for at least 800 hours of my life.  Holy Sh!t.I tell you all this because theres no way to sum up what you can actually do in the game in any reasonable amount of words, but heres a few useful bits I have divided rather arbitrarily into 3 good points and 3 not as good points.Good stuff:1: Think of EVE Online, except its a single-player sandbox with about 200+ beautiful sectors populated by about 8 races, each with their own ships, technologies, stations, food supply chains, goods, etc. 2: You also can actually fly your ship (theres hundreds to choose from, some you'll have to capture but seriously you'll find something you love) itself with wasd or a joystick and dogfight unlike in EVE.3: You can basically do whatever you want from escorting passengers or assassinating criminals to mining manually or by setting up individual stations, fill holes in the economy to help AI fractions or build self-sustaining war fleets or illegal drug empires and supply chains that exist only in a single sector or stretch across the universe via automated trade fleets operating out of closed-loop complexes.  You can of course be a pirate too, ejecting marines out of you cargo hold and watch them jet-pack onto a ship and cut their way through the hull and kill everything inside while you delicately keep the ships shields down on the outside (otherwise your poor meat-puppets will fry and you'll be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cause training them is time sucking and expensive).  You can command huge fleets by piloting one ship, waiting till its on its last leg, ejecting into space, and teleporting into the cockpit of another one within 15km of you and keep hopping around as needed, some engagements can go on for a few hours if you want them too.  Heck you can even be a bloody day trader using the stock market.The less good parts (and things to take note of to help you).4: The interface takes some getting used to as its not all that intuitive but theres so many options and key bindings that I can see why making one would be hard.  You also need to remember that software upgrades and racial notoriety are the keys usually to success in the game.  You also need to pay attention to what areas need what goods and set up satellite networks to watch prices and supplies.5:  The vanilla universe can be a bit dry though because the AI factions and even the pirates arent always aggressive enough towards you or each other.  The economy can also kind of sputter out in certain areas if you don't help it out.  That said, I highly recommend you go to the Egosoft forumsd an download either the X-Tended Mod or the XRM mod as that will solve this problem.  You wont be able to get achievements but who cares about that anyway?  It also might disable the plot but the plot missions are soo long and absurd for such little story in return that most players dont bother and just create thier own roleplay story as the play in the sandbox.6:  I find managing large fleets to be difficult as there just arent enough options available for commanding large groups of them in meaningful ways.  The combination of SETA and autopilot can make things either crash into staions occasionally or make AI ships circle each other forever without ever being able to accurately hit each other.  Little bugs here and there like jumping through a gate in a large ship and accidentally ramming into a smaller ship on the other side and killing it, so the po-po comes after you.   Large trade fleets are tough to cause you rely so much on remote piloting by software commands and it becomes tough to keep track of them all and rememebring what routes you have going where, what sectors to avoid because of the Xenon and whatnot.  Again scripts and mods can fix a lot of this stuff though and I HIGHLY recommend modding the game as any issue you have with it or any added feature you would want someone has though of on Egosoft forums and has made a script for it.  The community is really helpful and dedicated, though it has shrunk some because of the unforgivable mess known as X;Rebirth  I should also mention theres a few exploits in the game too like nVidium mining and stock market abuse.I hope you find this review to be of some use to you.  Be aware of what happened to me and tread carefully.  Its a great game for those with patience, intellect, and no hope of success in the real world.  It is probably a grave risk for anyone else.  If you do take the plunge on an X game though, this is the one to get.			"

												The metacritic review score, in this case, I would personally say is innaccurate. This game is immense, with a small price tag for the hours you can get out of it.If I had to describe the game to someone, I would call it a singleplayer EVE online. But not only that, its a game where at the beginning you can scratch out a living as a trader in a universe with a living economy, or you can take part in skirmishes to fight your way to the top. Thing that I love about this game is the fact that say a pilot bails from a target ship, or you purchase a new ship. You can actually issue orders via a command console to any of your ships, including your current ship. Now of course you can fly them all yourself as well and take part in dog fights, launch boarding parties at vessels, or even later in the game take part in capital vs. capital ship battles. You could start a trading empire and purchase software for trade ships under your command where they act autonomously, seeking deals across the galaxy in your name. My point here is, the ability to loadout ships and amass fleets essentially means that if you choose so, you can turn the game into an RTS. The game can be as hands on as you make it, basically.Not to mention, you can purchase and construct space stations and factories yourself, impacting the economy. Prices rise and fall across sectors, a stock market exists impacted by station construction or destruction, and various races have different products. You have reputation with these factions as well, and there are randomly generated missions that appear constantly at stations during play. You can pick sides in a large scale conflict between two of the factions, or go after a specific race yourself in a bid to become a pirate lord.As I mentioned above, the game has immense potential for fun here. Being a sandbox game however, I will say the storyline missions for this game are poor. Sometimes bugs occur, your auto pilot can run you into things, etc. However, the flaws i've seen are vastly outshined by the positives, IMO. The graphics arent extremely good, as can be expected from a title getting a few years older now. No performance problems to mention except for occasional slow down during large battles, particle effect apocalypses, and certain nebulous sectors. The game IS also running calculations for an immense number of things in the background though!One other large thing to mention is there was quite a large modding community for this game. I personally run the X Rebalance Mod, and it has made my game much better, fixing and filling out features. Recommend it as well, though there are plenty of other mods out there worth checking out too. I will say modding here is not quite as easy as say, skyrim, using the workshop to place the new files automatically.+ Combat is thoroughly enjoyable, dogfights with fighter class ships a favorite, ducking in and out of capital ship fire+ Diversity in styles and types of ships, i enjoy diversifying my fleet+ Nonviolent methods to amass wealth and power as well, using trade to satisfy requirements for sectors+ Large number of mods out there+ RTS style commands for your ships~ Graphics are looking dated~ Sandbox haters, steer cleer!- Bugs are occasional, but often when it rains it pours: autopilot & asteroids dont mix!- Collisions: Your ships can seem magnetized. you will become frustrated, trust me. Theres a mod for that though!- Poor plot missions- Randomly generated missions can become repetitive- Difficult learning curve -- There are tutorials and guides!Plenty of people steer towards a certain type of 'space sandbox' but I for one have found my favorite game in the genre. No telling how many hours I'll end up with.DISCLAIMER: Haven't played X3:Terran Conflict, or any other X3 game, ONLY X3: Albion Prelude! I've heard X Rebirth was shoddy, don't buy that thinking ""its the next game, must be better!""			"

												One of the greatest games ever made!The game is a mess, incredibly confusing even after hundreds of hours of gameplay (try to stay 1 month without playing it and I assure you you will forget how to do some stuffs), sometimes boring as hell... and yet, you keep playing it, year after year, expansion after expansion... you keep building your empire somewhere in the galaxy, you keep trading, fighting, exploring... and then you stop playing it, you leave it for months, perhaps a year, and someday you play it again, you try another start, and than you are upset again with all the mess, with the odd menus, with the bizarre steps to do simple things, you try to stop playing... and then... you keep playing it, you keep dreaming about new ships, new factories, new objectives... and when finally you turn it off, you can still listen to the girl's machinal voice when you enter a new sector : ""Bala Gi Joy"", ""Menelaus Frontier""...This is the worst best game of all time ever! Why we love it? Can't say, it's a **** paradox, but we really love it!			"

												It's a great game--but not for newcomers to the series.  For those unfamilliar with the series, There have been three main editioons of X3: Reunion, Terran Conflict, and Albion Prelude.   Reunion and Terran conflict surround a core story of the game, with TC (in terms of gameplay) being an improvement on Reunion in virtually every way.   This game (AP) is the most polished installment of X3;  but it has little in the way of plot, vs the other games.   It has little in the way of ttorial and everything else.  Which means, any user is basically going to find themselves completely at a loss for what they should be doing.   I only mention this by way of saying, if you haven't played any of the X games, start with X3: Terran Conflict.   It is much more acessible (though this game's learning curve is almost vertical) than AP.   Once you feel comfortable with the game, and have a sense of the Universe you're in, then you may want to give this a shot.   AP improves in several ways on TC, with improved AI, improved long-distance (OOS) combat results, and better balance for ship strengths (hull plating is no longer made of paper mache).  So for veterans of the series, this ogame is top.   It lacks virtually any story, really...but that was never the most interesting part of these games anyway, was it?			"

												The paramount of the original X series, and the richest of all the space simulation / sandbox games I've ever come across. After spending 170 hours on this game and just finishing all of the plots it has to offer, I consider it convenient to write an accordingly comprehensive review of this masterpiece.I would like start with noting that I've been playing the X series for several years, starting with X2 The Threat and spending the most time on X3 Terran Conflict, which makes me consider the 170 hours of story gameplay quite a generous ammount of time a sandbox game has to offer, needless to say that I already knew all the controls from the previous games. But this game is not about to be ended by finishing the story, since it's a sandbox with a vast modding community, allowing to add even more amazing experience to it. Within those 170 hours I've only merely scratched the surface of what it has to offer, and didn't even find enough time for some complex constructing, as I did in TC.Albion Prelude is a great improvement over Terran Conflict, most notably the UI and hull overhaul, which means a much better use of wide screens and longer capital ship combat. All the tiny features which were simply missing from TC are now added and some of the flaws fixed (within the engine's capabilities), Xenon Hub no longer takes months to complete, and boarding is slightly less frustrating thanks to the heavier missiles having an actual hull value, so they won't explode after a first hit with practically anything. Some new ship classes were added aswell, including the military freighter, light carrier (drone frigate), and the heavy destroyers. That being said, I see no point in continuing Terran Conflict anymore, as Albion Prelude completely takes over it - just forget about the other X3 games if you only wish to get the most polished-out gameplay, not caring for the lore or story at all!The war which takes place throughout the game seems fun from the start, as the mighty Terran fleet clash with Argons over several sectors, but I don't find it very interesting due to the rapid response fleet and it's random behaviour, with enemy ships spawning out of thin space near your vessels, even in a friendly sector.A slight spoiler regarding the war and how to deal with it once and for all:it can be ended during the Shady Business plot, after choosing the option to turn against the pirates instead of capping/destroying the Ozias.The game is already content-rich enough that it needs no modding at all - at least not for the story and achievement getting period. Some of the ages-lasting downsides of X also carry over, since it's still the same old engine being desperately improved upon, including the clunky autopilot and not-the-most reliable AI pilots. A simple solution to that is to not use autopilot within Terran sectors (or not use it at all- manual flight with SETA is almost always the fastest option), and to not use AI wingmen way too often. It is usually possible to deal with anyone on your own, without the need for vast fleets.As for the modding part, I suggest the cockpit mod[forum.egosoft.com] as it brings a lot of immersion into the game, and for dealing with the clunky AI constantly crashing into stations, there's the Bounce mod[forum.egosoft.com]. I heard that the XRM is not the best option because of the annoying beam weapon spam and other things, but you can still get some of it's components, such as the X-Tra Ship/Station pack[forum.egosoft.com] or the Combat Mod[forum.egosoft.com]If you're new to the X games then you should know that this game gives you the power to experience a living universe with dynamic economy that is developing real-time: hundreds of ships endlessly traveling throughout the universe and stations that are being randomly built and destroyed, varying in each game based on how the economy decides to develop. Albion Prelude now offers over 200 sectors to visit and over 350 ships to fly with, has a beautiful calming soundtrack accompanied by exquisite starry sector backgrounds, is virtually crashless (unless you screw up with mods, audio codecs, or some other technical stuff), has a highly responsive UI, completely controllable by keyboard which is great for macros (you would be surprised but it's really useful as it can make accessing some deeply burried menus lightning fast), and the game has an enormous replayability potential, both vanilla and modded. I think it's really fine-coded and thus enjoyable, unless you're trying to run it on a calculator.Things to take in mind before getting into the X UniverseThe X series have always been quite difficult to grasp for newcomers and it's crucial that you arm yourself with a lot of patience for the first few days. You are going to die many times and probably get overwhelmed by the scale of the world aswell. It lacks a decent in-game tutorial and it won't guide you everywhere, so you do your best by looking up some beginner tutorials online before giving up entirely. For X3AP, the Argon Peacekeeper gamestart has the main plot of the game, but based on my experience I would rather suggest that you pick something a bit more peaceful first, such as the Humble Merchant. Master the controls and understand how trading works before engaging on something more serious, and you will relieve yourself of most of the trouble. The newest game of the series, X Rebirth, is showing a promising return to the forgotten roots of the old gameplay which took an unrepairable and undesired detour after X2, and the next X game will hopefully deliver us the features and content that most players still staying with X3 have been yearning for. But the original X series will always remain it's honorable place in my space sim heart.			"

												Buy ONLY if you have the patience to learn to play an absolutely astonishing game in detail, I did for 178 hours and I would play another 100 if I had time.I will list all the positive and negative sides that I can think of;POSITIVE* Open WorldOpen Space in fact, because it is reaaaaally large* Very limited RestrictionsAlmost none frankly* Multiple Approaches to gameplay Be a grand industrialist, Trader, Pirate, Pilot in Military, Monopoly or go mad and be a terrorist in terran space!... or ALL OF THEM* Constant progressThats right, there are plenty of things to do and improve, you won't have so much time to finish all the projects you had in your mind* Interactive WorldSome games offer just open world, here, you can literally affect the way things work... With consequences.* Virtual Economy You can affect or be effected by wide and witty created economy system, dont expect a huge touch in this, but know that it will certainly spice up the gameplay*Variety in Ships/StationsThe spaceships you can use, destroy, board, capture or disable are plently. Different classes (Scout, Fighter, Heavy Fighter, Destroyer, Carrier, Transport, Cruiser, Capital Ship, Boarding Ship, Missile Boat, Lasertower and many more)Each Race owns different stations with different properties which require different materials, goods and also provide different resources or weaponry parts etc.* Quests, Tasks, MissionsBesides the main story, there is a VERY large range of things to do in the game.. Buy the asteroid data or sector maps, build stations for others, follow ships to their secret meetings, escort or raid ships etc. You will find many things to keep yourself busy if desired.* Immersive Design and Fluentness It may sound weird, but you know there are some games that you want to play awhile but ending up playing hours of it and not even know how the time passed... Yeah, its that because there is always a great transition between the things you did, can do and will do in the game that you wont find a proper time to say : Ok Im done with it for today* Harsh environment You can deny if you want but we all know that is always better to succeed a hard task than a simple one... Sometimes, your mistakes or miscalculations in industry will cost you severely. Good thing is, there is always a way to bounce off the bottom rise again, it pushes you to think while playing too.* Quality SoundtracksThat is actually my opinion, but usually every sector you fly to will put you in the mood of that zone... Except combat, combat music is a bit.. meh... But again, that is just my opinion* Mod SupportDoes this Need explanation? Very large texture or gameplay mods to improve gaming experience... DUH!..NEGATIVE* Insufficient TutorialWell the game does have a tutorial system, but just enough to say ""yes it does have it"" it only teaches you the basics and the most fun parts (advanced systems, complex installations, running economy, ship design and weaponry etc.) are either learned from the internet or experience... It was both in my case. So be patient if you really want to taste the game's true potential and trust me, its not Quantum Physics, you can get the hang of it in no time.* Needs more User-Friendly Prompts, Commands and InterfaceWhat I mean is, this game is very deep and large in scale and detail that even though game offers very advanced and complex ways to fulfil your tasks or goals you still need various interactive ways to make things more accurate or better. It falls victim to its own depth in gameplay.  (There are plenty of mods to improve this, you can still be satisfied with the current system if you aren't a fan of mods and prefer vanilla experience, so no worries)* Minor AI problemsAs I said, they are minor... Sometimes (Rarely) a huge transport ship you hired from Paranid Empire can not fly to the jump gate because of small asteroids or similiar objects and detours indefinitely. This has very simple solutions with no fix or mod requirement (like flying out of sector and waiting for it to come) and similar little problems like these. In case it is needed, mods to fix these issues can be found throughout the web.* Needs MoreYes, yes I know I said this game has plenty to offer but you would understand if you played. They make the game so large that you will start asking for more even though it has serious amount of features in it already... Frankly, they released a patch (which is in expansion pack size) with a whole bunch of new things and 2 major storylines and more sectors with races and such... The developers provide, respect.OVERALLI would give this a clear 8.5 / 10 Mainly because it gave such an experience that I bothered to write a review about it!... Oh yeah, its my first review. Hurray.Also, I have played EVE Online for 4 years so if you already know that game, you will be familiar with the concept of this game. I also recommend X3 Terran Conflict & Albion Prelude to those who own the latest X title (X Rebirth) because you will witness completely different experience nevertheless!			"

												This game has claimed many an hour from me, and rightfully so. It brings to the table a world that you interact WITH not in, and does so in ways that has meaningfull impact to both the world, and yourself. You have to be patient, like most things in life, it takes time... it's not easy, but it it is rewarding. There is no instant gratification here, but if you want to test yourself, if your tired of the simple shooter and want to emerse yourself in a world that will test you.... you will enjoy this game.

												Well, what's there to say about the game Steam lists as the single largest time-sink in my library?It's good.With any suspense now ruined, let's continue with the review.  X3AP is a game that has a 12 year legacy behind it, itself nominally the expansion to X3:Reunion released in 2005.  It's ""Yet Another Elite Clone"" (the 1984 grandaddy that defined the Space Sim we all know and love today), part of a series that had done at the time what no other Space Sim could:  it faithfully expanded upon the core gameplay and scope of space sims.Before Elite: Dangerous, the X series was considered the spiritual successor to Elite, and X3AP stands as the final product from years of refinement.  X3AP is far from a perfect game; its quirky with flat race and character design, simple narrative and mission systems, and plays better as a sandbox ""universe"" than it does as the story-driven experience it toys with.  The UI is functional but clunky and opaque without practice.  Its learning curve is more of a mountain, however the game's designed to be picked up piecemeal without forcing all of the meta and control systems down your throat at start.  It crashes, somewhat often, and many of the useful time-saving features (like in-space save) have to be earned.  Music can be glitchy; I've had it improperly download the music files on clean installs before and have found out recently these files might be the cause of some of my crashes.  Auto-pilot will end up killing you more often than missiles if you use it, and combat's fun but somewhat simplistic.Sounds like a solid 6-7 ""meh"" of a game, right?  Except that it isn't.  At the time X3 came out, it was a visually stunning game that pushed the benchmarks of PCs and user expectations.  Its dynamic world system created actual working trade where destroying a transport could affect the economy of a sector, either raising prices for the needed items or causing its weapons or munitions production to stop.  GoD (The Global Decison Engine... I know, we call it GoD anyways) would remove factories that were no longer in use and add new ones as required creating a unique playthrough every time.  It also creates military patrols for the different races in order to protect areas that come under attack and pirates to disrupt trade.  There's even times when ""war"" happens, with two race militaries facing off in large skirmishes within sectors (this is different from AP's War Sectors, although it's pretty rare to see).  And the universe is always running, even for the sectors you aren't in, the game calculates the lives of near a hundred sectors filled with ships and factories.  Profit and death continues, regardless of what you do. Add to this a vibrant world where there's no ""tier"" system of ships, and all races offer competitive fleets to choose from that follow unique fleet doctrine (eg, Split field fast and aggressive ships, Teladi defensive and slow) while also giving players a chance to OWN their own fleets and factories and command their own battleships.  It's expansive,  it's literally a game greater than the sum of its parts.  And AP has only honed this by adding new features (namely the war zones, some ship upgrades, and the stock market), some re-balancing and overall improving the experience to make it a solid 2011 game.  It's a game with few peers if any (I haven't played Eve).If it sounds too complicated or in depth for you, I don't blame you.  It can take more than 40 hours of playtime to hit ""mid-game"" of a playthrough.  There's a great modding community which can expand on the game's playability endlessly.  The game's script engine is readily accessible if you want to try adding in new features.If you think you're up to the challenge, I highly recommend this game to you, if only until the release of the 2016 ""next gen"" Space sims.If you're reading this and No Man's Sky, Star Citizen, and Limit Theory are already released?  I'd recommend watching their LPs and getting those games first (assuming they're good).  Afterwards, get this.  X3AP is a milestone in the Space Sim genre.  And it might still remain the best example of a first-person fleet-strategy-action-economy-simulation game we'll get for a long time.  It's worth the money, at least until Egosoft releases its proper successor.			"

												This is the world's premier trading simulator. Don't let anybody trick you into thinking this is about spaceships or shooting ♥♥♥♥ with lasers. This game is all about middle management of trading convoys.Have you ever dreamed of punching time acceleration in a game to 10x then letting it run overnight instead of actually playing it?

												This has to be one of my favorite games I've ever played in vanilla.  I can enjoy games like Elder Scrolls with tons of mods practically forever, but this one is great out of the box.  THEN you can mod it.  Mod it forever.  Play it for thousands of hours, modding it as you go, and never getting bored.  Plus, it's really dirt cheap when you consider the content this game brings with it.  Play as a space pirate, dogfighting your way through in tiny ships.  Play as an admiral, commanding those little minnows to fight as you sit comfortably inside your armored whale of a carrier ship.  Be a mercantile tycoon, sitting in tugboat corvettes pulling asteroids to your newly-built space station complexes that ruthlessly harvest all resources in a sector for maximum profitsss.  If you like the fun of having a chance to change genres on a whim while slowly clawing your way up the ladder, and reveling in how far you've come from your shoestring budget days up to buying whole solar systems, this is one of the most engaging games you can lose a whole month playing.

												Albion Prelude is one of the best space simulation games that I've ever played.  The game can seem daunting at first.  When I first bought it I would try to play 15 minutes, get overwhelmed at the choices and then not play it again for a month.  I finally spent some time on YouTube learning the ins and outs of the game and promptly played the hell out of it for months after.  If you have no interest in spending time learning a game outside of playing it (and I wouldn't blame you) then don't pick up Albion Prelude.  However if you want to play an open ended game where you can create a trade empire, assault a capital ship with your marine squad, build your own space station, and fight hostile alien races.  Then give X3 a try.   "

												It's ok.To make my review more valuable to the interested:I haven't played Terran Conflict. I chose to begin with Albion Prelude for reasons I'm unsure of now, so I can't compare to X3:TC for those coming from there. I can, however, fully support new players starting with X3:AP like I did.X3:AP is a great sandbox game with just enough guided gameplay in the form of various plotlines. The plotlines have enough information about the universe to give new players a basic understanding of events past and current. The game shines most as a sandbox, though.The systems in X3:AP include both combat and trading fleet management, ship customization in the form of basic upgrades, computer systems, and weapons, station building with much freedom. Management systems seem to hold their own. I find they do what they need to quite well. All of these items are great and fun to play with, but are tarnished by limitations when you get deeper in to the game.The most annoying of those limitations comes from the game's engine. Slowdowns occur in heavily populated sectors, especially with large player station complexes or large-scale battles. The slowdowns in large complexes can be bearable, but I've found large scale battles to be impossible to participate in. Even now with updated hardware, the game still stuggles for me. With that issue, you're left fighting these battles OOS (out of sector), commanding your fleets on the sector map.Other issues that tarnish the gameplay come in the form a major and minor bugs. One major bug is the erratic behavior of friendly ships in war sectors while OOS which will cause you ship casualties if you don't keep them out of those sectors (which is only about 6 sectors, but still an annoyance).Some things in the game seem to have little value to the experience such as the Unfocused Jumpdrive and covert missions, but the bulk of the game seems to hold it's worth.Overall, you can find much enjoyable in the game. Most bugs and annoyances you won't realize until you've put plenty of time into the game making a purchase worthwhile. Working your way up from one ship to an army with system of stations producing whatever you desire is an enjoyable experience. Carelessness can always get you killed or your profits lost.			"

Just don't expect the game to hold your hand much. There is a main story line, which i recommend playing through, but it can, like Elite, put you in the world and say off you go.			"

												Forget the last installment (X:Rebirth). This is the absolute crown of the series.Amazing depth, complexity, moddability and visuals, this Ship of the line of the X-series puts you in a truly captivating and immersive universe for you to explore. I've spent countless hours back before on non steam version with simply exploring systems as I searched for lucrative trade opportunities and keeping an eye out for hostile presence on the scanners, but if you want to do mission, bounty hunt, build or pirate, you have all the opportunities.My favourite of the X series. The interface might be a bit intimidating first, but you can soon get used to it and it truly feels like a complex, scriptable ship computer, again adding a bit to the immersion and the tools it offers to the player in commands and mods are endless.

												This is probably the most immersive game I have ever played. Due to the modability and scriptability, there's constantly new features available. The entire X3 series will test your skills to the limit. The X3 series is more about wits than force, though when your preparations are in place, there will be plenty of that going around.If you like a quick game, this is not for you.If you are easily frustrated, this is not for you.If you want a game that you hit the ground running, this is not for you.If you can hold your wits about you and build your emipre while hammering those you had to ♥♥♥♥ off to do so, you are in for one hell of a ride. I'm not one for reviews, and this is the first game review I have written, but after several hundreds of hours over the past few years, this game deserves one. Now I have wasted enough time.

												Forget about half ♥♥♥ casual games like Elite: Dangerous. This is the best space game so far. It has everything you'd want: A LOT of different ships to fly, exploration, itemization, complex economy, several factions to interact with different personalities and likes/dislikes, build / take space stations, stuff to do / explore even late in the game and a huge amount of freedom in what to do. Capture ships, steal loads, trade illegal stuff (weapons, drugs) or just let your AI Pilotfleet trade while you join an army, it's really up to you. Downside: You should look up some stuff! Many different items and customisations for your ship or goods mean to read about them. Some information is not easy to find at first, but it's worth it. It's a deep and complex space-/fight-/trade simulation which is it's strongest point. What I'd want from x4: Stay the same. Be complex, be deep! We have enough of the shallow crossover plattform games with the  fly-in-emptyness-and-don't-do-much-at-all sllllhit. We have enough of the stripped down games that are easy to get into but are boring after the first 5 hours.<3 X3			"

												The pinnacle of achievement in space games.  Don't be turned off by their disappointing later title, everyone just went back and played X3 again.  It's everything you've wanted.Pros:- Huge.  This game is huge, in the best way.- Pretty.  Very pretty.- Great universe to explore.- Tons of diversity in ships, weapons, outfits, etc.- Dynamic economy works in an excellent way.  Yes, there are demands you need to fill and supplies you need to take, but you will compete with a whole ton of AI trading in doing so.  It's fun.- You can do anything you want to.  Fly a fighter around and dogfight, fly a capital ship and blow up stations, fly a corvette which is a good mix, fly a freighter and trade, command a fleet of all of them, build stations, build a trade empire, build a weapons empire, create huge complexes, change the (well-simulated) economy - anything.Cons:- UI kinda sucks.  Flying and fighting is fine, but the menu system to execute fleet commands and whatnot is very clunky and takes time to get used to.  It's worth it, but, yeah, it's the biggest complaint everyone has.- Not much for plot, there are storylines to follow, but take the 'sandbox' tag seriously.  If you want a linear space-combat story game, this is not for you.  If you want to do everything else you could imagine, this is for you.- You need to install the bonus pack to fix a lot of problems.  It's free, but I'm not sure it's installed by default on the steam version, so don't forget to check.			"

												With 800+ hours it's obvious I love X3 and X3AP is my fave of the seires.X3 is an empire building game more than a space sim, you're objective is to make money and build massive fleets to go rampaging around the galaxy with.Some tips:First off grab the bonus pack found under the DLC, along with the turbo boost there's also commercial agent which is one of my fave scripts, it's like adding a mini RPG to the game as your pilots level up and gain new skills.The auto pillock (auto pilot):It has issues, after playing the game for a while you get to know when and when not use it, not as bad as it's made out to be just situational (I mostly don't use it).Game starts: I recommend the Bankrupt Assassin which is the sandbox start, you have a decent M3 but no money, it will put you staight into the action with M5 pirates chasing you down.SETA:SETA starts at a default of 600% go into options and crank it up to 1000% this will make the auto pilot less reliable though I find the better your CPU the more reliable it is. SETA is very handy if you want to use the stock market as you can sit outside the station and speed up time for some easy early game money. The stockmarkets a bit cheesy as it's too easy to make money, plenty of guides online if that's your bag. Reputation:Building up reputation with races unlocks higher teir weapons, ships and equipment for that race; though some missions are easier than others. Patrols are best for rep grinds especially if you can pick up station defence missions in the same sector. Military transport missions are also a good early game source of rep and cash, cargo life support is needed (find at pirate bases) and time limits can be tight, I tend to use manual docking until I get a docking computer.There are missions to avoid such as convoy missions unless you have a decent M6 or better.There's also racial hatred so killing Boron's in Split sectors will get rep for Split but with loss of rep for the Borons, can be useful when rep isn't high enough for missions.Boarding:I love boarding, you can wait and get a missile frigate (50mil) using boarding pods and flail barrage missiles but for a challenge try an M3 and TP combination (recommend Geochen), there's plenty of guides on you tube. It's tough but very rewarding and gets you access to some big ships you could'nt otherwise afford in the early game. This type of boarding is called 'spacewalk' as you dump your marines close to the target and hopefully they make it to the hull alive, salvage insurance (quicksave) invaluable.Early game targets should be TM and M6 class ships until your marines have levelled up. An M6 that can mount ION Disrupters will make boarding much easier, you get a Centaur as reward doing the Argon story line, it'll come with some marines. The Hyperion Vanguard, a paranid ship which can't be bought is about the best player ship there is, you'll find it in paranid sectors. If your not ready to board buy an m5 and put it on follow to keep track of it.Marines:It's a pain training marines, when buying go for the fighting stat as it can't be trained, they get better at fighting if they survive a boarding mission. Train all in engineering, a couple in mechanical and hacking.   Factories and complexes:This is where the real money is, setting up a lucrative Bliss place in Teladi territory will fill your coffers in no time but you can't beat well designed complex either for money making or for kitting out your fleet with missiles. Check google for the complex calculator.OOS:Out Of Sector plays a big part in X3, basically every sector your not in is OOS and the rules change. OOS combat for instance relies more on shields than weapons so fighters like the Falcon Hauler with 200mj shield fair very well even though they have very little weapon energy.Docking also becomes instant, telling a freighter to dock and then jumping out the sector and using SETA will speed things up with no risk of your freighter crashing into a station.Carriers:Setting up carriers is quite labour intensive, I suggest the Solano M4, good shields and can be bought in bulk (10 at a time) and they can be equiped en mass though Legend Home doesn't provide much in the way of ship equipment.Setting your fighters into wings and asigning their homebase makes life alot easier. One of my favorite early game strategies is to head for Yaki space and grab a Chokaro, it holds 3 fighters and good storage space for jump drive energy and missiles for restocking, there also handy for picking up ships that bail.Plugins:Plugins, except for the bonus pack, add 'modified' to the game so no achievments but there are some great mods out there. Grab Cycrow's plugin manager and the no-steam.exe.Check these out:XRMPirate Guild 3Yaki ArmadaNPC bailingImproved BoardingMarine RepairsI can't recommend this game enough, just don't buy X-Rebirth it's a different game altogether ;)Best X3 website:https://roguey.co.uk/x3ap/Complex Calculator:http://grangegame.co.uk/x3tcocc.html "

You might open it a few times, mess around a bit and realize ""Whoa, this is gonna take some time to learn"".  At least thats what i did.

I recommend this game to anyone who's looking to control massive space fleets including logistics and combat support and build huge factory compex's to support said fleet and make millions of credits in the process. The learning curve isn't as steep as KSP, but any beginner can get the hang of it within a couple hours (and with a little help from roguey).			"

												I found this game while looking for alternatives to Escape Velocity: Nova, which was getting a bit old (it'll be 12 this year). This is pretty much the same concept but in 3D, with voice acting and a whole lot of additional complexity. I enjoyed what I played of it, but I took a break for about two weeks and then found when I went back I had no idea: - why I had three carriers loaded with M4 ships - what my goal was- how to play the game.So I stopped. But, if you don't mind running to Google every few minutes early on, it's pretty rewarding. Sure, the dogfighting combat sucks, the UI sucks, the voice acting, animations and sound in general all suck, but the simulation of a living universe and the sense of exploration is unparalleled by anything less than Escape Velocity: Nova.

												WARNING: You must look online for how to properly play this game. I reccomend Roguey's site.Once you have learned how to play this game, it gives you hours upon hours of things to do. This is probably THE greatest space sim out there right now. PROs:- Huge number of ships you can buy and pilot. From a tiny M5 scout to a huge M2 destroyer.-You can automate other ships you own to do a large variety of things-You have an actual impact on the economy-Some rewards for the plot missions are just awesome. (Hub, Breaking Ground)-Not extremely demanding on hardware, I play on a older laptop with no problems.-You can spend hours doing nothing and have funCons-Pretty much get thrown in blind, learn how to play as you go. (Use online guides or you will become extremely frusterated.)-Very few plot missions.-Slow at start-Sometimes the autopilot decides to kamikazee into random ships/stations (Often during jumpgate transitions.)-Some generic missions you pick up are literally impossible. -You can spend hours doing nothing and not have fun			"

												TL:DR: Economistic game with spaceship sim controls and empire building. Pro's:Fun space simulator.Requires Thinking.Combat is enjoyable.Empire Building.Control massive fleets.Build massive bases.Fun economy.Graphics are pretty if somewhat dated.Music is great.Fleet control is good.Menu's.Good modding community.Replay value is infinite.Con's:Epic learning curve. Time consuming.Slow to start with.This game is worth every penny that you spend on it, however it does require a lot of frustrating hours to learn how to actually play the game because it is so complex. However this does have the added benefit of giving a lot of satisfaction once you learn how a particular process works and can apply it ingame. You cant compare this game to any other games because it is a niche all of its own. Its a thinking persons game, and in many areas overly complicated but in a good way because it actually gives you control over everything! I totally love it. Oh and its a blast to fly around with a joystick :)Wish I'd bought this years ago. Sadly I didn't and regret putting it off. This is a true hidden gem that many people wont have heard of and I highly recommend it.			"

												They gave me a space game. I thank them for that. One of the single best video gaming/simulation experiences Ive ever had and possibly the best ten bucks you'll spend your entire life, that is if your a true space junky! Keep in mind that the game requires original x3 but this is better than all the rest. There is a heavy learning curve tho and requires research to get the most out of but your patience is rewarded (steam hrs not reflective of actual offline play). There is almost too much to do if you set your own goals, like warring, trading, building factories, mines or whatever. The game grips you and doesnt let go. HUGE variety of space ships will keep you up trolling forums till 4 am (I recommend Rougey's ;) ) reading ship specs salvating over that new carrier purchase! Great game, Good times. I originally played this game back in 2013 and realized its truths but here I am again and something keeps luring me back. For the life of me cannot find anything similar on the market better than this. I couldnt recommend this game enough that is if you have the time. Oh and stay the ""F"" away from x-rebirth, its like this games uglier, dumber inbred cousin. NO! 9/10 Would build space weed factories while taking a lil puff puff again.			"

												Well as it stands, i'm not a X game veteran yet but i know my things in the games of those i played so far.This game of all of the X-series i seriously can't stretch enough of how good it is to waste hours into, i played X-rebirth for 600 hours atleast but albion prelude in my honest opinion is the gem of all of their games, atleast so far.The game itself has lot of space to travel in, it has also a strong economy that you can start trading in to learn the basics and as well to get a good head start of playing the game in a safe and progressive way also the start of the game's economy is random generated from ''somewhat poor to really good'' The best start as a trader should always be a wish for a poor economy that you can benefit from, for combat as a starter it can get a bit overwhelming at the beginning, depends atleast on what kind of ship you were playing with and aganist otherwise its really fun just destroying enemies that thought you were an easy kill.For any recommendation for this game i can only give you that i won't spoil too much but say its all worth it if you really want a space game that you can com home to and waste a day or your life into, it also contain the possibility to be replayed.Honestly, this was my first ''serious recommendation'' of a game that i gave some time to write about, if you truely love space games that isn't a ''No Man's Sky'' Then i would give this game a go, if you're in doubt, wait for a steam sale to drop by, almost at every summer or christmas sale these  games goes on for a good price but other than that? It's a solid game.As i said, i won't spoil the game so it had to be short, also why are you even looking here? "

												Do you like space sims? If yes, get this. Simple as that. It doesn't even matter whether you like trading or fighting, building great empires or simpyl breaking other's toys. It doesn't, because X3AP has it all.This is the most authentic experience any space sim can offer. How often do you read marketing trash like ""bring the universe down or see it rising under your leadership"" and other piles of ...? It is all true in X3AP. Via trade or construction, performed by you personally or by your owned ships, you can see empires rise and working. With ships you either fly or via countless choices in fleet management you can experience epic battles of hundreds of fighters and dozens capital ships clashing for control of systems. Good thing X3AP has very vell optimised engine because once you get this sort of fleet fighting you will never want anything else. And the last great thing? Modding community. Scripts addind basicaly anything you ever wanted into the game, complete overhauls and mods that give you anothoer hundreds of hours spend in this epic universe. This game is a jewell, a thing anyone who things highly of space sims should play. No matter what you liked on space games you will like it even more after this. This game has one downside though. Some call it a bit complicated. I see that as a misunderstanding of the concept of the game. Just as you can't compare CaC and Europa Universalis you can't compare X3AP and any other space sim that is scaled down and simplified to smashing buttons and marrying the space princess after five hours of arcade shooting. This game is great and complex and gives you great tools to achive things. But if you are looking for an arcade shooter or arcade builder, look elsewhere. This game is by no means simplified and it gives you all the control you could have ever wanted. It gives you the power to do great things, and if that scares you ore you don't feel like doing that, look elsewhere. But for the rest of us, this is a must-have.			"

Become a police officer and patrol sectors, fight in large battles between races, pirate and fly any ship you see, or just simply trade your way to the top. Every single ship is unqiue, flyable, and customizable (in terms of gear), and there are no ""I win"" ships. Each fighter, bomber, corvette, destroyer, etc has its own strengths and weaknesses .And to the people who write: ""theres nothing to do i dont know how to fly this game sux 0/10""Not every game is ""Press F to win"" The learning curve is gigantic, but the game is WELL worth learning. I have over 230 hours in Terran Conflict and I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the universe.Still on the fence? If you don't like something about the game, check the Egosoft forum. Nearly every single bug and irritation in the game (such as the suicidal fighter AI) has its own user-made fix. It doesn't stop there though. Major mods like X-Tended and X Rebalanced  add tons of new content to the already amazing base game. If you haven't bought the game by now and are still reading this review, stop wasting time! Buy the damn game already!9.5/10			"

												Even 4 years old this game is amazing.  It has phenomenal breadth, combat both fighter and capital ship level, trading at an individual level and (with the free bonus content) across the universe with trained merchants doing your bidding and complex factory and entire physical space factory complexes that feed the economy. There is a stock market that is a reflection of product and resource availability.  As others have suggested the learning curve can be intimidating.  Starting with just a handful of credits and a humble ship you can find the universe a very unforgiving place with massive ships and brutal pirates who won't think twice about crushing you.  This does make the achievement of your first  million something you really feel proud when you remember how you were scrapping for 500-1500 credit profit on your earliest of trading runs.  The graphics have held up well, good use of shadows, nice textures and the different races ships have their own specific sense of style.  There is no mistaking the organic influences of the Boron ships or the utilitarian blocky Split constructs.  Asside from the challenge of learning the game (not necessarily a criticism) there are a few minor gameplay issues that can annoy (autopilot AI will sometimes freakout and plow you into an asteroid or station) and the layout of complexes of factories can sometimes yield a nearly undockable (by AI controlled ships) end result.  Some careful planning and spending some time on youtube watching videos on how to avoid this helps a lot.  I bought this game on launch and keep coming back to it over the years.  Note that the latest iteration of the series is a nearly complete reboot and not at all comparable, in my view, of the previous X games.  Each of them had gotten better up til the Reunion game.  and X3 Albion Prelude is a must have space (near) simulation of commerce, combat and industry.			"

												A decent space flying game with a lot of variety in the gameplay... but also a very broken game.X3: AP is about flying and doing whatever you like. ""Whatever"" in this particular case can mean a lot of things, such as fighting or trading or completing missions or playing with stock exchange, building your own fleet and base, exploring new territories... and most of these things are fun. When they work. The flying is pretty good, and the gameworld consists of many small areas (which is pretty weird for a space game, I think), many of the mare quite similar, but the environments are impressive nonetheless. There is about 270 areas to explore, and flying to see new places is a joy in itself.Combat is alright, but it could be better. It's not bad though, just very average. Fortunately, building your own fleet and base give a lot of satisfaction and are worth your time. There are both main quest missions and generated random missions. While I can say that I quite like the randomized missions, which are varied and even interesting (for a generated ones), the main quests are simply... broken. Sometimes I could not complete a main quest because one of the missions bugged out. The story isn't really that interesting in the first place though, so you might as well forget about the storyline. Trading is alright, just like combat, and it's a totally viable option too. If you don't want to fight, then trading is a good way to spend your time in this game, enjoyable when combined with exploration, and it's also the easiest way to generate a lot of money. Avoid stock exchange though, it's broken and developers never cared enough to fix it.AI is dumb as bricks... or even worse. Autopilot crashes you into other ships (or ""buildings"") a lot, and if you are near gates, then sometimes a ship spans at your position and you explode. This is quite frustrating. Enemies are easy to out-maneouver.The sounds in this game... are bad. You should accept the fact that apparently there is air in space and you hear sounds of everything around you, while explosions look very... Earthy. Sounds disappoint, but music is great and differentiates a lot between various areas. Some of the tracks are great to listen to even outside of the game.X3: Albion Prelude is even larger than previous X games. It has more territories and more ships. It's a decent game well worth a purchase, and probably the best to play in the series, especially if you have never played any X game before. I recommend it to those who like space action games (some people wrongly describe it as ""space simulator"", do not get mistaken, there is no simulation in this game) and sandbox games where they just play around without any specific goal, and I recommend it to those who have never tried any space game before as X3: AP is a good way to check out if you like the genre. Overall, a good game, but quite bugged.			"

												Whether or not I recommend this game is something of a complex question. I think that it depends on the type of gamer and the type of game you are looking for. Let me get this out of the way right now: X3 Terran Conflict and X3 Albion Prelude are NOT simple games. They do not provide a comprehensive tutorial and fail to explain a large amount of the basic strategies that a player should know in order to enjoy the game. You'll have to go to the forums for that, and you will find a mixed bag of documentation. Some of it is really good, and very helpful, but some of it is just not. If you are a casual gamer looking for something fun to pick up and play, this is not a game for you. In that same vein, this game is also really, really slow. If you're the kind of person who would like to simply just blow ♥♥♥♥ up and have a lot of fun action, you're also going to be sorely disappointed. X3:TC and X3:AP both suffer from the same issue: They want to include a lot of different features. This means that although combat works, and is fun, and there are a lot of good weapons, missiles and ship platforms available, it is sparse, and also tends to be annoying with the AI's tendency to crash player-owned ships into one another. I do give this game a recommendation, however, as the other aspects of the game more than make up for the issues I have listed. Yes, the game is complex and difficult to understand, but that complexity brings in a high degree of control over player-owned assets, such as commanding ships as to how low their shields should be before they jump away from a fight, or setting the likely-hood of a ship launching any missiles that have been installed on-board. Weapons can be swapped out, and most of them are side-grades and depend on the role you are attempting to fill. The universe really does feel varied with several distinct different races to gain reputation with and buy their faction-specific ships. The plot is a bit thin and the voice acting is laughably bad, but personally it doesn't upset me too much when a sandbox game doesn't have a strong plot. Games such as Minecraft and Terraria have even less of a plot than this game.It did take me an hour or two to figure out good strategies for fighting and trading, and quite a few trips to the forums, but eventually the game opens up and becomes actually enjoyable, and it allows you to be nearly whatever you want. Unfortunately, although the game allows for a ""custom start"" option, short of downloading X3 Editor 2 and manually editing the game's files to add a new game start, there is no way to have a truly customized start, which is disappointing. In the most basic sense: Yes, this game is fun, if you are willing to put the time in to understand it. It is solidly made, most things make sense in it and although it has flaws, they are easy to ignore.			"

												Quiet simply the best space action game I've ever played if you played Freelancer back in the day and had so many things u wished u could do in it, most of those things are in the vanilla versoin of this (and if not theres tons of mods). The interface is quiet slow and confusing but once u get used to it it becomes and extremely powerful tool for building and managing your growing commercial empire or battle fleet.Practically everything u see flying in space can be either bought and/or stolen and flown by u personally.Most of the stations in the game are buyable from shipyards and you can build them wherever you like.Note though if u prefer flying fighters u wont have much chance of killing Capital ships with one, but you can still fly a fighter and order heavier ships or a swarm of fighters to kill enemy heavies. If you choose to fly a capital ship you will be able to kill anything on your own (at least 1v1)But I'm not sure why u would stick with one ship in this game u can own a ship for every occasion and switch between them whenever you like.

												You can perfect your flying skills, grind missions and do trade runs for hours to build up your fortune in order to get your fledgling business off the ground and maintain a reasonably-sized protection fleet. Or you can be the Space Wolf of Wall St, manipulating the stock market and spending hundreds of millions of credits on capital ships that you crash into space stations. Sometimes you'll have days where you just have to get in your missile frigate and vaporize entire sectors, expressing little to no remorse at having taken billions of innocent lives. Seriously, this game has it all. Unfortunately ""it all"" includes laughable voice acting and writing, a few overly complicated menus/functions, and an AI that for some reason works great until it's piloting your 50 million credit station transport that you spent 8 hours trying to cap from the Terrans, at which point it begins to behave like a 100 year old blind dog with Parkinson's is at the helm. Still a 9.5/10 space sandbox with an absurd amount of content and a reasonably compelling story, $10 is a steal for the hundreds of hours of enjoyment you'll get out of this.			"

												I'm sure I can speak for a modest few when I say that I occasionally drift away from X after playing it hardcore for a hot minute.It might be a few months naturally, or...I'll read about some new space game coming out and start thinking to myself ""Self,"" I'll say aloud because I have issues not related to the topic at hand, ""aside from being such a casual, yet debonair gentleman of good taste, you know for a fact that you own one of the best space games of all Morris Day and the frickin' Time!

												If you want to get any X-game to try it out this is the one (do not play Rebirth first!), it has the least steep learning curve of the series and if you complete the main plot you have a couple million to start trading early rather than grinding back and forth between stations using SETA (you still do that, but not as much).CombatThe big difference between this and X3:TC is the fact the Argon and Terrans are at war, so there are war sectors included which are interesting and can be dangerous to players, however apart from these sectors the universe feels more safe due to the absence of the Kha'ak. So apart from these sectors and a couple of pirate sectors the universe will feel completely harmless.The combat is fun (at least in my opinion) as it requires many skills, during your game you will fly smaller fighters in one on one combat, engage against M7 frigates, and finally in Battleship M2 battles, each requiring different tactics to defeat. However the game has balancing issues in some respects, missile frigates can destroy anything, and are frequently spawned from combat missions. Put simply I saw 3 M2's, 2 M1's and pretty much everything else in a sector get destroyed by 1 missile frigate, as the cpu ships don't seem to understand missile defence, the only thing stopping it destroying my fleet was that it ran out of missiles.TradePlayed an X-game before? Ok skip this part, there is very little change from previous X games in this section as the expansion   focuses mostly on combat, except for the inclusion of a stock exchange which allows you to invest in shares, and your actions in the universe affect the share prices based on demand and supply of the good you invested in. Issue being this makes the game very easy if you use exploits or have a complete monopoly within a sector.For new people the trading is actually quite good at showing simple demand and supply economics (price elasticity may even be present!), put simply buy goods in high supply in low demand in one sector for a low price, next go to a sector where that good is in low supply and high demand. Sell it for profitsssssssss (meet the Teladi) and repeat over and over until you know exactly where the SETA key is.ExplorationOther than about 2 sectors there is not many new regions to explore from X3:TC, but that does not take away the fact that it is a massive game, and will take you literally days for you to find all of the sectors due to a couple of hidden unknown sectors.SummaryThis game and the X series in general is not for everyone, as it requires the most amount of patience I have encountered in a video game (the many years of Football Manager and Championship Manager are not even close to this for time commitment) but if you stick with it you will uncover a jem of a game, and even if you do not want to spend the time justinstall some mods (really recommended for new players as it adds so much to the game), change the players name to ""Thereshallbewings"" and script in your fleet of Excelsior and Galaxy class ships and the Normandy SR2 as your flagship frigate and take over the Galaxy!

												This really isn't a game for the faint-of-heart or players without patience. If you want to fly a fighter and dogfight waves of bogeys...this isn't the game for you.If you want to start small and build an empire of stations and ships from interceptors to mighty carriers, then you've come to the right place. But you still are going to need perserverence. This is a clunkily-designed game with a frustrating interface where commands you will need are buried in menus buried under menus with no explanation of how to find them or how to use them once they do. And it will sometimes not be clear if they even did. Features that seem obvious will sometimes be missing and next to nothing will be intuitive.Get a friend who has played the game to help you a long. Get lots of friends -- the game does have a strong, if small, following. The X3TC subreddit is a great place to go, as is Roguey's site (google him).So for all the game's flaws, what's right? Combat is satisfying, customization is satisfying, and even the most mundane tasks like trading can be strangely rewarding. The slow and steady drive of your hauler as you travel from gate to gate, monitoring for trade opportunities on the way while watching your radar for hostiles -- very immersive. You're also not going to have many other opportunities to captain a capital ship in first person, and this game offers a lot of that.It's also got a huge and very thorough mod community. If you see an issue with the game, there is likely a mod that will help. Many are available to simplify actions without reducing complexity.This game is a very deep sandbox. It will reward you, I guess, if you just want to fly around ahd shoot other fighters. But you'd be digging a small hole in a big beach.			"

												Best 4X Space Sim bar none! Excellent in almost every way. You can really lose quite a lot of hours playing X3 and the Albion Prelude is a great continuation of both the plot as well as what I would consider the main open-ended game. Albion Prelude features just about every fix or tweak you could ask for and as a result is extremely polished.Do keep in mind how this game rewards spending time. It's not grindy in an MMO style, but one can easily imagine how 'trading from bottom to top, earning millions' will simply take time. People who want an easier start should definitely start with the Humble Merchant setting and perhaps try their hand as the stock exchange market to get their first millions. Then after that you can essentially do whatever you like. The game allows for multiple save games, so there's definitely room for experimentation. Some things, like setting up an automatic trade route do often require specific space ship software systems, same goes for managing space stations you can buy and run. There's a slight learning curve to expect there, certain sectors in the game are easier / more difficult to get profitable stations going.Exploring the X universe in X3: Albion Prelude is awesome. If I actually had more time to play, I'd probably easily spend hundreds of hours in this game. The open-ended nature and the freedom of choice is great. (Also, do not buy X: Rebirth. So far X3: Albion Prelude is superior in every single way imaginable, except for perhaps the graphical fidelty. X3: Albion Prelude still is a great looking game though.)			"

												An interesting game which has quite the potential.  I found the storyline part to be rather short and possibly rushed which I found to be a little sad.  There are however other small story quests with other races that can be played during and after the story line.  For the most part it is well balanced excepting when you cannot immediately identify what class of ship in the info bit.  Overall a great game with lots of potential for expansion by modders.Additional;  The Hub plot I have found to be quite good as it gives you a chance to cap Terran ships without the added Osaka class ships that are gunning for ya.  The Player HQ makes a return and is sweet as like the last time.  I found the Aran to be way under powered as far as it's movement went and personally think that the ship ought to have had a similar function as the shipyard as far as repairs go.The shady business plot and the Corporation Troubles were sadly rather lacklusture as it looks very much like they pinched the quests from modders without the voicing.  The Shady business one is, as a commenter mentioned, difficult.  Haven't finished it yet but think maybe it could have been added in after the breaking grounds one where you get your own sector, which I found sweet but again sadly lacklusture as one side borders a warzone and the other pirates.  I think maybe they ought to have swapped the pirate sector with either a Commonwealth Sector or maybe an empty sector for travelling traders as the large amount of mining resources makes it perfect for a MASSIVE complex and a perfect spot to hook in a Player HQ for ship building.  The idea of removing all the pipes for complexes in this case is advisable.The Stock exchange is a GODSEND with it's quick money making potential.  My recommendation is to stick mostly with the corporation and business one and not the comodities for quicker returns.  Eve then keep to the smaller businesses as much as possible.  Plutarch, in my save, has gone from near worthless to pure gold in like a second making me 5 Mil profitsssss.  That said all the corporations have little movement up or down as the businesses are more changing.  After using it a little, and a little knowledge of economics, can have you at 100 Mil in around a real time day tops.  Just remember that at a selling viewpoint the higher the index the more likely there will be a looooooooooooooooooong wait for profitssss.			"

												It's one thing to have a hugely high learning curve.  That can actually be a positive thing; it generally means a complex and layered game, requiring thought and strategy.  But to marry this with some of the worse tutorials in gaming history, along with no documentation is mind boggling.  Fortunately, this game is popular and the fan base does provide much needed hints and guides, which without this game would be unplayable.But the issues with this game go much farther.  After over 200 hours into it I am forced to ask this terrible question: Is this game full of bugs or intention AI cheats?  Consider.....- My ships constantly ram asteroids and my stations.  NPC ships never do; not while trading or attacking.  Are they not using the same flight algorithms?- Docking at stations:  I have 5 trader ships, all set with orders to deliver required goods to my hab complex.  But they refuse to dock.  Some will enter the vacinity of the hab and then refuse to move while others will ram my station destroying themselves.  Meanwhile, despite my setting my hab to  refuse trade with other races, their ships come and go as they please.  Again, it seems like the game has different NPC and player ship docking scripts.- In combat.  I no longer carry missiles.  I was dying from missile attacks a lot.  Eventually I decided to watch one of my missiles in actions.  It was a silkworm and it ignored my targeted foe and came back and destroyed me.  In my experience, this misfire never happens to NPC ships.  Again, why the different behavior between player assets and computer.- The addon package gives players the opportunity to blacklist sectors and stations for trade.  Doesn't work.  My assets still preferentially travel into Omnicron Lyre, in the hope of a quick death at the hands Terran's continual raids there.  I have found nothing that stops this behavior other than not exploring those sectors.- SETA (Time Acceleration) is interrupted by almost every possible keyboard, mouse or game interruption.  It is frustrating and completely unnecessary.  But there is one thing that doesn't stop the game acceleration - notification that one of your ships is under attack.  This means that by time you stop the SETA, whatever asset was under attack is gone, with no hope of intervention from the player.  Why such an anti-playable implementation?-  Station placement.  After placing and connecting two stations together, I often find myself unable to connect a third station to hab complex, even though I place the new station exactly between the previous two.  This requires many, many save and reloads until the game randomly (as far as I can tell) lets me connect the new station to my hab complex.- The game promotes itself as having an in-game economy, but that is a lie.  All I have to do to massive increase an enemy's manufacturing ability is drop a bunch of Laser Towers in a sector they are attacking.  They immediately get a boost to production permitting them to quickly annihilate my defensive buildings.  Once my twenty  or so Laser Towers are destroyed, their raids return to fewer and smaller ships - meaning the best defense is absolutely no defense!- Enemy ships instantly build and travel.  I'm in Omnicrom Lyre and I've destroyed all enemy forces there.  All I have to do to replenish them is travel out of system and then immediately return: my foe will be back in full force, despite their shipyards being many sectors away.  For me to rebuild a fleet of that size, fit with weapons and shields, and then to fly to the sector of combat, would require at least an  hour, assuming I had the huge mountain of resources already available.- Mission difficult assignment.  This is the biggest joke of the game.  One mission will describe itself as being 'Hard' and send you to fight a couple scout class ships.  The next will be labeled 'Very Easy' and you'll find yourself  in a fight several  frigates and 6-8 escort fighter.Great ideas with this game.  Part of me still loves it despite its warts.  It is a thinking man's game, very complex and requires many, many hours to master.  It is an incredibly nice change of pace from all the button mashers that dominate the game market.  And maybe I am wrong and all my complaints are the result of buggy code and poor game design but the preferential treatment NPC assets get over players make this a hard to believe hypothesis.Still, if  you don't mind spending days on end figuring out how to meta-game around the bugs/cheats then this game is recommended.

												There are lots of good space sims out there, but not a single one I tried came close to this beauty. Spread over X³:Réunion, X³:Terran Conflict and X³:Albion Prelude, I spend 800+ hours, trying to build my own empire out of the stardust in the X-universe.I have to admit that I am in love with sandbox-sims where you can develop and build out of your hearts desire, games like EVE(except for the multiplayer part) or minecraft(just in space, with a living universe, and graphics!(*yay*).This game pretty much covers all the aspects I like about these games. I can spend hours managing my freight ships, supplying my stations, building a new complex. while at the same time flying my majestic capital ship into the heart of the Xenon Sector and launching my pretty missiles and cap-ship-guns at the robotic enemies, to get revenge for all my freighters they destroyed.Sometimes I even just take a little scout and admire the sectors, listen to one of the most fitting in.game music I know, and watch a capital ship coming out of the nebula trying to dock at the next station.The biggest flaw with this game though, is the time it takes to get into it. I think I had to play 40-60 hours before I understood the game somewhat, and during that time I was really confused by all the possibilities and things to do.So if you are the kind of person that is not afraid to spend some time to learn a game inside out, or even love trying to understand such a complex game, then give this one a shot, it is really worth it!And if you have no idea what to do, just fly around and admire the surrounding. There will be something coming into your mind, I promise! :)			"

												A decent time sink game slightly compareable to Mount & Blade. Depending on your chosen player start you have almost nothing and slowly build up to bigger ships, factory complexes and trade empires. Sadly there's really no real reason or end-game goal to the game, f.ex. like conquering Caldaria in Mount & Blade for yourself or another faction.The trade system is pretty bare bones (prices only change depending on whether a factory has more or less wares, their ""competitors"" don't affect them and companies can never go out of business), the stock exchange they added in Albion Prelude is outright broken (you can buy shares at their minimal price and they NEVER EVER go lower than a set value), and there's no real reason to wage war against factions, unless you're aiming for money early game through piracy or want to capture certain unique ships. Once you get one of the end-game destroyers the game quickly loses its charm as there's no real reason to use it on anything, other than to create random havoc.The war between Terrans and the other races they added in Albion Prelude is extremely lackluster as it never spills outside certain ""war sectors"". It's completely avoidable, it doesn't affect the market or race politics in any way and there's no way to ""win"" the war for either side save for a seperate long quest that isn't really about waging war. Even if you wipe the enemies from all war sectors they'll just spawn more units and factories out of thin air once you exit the sector and the same is true for other races as well. You can't really interact or change the game world in any meaningful way and the world itself is extremely static where nothing mentionable occurs unless the player takes a mission, which usually involves spawning a number of enemies out of thin air, depending on the player's fighting rank. Even in those the failure only affects your reputation and rewards, but doesn't f.ex. lead to full-scale invasion or the invaders setting up shop even if they hypothetically wiped out everything in the area. The other missions like taxi service, transport etc. also consist of hauling people and objects that appear out of thin air. There's no actual cause and effect which makes NPCs offer these missions and there's no competition to try fill their needs either. It's more of a randomized theme park for the player rather than an actual sandbox with a living world where everything doesn't simply revolve around you.tl;dr The ""from rags to riches"" portion of the game is enjoyable and offers hours of gameplay in form of exploration, battles, space piracy and empire management and you're given free reins on how to approach your goal to glory, but the actual ""sandbox"" part of the game is virtually nonexistant and you'll see the limits of the game the moment you actually get powerful enough to hypothetically ""influence"" anything in the universe.

												Good job Egosoft. I'm sorry about your X Rebirth but you managed to make another remarkable SF simulator, the X3 Albion Prelude!Do you wanna make your very own empire from scratch? Buy this game. From tiny, unremarkable spacecraft to the grand fleet awaiting your command!X3 AP gives you a truly awesome fleet battle experience too. This game features seemingly endless war between two major race, and you can participate into it. Pick a side if you could, join allied fleet, flow together, and take no prisoners.Now I said every pros, time to reveal dark side.You need to do everything by your hands. Are you going to assemble huge fleet? Good luck fitting every capital ships + more than 25 fighters to fill your carriers + many other escort ships. You need to wait 4 RL hours to get a capital class weapon called 'PPC', or 'Photon Pulse Cannon' from one PPC Forge. Although there's time accelerating function and a bug to duplicate specific weapon. Enjoy.Your often feel low due to few, repetitive, and bland in-game quests. If this gets serious, you'll think the entire game is pointless(the reason why I left X3 AP). And once you reach the level 'can do whatever I want', like all sandbox type game, you will ask yourself: 'what now?' after assembling grand fleet for the third time and having 20 billion credit on your account + 20 different station of your own. Grand space battle become boring because you can bring one missile boat and one transporter that carries additional missile to annihilate every object in a sector. Or, to not be so OP, you can bring six or more carriers(each carrying 60 fighters). But good luck restocking all lost fighters. Some fighters might rammed into something bigger than those because...In-game autopilot is auto-pillock. In other word, it sucks. So much unreliable and likely ram to something. But since all ships (except player controlled ship) are controlled by AI. Nobody is safe from this. Heh, my seat-on-a-rocket ship just gone balls deep in a random space station which is 5 000x times more tougher!Conclusion? I can't conclude. To be honest I won't strongly recommend to buy this, but overall it's a well-made SF game with some ♥♥♥♥ed up functions. So keep that in mind, purchase with caution.			"

												A massive & fufilling sandbox-4X Hybrid that can cater to just about any playstyle, whether that's fighting all by your lonesome, forming fleets for strategic combat or just trading & building. And that's before you take into account all the possibilities its extensive library of mods can add!That said, it's not exactly the most intuitive game to get into. As much as I like the series, I'll be the first to admit there's probably a reason this is a cult classic and not a mainstream success.			"

												Probably the best trading/economy/hauling sim I've played. Having a reactive supply/demand economy makes my actions mean something, rather than simply hauling X to Y for Z credits. There's also a stock market and the ability to directyl contribute to the economy with production as well as distribution.Parts of the game feel a bit dated and unpolished, if I'm being critical, but overall I think it stands the test of time and has a fair amount of charm. The atmosphere reminds me of classic Eve.If you like games like Elite, Eve, Freelancer - even ETS2 etc. - then there is a lot you'll like here.			"

It's a true timesink if you want it to be.The game will try to trip you up at EVERY corner, it is unforgiving and complicated - these are some of the games greatest strengths. Once you learn how to use it it is actually very straightforward, and very rewarding.Once you have a fledgling economic empire to take care of, and a fleet of ships jumping around doing your bidding - you will find one of the best emergent gameplay experiences in gaming history.The games strengh is in it's sandbox play - don't expect much in the way of plots or story.

If you want you can get the bundle and get both X3 Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude both are very fun.X3 reminds me of a EvE Online single player version, you can trade, build, fight, and much much more.Like i said, there is a bit of a learning curve but there are youtube guides that walk you through some of the professions and you quickly get the hang of the game, you can look up CdrDave (X3TC Walkthrough), the walkthrough will work with both Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude since they are basically the same game.I give this game a 10/10 and there are hundreds and hundreds of hours to sink into this game.

You can customise your ships, get a fleet, control a bunch of ships with ai, maybe a few gathers minerals while you clear a sector from the bad guys, yeah its the summum of its type to me, if only it had multiplayer or even more random generated content to keep us going! The game can be mooded for additional dept i believe. The spacial combat is one of the best and there are a variety of approach and different ships/weapons/missiles to keep things interesting. The story will not win any award, but the game.. definitely worth it.			"

												I bought X3: Terran conflict, X3: Reunion, and X3:Albion Prelude as part of a package deal on special.  I would have been better off buying Albion Prelude as it was the most recent with more stuff and there was not a significant enough difference between the three to justify playing the other two (although I started with Terran Conflict).This game has a very steep learning curve, but looks to be pretty solid.  Unfortunately I don't have the patience, or the time.  Still if you like the explore/build/trade type of games it is engaging.  Worth getting if you have the time.			"

												Please dont let all the bad reviews put you off this game. those that say they dont know what they are doing in this game have clearly never played any game in the X series and shouldnt have as they cant grasp the concept of a space opera sandbox. if you have TC you find this one as ""polite"" since AP revolves inside of an active war combat between the Argon and Terran military is constant and wil happen pretty much anywayhere which has its pros and cons. as i said before its a space opera sanbox, you do what you want. take the game start that best suits what you want to play as at the time. be pirate if you fancy rading and stealing be the merchant if you want a more passive start and free cargo vessel. pic either the argon or the terran military if you want to go down the militaristic route. but all of them given enough time can do everything. those bad reviews that say all you do is fly are wrong those reviews that say the game takes too long dont understand taht space is pretty big place and this isnt star trek or starwars warping place to place isnt something you get until the mid game if you could call it mid game. as for the one shotting.... gtfo of that silly scout and into something more robust then you have to earn your way up through missions or trading to earn the right to by the more combat orientated ships. if you want play a game where you start with a silver spoon this isnt for you unless you want to figure out the very simple script editor and use a money cheat for a leg up. though ill warn you. if you cheat your way through and X game, you will find yourself very bored with no sense of accomplishment.

												This is X3 on crack, you can use the stock market to fuel your war campains and have a massive armada. The scope of this game however is so huge I've spent over 1000 hours on it since I started playing and I still have not unlocked all the achievements. This is a game that you'll have to work on over a VERY long period of time. The great part about the long time though is you will have so many factories, ships, and even taken over so many systems you have to build a fleet and send them to xenon areas just to spend some of the rediculous piles of money you have. I spend more time getting the weapons for the ships than worrying about money to buy everything. All in all it is pretty fun.- Over 1000 hours and this game is still a blast.			"

												If you can get past the somewhat steep learing curve, this game is awasome. WHen I picked it up I was hoping for a more realistic universe (something like the good old Elite series). This game doesn't have that, but it has a lot of other things going for it. Great trading simulation, decent combat with multiple ships involved, a lot of ways to customize ships and fleets. I must admit I've spent most of my time doing trading and satation buidling and less in combat, but I think combat is still good if you chose to go down that path.The game is pretty much a sandbox that let's you do whatever you want. If you've played terran conflict, you'll like the improvements in this game, including the stockmarket. If not, you can either start with this game right away or play X3TC for some time to see if you like it.Overall a great game! "

												This is by far the best game in the x series. It has all of the game play mechanics from X3: Terran Conflict but is more up-to-date and complete. The modding community is still active and is quite large. My playtime is short because steam glitched and wasn't recording my playtime for a long time, i have over 100 hours into this game and i still find new and exciting things in it.The learning curve is not a curve, it is a cliff. Once scaled, the game becomes amazing. The Terran economy is a little broken, but there are like 500 mods that fix that.I would recommend that you buy the x superbox, as it comes with all the x games except for x rebirth (but we don't talk about that game), concept art, music, fan stories, the modding materials and so much more.

												Best space sim ever periodIts a free-roam sandbox/ universe simulation/ adaptive trade economy game on some pretty epic scales. You start out with 1 ship and grow your empire to as large as you like. What I enjoy is that you pilot the ship in a FULL 3D space setting like a simulation but you can also control your fleet(s) though commands. While its not an RTS in a traditional sense it kinda is when doing large sacle battles.Ships can be upgraded with software that lets them do more things: such as explorer class software installments can give additional commands to that ship for scouting. In combat various upgrades can be destroyed. Weapons, shield generators... all those things can be destroyed. So the idea is to make your trade empire to A) bring in profits and B) help to provide/ manufacture the types of soft/hardware you need.All ship classes fly different and FEEL different too. That fighter ship will handle much different then that missle boat... in and out of combat senarios. Work to get that capitol ship you always wanted. Fly it yourself as you lead into an assult against a large pirate network in rouge space... then launch your heavily armored assult wing and teleport to fly the helm of that ship. Combat can be automated but you will want to take the controls manually. Its so satisfying to actually learn to fly your favorite space ship WELL5/5 ...this is a game that has a main quest but its kinda blah. Really its a game you can do ANYTHING the engine allows and make your own goals. Its a slow game though so if you get sucked in expect to sink a LOT of time into this new universe.			"

												As of writing this review, i've only played two hours. All I can say is two hours is enough time to fall in love with this game.X3: Albion Prelude is an open world space sim, where you can choose to either fight for one of the factions, or to trade on your own. Now, something I want to point out is that while the base game is already loads of fun, the fun is multiplied by 100 when you download mods. Into Star Wars? Check out the Star Wars Reborn mod. Just go on youtube and search ""X3AP Star Wars""I would like to point out something, which is that if you wait you can get X3AP and X3: Terran Conflict all in one for a couple of dollars on sale. Go out there and blast some Terran scum.			"

												Best Holocaust Simulator 2012.My experience in Albion Prelude was like that of a fine golf country club. It is a pretty experience, with plenty of visual flair and no ethnicity in sight, just the way I like it. Aryan and clean. It had a complex social structure on the surface, but if you dig hard enough you'll realize that it's an incredibly racist, therefore fun, experience.Those Boron fish people suck. They're filthy swine that take up space (heh) and need to be exterminated. I played AP as a captain of the Cleansing Fleet. Me and my crew of intergalactic racists would fly around and kill any Boron on sight. Police want to interfere? Thanks for the XP.100 / 100 dead borons			"

												A great game for strategy and tactics. It is probably, I say probably because obviously I have not played all games that claim strategy and tactics are required. However, I doubt very seriously that there is any game out there in which strategy and tactics in aa real sense are closer to what strategy and tactics really are. I have played this game nearly a thousand hours. Looking back over those hours, I see where I used the wrong strategy and tactics to advance my conquest of the X3 AP universe. The technology tree, economics and battle aspects of the game all require some thinking. It is a vastly superior game to others of its kind that I have ever played. It actually imparts some lessons one can take into the real world. I can't recommend this game higher. Egosoft is thanked immesurably for this game.			"

												Generally enjoyable space sandbox game. It has a very steep learning curve due to it's complexity and number of variables for everything you do. The game becomes most fun early-mid game once you have a few ships and are prospering financially, mining, trading etc. But it is only when you delve deeper into the the games more intricate mechanics that you see how broken it is. It get's to a point where you have so much going on that you MUST automate most of your fleet and base production facilities (this is where the game breaks) The sets of options becomes so contrived and buggy that you must download a bunch of 3rd-party files to fix the games more intricate (but neccessary) mechanics. When you bore from trying to fix the games mechanics through hours of googling and downloading misc files and want to try out combat, you might be as disappointed as I was, as ship combat is as every bit contrived as the trading and base-building, to a point where it becomes not fun at all. If the combat was similar to Freelancer, that could have fully redeemed the games fun-factor. I would say it's worth buying, purely just for the fun and exploration on offer early game. If you like micro-management, resource gathering and trading in a huge space sanbox then this game is for you. 68/100.			"

												Well, ladies and gentlemen, I've given it my darndest. I played the game long enough to have three stations and a chip/computer complex. It took me 30 hours, and I still feel like I haven't even started.This game is long. Like, get up and leave for half the day while the game is running and you will be a little bit closer to your goal long. I'm not joking. In fact, about half or more of my hours in the game I was gone. If you're focusing on building a trade empire, the best thing to do is hit the fast-forward button and run the game in the background for a few hours while you do something else. It's the only way to build up cash without any player input.I'm not really not sure whether to give this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down. On one hand, I would not have gotten to this point without the ability to minimize the game and go do other things. On the other hand, I have enough infrastructure now to have my trade empire really start to take off. I could eventually build a massive fleet and do whatever I please.Whatever Egosoft has done here, I think they have have succeeded. For that reason, I give the game a thumbs up.			"

The game was running basically nonstop for several months (my factories were producing even while I was sleeping). Eventually, I had to physically destroy the DVD disk to get my life back.Since then I tried to stay away from the X series as long as possible. I even switched to a Linux to avoid the temptation. But guess what, they found me even here.There's no escape from the Universe. I'm falling into the black hole again.

Well almost anyway.The game has over 300 ships, multiple systems for the player to explore and several races, 3 of which seem to be named after elements (Argon, Boron, Xenon).The game allows players to built an empire, kill pirates, or just downright join them, or even conquer the entire universe, with the possibibity of owning your very own Headquarters allowing you to be buy, or capture ships to later reverse engineer to gain the ability to build them yourself.

Whle the campaigns can be completed in a few dozen hours, there are hundreds of hours of goals you can work towards. The learning curve is absurd, but you gain control over autonomous programmable ships (trading, military), manually controlled ships, carriers, capital ships, all customized. Buy your own factories and chain them together to build supply lines. Set up automated trade routes, scouts, and observation posts. Disable and steal enemy ships. Government systems operate giant fleets which they build and navigate and fight in real time. This leads to unscripted developments.

												ALWAYS ON GRINDAlways on grind. Both the plot quests and randomly generated missions require you to do one thing, grind for money until you can afford to purchase whatever it is to complete the mission - at which point the mission is easy. Missions are either easy because you have the money, impossible because you don't, or impossible because of time limits and you don't happen to have a jump drive or appropriate wares installed at the time.Flight controls are good and customizable, and the backgrounds are pretty.The economy, trading, and station building are all about having enough money - and you either spend time with tedious micromanagement or let it run on some form of laconic automatic.The map interface is clunky and painful. Why is it always so difficult to find certain available goods? The encyclopedia tool helps, but ultimately falls short of explaining why all the stations and factories which supposedly are trying to sell their wares fail to broadcast their location or advertise pricing.Combat in the smaller M5, M4, and M3 ships is fun, but larger ships are often impossible to get through their shields. Using a larger ship yourself makes combat a non-event after you equip turrets with phased repeater guns for missile defence; hoever, the larger ships are painfully slow.Modding helps aleviate some of the above problems but fails to correct some of the fundamental flaws in this game.Bottomline: The game has SETA to accelerate time in the game - because you are so often just waiting to get from point A to B. However, even at 10x speed, waiting isn't fun.			"

												It makes me sad to not recommend this game because it has so much potential. My main reason for not recommending it is that the autopilot is completely broken to the point where it is mostly worthless.Autopilot cannot safely fly ""fast"" ships: it will crash them into star gates, other ships, and asteroids. Autopilot also cannot be used to gather the many pieces of the asteroid you are mining in a slow freighter as it will crash into asteroids, obliterating your ship. Unless you have the famous 3rd party ""Bounce"" mod installed (which marks your game as ""modified""), your wingmen will collide into each other and explode. It's just ridiculous.It is shocking to me that Egosoft has not only left the problem unfixed, but haven't even given the players the ability to mitigate this game-ruining defect. For instance, one user asked in forums if we could be given an option to simply turn off collision damage for our ship and Egosoft responded: ""No, I'm afraid not."" It is not fun for me to manually pilot my ship through space or asteroid fields. It is also not fun to slowly float around, picking up the many chunks of the asteroid I have just exploded with my mining laser. Thus, I sadly cannot recommend this game.			"

												Has an awful lot going for it but servere glaring flaws as well, mainly related to there being zero effort on the part of the devs to ensure that various content is actually possible to achieve. Time limits that can't possibly be beaten with any ship that has the cargo space to handle the mission (and no indication ahead of time that your ship isn't fast enough), incredibly powerful enemies randomly spawning in the sectro the storyline mission starts in, even the tutorial mission may not work depending on the start you choose (including one start where you're given a combat vessel with no cargo space, no weapons, and not enough money to buy any weapons). It doesn't even give me the sense that I wasted the money, but that I wasted the time I put into playing it instead of something else.All of these problems are incredibly frustrating because underneath that is what looks like an amazing economic  system, good fleet management, and fun though not ideal combat. But you'll have to deal with constant RNG related frustration in order to get to any of that.			"

												There's a lot to love in the X universe, and I've dabbled with it since the first installment. The narrative is deep, has tons to discover and is stunning for a game of its age. Really, the game is bursting with promise - things to do, histories to uncover. Old hands will tell you it has a steep learning curve and this is true, but the curve is not around learning how to be good at the game, the curve is about learning how to *work around* the game.First of all, for the starting player the game works hard to stop you from succeeding. Missions, traditionally the reserve of the new player in 4X games seeking to earn a few quid here and there, are almost universally impossible for a new player to complete. The game offers loads to you, but they are either too time limited to be possible in any beginner's ship, require more cargo storage than you can offer, or put you up against enemies leagues ahead in technology. The game makes no effort to help you figure out which missions are even possible for you and your capabilities. The old hands know this and only take combat missions with their super combat craft, but there is no possible way to know this for a new player.So maybe you check out trading - a tedious but reliable way to make a living in 4X. Again the game stands in your way. For some bizarre reason, frequently you will find that the suppliers of goods have almost double the price that the customers will ever pay. The in-game economy is serving those demands through their own AI ships, etc, but there is very little room for the new player to make a slight profit without a lot of trial and error. Sometimes the prices jump without warning, leaving you stranded with a hold full of goods that you have no idea where you can sell. The vast variety of goods adds richness but it takes a lot of work to figure out where to sell.You resort to online guides and figure out that the best way to make money is the stock exchange. This is absolutely true but in practice involves staring at a random number generator until it flips your way. The (corporate) stock exchange gives the illusion of realism but in practice is just nonsense.After 17 hours of variously failing impossible missions, selling Argnu Beef at a loss, failing to find anywhere to sell Space Weed and finally making millions by staring at a number changing from 100 to 95, I realised the game is a false economy - the fun bits require just too much *actual work* to be of any value.That said, you might enjoy it, and this relatively old game is certainly good value (I definitely got a few pence per hour out of it) but you have to be ready to spend most of a day of your life fighting the game, to try and get a glimpse of the heart.

												This is one of the greatest game franchises ever made, i highly reccomend getting this game and all the games that came before it.The X series have been arround since '99 and like most to all '99 PC classics it did what it wanted and more.The X games aren't just your average shooters, they require alot of thinking and skill to play right, and of course the ability to use the internet.Although this is not for those kids who like instant glory, no you have to work for that fame and fortune.You can be basically anything you want... within reason of course, you can be good or bad, a law enforcer, or a lawless pirate, a honest trader or a scumbag smuggler, someone who kills hostile factions like Pirates and Xenon or someone who kills everyone but their own ships and stations just to name a few or maybie a combination of two or all of the above, the choice is yours.But remember this, save often and buy salvage insurance when you can because this game will punish you especially if you're new.You can fly basically every ship in the game (with a few exeptions), from scouts to loads of different types of fighters, to bombers, corvettes, frigates even destroyers and carriers.This game is very moddable but be warned: if you mod the game you can't get achievements, but the mods are great, from new ships, scripts and general fixes, to complete rebalancing the game and even total conversions.In general i reccomend getting this X game or Terran Conflict because they have the most content in them.You have to have a baught Steam version of X3: Terran Conflict to buy it but strangely you don't need it isntalled, for those new people i have a starters guide.

												note: i played about 40 hours of Albion Prelude before trying the Terran Conflict version, when i realised this is just the same type of game, Albion Prelude is just some sort of DLC ! so this review counts for BOTH or better ALL ot the X-games.i got 3 words for this type of games: boredom in spaceWhat comes next is only MY PERSONAL OPINION about this game, and you might want to agree or disagree with me, that's fine, but leave your comments for yourself please if you want to rant against MY OPINION, ok? Thanks in advance.There are some pro's in this game, i have to admit, but there are just too many cons that made me stop 'playing' this 'game' :1. everything takes way too much time, you can't accomplish anything in under 100 hours of gameplay; that is 2 or more whole WEEKS of worktime in your job! so i assume that most people who play this game are either a) unemployed or b) have no real life (no offense) or c) are retired and have alot of time on their hands2. Interface is really bad, overly complicated and takes many hours to get used to; it feels like i am back to college trying to get a degree in spacetrading/spacenavigation... that is in my opinion not fun, but WORK, and i am here to have FUN, not work, because it's supposed to be a GAME, right?3. for a spacesim, it's more then unrealistic: you jump lightyears over lightyears in a matter of seconds, but the space you work in ones you arrive is about 120km in diameter only! makes no sense to me, sorry... i don't even want to talk about how long it takes to get from one gate to the next one, even with 6x timespeeds (called SETA here). oh and then you have to 'explore' those sectors first? haha... that would be ok if it's space that belongs to another race, but the terrans and argons should know from the start where their planets are right? i get it, all those things are there so it can keep you busy, 'exploring' """"""new"""""" planets... problem is, they are already there when you started the game, so it's only new to YOU, right? kills any immersion for me to be honest.4. Jumpdrives need energycells so you can use them... are we in the 21st century? never heared of any spacegame or sci-fi series before that you need a f... battery to use a jumpdrive device of some sort that brings you halfway across the universe... it this a TESLA Demeter or what? Don't tell me this game wants to be environment-friendly! LOL5. Boredom in space for me is this: for about 3 minutes of action you need hours of preparation sometimes, and the rewards you get are often far worse then the cost. It may be me, but that's just not fun, is it? It's like going 1 step forward and 2 steps back...Ok there are mods out there that can solve many of those problems, BUT i just don't have the patience any more to deal with installing those mods and hope they work properly so you can finally, hopefully enjoy a game and hope that it doesn't crash BECAUSE of those mods! There is even a mod that removes the jumpdrives out of the fighters completely, so you can not use them anymore with them! REALLY?This game has a huge fanbase (again i think it shows the actual unemployment rate we have in the country - j/k hehe), so there are a LOT of mods out there, but so many, it's a) hard to find the latest version that works with your game and/or other modsb) the links to them don't work any more because they are too old and the files got removedc) the time you need to read through all these forum posts to find the things you are looking for.... you get the ideaThere are so many more issues with this game that i could go on and on, but i don't want to waste any more of my time for that, so for players who consider buying this game, be warned: before you start to play this game do these things first:a) quit your jobb) end any existing relationships (if you had some before)c) get yourself a supply of food and water for several months so you don't have to leave your home EVERd) get yourself a supply of antidepressiva or other drugs that can keep you happy while reading all the information you can/must get about this game, because you will NEED to read alot before you start to understand what this game is all about (alcohol works too)e) be prepared to take a test after you read through all the material about this game (test will be playing the game itself)f) hide all items you could use to commit suizide ones you realise how much time you wasted for nothingg) find the uninstall buttonGood thing i bought this whole X-game stuff on sale for like 14 bucks, so it's not too big of a loss to me financially... i just want my wasted time back please ;-)			"

												I'm so tired of being punched in the balls by this game. I can't use Universe Traders because they go to sectors I have specifically blacklisted and get destroyed. I can't use Sector Traders because they try to dock at pirate bases that I have globally marked as enemies and get destroyed. I can't use CAGs because they sit in my complexes and do nothing unless I manually tell them to do something.I have read guide after guide. I've read the forums.

												I love X universe games, but I have to say if you have Terran Conflict with mods, then don't buy this, you'll be extremely disappointed, it does not incorporate any TC missions, the game starts all focus around a war of 3-4 contested sectors near the Terran/Argon border and Rapid response fleets just constantly attack and counter attack. Trading as a terran start is practically impossible, due to the lack of gates in Terran home sectors, the size of the sectors and the war that locks you in a bottleneck, even if you escape said bottleneck Argon rapid response fleets generally jump you where ever you go.Argon start has one campaign to play thought starting in the same sector the Khaak missions started on Terran Conflict. To cut it short. The game is too short, it's like Terran Conflict with a few new ships and a few community mods and no missions, if you expect more than this then DO NOT BUY.			"

												Fight hostile aliens!  Build a commercial empire!  Create a mighty space fleet!Maybe that's what you've heard or what you may think about the X3 games.It's not what you're going to get.What you ARE going to get is an endless grind of repetitive missions in an attempt to build up a little bit of cash.  You'll fly your starting ship around for hours, looking for stuff to buy low and sell high, watching your meagre supply of credits creep upwards.  And heaven forbid if you get in to a fight (assuming you actually FIND something to fight) -- if your ship takes damage, simple repairs cost you far more than what you may have gleaned from the combat.  Installations will offer you missions you cannot take because you don't have enough cargo space, or money, or a decent enough ship, or whatever.  And the only way you can get the credits you need to, say, buy a ship worth conducting trading in is to grind for days.Or you can play the missions which, since the very first X game, are typically terrible, terribly voice acted, terribly balanced, buggy, and don't tell you stuff like ""well, you may need a few ships or a FLEET to complete this"".One of the loading screen quotes in X3 is ""Time is the fire in which we burn"".  And X3 is the grind in which we burn time.  Recommended only to folks with absolutely nothing else to do in their lives.			"

												There are parts of this game that are absolutely awesome: it's got a dynamic economy, huge space to explore, varied ships and a great ability to influence events. However, it's flawed in one crucial aspect: it just feels empty, there's no personality to any of the simulated sentient beings in this universe - there's little 'human' touch or sense of political intrigue to color the commercial and military activities you take on.The above, coupled with the fact that you really need a *lot* of time to get something going without cheats and that it's got a fairly steep learning curve means you should play ths only if you have a lot of time to spare and a lot of patience. Even then, the time and patience may be best rewarded by other titles, like Dwarf Fortress.			"

												I love this game series... it has everything I want in a game...Except for functional AI.The game is supposed to allow you to form fleets and use those fleets to go into battle.  Awesome right?Nope.  It's not awesome, it sucks.Why does it suck?Because the AI of your wingmen/fleet ships sucks.  They circle around you constantly rather than following in a rigid formation.  This causes them to do all sorts of really stupid stuff like crash into you or crash into anything around you or just generally crash.  And when they crash into you, you die and they die, or something dies.So, you can't use wingmen effectively - which defeats like 50% of the purpose of the game.Anyway, you can't just make something like this so lazily - but the company did make something like this so lazily.  One of the most important features in the game is absolutely broken and they never bothered to fix it.  Honestly, I could crap better pathing algorithms than this game has and I'm not even a professional programmer.  At least I know I wouldn't ship a game with pathing problems like that.  Why is it so hard to get the ships to track rigid formation targets instead of swarm around your ship like flies?  Well... it's not.Want cool big ships?  Totally awesome right?  Well, forget about flying with wingmen because they'll crash into you left and right unless you are ordering them around through half a million menus.  Sure, you'd think there'd be a key for ""order wing to attack X target"" - there is, it works sometimes.  But, sadly, you can't have that wing flying with you because they'll crash into you left and right.  Which means the only TWO KEYS that you have to control any fleet in the same system as you are off limits unless you're flying... and it must be precisely this: an M6 or M7 with no more than ten M4/5s.  Forget trying to have a fleet if you want to fly a capital ship.  Of course capital ships are useless without a fleet....  But, alas, they hired halfwitted monkeys to code the GUI.Like playing with a mouse?  Find Joysticks too large and cumbersome?  Well, you can't use autoaim then, AT ALL...  That means on your giant ship where the turrets are positioned like a kilometer apart, your shots are going to be aimed at that enemy ship a KILOMETER APART because your turrets are just going to shoot straight instead of interpolating what enemy you're attacking and forcing both wing's turrets to collide at that point in three space.Why can't you use autoaim with the mouse but you can with a joystick?  I have no clue whatsoever, but I imagine it's just to show you how much you were shafted by a company that apparently spent its entire budget on skybox reflection shaders.Maybe it's because the maths for screen to point were too hard for the halfwitted monkey GUI programmers.One of the cool things about this game is you get to build factories.  Sounds fun right?  You get to position them in space and build giant complexes out of them!  Well, thankfully they've made it easy by allowing you to visually see the factory in 3 space before you place it - you can even rotate it around with the number pad and position it and the like.  This would be great if it weren't for the fact that they force you to have a semi-transparent (emphasis on the ""semi"" more than the transparent) map covering the ENTIRE SCREEN while you place the factory.  It's ok though, you can just press ""ALT-H"" to hide the hud like in regular mode?  Oh?  It doesn't work?  Well, why should a simple toggle exist to temporarily hide the GUI overlay?  Sure it would come in handy while placing a factory, I mean they did bother to give you a representation of the factory in 3 space before you place it - but why should we let 5th grade programming prevail when we can half halfwitted monkey programming?But in all seriousness - this is the kind of game I want to play - but there are so many things that make it so inordinantly and unintuitive to play that I have to give it a thumbs down.   They want you to play it like a text game with a graphical componant rather than a graphical game with a textual RTS component.   I'm cool with micromanaging fleets and factories and spending three hours in space just setting up trade routes and supply lines - but damnit I want there to be a purpose to it!  When I want to go dogfight I don't want stupid half-♥♥♥♥♥ GUI programming to get in the way and that's what you end up fighting against in X3: the GUI.  The enemies in X3 aren't the enemies you're fighting when you want a little space combat, it's the programmers who seem to lack absolutely any intuition whatsoever when it comes to a user interface/real time combat mechanics.

												I really tried to like this game, but it just fails is too many ways.Pro:-You can have as many ships as you want. Even get stations and control sectors. Sadly, this is really the only Pro.Con:-Travels is so slow, you spend way too much time getting somewhere, it makes the game about 1% action & 99% waiting.-Learning curve sucks, not as much as many claim. For me it was not knowing all the different buttons and commands and having to spend the first 10 hours playing constantly looking up how to do stuff.-Can only save at stations. This sucks as it will send you on a mission far away, so you spend 30 minutes getting there, and you die and have to do the 30 minute flight again. Or dock at a closer station to target and save, but then you are adding a few extra minute just to save the game.-Auto Pilot sucks!-Combat is fairly lame, it is not as fun as many space games, however I never built up a fleet to check out larger scale combat, as the game was just too boring.-Missions often point you in the wrong direction, as they point to the end and not where you need to get what you need.-Cant find stuff. The game asks you to deliver something, yet it wont tell you where to get it. In one case I searched 7 systems for the item, and finally gave up.-Missions often have stupidly short timers on it. It will give you 11 minutes to get something that you have no idea where to get and dont have time to fly around to find. In short, if you dont have it on you: Mission Failed-The tutorial only covers basic flight and leaves you with little to start with.Stear clear of this game. If you really want to try it, wait till it is like $5. "

												I don't know what it is but I couldn't get into any of the ""X"" games. I don't mind slow games, or hyper-realistic games. But the game interface is just too difficult, and the payout is not high enough. I can see how some people might like it, but I have to imagine that if they spent some time on the interface and general gameplay this series could be so much better.			"

												This game can be fun, however more likly once you get past fighter ship dogfights it'll get much worse...Combat:The game is missile happy and missiles are lethal, you can be in your fighter and watch as an enemy spams swarm missiles at you and your only action is to accept death. if you do it not only does the game get boring but you need mass logistics just to manage the cost of all your missiles.Logistics:NPC stations take far too long to create goods unless you bring them supplies yourself, its a good way to earn money but very time consuming... You can have your other ships do it but prepare to have 50 guards escorting them or they'll die as raiders and other hostiles are *frequent.*Hostiles tend to have a heavily reduced spawn in the sector you are in unless triggered through a quest / missionRed Sectors:NEVER EVER EVER tell your ships (unless its the one you're flying) to enter a red sector... the game will spawn ships for the sole purpose of killing it, I've tested this on countless occasions and its 100% spawn rate, and its always a ship ether able to 1 shot it, or a fleet of ships able to kill it in less then 5 seconds...*Ways you can get through red space with other ships:YOU MUST escort them!!!Going from gray sector to red you'll enter first then have them follow you.When you get to the next gate, have them fly through first but be ready to enter the gate within 10 seconds of them entering or it'll spawn a enemy patroll / capital ship on the other side.When exiting red space (red to gray) ensure the other ship exits first, then you can follow.**It doesnt matter if both sides are neutral to you, if one isnt an ALLY they WILL send ships to kill your NPC ships!!!!!!Your NPC ships have the mentality of a civilian ship and will just idol as they get murdered... keep this in mind and always fight enemies 3v1 in your odds, be ready to lose ships by the fleets as if the enemy ship is larger it will kill everything with 1 missile... Excluding you whom it wont be able to hit at all unless you're sitting still AFKTerran is the easiest race to play for starters as they only have to worry about 2 things:Argon in red sectors (or past them any other aliens whom they dont build faction with)Pirates whom are easy to deal with as most of the time they'll ignore you or you can find and kill their base as they dont randomly spawn like Argon do.Argons have the constant threat of Xenon warping through any gate at any time and killing everything on your transport ship that took you hours to collect... Every other race has it as hard / harder...Overall I'd say this game needs a massive reduction in missile spam (missile ships / bombers are allright but when you see over 200 missiles in a cyclone flying at you each one does 10% damage you're just wondering WTF...)Random spawns of enemies whos only job is to kill your ships is total crap, especially if you have no enemies... i flew to earth as a Argon without anything attacking me but soon as I tell my trade ship to fly though no more then 15 seconds there's terran M2 behind it closing in and 1 shots it with a missile... then leaves as if it was normal for that ♥♥♥♥ to happenUntil then I cant recommend this game for normal people, tho I do recommend it for people who understand the game's script codes (I use a money cheat to replace all my lost goods from random Xenon raids in sectors over 10 jumps away from any Xenon space), or people that just like being beat up, knocked down, and beat up some more...

												(Note: this is a joint review of both the Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude variants of X3; thus, I'll post the same text to both.)I **really** wanted to like this game. I *really* did. Let me explain why.I'm a veteran video game space cadet. I played the original Elite and Wing Commander on Commodore 64, and lots like them, since. I've played EVE Online off-and-on since Trinity (~ 2007). I ***LOVE, LOVE, LOVE*** spaceflight games that are ""sandbox-y"" for almost as long as I've been playing video games, and that's been too long a period of time (I'm now 41).The Egosoft team was obviously ambitious. And, in some core ways, they succeeded. But the whole thing ultimately feels rushed.In the end... At minimum, there are five things keep me from recommending this game.(01) - There's no clearly-evident, gradual-slope difficulty ramp, and what you see is not always what you get. One minute, you're doing something that you percieve is very easy, is in fact very easy, and you are succeeding quite well... And the next minute, you're doing something that you percieve to be (very) easy, is in fact very difficult, and ends up being effectively suicidal as a consequence. One ends up having to revert to game saves frequently before gaining a good feel for that the *real* difficulty of various things are, as trial-and-error appears to be the only logical path towards mapping out a successful long-term course of action for oneself.(02) - The accelerated time mechanism... Isn't accellerated enough. 600% of real-time is the max; in fact, it should be variable, with max *at least* %1,000, given the distance between various objects of interest, and the max velocities of the majority of craft in the game (esp. in the early game). Expect to spend LOTS of time simply staring at your screen whilst you travel from place to place. For me... It got *really* old after a while. Asteroid mining in EVE Online came to mind - a great ""second screen"" experience whilst your primary focus is on something else (work-related?)... But boring-as-hell if you have nothing else to do at that time. Or, at least, it *would* be a great second-screen experience, if the next line-item wasn't true.(03) - The auto-pilot is borderline suicidal. It's certainly borderline schitzophrenic. At minimum, it's not consistently reliable for what one would expect to rely upon an autopilot for: performing the mundane, common tasks associated with piloting a craft, without harming the vehicle or its contents. Simply put... It's difficult, if not impossible, to ""trust"" the autopilot within confined, or crowded, space... Which means its use is circumstantial... Which erodes the value of such. (IMO, anyway.) It results in lots of time ""babysitting"" the craft when (IMO) one shouldn't have to. If this one thing were fixed... I would borderline-recommend this game for use as at least a ""second screen"" experience (as described above). But, as it presently stands, I would distrated too often by my ""babysitting duties"". :-((04) - The tutorial sub-system is *far* from complete. I appreciate the fact that Egosoft respects their customer base enough to deliberately avoid ""hand-holding them"" through everything... And I actually *like* the idea, in concept, of forcing the player to learn the majority of the game through actual experience. But there are better ways to do the latter - EVE Online provides some excellent examples. For a game this complex... Just teaching them how to move around, and them leaving them to their own devices, with one having to traverse the majority of their local solar system in order to learn enough subsequent basics to gain an idea as to what their options are (much less decide upon a course of action in the direction they wish) is a bit ridiculous, IMO. It's as if the game's creators expected anyone buying the game to have prior experience with a variety of similar-genre games in the past, such that they would ""just know"" what their options are, thus lessening the tutorial/ training burden. It's pretty lame, in this respect.(05) There's no context-sensitive help to speak of (that I could see), beyond short descriptions of various items/ entities. I could forgive (04) if there was strong (05) present... But there isn't. I shouldn't feel obligated to alt-tab to/from my web browser to search the web for basic how-tos, as I play along, to make up for the lack of available in-game documentation.In short... This game feels like it was the work of a small, highly-ambitious, highly-skilled development team... Who hit a budgetary/ deadline wall before this could be fully baked... And, like many rushed programming projects... The documentation is the first to be sacrificed at the altar of timelines and budget constraints.Again... I would *really* like to recommend this game... But, as I've played it over the last few days... I just can't. And that makes me sad. :-(			"

												This game is hightly confusing and takes forever to complete missons. This is because you find most of your hours traveling sector to sector and has a very steep learning curve. This is one of the hardest game I have ever played, many times, a mission that you are on will become impossible beause an enemy will kill you without you even having a chance to run. One more thing, most will find the game extremely boring because the missions you do to get credits become extremely repetitive, unless you leave AI to trading between your stations and others, which will just make the gameplay very dull.

												seems like a great game but it does not teach you how to play properly. for instance im trying to learn to shoot a simple crate but it doesnt start you with a laser or tell you how to get one but you have to shoot the crate to move to the next lesson. just like giving you all the parts to build a car and telling you to build it but not telling you how. so freakin stupid and a waste of money unless you have days to just watch utube videos and find someone willing to talk to you and explane how to do things.

												For a gamer new to the X3 genre, they coulnd not make it more difficult to get started.  While there is suppose to be a tutorial in the flight school section, there is little direction and it doesnt tell you where to activate it to even get started.  Nothing is intuitive.  There is no in-game help nor key stroke guide. There are so many controls and menus, that just picking up and getting started is more than a challenging task.   Also, trying to figure out where or how to dock with no direction is a difficlut task in itself.  Try the auto-dock funtion and your ship just flys atround, shfting directions, and never docs.  The auot-pilot funtions is obviouly broken.  After having spent over two hourst trying to figure out how to dock or even activate the tutorail, finally just gave up.  This is not a friendly game to new players to the genre.The game has a Window option, but it is pretty pointless as you are unable to have the 118 page manual open in one sreen and the game in another.  The game just does not allow you to switch to a different window.			"

												Has a lot of promise, but doesn't deliver. 1. Autopilot regularly crashes you and others2. The war that is supposed to be central to the plot is boring and contrived. 3. Stations never have the weapons you need.4. Everything is super slow even with SETA.This entire game feels like a grind, sort of like a singleplayer version of E.V.E Online.All the grind, and none of the human interaction.Edit: I have been told I was a little harsh on this game. I will give a few caveats:1. If you really enjoyed E.V.E online you might enjoy this.2. I played this game on a laptop, computer performance does have a large impact of the autopilot. A combination of a mid range computer and high SETA levels increases the risk of error (and thus crashes)I still would not recommend it. If you want micro management FUN!, play dwarf fortress :D			"

												Unlike my X2: The Threat review, this one shall be a not recommended, ive spent 2 hours on this and i instantly wish i had spent my money on having my head banged on a wall because id have enjoyed it more.Its controls are utter and complete ♥♥♥♥♥, if you try using a gamepad it can occasionally cut out at random and you will need to compensate with the keyboard, keyboard and mouse controls are god awful, the mouse in particular is sluggish as all hell (i have my sensitivity maxed, if it wasnt id imagine it would be like trying to wade through semi solid concrete), if you do have a joystick i can only imagine itll randomly cut out and set fire because it doesnt want to be associated with this crap.Gameplay: what is there?Seriously....tell me what exactly you can do in this that would be considered ""fun"". Trading would be ok if it wasnt practically the entire focus of the game and therefore so heavily done that it detracts from combat and even MOVING AROUND, dead serious....moving around is atrocious. Anyway combat? the one time i encountered combat i found i had no weapons by default :D.....Sound: it took some stuff from X2 and mixed in some of its own.Visuals: wonderful, only plus in my opinion.Performance: Occasional slow down but ill put it down to using a crappy office laptop.End result: I want a refund, this is plausibley one of the single worst games ive ever played, i dont understand why people like trade games like this, its buried under tons of crap that i cant be asked to learn. Before you go and say ""oh you havent spent enough time on this"" or ""oh you just dont understand that combat isnt the main aspect and therefore you cant derive enjoyment from it"", first off, i have spent enough time on this, ive spent enough to know im utterly disgusted steam sells this ♥♥♥♥♥, secondly i have played a number of flight sims and space sims before, i have also played trader in numerous other games and can do fairly well, and i do understand that combat isnt the main focus, but what id really like is to have a competant system that actually responds as i want it to and doesnt feel like im bogged down in the ♥♥♥♥♥iest bog in the world.

My review3/10 for interface8/10 for graphics4/10 for controls0/10 for storyline, quests, goals-10/10 for everything regarding tutorials and explanations on how the game worksA big overall of 0/10, do not buy this game unless you know how it is played without having played it. I saw a lot of people say ""its normal, its a sandbox"" well, no. Even a sandbox game needs to tell its new players how to play with the sand so they do not choke on it.If anyone is feeling kind enough to build a mod that can guide new players around on how to fly the ship, how to select something in the menus, how to buy or sell something how to change ships, how to do ANYTHING else than fly, dock, shoot, select a target, then the game would get a good 7/10.

												First 15 min impressions: X3: Albion PreludeVerdict: Not for me.Steam refused to install this game. To get it running I had to consult the internet. I read a thread where someone was berated for trying to play this game without having the previous (unrelated) game installed-- why would you expect that to work?To my naive senses. this game is exactly the same as the others. The introduction was nonsense (I gather a terrorist cosplayer set off a war? Maybe). Gameplay was tedious and slow. Plot was non-existent. I was glad when it was over.I'm reminded of a Douglas Adams quote I read long ago and can't quite remember the details for. If I recall correctly, the BBC had created a fan-site/forum for HHGTTG, and then promptly forgotten about it. The forum was used religiously by a small group of people for 10-15 years. When Adams discovered this later he claimed it was like ""You left food in your refrigerator so long that it developed sentience, and a little civilization evolved in your icebox. One day you pull open the drawer, and the inhabitants thank you and ask you to please close the drawer again, they liked things just the way they were.""Somebody loves these games dearly. They've evolved their own genre that is the pinnacle of their gaming experience. To the rest of us, it tastes like moldy cheese.			"

												Three words can describe how my experience was in this game. Purely. Justifiably. Amazing. Surprising right, I know I know, It doesn't look like much from the pictures given, but a world that is amazing and full of unlimited possibilities awaits just beyond that door. When you first enter X3 you are swamped by a non-tutorial, up-close, unforgiving, and dangerous universe. It takes a little practice to learn the ropes of the game; exploration, trading, and battle. This can be a very dangerous world or a very  safe one, depending on who you chose to be. It is best not to think of a single directive but more long term and while being a cutthroat pirate maybe fun and exciting it does not however pay very well, unless you hit a large target. This however is extremely difficult and takes a lot of preparation. So, whether or not you are planning your large heist you have to encounter trading at some point. This concept can take a little getting used to but my recommendation would be to go around trading energy cells until you have a good amount of cash, all the while looking at rising and falling stocks at the exchange.. Then invest in some stocks. (Yes the game has its own living and breathing stock exchange that can be very hard and frustrating but can create a very large payout to those who figure it out.) After you gain a sum of money and are sitting happily in your battlecrusier struggling to maneuver the shipping lanes, look for the best place to get weapons, build some stations, and go exploring. Be cautious though, there is always someone who wants you dead. It is very dangerous and yes, you may be large and have enough cannons to block out the sun, but a well aimed missile can kill you and end your game. All in all 9/10.			"

												I can't get enough of this game right now.  It only needs a couple of mods to be perfect for me - Cycrow's Improved Boarding and DrBullwinkle's Marine Training & Repairs.  Everything else is just about perfect.Once you get past the steep learning curve and arcane interface, you'll be digging deep into a delicious cake made of perfectly blended space combat and economy manipulation.Avoid the Stock Market, though.  It's basically cheat codes to print off free money with no effort.  It goes against everything the game has going for it - namely the construction of a space empire from a humble beginning and carved out with your own sweat and blood.  Free money is like a cancer in a game like that.  I didn't value anything I bought with it, but I love every ship I capture and work for... so - do yourself a favor - don't play the Market and enjoy the game as intended.  If you worked to unravel the UI and controls, you should work for everything else.  It's just sweeter that way.			"

												Of all the games in the X series, this is the first game I've dared to play, the controls seemed hard to get, but after reading a few manuals and watching a tutorial, I got by.The game it self is amazingly deep. You can choose between three races, two of them are both human, but with different pasts.. we have the Humans from Earth, and then the Humans who got lost in space or so (explained in the first games). If you go for the Earth race, you start of secluded in the space, with an never-ending war with the other Humans - who have vast numbers always going on, trying to get back and see / conquer Earth.If you go with the other races, you get more sectors to explore, and the dangers of the Planet Destroyers at close-range. While there is a suicide race option aside from the humans, I wouldn't recommend it, since it's death = save deleted.You can wage war, build factories, take over ships and just become your own faction of sorts. You can even buy a whole sector for yourself, just try not to get on the other races edge too much.. unless you like their armies on your doorstep.But beware, even though death while playing as Human doesnt delete your save, it does show Game Over, even if you have several ships. If the one you control get shot down, all your other ships you have as defence around you doesnt matter. Just remember to eject out of it, and get an ally ship to rescue you!			"

												After having thoroughy played X3 (both the original and the expansion) I can safely say that this is pretty much slowly (but surely) bringing back the good old time of space simulators. Not just normal space simulators, no, space simulators where you can own a huge ship, have dozens of supporting fighting and ♥♥♥♥ the living ♥♥♥♥ out of an entire galaxy with your millions of lasers.Yeah, try to beat that with your modern warfares.

												IF you can get past the absurd learning curve, this game is amazing. I have spent hours playing it and just started to mod it as well. I recommend XRM mod. You will like building an economic and military powerhouse over time and toying with the race relations of war. This is not a fast pace game though. so if yo uexpect to jump in and have a capital ship in a few hours your are going to be sadly mistaken.			"

Build your economical empire and/or create your own army (containing destroyers, carriers, supply ships, ...) and conquer the universe or help a faction of your choice fight against its enemies.The game takes time to get into as you are mainly left on your own but the freedom of action you have makes the time investment rewarding.

												If you are into complex Economic simulation, or just free roam space worlds this is a biggest time sink you can find out there. X3: Albion Prelude is the refined best that the X-series has to offer. The game features a big fleet of spaceships that are yours to commandeer and various races to interact in this simulated universe.You start out with a single ship with varying backgrounds depending on your character, and you are just left on your own in the middle of nowhere in a vast universe to do as you please. You can follow the Story Quest missions or just go out on your own and build your own trade empire. Heck you can just spend your time pirating in border sectors and shooting down supply ships for profit.One might be overwhelmed with how all the ship software and components work, or how and where to get them installed. But once you have figured out the basics of commandeering, and figured out the game universe, this game will keep you engrossed for a long time.I would recommend downloading the bonus pack for a few gameplay enhancements, that make this complex game a bit more easier to manage.Once you build up a sizable fleet, you will need the enhancements to manage your factory complexes.I never realized how time flew by when I was playing X3:AP			"

There isn't much of a story, but once you're out on your own building your empire or do other stuff this games comes alive like nothing else. So really it's up to you to give it meaning.However the game as such lacks many great features provided by the active modding community. Forget about the vanillia mode of this game and mod it as much as you like. Avoid ""cheaty"" stuff since it really kills the fun. Instead choose improvements like the complex builder, the advanced and stupendesly expensive jumpdive, addon software and so on.Thanks to it's plugins this game provides a lot of depth. It is pretty to look at and even runs on low end hardware (e.g. Intel HD3000). Don't expect a great story line and make the universe your own, then you will experience the greatness of this game. Don't go for it if you expect a great story or other guidelines. This game requires a lot of involvment.

But we are not talking about X-Rebirth...As far as Albion Prelude, it is one of my personal favorites, because it incorporates the concept of a stock market which previous X titles did not have.   Using the Stock Market you can amass large sums of money, rather than as in the previous series, working several days just for enough spare change to upgrade your ship and and pay for repairs along the way.Everything about this game is marvelous, from the atmosphere, the music, the souds, the great variety of weapons, and things to do in-game, comes as close as I thnk we'll ever get to a totally fun space sim.  My favorite Capital ship is the Titan, and theres just something magical about seeing her open up all her turrets, firing at different targets and seeing those High Energy Plasma Throwers make a mess out of just about any opposition thrown it's way.The only thing I did not like about the game was the flame thrower weapon, which seemed very unrealistic as a weapon to have in space, and most of the heavier pirate ships will have those weapons, and in numbers they can make short work of even a Capital ship, if not dealt with swiftly.   Another issue with those weapons are they are frame rate intensive, and really lagged down my system during battles.  That was the only problem I really had issues with.I give this game a 8.5/10			"

												The most up-to-date expansion of the X3 Series, after Reunion and then Terran Conflict. Space Capitalism/Piracy/Combat Simulator all years plz no X:Rebirth in X3 at least u can fly any ship instead of being limited to one lol srsly tho X3 Albion/Terran Conflict are great games.			"

												If you are looking to jump straight into combat, or are not a patient sort in general then this is probably not the game for you. It takes a long time to make any appreciable progress in this universe, in the dozens of hours, in fact. When you start the game, it can take several hours to make 100,000 credits, and some of the high end fighters run 4 times that or more. Capital ships and massive transports run in the millions of credits, but are satisfying to use. I played this game before it was on steam, and probably have several hundred hours into it. It is a lot of fun if you like an economy simulator and random combat encounters.			"

												This is a simply stunning game and just what I had hoped it would be, being a huge fan of the old Frontier Elite II from the early 90s I was pleasantly suprised to find that X3 offers almost everything Elite II did with a huge universe to explore, massive battles and in depth trading systems it's not for everyone but for any budding Space Cowboy don't miss this game.

												Less of a grind than normal X3 (they are learning) but still can be a grind. Also kinda unfinished (One plot for only one of the several selectable races). The whole thing isn't thought through like you don't get to know alot about what is going on with the War and what it expects you to do, you can never loose at the new stock market feature and neither can you get a stake in other corporations by buying their shares etc....  there's very little transparent to the player. Obviously they just try to get more funding to the next X, which is called ""X Rebirth"". If you're interested in the X Series you better wait for that new one, because it already looks promising and seems to learn from many of the mistakes they did in these earlier X Games. If you - against my advice - absolutely have to play a X game before that, then play X3 Terran Conflict but be prepared for a Grindfest of a size that some MMOs look like dwarfs... and this game is Single-Player, mind you.

If you ask me X3 AP is one of the best space sims out there since the beggining of gaming. Starting with only small ship and later buidling up your fleet, doing combat missions, waitting for that Mamoth to apear so you can buy a station, just brings open play and many posibilites.			"

												Do you like building trade empires for hours on end, then going out to blast some aliens for a bit before coming back to the empire building?  Heck yeah?  Then you found the right game.The game is essentially what you would get if you mixed Wing Commander with Partrician or East India Company, or something along those lines.Also, do you like mods?  This game has a metric butt-ton of them.  Maybe not Skyrim levels of mods, but a lot.  And most of them are /very/ good.  More ships?  Sure.  More guns?  Easy.  Bigger Universe?  Yep.  Entire new ways to play the game like as a mobile salvage yard.  Dang right.  Upgrades to ship AI so that your each one of your larger ships has a number of main crew members with different skill levels that affect how the ship operates, and you can shift and move that crew around to different ships?  Yeah, some crazy bast**d actually wrote that one too. Oh, bring a joystick (or at the very least a 360 controller) and the patience to learn how the game works.			"

												I really can't believe I've put 268 hours into this. Great game. Immersive space game with good combat and business aspects to it. Think Eve, but single player and way more options with just enough grinding to make it feel like you're doing something but not require you to feel like it;s a job instead of a game.I'm keeping this installed, not its successor. The reboot is a totally different game. Only thing I don't like is no matter how big you are in the game, there's really no way to actually affect the ""borders"" in the game. You can get to a point where you can dominate any engagement, build commercial empires, etc, but you can't actually move into a pirate system and take over for example.  "

												I highly recommend this game If you have looked for a game with replay ability thats both a sandbox enviroment and in space then look no futher the X3AP the expansion to the best game in the series of X-universe game made by the company Egosoft.  I have played the base game X3:Terran Conflict (a non-steam version) possibly a good 8 years and have continue to enjoy it.I have personaly modded both this expansion and the orginal X3TC for my own tastes, which I totaly recommend you try if you like the base game or don't like the base game mods are certainly there to keep the game interesting for a long time.  The community of this game is good and extremely helpful to new comers on the Egosoft forums. And there are some excellent mods Such as Litcubes Universe for X3AP, XRM for both X3TC and X3AP, Rogueys mod for X3AP and various non total conversions, scripts, new backgrounds, new ships, new plots such a large ammount of quality mods for this game and X3Tc to list. Now fair warning there is a learning curve you will not jump in and automatically know everything in the universe, where the best trade places are, the shipyards or the other races territories but that's the fun,  you then go threw these linked wormholes called ""Gates"" to the one its matched too and enter a new system, then you either visually spot stations and fly towards them or get close enough to have them show up on your map from your sensor'es. All in all great game fully reccommend, Do not get the latest one X-Rebirth is nothing like this game and is largly shunned by the core community as a failed attempt.			"

												This game is an extension on the Terran Conflict universe with new plot lines and content. Its basically a huge space sandbox which at first feels very overwhelming, however knowing how to do everything is not essential. You pick a start scenario which sets your race and starting ship(s) and credits plus gives you access to the different plot lines. The main plots have no time limit so you can ignore them untill you feel like doing them and just fly around and explore the vast universe. The dynamic economy can be exploited for profitsss or you can scavenge the wares dropped from capital ships in the war sectors. After you have made heaps of cash you can build factories  and or a trade fleet and generate a constant income. You can also just be a pirate and loot wares from the ai ships flying around. Or you can do none of the above but you need creditssss!! for more capital shipssss!!The graphics are great for a game of this age and complexity, good immersion.I just fly around and shoot with the mouse, keyboard controls can be customized too.The only downsides of this game are its interface, while it needs to be complex it could have been thought out better. I think it is due to features being continually added over time.The game runs great on my FX8350 but is heavily single threaded. I dont know how they simulate the universe, run scripts and render the world on one thread and have it run as good as it does. There are slight pauses when fleets jump into sector and occasionally in the menus / UI.Theres also issues with how the war sectors are scripted which will make your hair fall out but i learned to work around it and now have ended the war anyway.I recommend this game to people who dont mind a bit of a learning curve. I personally had no problem being drawn in by the universe and having it consume most of my spare time.  "

												This is an excellent sandbox space opera game. Start out with nothing and build an empire. Build and manage stations which create goods. Create fleets to defend your property from pirates. Take part in MASSIVE space battles. It is a complex game and the UI is not friendly, so only invest in this if you dont mind the steap learning curve.			"

												I can't get enough of this game right now.  It only needs a couple of mods to be perfect for me - Cycrow's Improved Boarding and DrBullwinkle's Marine Training & Repairs.  Everything else is just about perfect.Once you get past the steep learning curve and arcane interface, you'll be digging deep into a delicious cake made of perfectly blended space combat and economy manipulation.Avoid the Stock Market, though.  It's basically cheat codes to print off free money with no effort.  It goes against everything the game has going for it - namely the construction of a space empire from a humble beginning and carved out with your own sweat and blood.  Free money is like a cancer in a game like that.  I didn't value anything I bought with it, but I love every ship I capture and work for... so - do yourself a favor - don't play the Market and enjoy the game as intended.  If you worked to unravel the UI and controls, you should work for everything else.  It's just sweeter that way.			"

												Love this game, as well as all of the X3 games.  There are some fundamental flaws in the code that can get really frustrating though.  The worst thing for me in all of the X3 games is the fact that all of your AI ships get stupid if you enter a sector with them in it.  They will often nose dive into an asteroid or crash into each other as soon as you come through the gate.     Don't bother mentioning it on the Egosoft website though, unless you want to get bombarded with fanboy insults that claim this is not a problem.  Their solution is just don't go into that sector anymore.  Not acceptable in my book.  Can be fixed with a mod that lets you turn off collisions.  This in turn has some undesired effects, but at least makes the concept of Wingmen that don't suicide possible.       Still, this game is mega fun and far superior to Ego's latest farce it calls a game, X:Rebirth.  They have really shown that they have some great ideas, but lack the level of programmers working for them to makes those ideas reallity.			"

												If you dare to get into X3: Albion Prelude, you'll ruin your life and be proud of it.This game throw you in a time vortex (yeah like Civ-onemoreturn). Basically you start in space with a barely armed light ship and you must.. do what you want! A pirate wingleader? A Merchant? A capital ship Commander? Yes, yes, YES!Let's face it, X3 is hard to handle at first. You'll have to dig the manual and some wikis (its like going to shopping trust me) to manage what you want. The content is crazy huge (ships per races, weapons, wares...) and the game is really beautiful. Great music come along to create a deep space atmosphere.Its hard to translate the epicness of X3 with words, but since the price is that ridiculous, i'd suggest you buy it and try yourself!RECOMMENDED "

												This game...no, wait, game is the wrong word. The word 'game' implies 'fun'. This game is not fun. Rewarding, is what I would call this game, and that is worth more than fun.Sure, you struggle for a while to figure out what the hell you're supposed to do (don't worry about the plot, you can pick that up much later). Then, you think about uninstalling. And then, the magic happens. You score your first big trade, and that's all it takes. A few million credits later, and you are well on your way.This isn't a space shooter, or combat sim, or anything like that. This simulation is a living, breathing, frustrating, rewarding, and glorious living place. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.			"

												If you have the patience, this game can be really addictive. The learning curve isn't a curve, though. It's a wall. Basically you start out with one ship and a little bit of money and through missions, trading, and exploration, you build a space empire that includes everything from space factories to freighter space ships to huge carriers, filled with fighters.I love this game but it's pretty easy to die and it's a long road from the start to having a respectable size fleet.Also, I recommend a joystick for this.

												Of all the games in the X series, this is the first game I've dared to play, the controls seemed hard to get, but after reading a few manuals and watching a tutorial, I got by.The game it self is amazingly deep. You can choose between three races, two of them are both human, but with different pasts.. we have the Humans from Earth, and then the Humans who got lost in space or so (explained in the first games). If you go for the Earth race, you start of secluded in the space, with an never-ending war with the other Humans - who have vast numbers always going on, trying to get back and see / conquer Earth.If you go with the other races, you get more sectors to explore, and the dangers of the Planet Destroyers at close-range. While there is a suicide race option aside from the humans, I wouldn't recommend it, since it's death = save deleted.You can wage war, build factories, take over ships and just become your own faction of sorts. You can even buy a whole sector for yourself, just try not to get on the other races edge too much.. unless you like their armies on your doorstep.But beware, even though death while playing as Human doesnt delete your save, it does show Game Over, even if you have several ships. If the one you control get shot down, all your other ships you have as defence around you doesnt matter. Just remember to eject out of it, and get an ally ship to rescue you!			"

												I left this game untouched for a long time until it finally hit me. I know the X series since X2 which got me hooked completely. This reincarnation of X3 really blew me away. There isn't much of a story, but once you're out on your own building your empire or do other stuff this games comes alive like nothing else. So really it's up to you to give it meaning.However the game as such lacks many great features provided by the active modding community. Forget about the vanillia mode of this game and mod it as much as you like. Avoid ""cheaty"" stuff since it really kills the fun. Instead choose improvements like the complex builder, the advanced and stupendesly expensive jumpdive, addon software and so on.Thanks to it's plugins this game provides a lot of depth. It is pretty to look at and even runs on low end hardware (e.g. Intel HD3000). Don't expect a great story line and make the universe your own, then you will experience the greatness of this game. Don't go for it if you expect a great story or other guidelines. This game requires a lot of involvment. Read the egosoft forums to find out what little tricks are out there and how to actually play the game.			"

												As much an RTS as it is a space sim.  It's all about building an empire in a faction based open world.  Don't bother trying to play it with a joystick, but the combat is fun.  Tons of ship customization and fleet building options.  Has a very steep learning curve, but there is a tutorial, and if you just start by playing the campaign it's not as bad.  This is a very in depth game that you could easily spend hundreds of hours in.  Building your empire and conquering the galaxy.			"

												Three words can describe how my experience was in this game. Purely. Justifiably. Amazing. Surprising right, I know I know, It doesn't look like much from the pictures given, but a world that is amazing and full of unlimited possibilities awaits just beyond that door. When you first enter X3 you are swamped by a non-tutorial, up-close, unforgiving, and dangerous universe. It takes a little practice to learn the ropes of the game; exploration, trading, and battle. This can be a very dangerous world or a very  safe one, depending on who you chose to be. It is best not to think of a single directive but more long term and while being a cutthroat pirate maybe fun and exciting it does not however pay very well, unless you hit a large target. This however is extremely difficult and takes a lot of preparation. So, whether or not you are planning your large heist you have to encounter trading at some point. This concept can take a little getting used to but my recommendation would be to go around trading energy cells until you have a good amount of cash, all the while looking at rising and falling stocks at the exchange.. Then invest in some stocks. (Yes the game has its own living and breathing stock exchange that can be very hard and frustrating but can create a very large payout to those who figure it out.) After you gain a sum of money and are sitting happily in your battlecrusier struggling to maneuver the shipping lanes, look for the best place to get weapons, build some stations, and go exploring. Be cautious though, there is always someone who wants you dead. It is very dangerous and yes, you may be large and have enough cannons to block out the sun, but a well aimed missile can kill you and end your game. All in all 9/10.			"

												I highly recommend this game If you have looked for a game with replay ability thats both a sandbox enviroment and in space then look no futher the X3AP the expansion to the best game in the series of X-universe game made by the company Egosoft.  I have played the base game X3:Terran Conflict (a non-steam version) possibly a good 8 years and have continue to enjoy it.I have personaly modded both this expansion and the orginal X3TC for my own tastes, which I totaly recommend you try if you like the base game or don't like the base game mods are certainly there to keep the game interesting for a long time.  The community of this game is good and extremely helpful to new comers on the Egosoft forums. And there are some excellent mods Such as Litcubes Universe for X3AP, XRM for both X3TC and X3AP, Rogueys mod for X3AP and various non total conversions, scripts, new backgrounds, new ships, new plots such a large ammount of quality mods for this game and X3Tc to list. Now fair warning there is a learning curve you will not jump in and automatically know everything in the universe, where the best trade places are, the shipyards or the other races territories but that's the fun,  you then go threw these linked wormholes called ""Gates"" to the one its matched too and enter a new system, then you either visually spot stations and fly towards them or get close enough to have them show up on your map from your sensor'es. All in all great game fully reccommend, Do not get the latest one X-Rebirth is nothing like this game and is largly shunned by the core community as a failed attempt.			"

												Highly recommend this game over the more current release.  The X3 series, at least for me, is the most engrossing and complete space trading and combat game I've ever played.I have 4X the amount of time logged then what Steam shows (from a non-steam purchase years ago).The flight model and keyboard commands are not what are considered 'standard' by todays current space combat/trade sims, so it will take a little time to become familiar with the shortcuts, etc.You do not need a flight stick or complete HOTAS to play this game.   KB + Mouse will do you fine.  Memorize the keyboard shortcuts!  They will go a long way to helping with the enjoyment of the game.Play how you like.  If you want to be a pirate, a trader, an asteroid miner, or hybrid you can custom tailor your character. -p0pp3r			"

But in your library if you click onto your game its shown as not installed. Go to the developers site: http://www.egosoft.com/download/x3ap/bonus_en.phpAnd download: X³AP All In One Bonus Package (v5.1.0) at the bottom of the site. It could be downloaded without an account. After that simply install it.For questions about the items and how to use/find them: http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=276039For X3AP scroll down. This link is better because you can click on the headline of every extension in order to get a detailed description about how it works.For the game itself: I still love it!And huge respect to the developers for keeping the game updated although its been a long time since the release!

												The game might looks overwhelming first with all the interfaces. But once you actually get down to it, it's quite simple. The most you will use is property menu and ship's command console. Once you get those down, it's easier to learn than EVE online.The game is every space sim geek's dream. You can do whatever you want, how you want. You want fly that fancy ship? No problem, you can buy it from faction shipyard. They don't sell it? No problem. You can train marines to capture it. No money? Get some freight ships and hauling goods. Or build your own space stations and start manufacturing things to sell, so you can build up your own fleet, from carriers, battleships, to corvette and fighters.One other thing about the X series is its mod support. There's hundreds upon hundreds of community made mods that enhance the gaming experience. All can be found on Egosoft's community forum. Mods range from small fix, to total overhaul that adds tons of replayability. One mod I personally recommend is the XRM. It overhaul the entire vanilla universe while rebalancing very ships, weapons, and missiles. There's another mod that ported the Terran conflict's individual plot line into Albion Prelude so you can enjoy all the improvements AP brought while playing the old story missions.All in all, X3 AP is the pinnacle of single player space sim game. If you don't enjoy EVE online's complexity, this is the definite space sim game for you.			"

												Less of a grind than normal X3 (they are learning) but still can be a grind. Also kinda unfinished (One plot for only one of the several selectable races). The whole thing isn't thought through like you don't get to know alot about what is going on with the War and what it expects you to do, you can never loose at the new stock market feature and neither can you get a stake in other corporations by buying their shares etc....  there's very little transparent to the player. Obviously they just try to get more funding to the next X, which is called ""X Rebirth"". If you're interested in the X Series you better wait for that new one, because it already looks promising and seems to learn from many of the mistakes they did in these earlier X Games. If you - against my advice - absolutely have to play a X game before that, then play X3 Terran Conflict but be prepared for a Grindfest of a size that some MMOs look like dwarfs... and this game is Single-Player, mind you.

												Do you like building trade empires for hours on end, then going out to blast some aliens for a bit before coming back to the empire building?  Heck yeah?  Then you found the right game.The game is essentially what you would get if you mixed Wing Commander with Partrician or East India Company, or something along those lines.Also, do you like mods?  This game has a metric butt-ton of them.  Maybe not Skyrim levels of mods, but a lot.  And most of them are /very/ good.  More ships?  Sure.  More guns?  Easy.  Bigger Universe?  Yep.  Entire new ways to play the game like as a mobile salvage yard.  Dang right.  Upgrades to ship AI so that your each one of your larger ships has a number of main crew members with different skill levels that affect how the ship operates, and you can shift and move that crew around to different ships?  Yeah, some crazy bast**d actually wrote that one too. Oh, bring a joystick (or at the very least a 360 controller) and the patience to learn how the game works.			"

												I really can't believe I've put 268 hours into this. Great game. Immersive space game with good combat and business aspects to it. Think Eve, but single player and way more options with just enough grinding to make it feel like you're doing something but not require you to feel like it;s a job instead of a game.I'm keeping this installed, not its successor. The reboot is a totally different game. Only thing I don't like is no matter how big you are in the game, there's really no way to actually affect the ""borders"" in the game. You can get to a point where you can dominate any engagement, build commercial empires, etc, but you can't actually move into a pirate system and take over for example.  "

												Any review of this game will warn of an extremely steep learning curve. I would disagree and say it's more of an atrocious user interface that prevents people from learning this game. Once you get used to it, prepare to spend a decade gathering the resources needed to do anything fun, unless of course you get into the stock market which is only available in Albion Prelude. Hence the reason I would only suggest X3AP rather than any other X3 build. The sheer scale of the game is impressive which is a must for a game about space exploration. The combat isn't bad either. If you've been looking for a space sim that doesn't require the extreme dedication of an MMO like EVE online, then this is the game for you.			"

												Great game if you have patience, have time to spend, and for testing your micromanaging skills (this game takes a LOT of micromanaging to the point where you have to control EVERY aspect of the properties you own). A very time consuming but fun game where you can choose multiple starts, choose what you want to do. A very wide open universe where you can do simple missions and trading all the way through creating a massive empire. You shape your own universe through your actions. For people that are looking into getting this game, I recommend it. For people that want to get started out fast and legitly without having to cheat that have some time put into this game, I suggest manipulating the stock market for easy money early on. From there everything is up to you as the player. Do the plots for great rewards, or go to war and deal with the consequences and rewards of fighting on the Argon/Terran front. Or fight on the border and core sectors by fighting pirates and Xenon. The fate of your choices rest in your hands.			"

												Highly recommend this game over the more current release.  The X3 series, at least for me, is the most engrossing and complete space trading and combat game I've ever played.I have 4X the amount of time logged then what Steam shows (from a non-steam purchase years ago).The flight model and keyboard commands are not what are considered 'standard' by todays current space combat/trade sims, so it will take a little time to become familiar with the shortcuts, etc.You do not need a flight stick or complete HOTAS to play this game.   KB + Mouse will do you fine.  Memorize the keyboard shortcuts!  They will go a long way to helping with the enjoyment of the game.Play how you like.  If you want to be a pirate, a trader, an asteroid miner, or hybrid you can custom tailor your character. -p0pp3r			"

												Ok I've been playing X games for a little while now and am still learning how to get things to work. Out of a 5 star rating system I'd give it 3 to 3.5 stars. It is a beautiful game and once you get into it and actually figure it out it is a very enjoyable game. There are some major draw backs though and number on is NO TUTORIAL!!!!!! So you basically hop in your ship get shown how to do a few minor things then sent off in the universe to die over and over and over.... Second the pathing issues kinda suck I have ships hiting stations all the time. I'll need a ship to come fight in my sector and the it to jump to me just to have it hit the station while undocking and explode. absolutley no reason for this. I've docked at a station to save the game in my Spitefire and then explode when I undock. I continued and it happened again had to have another ship dock switch ships and undock that way. Also the game is basically about trading so why is there no tutorials on how to set up the basic trade soft ware you buy? thank god there is an amazing online community that has posted a lot of valuble information I find myself looking up a lot. so that is this games saving grace if it wasn't for the online help I would give it a 0.5 but with help the majorly steep learning curve is managable.

												Hardcore Space SimIf you liked Freespace, Tachyon: The Fringe, or Freelancer, or ever wished you could play Eve: Online in single-player, you should try this game.The starting curve is a bit steep; you won't be fighting pirates or controlling a shipping empire immediately out the gate, but a few hours invested will get you to that point fairly easily.  Several hours more invested can have you owning your first space factory or capitol ship, and from there the paths are still diverse.			"

												UPDATE*********Ok, never mind all that, its awesome. But this game is like freaking magically possessed or something, or I am or whatever. So I went to sleep last night after getting back on it again. Thats where the magically possessed stuff comes in. I wanted to blow it up......BUT....found myself back at it again. I finally figured some stuff out. So I go charging into some Pirate HQ sector and get my ♥♥♥ shot to pieces by a hoard or something. Did not know how to fight at all, not even shoot my guns really. So again, I go to be like WTF I hate this game. Fast forward to today. Somehow I woke up understanding how to fight and some clearity on a few more things. So I have been kicking some ♥♥♥, trading stocks and making a killing, got sector trading going. How the hell did I figure all this out , overnight, in my sleep??  I know how. Borons, Argons and Teladi exist and they somehow infiltrated my bedroom last night, placed some unknown knowledge chip in my brain and escaped without my ever knowing. I think they may have been confused at some point cause my butt hurt a little but thats enough about that part. Anyhow, I'm playing now, and its awesome. I can see me playing this game for years to come!!!!! So my take is this......This is the only game you will find out there that will give you a boner and a migrain at the same time and drag it out for 14 hrs a day for 3 yrs. If you play it have a couple doctors on standby.			"

												Very steep learning curve but very rewarding.  Be a smuggler/pirate ship captain, a soldier in a fighter or build empires.  You can have Complexes of Factories and control a supply and demand based economy with a full stock market. You can also have you're own Headquarters which is a huge customizable station to control your empire from.   Closest thing to living in space without actually living there.			"

												   This game is amazing, assuming you make it far enough to learn the game. It has a steep learning curve and lots of micromanagement, but if you manage to understand it, you'll be leading fleets of ships ranging from fighters to capital ships. The objectives of the game are largely determined by  how do you want to play: Want to be a pirate? Capturing enemy ships can be risky but rewarding. Want to be a miner? There are plently of asteriods to explore and set up stations to bring in the money.    Or you can work your way to dominating the universe by capturing whole zones and forcing the other races to buy your goods, but prepare for huge battles. Overall, with this game it is easy to have over 400+ hours of gametime and still find things to do.			"

												Since Im not able to post a review on the Bonus Package site  Ill post it here because the link for the Bonus Package seem not to work.My solution for getting this free content installed is to ""download"" it on steam. But in your library if you click onto your game its shown as not installed. Go to the developers site: http://www.egosoft.com/download/x3ap/bonus_en.phpAnd download: X³AP All In One Bonus Package (v5.1.0) at the bottom of the site. It could be downloaded without an account. After that simply install it.For questions about the items and how to use/find them: http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=276039For X3AP scroll down. This link is better because you can click on the headline of every extension in order to get a detailed description about how it works.For the game itself: I still love it!And huge respect to the developers for keeping the game updated although its been a long time since the release!

												X3 is and has been the best space sim and sandbox games for years. I racked up 200 hours in the first few months, there is so much to do it can be overwhelming and every you do in the game takes a lot of time whether you are putting together a fleet consisting of the best ships from across the universe or  a massive trade empire that makes millions of credits it can take some time. Of those 200 hours i played I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer, there are a whole host of plots (that's what they call story quests ) none of which I have even done yet, you can become a pirate by boarding ships with your crew of trained marines, they fight through the levels of the ship and turn over the the controls to you. That's just a few things you can do in this game I highly recommend it if you're looking for a space sim that you can do almost anything in, if they ever make a sequel (I'm not counting x rebirth because that game is ♥♥♥♥) I would love to see planets you can land on and maybe even take over and have them become part of your empire, who knows anyway the game is pretty good			"

												This game has been quite entertaining. Its also been quite time consuming. While the actions of a couple minutes can ruin your game or make bounding leaps forwards, things in this game overall happen very slowly. Its a sandbox really, so you can do whatever you'd like. I've been building a trading empire that specializes in manufacturing weapons and sheilds. Once I start making a strong income I will build up a fleet of warships, arm them with the weaponry I've produced and smash the hostile civilization that caused me so much grief early on. The game has a universe-wide economy that ebbs and flows with supply and demand, it even has a stock market built in. All the ships you control can have software packages installed that allow you to give them more commands, automating your micromanagement of massive fleets and factory complexes. This is a very interesting game, but it requires a lot of time to get anything done. Its very easy to play in segments though.			"

												The X series of games is certainly not for everyone, and if you look for flaws in this arguably best of the bunch, there's plenty to be found. The menus are endlessly convoluted, the default key config begs customization, advanced features are hidden in separate scripts that you have to find first. Sound design is inconsistent, comm portraits look laughably outdated, and sometimes the auto pilot will just decide to kill you by running into a nearby station, potentially taking hours of progress with it.So why even play this?The game is just that absorbing and consistently entertaining. You get a real sense of accomplishment after every little milestone - start as some deadbeat down on his luck in a cranky vessel, and work your way up the food chain until you find yourself baseballing away smaller spacecraft with your warship that looks like a giant metal dong.Everything is forgiven.See your employees breeze by on your travels as they expand your gargantuan accumulation of cash into even more absurd numbers which you can then blow on even bigger ships, your own illegal drug farms, or go wreck entire sectors just for some sick fun. Sky's the limit, and you're well past that border.Plus, despite this game being years old, and a polarizing sequel out, the devs are still fixing bugs! Even adding content sometimes! Kudos for these guys.If you like games with depth and don't mind investing a little effort into your games, and if you have patience, this is the game to get. Or, just play Dwarf Fortress I guess.
