												Much worse than WoS3... it's even worse in some ways than WoS 1 and 2. Physics are non-existant, there is no cab sway (the train is glued to the tracks), weather effects are pretty bad (seriously - snow looks like fireflies), most of the train sounds are all recycled from WoS 3 (like the doors and handles); new sounds (like the compressor for the brakes) are stiff just like the physics - they start and stop in an obvious loop cut. The train is stiff, braking is quite bad (the first few notches do almost nothing and then with the last two you can stop a massive train litteraly on a dime); there is absolutely no feel for the weight of the thing; not even Trainz levels of feel. And on top of it all the graphics are super choppy, and my system is not at all bad... TS2015 runs awesome on it, and even OMSI runs pretty good.TML had mostly released really crap games in the past (all their laughable bus sims come to mind) but after WoS3 was good I actually started believing maybe this will be good as well. Boy was I wrong. It looks like they've wasted all their time coding a completely unnecessary headquarters with bosses, mechanics and a cafeteria, and making earthquake missions, instead of investing in the actual simulation. Can't believe they charge 35$ for this.If Steam would allow refunds, I'd get one. And this is definately the LAST time I'm ever tempted to buy something from TML. The level of their credibility for me had dropped to zero. If you like rail simulators, and you value realism, avoid this. If you just want a fun game... there are much cheaper ones that are better.P.S. - The game also tends to crash, just now it dumped me out of a 1hr drive I was in the middle of, wasting my progress...P.P.S - After playing some more, I have more observations.Thankfully, there was no more crashes after the game update that came yesterday. But:- Many times when I start from Main St I get a double-train occupying the same space as mine, which makes it hard to set up. After I leave the station the game resumes normally- EVERY time I play a schedule I have at least 1 missed station listed in the review, when in fact I never miss any, and get a score of about 60% even though I did everything perfectly by the book and stuck to the schedule 100%. WTF.- The game becomes much less choppy when I turn the antialiasing off, with almost no visual impact, so that's a good tip for people having problems with performance.UPDATEThe game became much better during the last few updates, there is now cab sway - and even though it seems weird and choppy to me and not as good as WoS3's was, it's better than nothing, the crashes stopped... but: I've recently got a traindriver controller; and this doesn't work with it. WoS3 does, and this doesn't. So I don't play this at all anymore. WoS 3 is still better that this IMO.			"

												World of Subways 4 is an improvement to the world of subways series. That being said I am 7 train rider so I’m going to criticizes this a little harder than some other people. The Game format itself in shift mode was great and follows closely to how MTA operates there crew for the most part. The game itself i felt the track layout was rushed (even though we experienced several delays in the creation of the game) the switches south of Queensbrough Plaza are way too sharp for any train to take, also there is in consistent head movement along the route such as when leaving time square you have to fix the view but any other curve after Hunters Point Ave you don't have the same experience. The other thing I found lacking is the level of AI traffic in terms of trains the 7 train has the HIGHEST TRAIN FREQUENCEY in the system, for example I was operating a express train from TS to Main and there was NO OTHER NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC only 3 other southbound trains, that would be a frequency you would see maybe late night not 4 in the afternoon. In terms of scenery they did a great job and it is highly realistic to real life. So the train itself have okay physics for the train, they could be much better but they are simulating an older fleet which in real life if anyone rode them when the train operator applied the air brakes the train stopped, the good old R33 don't run like the R62a that operate today (the R62a only have airbrakes compared to the R33). So aside from the AI traffic or shall i say lack of....the game is actually pretty good			"

												So far, so good... Feels more stiff and disjointed than Vol. 3, but a smoother experience than the first two. Good visuals, good audio. Passenger AI can be a bit...Wonky on the platform. And every train I've passed has been empty. But the driving experience is mostly good and the game is, for me at least, fun. Never have I had to race a train to beat a tunnel collapse before.			"

												The game is better than I expected it to be. I've run the full round trip once, and I also made another trip from Times Square to Queens. As somebody who rides the 7 from Times Square to 33rd Street everyday, my standards were pretty high. In terms of scenery, they did very good. They placed railroad tracks where appropriate, they put buildings appropriate to the route, and did good with the stations. They even put in specific buildings, such as Aviation High School between 33rd and 40th streets. The train is nowhere near as good as the scenery. The cab is okay. The T/O and C/R indicators are both present, but do not work. The sounds aren't terrible, but the motor sounds are not very good. The physics are pretty off from where they should be, making the train kind of tough to operate at times. Also, the story line is not very good. I didn't want a story, just to simulate train operation. It seems that you'll be fine not participating in the whole story line thing after the first time you play, but I'm not sure. The story line doesn't seem how it should be considering how things work at the MTA. I also want to point out that the game has a few minor bugs, as it is a new release. The last thing I want to say upsets me is that there are no timers present throughout the route, but it is still playable without them. I haven't used the conductor mode yet, so I'll edit this once I have done so.			"

												Do you hate the variety that most rail sims offer? Did you dream about controlling only a single train on only a single 20 minute track over and and over again? Are you annoyed by acceptable frame rate, good graphics and accurate sound effects? Do you enjoy when the game description says that the game is set in the 70s and 80s but it isn't at all reflected in the actual game? Do you despise good voice acting but enjoy laughable mission scenarios? Then ""World of Subways 4"" is the game for you! Laugh and cheer as you take your only train from Flushing, Queens to Times Square! Why not go the other way? The possibilities are dual! It's literally minutes of fun!			"

												I have rarely regretted a purchase so thoroughly as I regret my decision to purchase World of Subways 4.  I hadn't played any of the previous 3 games in this franchise, but I was drawn in by the appeal of, ostensibly, a realistic subway simulation that highlighted the neighborhoods and infrastructure of New York City along the 7 line.Instead, this game delivers on virtually none of its promises other than the actual simulated act of driving a subway train.  The sound in the simulation is poor, the character animations are abysmal (1990's-era tech), and the voices in the game are so horrible they could have been featured in a grade-schoolers' YouTube video. And to top it off, the on-screen text (mission briefings, descriptions, etc.) are extremly poorly translated into English.Don't purchase this game.  You'll regret it, as I do.			"

												After what may feel like a steep learning curve, driving the trains is actually fairly easy and there's not as much setting up as there was in WoS3. That said, WoS3 is still largely better than this in virtually every way. The depot with NPC characters providing missions and something of a more social edge to the game as you interact with colleagues and your bosses is a nice idea and makes it different from other simulators,  but ultimately feels rather pointless once the missions have been completed. Conductor mode is also a nice feature but as it involves you switching from the driving cab to the conductor cab, performing the conductors duties then switching back to being a driver, again it feels like a wasted opportunity and it was easier in the end to simply leave it to the AI. Some of the sounds and passengers have been recycled from WoS3 (but with groovy 70s clothing!). The opening music and cut-scene is unnecessarily dramatic for what is simply a train driving simulator!  Ultimately, it's difficult really to know whether to give it a thumbs up or down - I enjoyed playing it, I liked the graphics and the feel of driving the 'Redbirds' through New York c. 1979, and I'll certainly go back to it. But in the end, I'll probably end up going back to WoS3 more. Perhaps because I'm a Londoner! But even if I were a New Yorker I'd feel that give the length of development, something so promising yet not quite as polished as this should've been put out there. If you can ignore the flaws, you'll get a lot of great enjoyment out of it if you're a subway fan. But to enjoy it at it's fullest, you really do need to try and overlook the flaws. I'm giving it a thumbs-up, but hoping future patches and updates will smooth out the faults and make it truly as brilliant as WoS3 was, as it's certainly a possibility. But, if you feel you cannot ignore the flaws described very well by other reviewers too, you're advised to go with WoS3 instead.			"

												Last Updated: Friday 3 April 2015The review of the game in short is I do  think this game is one of the best game made so far and I would reccomend buying it, however if you are unsure about buying this  game, then please read all of this review to get better understanding.Hello I've been playing World Of Subways VOL 4 for over 1 hour, and I can tell you I find it quite fun, the detail of the game is much more better then you would find in Train Simulator 2015, however the game is quite tricky as you will after set up your train and make sure everything is very nearly perfect because if you do something wrong it coulld result in making you restart the mission :(I would recomend you going for beginner mode first as this will help you, it will ask you when you are in the the start the shift every time. Their was a new Update which has really help out, the train feels more like real life and the new feature of Cab Sway is awesomeHere is some Pro's and Con's so far I have found the game (Last Update 23/03/2015)PRO'S *Train game*Graphics *English version has been translated in English with English sounds. *The game is very big and their a lot to do *The game as story Mission which is quite different compared to World Of Subways 3 London underground*Fun*Cab Sway *Challanging*Arrgo mode*Conductor Mode*Real life like*Some good detail mission*Hard mode*Drive speak to you when you takeover their shiftsCON'S*The Game require high specs *8 mission (I would like to see at least 10 -12)*User are reporting of issue*Not open World*The Game is hard to learn the the controls*Punishment (Restart mission if do one little thing wrong)The score I give this game is 81 / 100For the game to get 95 out 100 it will require to be more stable and maybe add more mission.Hope this helps out more*Sorry for the English, I not too good, the first one was very rushed, so it might of sounded really bad!This will be update for the next few weeks / Months			"

												Absolutely terrible! Not even closely comparable to WOS Vol. 3. Played for 20 minutes and hated every minute, and I love simulations. - The graphics are terrible compared to previous volumes. - The menu is sluggish and struggles to keep up with 4K, let alone any higher resolution (which states is supported in the setting menu).- The game is very slow, and eats up FPS like nobody’s business (even with a very high-end PC).- The physics are not even close to that of London Underground Volume, with the cab static (no sway)- Re-used sounds from Vol. 3 except for a few brake pipe sounds.- The game storyline seems to have been something new (and I commend the developers for adding interactivity and to a certain extent: free-roam). But the character animations are terrible, jumping erratically, no speech syncing, and no sense of realism. In addition, the overall feel to the game seems to be that of a FPS, whereby the music is adventure-orientated, and the character interaction/AI is mediocre.- Mouse syncing problems arise when changing resolution (as if the mouse is still stuck on the previous resolution).- In-game effects such as rain and snow are appalling.WOS Vol. 3 has by far been their best simulator so far. WOS Vol. 4 is like a step back in game development. While other game engines and developers exceed the boundaries with their games, WOS seems to ignore all new technologies and game essentials. It is hard to believe that their previous games have been better than this one, and yet with all these negative aspects, they still charge £26.99 ($34.99 in the US). It is very disappointing that such a long-awaited game on behalf of the community is such a let-down. For anyone who is thinking of buying this game; please don't. Keep your money for a better developed game which is actually worth this extraordinary amount. I can see the reasons as to why they implemented such things as character interaction and storyline (as many from the community requested some sort of interaction/storyline), but it has greatly affected the quality of not only the graphics and user interface, but also the gameplay, of what this franchise has always been about; driving trains.

												This game has both its good and bad points.  Personally I feel this is an improvement over WOS3, I can see where they were going with the missions, but if your a simulation fan like me, then avoid them.  The whole depot thing is a nice touch, I like the fact you have to 'sign on' with the supervisor, and can take over trains from the AI, take your train to the sidings at the end of your shift.  The fact you can do an immediate return trip after terminating  by walking to the other end of the train and setting it up is really great.  I can now do a return journey without having to come out and go through menus; like in WOS3 where if you wanted to do another trip straight away you had to go back to the menus and select the retun.  Now it is part of your shift plan.The game is far more indepth  than TS 2015, don't come to WOS 4 thinking you can drive a train in TS2015 so you can here, you won't be able to.  The manual and tutorial are you friend initially, use them, there are a lot of train controls.  Station stop are unforgiving, over shoot the stop mark by less than a foot and the doors won't open.Good:The depot interaction to put yourself on a route is great, much more realistic over previous WOS'sMuch easier to walk in this than in WOS3Weather and lighting engine is much better than WOS 3It really does have the look and feel of the NYC Subway system and accuratly simulates this.  You have to operate the doors from the conductors postion because thats how it was done in the 70's where this game is simulating.Far more feedback at the end over WOS3Bad:The missions are a joke, and completly ruin any immersion, I tried them and will ignore them, aimed more at casual players, rather than hardcore simulation fans (like me)The animations of the AI in the depot are laughable, as is the voice acting (and lip sync is way out)Some of the translation from German to English is badly done, you need to read things a few times (only an issue in missions really)You have to disable AA in Graphic options or the FPS for me was 10 (I have a GTX 970) others are reporting the same issue, this is your fix, there also appears to be no graphical affect from this.You can't freely walk around the stations like you could in WOS3Braking physics feel a little wrongOverall I really like this game and will continue to play it regularly.  This is a SIMULATOR, and has far more simulation and is way more indepth then TS2015.  You need to be prepard to fail in the first hour or so, this game needs some getting used to before you can fully appreciate what it is.  My advise is to read other reviews, watch some YT videos and decide from there.  If your really unsure, then get this in a Steam sale or from another vendor who are more likely to refund.			"

												So far so good a few bugs but not to bad a range of 8 missions and different shifts.i like it although the lack of ai traffic red signals during rush hour confuses me.I like being a conductor although it'd be nice just to be that for a route or 2. Other than that going through tunnels at 40mph and braking as you hit the platform to stop and not the miss the station gives you the ultimate pressure AGGRO MODE well thats a excellent addition used it a couple of times and think it could be improved aswell as the ai traffic :) so yes i recomend this if your into simulators (although its still not as good wos3 its a good edition to have especially if you enjoy driving through tunnels and trying not to derail at 35-40mph)			"

												I had high, high hopes for this game after the huge success that was World of Subways 3, the one set in the London underground, which was amazing. But this game was an utter letdown. Awful, AWFUL physics, clunky gameplay, bad performance (on a very high end PC) and the menus are terrible. Also not to mention half the text in the game is misspelled or in German. It's awful. That's £27 I will never get back. Terrible game, PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS! I am somewhat shocked that this game managed to scrape a 'Mostly Positive' score. I played WoS 1 and I genuinley think that everyone but the graphics and scenery are better tan this new release.Quite possibly the worst game I have paid for and played in my entire life.			"

SummaryWhile not that horribly bad, this is not the game I expected. It's not as bad as another TML game, the Fernbus Simulator, but still, it's much worse than other train sims out there. It has some improvements over WoS 3, and is much less buggy for me when in outside of the train mode, but I still get occasional crash here and there, which really shouldn't happen after such a long time since the game's release. The worst things are physics and graphics. Overall, I cannot recommend it. What works... sort of... kind of...1. The route is rather decent, and pretty varied, although the real underground part is pretty short. I like that a pretty long part of it is above ground but from the World of Subways I'd expect a bit more subway stations. 2. Weather is overall acceptable, except for winter which is not good at all. Hand wipers are a nice touch. 3. Stations are properly crowded when compared to other train sims out there. You can really feel that the you are driving a train in a busy metropolis. 4. The depot is passable. The only things I don't like are the horrible faces and character models and above all, those immersion-breaking TML game ads. I already bought your game, TML, don't need to ruin my immersion. This is how the route was supposed to look in the 1980s/90s, why the modern ads?5. Being able to walk around your train and stations. I really loved this feature in WoS 3, and I love it here.6. I have a high-end PC so I have almost no FPS problems and when I do, those are very minor. Can't complain here.What really doesn't work1. Physics. They're not as good as WoS 3 or Train Simulator. Especially the brakes, most of them do little, and then the last two levels stop a huge train in an instant. Not very realistic.2. I might be wrong, but I think that some sounds were actually recycled from the previous games by TML.3. Character models. If you want to include people in your game, and especially if you want us to be able to see them face to face. When really close, these look simply awful. I know that other train sims have horrible characters too, but I would really love to see a sim one day that would make them at least passable. Also, the animation are horrible and they disappear as soon as they enter or exit the train.4. Stability. While more stable than WoS 3, you can still encounter some CTDs, especially when continuing your schedule on the way back. This shouldn't happen so long after the release date.5. While there are many trains travelling in the opposite direction, you don't seem to encounter nearly enough trains going the same way you are. Remember, this is one of the busiest lines in the world. It's supposed to be full of trains.6. Winter. Snow effects are simply awful.7. Some stations are empty for no reason.			"

												Sometimes someone has to just get on a soap box...and tell the developers the TRUTH!Maybe because I love simulators, maybe because I'm a 3D developer/artist myself and I know the challenges of building such a fine symphony of digital subsystems all working together to bring your pc to life. So here it goes:Hell ya! YOU GUYS... TML? GREAT JOB! AWESOME! I haven't even fully dug in and I'm already impressed! Great! Love it! Game install via steam: flawlessWish: Keyboard Reference Card (Or I just haven't found it yet) resorting to writing them down on my own little reference as I don't want to slam people's feet in the doors... ok so what if I do? ... I want the option! Need that keyboard reference! :)Graphics: Beautiful. Another example of a cool developer team giving us way more graphics capability than most even have now - meaning...to me... the game will remain awesome hopefully for generations of new gaming rigs - and performing all the way! Chugs? If so - turn it down - you can graduate to more horsepower later - this program does more than draw - so I expect audio, physics, script engine etc - all add up to clock cycles... like games such as FSX, Xplane, ArmA, Trains: A New Era..... Remember: emulating life is pretty darn complicated. The computer that got us to the moon just calculated a few things - thats it - this stuff is crazy complicated - if people say it's not complicated - everyone does it - they are downplaying what is involved and almost doing a disservice to the developers who actually pull it off! Forget what technologies these folks used... forget the techno everything... and look... just look at this ... Its awesome! bump maps, lighting, shaders, the assets (trains, buildings, signs, cars, people, etc) ... whatever - it looks great!For me its not always the technology - its the graphics as a whole. For example I still think Rule the Rail model train simulator is the best looking and fun train sim I own! Kinda looks like Marvel comics versus real life... and the wild west one (Iron Horses) looks like Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote are going to coming running out a tunnel down the train trAcks leaving a dust trail! In these games, if they made the graphics modern looking it would lose their charm. Alternately - some folks use a great game engine and turn out yuck. So... its an art and a science! Looks good? Works for me!This game has nailed a more serious look, gritty, realistic, yay! Love that Too!Acting: In a train game? YOU WIN! Blazing new trails man! Like Take On Flight did for a helicopter sim, these TML? folks did to a train simulator! Closest yet is Train Sim 2015 Career mode to my knowledge... So BRAVO! I love it! The shots of the women walking by, the sass - lol Makes the Sim the tool and the interactive parts of the game (characters in the game, missions... want more of that!) makes it have more meaning! Love it! I can't wait to get yelled at or something.. derailing/speeding..lol and just trying to see if I can actually NOT get reprimanded as well! It is a sim - I should TRY to do it right.... should is a strong word - You do whatever the heck you feel like here! :DThe Price? Will I get bored?Maybe... its a train thing with me - I go in phases but that's not these folks' fault... If this was only a 3D railway tour of Manhattan I'd still think its great! $40.00 USD is chump change for this kind of work in my opinion. Why? People pay hundreds for Downloadable content for TrainZ...(somtimes over a hundred for one train consist - an engine, a tender and a couple carriages ugh)  What would they pay for this route as an ADD-ON? $40.00 USD? I would - HELL YES (And I don't like to buy anything from that - usually too pricey for what you get but - again if I got this for 40 as a TrainZ Add on (or Train sim 2015 for that matter) - yeah I'd get it!) Anf if some people knew how much work goes into making decent 3D graphics... models, level designers, all forms of 3d art and it takes time to get good results let alone great results!My PC BTW is a Dell I7, ATI 5700 series I think, 8 gig ram, nothing fabulous - but I do thnk you need this as a minimum these days.... need some ram, some cpu, decent gpu :) Before I bought this game I wanted a really good detailed review - and I found many reviews but I was really interested in this game and I just couldn't get enough info... so I grabbed it anyways! (I often buy not even reading reviews so why not!) The run of the mill part of the game? I've played enough to know this simulator seems like it is probably pretty close to real life...im no expert but I'm impressed. But you do just drive and get into a routine - and ...welll that's the job the game simulates. In fact, when you add the fact that it will rate your performance like a high score might work in other games, and the missions that come up that seem to really make things interesting...  Well I'm going to play this out for awhile... and then maybe play the World of Subways 1 - PATH - I tinkered enough to know this game would probably be great like that one is - and I was right! YAY!Great Job TML - Makers of World of Subways 4			"

												Extremely disillusioned with this game. I bought WOS 3 a few months back and fell in love! Amazing simulator, super realistic. When I found out WOS 4 was coming out I HAD to get it. Now that I bought it I extremely regret this purchase. First off, I have a pretty good computer that runs well with almost all of my games (including WOS 3 which worked flawlessly). As soon as I installed WOS 4 it told me that my graphics card was insufficient. When I began playing the game it started lagging like crazy. The people in the game look terrible. TML spent more time trying to design the depot and the cafeteria that they forgot about the actual train driving. There is NO CAB SWAY, the train is stuck to the floor! The train accelerates unrealistically fast and the braking is also very unrealistic. WOS 3 is an amazing sim but WOS 4, complete disaster in my opinion. If I could get a refund, I would.			"

												I've been playing WOS since the 1st installment with the PATH. WOS 4 is a huge improvment from that game, but is a giant step backwards from WOS 2 and 3. WOS 3 is, so far, the pinnacle of the series, probably because they had an actual license from the London Underground. This game however, provides a cheap knockoff of the MTA. It's almost like the developers watched some YouTube videos of the 7 line and built a game around it. They couldn't even settle on a time era. The signs, rolling stock and stations are full of anachronistic items that just don't fit together. The train handles like it's glued to the track and the missions provide unrealistic scenarios that seem really out of place. The only improvement in this game over its predecessors is the addition of Agro mode, which gives you some kind of passenger feedback. It's a bit of a throwback to BVE's happy/angry face system. Unless you're a huge rapid transit game buff, skip this one and go back to WOS 2 or 3. Hopefully TML will get their act together again and give us something astounding (and licensed) for WOS 5.  "

												So they fixed the main problem that this game was having and have added updates so I am switching my review from negative to positive. They added cab sway which gives it more realism, they added more ai trains during rush hour making the game way more active. The missions are nice and add some challange. The trains should have 3 notches on the accelerator not 4. And the sun glare is mixed up. You get glare heading into the city in the morning and glare going to Flushing in the afternoon/evening when it should be the other way around. The sounds are good considering most simulators focus on other details. I like the graphics definatly better then BVE. I now would recommend this game to other simulator fans.			"

												If you like simulations and are not overly fussed on the smallest of details then I recommend this, the trains have a very high level of detail, some minor details wrong/missing, the route is pretty accurate, animated characters are not the worst I've ever seen, but the voice acting is, it's pretty much non-existant, I would give the game a 10/10, but because of minor bugs, some glitches and the voice acting, I can only give it 7/10, I give the trains a 10/10, I absolutely love the R33/R36, beautiful trains, so if you're like me and you only get it for the trains then I highly recommend this.

												This game for me is a tale of two halves, it has its positives but mostly negatives.Positives:Ability to take over services at designated stationsCareer mode-esqueAbility to continue driving the service once the terminus has been reachedSome physicsNegativesWater and leaves coming through the train windows....Sound pack is awful, its the same both inside and out of the trainAwful graphicsInterface is awfulThis is so sad, as many of the features Ihave listed as an issue on this game were dealt with rather well in the London Underground version they made, which is MUCH better.

												The graphics are IN NEED OF UPDATING. The AI people in the depot who share their stories are diverse in missions. Platform people seem to be having trouble entering train. Game playing seems sharp on some curves that even at 19mph it’s too fast. Realistic feeling is good, having to control doors, lights and others from keyboard is a learning curve. Using a gaming laptop without numeric keyboard was a challenge until I just change controls to keys not already in use. No joy stick control available in this game “yet-hint hint”. I know this route; I grew up in NYC and rode the #7 train many times. It brought back many memories. Cab and other views are nice and since I’m using a laptop I had to test graphics setting to suit my playing experience. There was some “stuttering” but I un-ticked the AA box and it ran much smoother for me. The game is, as others have mentioned frame rate intensive. You can set the conductor’s AI if you don’t feel like switching back and forth from drivers to conductors cab. If doing so you have to line up train at platform for doors to open automatically. I have had the game freeze, only to restart by power off/on button. Again, just lowered a setting in graphics. No crash report box appeared then. I did have two other crash issues in which a dialog box popped up where you can add your experience before the crash. Very convenient. Weather is another issue; rain and snow. Snow looks like driving through fog with snowflakes. When things settled down after install, game ran well. I like the interaction. There is room for improvement and I hope they are listening.  "

												As you've probably read in the other reviews this game has some problems. It features door chimes even though the units featured have never had door chimes, its set in the 70s and yet features the 7 line diamond and circle logos which did not exist yet, and it has few glitches (passenger walks into an invisible wall while attempting to board the train) .  The missions aren't very good,  they tried too hard to make a simulator into a game and they are all way too arcadey and the last mission is really out of place and weird giving this game a 12 age rating. There are two exceptions to this though 'Whiteout' (Brad Pommeroy) and Black Ice (Adam Livsey) which I found to both be very good except the time limit on the former is way too short encouraging early departures and recklessness'.Despite this though if you are considering purchasing this I would recommend it. The sound is very well done (although some sounds are reused from WoS3), the graphics are ok, and the world is rendered in typical WoS accurate very high detail with no re-used models or textures (Not sarcasm encase you haven't played WoS). Also as a TML-Studios game you can leave the train and walk around and explore stations and this time the depot.  It's worth noting that TML have fixed many things criticized in other reviews and there is now cab sway for example. But although I would recommend this game I wouldn't recommend paying £26.99 for it that's a ridiculous move by Aerosoft as all new simulators are generally sold for £24.99 at retail (and TS DLC, which is basically what this is, is sold for £24.99 new as well) not only that but it costs less everywhere else in the world (at least £4 cheaper https://steamdb.info/app/343070/). So if you're in the UK I recommend buying it on Amazon where it is cheaper and the DVD activates on Steam plus you get a box, DVD and printed manual. But if you are in the UK I'd recommend WoS 3 (/app/283620).			"

												World of subways 4 Is a great NYC subway line. I do warn you do not play this on a regular laptop as it can get very laggy and/or crash. After I got a new computer, I played it for a while. One thing for aerosoft, It would be nice if the arrival of trains had an announcement. Worth the money if you have a good computer, or gaming laptop.			"

												Let's get this straight. This is an excellent game. I can understand why some don't like it but I personally do. I was a little skeptical before buying it, as I was a little worried about poor FPS that others were experiencing. But it turned out that I didn't have to worry at all, I get great FPS! Every aspect of the game is very authentic. It is most certainly one of the best games in the World of Subways series. It reminds me a bit of the first volume: The Path, as they was also set in New York, The outide graphics are excellent in detail. What more could you want from a subway simulator? The cab graphics and textures are also very good and I love the way that the controls in the cab have an 'old' look with the paint peeling off. A nice touch by the developers. Weather effects are also great. At least the game has a tutorial, unlike some of the other previous volumes. I love the way you can also see the Manhattan skyline in the distance, which I find a very nice touch to the game. Graphics on the track, inside the tunnels and stations are also extremely good, with dynamic passengers on the plaforms as well. Having the choice between local and express services is also a really cool feature, and really adds to the game. I don't understand why people don't like this game. What is there to complain about? I like the fact you can walk around the depot and talk to other colleagues and discuss shifts, etc. You can also be the conductor which I find a nice alternative to the normal driving mode. It's a shame there's not that many view mode choices. For example, I would have liked to have seen an interior (passenger view), as that would have been really cool. Another little bug is with the braking lever. The first three or four notches, seem to do hardly anything and the last three screech the train to a halt, which is a bit wierd, but it's not too much of an issue. One of my favourite aspects of this game is the incredible view distance. You can see for about a mile ahead of the train at once, and from station to station through the distant haze. And it doesn't make any impact on FPS! This is probably one of the best games I have ever played in terms of the view distance from where you are sitting. In most games, it significanly impacts FPS. World of Subways 1 and 2 had poor view distance, so bad that you could see the track loading ahead of you.However, be aware that you will probably require a high end system to run this game, as the graphics are quite demanding on the CPU and graphics card. I had to alter a few settings to to get it to running absolutely perfect, and I'm sure that this will apply to most people as well.I would say that this game is definitely overpriced in terms of the amount of content you get. For example, the line 7 is not that long, and only takes about 35 minutes to drive an all stopper service from end to end. So my advice is to wait for a sale, like I did.			"

												This is just one of those titles where you either love it or hate it. I have a large margin of forgiveness when it comes to this game's gameplay(physics, AI etc) because of the content involved. By saying that you can consider this review biased because I rode the 7 train to school daily growing up, and rode them to and from work for years and miss the Redbirds dearly.Graphics 10/10 - I can concur with the other early reviews and tell you that the scenery is  just perfect. They nailed key locations like Aviation High school, Queens Blvd, Roosevelt Ave, and other spots that would only be recognized by people who ride this line regularly. The stations are modeled perfectly. Some details are a miss, but not everything can be perfect. TML did a great job of getting the feel of the Redbirds. As a child and early teenager, the conductors used to leave the cab door open all the time while driving the train so I would always watch them at the controls. It is safe to say that the cab has been detailed perfectly down to the last detail. It is amazing to finally understand what the conductor was doing all those times I watched him drive the train since now I am sure most of the trains(r160's) are controlled by computer more than actual manual controls and air brakes. I have not gotten into the mission part of the simulator yet since I am still trying to get better control of the train itself, but I understand the complaints about the physics. Sometimes you think there is actual physics working in the back round because when you are going uphill, the train slows down and vice versa on the down hills.  Gameplay 7/10 -For what its worth, its an awesome simulation. Like I said earlier this game gets my vote because 1. Part of the route is modeled after the neighborhood I grew up in/live in 2. It rendered probably the coolest of the MTA NYC subway lines aside from say the F train since you can see so many cool things above ground compared to tunnels. Even the tunnels were kept pretty interesting. I have to say that if they went for complete realism on the tunnels, they would have been more bland. They actually spiced up the tunnels with extra lighting here and there and threw in pipes and stuff I normally don't see since its so dark and dreary in the actual tunnels. Audio 8/10-  The sounds are pretty well done also. the screeching tracks, the train doors and all appropriate sounds are emulated. The only ones I actually noticed were missing were the air brakes releasing the pressure and the announcements for each stop amongst a few others. It still amazes me that I can simulate driving the 7 train.			"

The passanger AI is very bad. Omsi passangers are much more intelligent. Overall its a good game and everyone who likes to drive overground a metro is right here. Because I love tunnels and London my opinion isWorld of Subways 4 is good, World of Subways 3 is better.			"

												I really enjoy playing this game.  It is actually a very good design and allows for you to really get into it.  If you're a fan of simulated train operation, this is the game for you.  In particular, I like the NY games because the trains are much easier to operate that other systems.  It takes little to no learning curve to play this version.      My hope is that they will release another modern day swubway simulator.  In particular, I'd like to see Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, and Los Angeles.  Perhaps also a partnership with Walt Disney World and add in the Disney Monorail from Orlando, FL.			"

												Just purchased. Running Windows 10 with an AMD Radeon 6700 graphics card. AMD Quad Core, 6GB DDR3 w/ 1TB Hard Drive. Quality is very poor. Like watching a clamation video.  Not the computer because I also play Flight Simulator X which is a very high resource demanding game. Any suggestions on how to improve image refresh rate?			"

												~Passable, so far but still needs major improvement, I have hope~With patches I think this game can be made much better but I have some major issues with it. The first is that upon setting everything on high I noticed major slow downs, at first I thought maybe my hardware was just that inadaquate for the game but then i noticed other people with high end pc's were having the same issues (which actually gave me a slight sigh of relief). Another thing i noticed was that the trailer and screenshots for the game gave off the impression that the graphics were going to be very very advanced but upon starting the game after cranking everything up, things looked still quite medicore and rather dissapointing, coupled with the poor preformance is a not very flattering first impression. The gameplay is well, only decent, Ive never operated a Redbird so the Physics to me were fine. They didnt seem difficult or unrealistic but what was clunky were the controls which wasn't the most enjoyable experience. Unless you are super human you wont know the controls right off the bat bc there are a lot and it will take practice to remember them all and remember what belongs to what. I also didnt like how the train sort of ""jerked"" around the curved sections of track, that didnt seem to be a problem at all in WOS 3, what on earth happened, infact WOS3 graphicly looks almost the same (Not saying it looked bad by any stretch) but it ran so much better than this, and the gameplay was so much more enjoyable. I was expecting to get WOS 3 preformace and gameplay fused into this new experince with the 7 line and the graphics as advertised in the trailers and screenshots but what i got was a rather slow, not so attarctive, cluncky controlled, mediocre mess. A dissapointment, certainly, lost cause, probabaly not. I think that once TML sees all the bugs and complaints maybe the will grace us with a patch so that it atleast runs right. As far as the route and trains, they look great, im not from the area per say but as people who grew up riding the Fulshing line during the Redbird era they will tell you things are pretty damn spot on. Im left rather empty and dissapointed, fun game, and ill continue to play with my GPU settings and in game settings to see what i can do to get it running right but the bar was set really high and it really didnt meet anything near my expectations.

												Im not a nay-sayer when it comes to simulation games. I adore all things both crappy and great when it comes to quality in simulation games. But with World of Subways, it veered straight off a cliff down into a lava pit called ""Trying to Hard"". While certainly a well thought out game with some decent details and simulation quality, the finer details are where this game lost out hugely. The campaign mode and walk around offices of an 80's NYCTA operations office are one which are so buggy and sometimes confusing, you would expect a map or something. Conversations are awkward and poorly paced, knowing what you needed to do and just free play are things which are hidden very well in the robotic glitchy AIs that make your aquantiance. For the gameplay, actual driving, it is the same as any other World of Subways games... Way to many controls for way to many steps. Expect to make a lot of cheat sheets to play with this game. If you are able to remember the controls by heart, like I can the important ones, good on ya. But Ill tell you what, I know I was constantly flicking through hastly written notes looking what steps I had to preform to open and close doors!The train driving is also very odd. Unlike the real subways I know being the Elevated in Chicago and the NYCTA in New York, the trains are like playing with a model train set with a lot of optional features. IE: Trains can be screeched to a halt from 30 MPH in less then 100 feet. DOesn't matter if you need too, you get really no serious repercussions doing it (Unless playing on ""aggro mode""). People just bik at you once and a while and say ""You should do better!"". World of Subways 4 is what I saw World of Subways 2 to be, an odd step in a different direction for this series. Also, lets skip the Taking of Pelham 123 mission please, just one way to smack us true railroad simulation (and real railroad people, for those of us one in the same) across the face with silly no-realism missions. While yes, this game does have some interesting ideas, they are done by not-so-professional grade people and companies. Or perhaps this was such a side item game vs normal development for other games that it never got the true work/QA it really needed to be a great game. Which is why, if you want a good game in this series, I would strongly recommend World of Subways 3 and wait to see what 5 will come with.			"

												Like all the others, I was expecting a good driving experience on line 7 of NYC, more than 3 WOS London .... but .... I state that I have a powerful PC on which work properly WOS1; 2; 3 Trainz Simulator and TS2015 !!! From videos posted to advertise WOS4 seemed to have spectacular graphics and effects worthy of reality, with new interactive features (dialogues missions etc ..) The reality however is different .... The game during gameplay presents many problems that make it difficult and nervous to handle. The graphics are nice, but not amazing (nothing better than TS2015 and much lower than the masterpiece in London WOS3). Many difficulties in managing mouse that works sometimes and you have to click several times to activate the functions. Rain, snow and storm have a graphic scenarios seem heavy to handle and everything is not absolutely smooth, even with the graphics settings to the minimum you have problems .... The train controls are perhaps too many to remember, acceleration and Braking is difficult to manage because it does not respond immediately to the command, also if you travel at high speed and brakes 100% the train stops immediately (in reality could not be so, does not seem to respect the rules of the weights and physics even in climbs and down the train speed does not change !!!) The people crowding the stations seem zombies who wander without a destination .... The signs and traffic lights seem crazy and do not give the right braking distance (a green traffic light and after a few meters here is a red light!) The judgment for the part Playing on the activity is so low! is also shocking part of the activities that take place within the depot NYC ... The dialogues are not fluid and synchronized with the face of the various characters ... There is a map of the offices and do not understand where to go, Also here all seem zombies, the rooms are cold and lifeless, you lose a lot of time to start a game ..... I think that developers would do better to develop a second line on the basis of WOS3 London avoiding interaction at depot and unnecessary nonsense that make it a product in half (in Italy they say ""is not meat nor fish"") ... I hope someone intervenes in order to improve it, when my judgment is very bad .... I hope that the next WOS5 is the CENTRAL LINE LONDON designed as WOS3 least in terms of graphics and activities .... Last thing ... if you want to ride the subway in NYC you should buy WOS1 ... it's more fun and less stressful than this lousy product!			"

												I had really high hopes for this game. I loved the MTA back then and since no other Steam game made a New York Subway game, I was excited for this game. At first the price was insane, $34.99. I waited till the Summer Sale 2015 and I bought it for $23.44. I got the game and when I clicked new game, the game crashed. I then got a new graphics card (NVIDIA Geforce GT 610) and the game started but, the frame rate was extremely low. I had TF2 and Gmod on my PC and they worked decently but this didnt. To all of you, please dont waste your money on this game.			"

												What a major disappointment, I really wish I'd waited for the reviews of the game but purchased on release day after following all the hype. Is there any way of requesting a refund seriously? Because this is the worse money I've ever spent on a game. It offers nothing in terms of simulating the experience of driving a train and just offers a dull lifeless experience. The depot element is a complete joke, populated by what appears to be walking dead androids. I could ignore that if the train driving simulation was interesting but it’s not. One example of many is the braking; it’s so flawed the initial brake steps does nothing then increasing the braking the train stops as if it hit a brick wall, totally ridiculous. The London simulator WOS3 really had some atmosphere of the area and the line but seriously this comes nowhere near WOS3, it really is shockingly bad. Steam give me an option to return a game for a refund you should not allow loyal customers to pay for awful games like this without the option for return.			"

												Well this game is... complicated.With WOS3 (London Underground) it is pretty simple just click a few leavers infront of you and you are moving, but no, this game there is so many buttons, really confusing they are not labled. The game however has pretty good frame rate but I can see why people are complaining about that, the grahpics are not too good but for some reason uses alot of FPS.I would say to look up videos before buying the game, however they do not show how bad it actually is. Buy at your OWN risk!			"

												Currently I cannot recommend this game, for one major reason: the performance is terrible. I have a pretty decent computer with lots of space and plenty of RAM, and have a number of simulation games, including Euro Truck Simulator 2, Euro Ship Simulator, OMSI 2, Trainz: A New Era, Train Simulator 2015 and the first three volumes of World of Subways. All of them run brilliantly on my computer. But WOS 4 has very choppy and jerky graphics. Worse still, the mouse is barely responsive on it. It is a great struggle to move it onto the menu items, and when you do finally get there, you have to click about five times before you finally get a response. However it appears that my problems have to do with my graphics card. The system requirements don't tell you how big your graphics card should be, but apparently it is meant to be 1024MB. My card - an AMD Radeon HD 8570D - is 790MB, supposedly. That's more than good enough to run the games I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but not this game. If you're experiencing similar problems with the game to what I am, then the size of your graphics card is most likely the reason.Another complaint I had about the game is that if you failed an exercise in one of the tutorials, the game takes you right back to the beginning of the tutorial rather than to the beginning of the exercise. However, this bug appears to have been fixed in the latest update (1.2), so my thanks to the developers for that.All in all, these problems make the game more aggravating than fun right now. I like the new ideas of the game, but they're no use if the game's performance is inadequate. Some sort of warning should be added that the game may not play well if your graphics card is not big enough. Until a patch can be made that is more compatible with smaller graphics cards, or if you just don't want the hassle of upgrading your graphics card, it is not really worth forking out the considerable sum of money being charged for this game.
