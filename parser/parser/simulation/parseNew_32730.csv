												Great game but doesn't work at all on Windows 7 64 bit, which is a bit of a problem if you want to play it. If you want another useless icon on your desktop though, it's a great purchase.			"

												This game is basically a remake of F-22 Lightning 2. It was released in 1999, so the graphics are obviously low quality compared to new titles, but they are on-par with other flight simulation games at that time. As far as flight simulators go, this game is more action oriented than the true-to-life flight dynamics one might find in X-Plane or Microsoft Flight Simulator.The first several Quick Missions work you through a tutorial on the game basics and the last training mission is a full combat mission test. The Quick Missions also have a large and variable assortment of non-arc combat missions to help hone your skills for campaign mode.The campaign mode has a large number of single player missions. You work you way through various deployment campaigns and the mission situations build-up to a finale mission for each campaign (typically culminating to a nuclear strike or combination bombing/multiple enemy squadron mission). It also tracks your stats and has a scoring and flight rank promotion system based on your mission performance. Each finished campaign rewards a medal to the pilot as well.There is multiplayer available, but only through a community-based mod. The game originally shipped with built-in multiplayer, but since this game is nearly 15 years old, the built-in, Novalogic-based multiplayer system no longer functions.My biggest complaint is the default keyboard map is not very intuitive and the tutorial could be more in-depth. Despite the game's age, my Saitek X-52 joystick and throttle work fine with no modifications (all basic flight controls work, including firing active weapon, rudder, and throttle functionality).If you are feeling nostalgic and enjoy flight simulators or air combat games, this one still has depth and fun available after 15 years. Despite another reviewer's issues, I have had zero crashes while doing anything in this game and have not had to modify any game files for it to function properly (I'm in 64-bit Windows 7 with a DX11 GPU and Core i7 CPU).

Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Pratt & Whitney proudly present, the F-22 Raptor Air Superiority Fighter! Incorporating cutting edge avionics, weapon systems and stealth technology, the F-22 promises to be the air dominance fighter for the 21st century. The Westinghouse AN/APG-77 radar with it's one hundred-twenty degree field of view enables the Raptor to acquire and track multiple targets beyond visual range. It's on-board computer system can identify and classify targets at a rate of seven hundred million instructions per second, the equivalent of four super computers.Providing power for the F-22 are two Pratt & Whitney F119 turbofan engines. Rated at thirty-five thousand pounds of thrust each, the engines allow the Raptor to supercruise at MACH 1.58 without the use of afterburners, greatly reducing the F-22's heat signature. The F119's engines also feature a two-dimensional thrust vectoring system giving the Raptor superior agility in combat.In it's air superiority role, the Raptor carries two AIM-9X SIDEWINDER's and six AIM-120C AMRAAM's. For deep strike missions, four AMRAAM's can be replaced with two one thousand pound Joint Direct Attack Munitions. The JDAM is a GPS guided ""smart bomb"" which can strike at target without active lasing allowing the F-22 to remain undetected.Designed with stealth as a primary goal, the F-22's titanium and composit superstructure is both lightweight and strong. With the addition of radar absorbing materials, the frontal radar cross section is over one hundred times smaller than on the F-15C.The rules of war have changed, the battles of tomorrow will be won not by those with the largest armies, but by those who can attack without being seen. The only armor will be the cloak of invisibility. Achieving air superiority will be the task of the only aircraft capable of striking at the heart of the enemy. It is a warplane light years ahead in it's design, a supersonic killing machine.The F-22 RAPTOR!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -NOVALOGIC is a war game making machine and a decent one, I might add. I am the owner of  their many titles, and I can tell you right now what you're getting for your buck. Novalogic's games usually follow the same code in terms of quality. You get a game that is a military simulator in lighter category, but it still contains balance of realism and fun at the same time. Simplified, but well made and written voice-over tutorials to help all new players settling in fast. Sometimes you get those small showcases with short educational facts which I personally think back at the time was awesome. So, whether you are a hardcore simulator freak or more of a casual pilot, please continue reading this last bit.I consider myself as a space and aviation enthusiast. I'm no Ace, but I have a lot of understanding and ability to comprehend how things work in real life. Nothing is more rewarding than using your own experience to figure out things on your own in a professional simulator. This has inspired me since I was a kid. The F-22 Lightning 3 however does not come close to a hardcore flight simulator, but it's not even trying to. In fact I find this game to be very enjoyable despite it's easy flight modeling and entertaining realism. After all they say the F-22 uses a lot of computer assistance to make flying and the use of instruments fast and easy to manage, so I give it the benefit of the doubt because of 'Murica. If you want to fly a straight line, you can probably do it without a sweat, because this bird is rock solid and holds the AoA even if you go grab something cold in the meantime. If you actually manage to stall the plane and crash, you deserve a medal, because those twin two-dimensional Pratt & Whitney's will not make it an easy task. Even with the ""fun option"" of a full external loadout of AMRAAM's and Fuel Tanks, side bays with SIDEWINDER's and internals carrying a thermonuclear bomb, the F-22 will fly a straight line. If a simulator is done properly, the payload will affect your flight characteristics and fuel usage tremendously. The F-22 Lightning 3 does not model this and just flies over that aspect. In a realistic flight simulator (DCS for example) depending on the load you carry, a lot of warplanes require constant manual rudder and pitch adjusting in order to maintain level flight.Now it's time for your tour of duty. Your campaign tour in F-22 Lightning 3 will consist of 6 campaigns over 46 missions. All these missions are scripted, but there's a nice variety of all sort of interception type of missions including air, land and sea. During your campaign you will learn how to use the F-22 effectively and deadly. You'll be flying it into the heart of the enemy and delivering your message before the enemy even realizes you were there. Some of the missions are pretty straightforward and even easy I'd say, but some are hard as nails. Most of the time you know what to do immediately, but some of those escort missions... Like god damn. Seriously. It's not an easy task to protect your mission target when you're approaching the battlefield from a bad angle and your missiles cannot hit the enemy. I wouldn't say it's unfair mission design. The problem is the missile trajectories, they're all wrong. Instead of guidance and at least a bit of prediction where the target could be heading, they attempt to aim directly on the target itself like a beam trail. Getting used to how the funny and a bit of cheating AI works and your missiles to have a good hit success is required. Also cooperation with your wingman is vital. Fear not though, you will always have the advantage over the enemy because of your advanced avionics, stealth and long range missiles. It just takes some practice, that's all.Graphics ain't great, but they're tolerable. The sounds ain't anything special, but the ATC / radio voice-overs with all their jokes adds a lot of fun drama to the missions.When it comes to dedication and maintaining some standard, I think Novalogic does it's job well. Despite the game's small bugs, it's still a very rewarding and entertaining game to play. If you always wanted to pilot an F-22, and you don't want to spend weeks of learning the controls, this is the game for you to start with.			"

												Always Loved Novalogics fighter games. It does seem a shame that games like this are not being made anymore. The worst example is as a Star Wars fan I loved the X-Wing series, XWA was made over a decade ago now and no signs of another fighter sim to come. Seems the same with novalogic and jet fighter games too :(			"

												The game has a serious bug: If you destroyed all enemy radars and missile launchers in every mission of final campaign, then you can't complete the final mission because you can't receive the voice authorization of release the nuclear weapon. So you must just achieve the mission's goals to avoid this trap.On the other side, even if you had completed the final mission, your character's status was still ""Active"", not ""Retired"". That means: You will never complete the game!			"

TIP - For those who are experiencing issues with the game , run the game with Windows XP S3 compatibility mode for issue-free game play . * Also if you want to run the game with HD resolution and slightly better graphics download Nglide Configurator from  Website link [www.zeussoftware.com]REVIEW - This game brings back soo many memories of my childhood , this the first aerial warfare simulator i have ever played and even to this day  the Novalogic  aerial combat simulators are still my favorite . Most Arial combat simulators today lack in depth detail and realistic qualities , games  of this genre could learn a thing or two  from the Novalogic Flight simulator   series  , back in the day this game was a huge step ahead in its genre and it stood the test of time and its still a high quality classic today . You have the choice to do things such as  customize your weapon loadout ,  plan navagation routes , customize auto-pilot settings and even order your wingman to do a varity of things / Also worth mentioning is the  game also comes with a mission editor , if you desire to add something new to your gameplay   . The game  has a very good balance of authenticity and realism yet   including some arcade style elements ,when it comes to the campain its long ,  and with the amount of quick missions provide for continouus gameplay with a good amount of replay value oh did i meantion you can also drop nukes ?  Muliplayer VERY RARELY has any players , with decent server connection quality even though this game is nearly 18 years old  , its enjoyable and its the best game of the entire f-22 series  . Overall this and the F-16 and the MIG- 29 games are a must have for any flight sim or Arial warfare buffs  , do pick up the series during any sale  and enjoy this amazing classic.  "

												I've been ragging on the game Vector Thrust and comparing it to this game in past.  Well I decided to bite the bullet and play(buy) this game again on my Windows 7 game playing 1024x768 resolution.  Well I got an education with a flight Arcade that is over 15 years old.  Here is my conclusions.  Vector Thrust is worst than I thought.  It suck not only Bad,  but really bad.... I mean Really Really Really Sucks.  What a piece ..... (well Steam has warned me to be nice - So I will and not finish that last comment)Yeah I know the graphics for this game are dated.  But this ""Arcade"" game is so Far Superior, It Glides, Its Smooth, Its Intuitive,  and it D@mn fun (Assuming you can get it to run)...  For me I had to mess with the L3.ini (just a liitle)  in order to get it to play.  Configuring via the in-game option menu cause my game to freeze (i7, Windows 7, NVidia GTX 550 ti ).

												This one is diferent from the F-16 and mig-29 games. This one is harder to dogfight, if not impossible to do so. Control become really nice but now it's harder to dogfight. Graphics improved too, as you can see right from the first mission. But the F-22 become more a fire missile only, because using the cannon is hard and there's no board computer like the F-16 has.Anyway, was fun being mad. This game is hard as hell...			"

												 have really enjoyed this game. While the graphic are not up to the standard of FS2004, there are lots of mission options and even my five year old son can navigate his way around. The program has never crashed while in a mission, but some features are not very realistic eg it doesn't matter what altitude you are at you will find the target. The only thing that I have struggled with is learning the finer points of air combat, which the manual does not really help you with.			"

												Much like the F-16 Multirole Fighter, F-22 Lightning 3 puts me off in the graphical department. The controls aren't intuitive as much as F-16. No tutorial / training mode can be found in the game! Like F-16, this game do support the XBOX 360 gamepad to a point but you would be better of playing this game with Keyboard though. The gameplay is slow and bland/boring. The audio (sound/music) aren't that great either. Also, don't seek out this game for the multiplayer as it is quite dead! Maybe you could play in LAN but I haven't nor I am willing to give it a shot! Did this game improved at all from F-16 Multirole Fighter? Barely! The visuals are a tad better but that would be all.PROS:+Works on modern computers (although it kept crashing until I ran the game in Windows XP compatibility). Also, XBOX 360 gamepad is supported, but barely, like F-16.+Improved visuals from F-16.+Simulation seems adequate from what I played, cockpit is well modelized.CONS:-Dated visuals, graphics compared to modern gaming.-Game doesn't completely support full screen as you see the window.-Controls aren't very intuitive. Same controls as F-16.-No tutorial / training mode so you are left out figuring the controls for yourself.-Boring gameplay.-Poor audio (sounds and music).-While in-game, can't access the options menu nor view/edit the controls which that is quite unacceptable in my book.-Dead Multiplayer (to be expected though).OVERALL:Well, barely any improvement from F-16 and well, I would only advise you modern games instead. I'm not sure how this game did back in 1999 but now in 2014, I prefer investing time on more modern games, as should you!RECOMMENDATION:I would recommend F-22 Lightning 3 to flight simulation purists and gamers that dig old school gaming only. But in my book, you should stay away and look into modern games instead!Also, since you cannot buy a single Novalogic classic and ""forced"" to buy the Novalogic Classics Volume One: Machines of War package, you better think twice before investing in this as I only found one game worth of purchase, Commanche 4. If you can find this package on a very good and drastic deal, give it a shot. Better, look somewhere else if you can buy a single game at a time.RATING:3.0 / 10			"

												A good game, but there are a few significant problems, that affects the fun heavily.I think some people will get frustated of the enemy missiles, but after little bit exersice it is possible, just fly fast to an other direction and use your countermeasures in the last few seconds before the impact.This game was released in 1999, so I will not complain about the graphics or sound (which is actually still enjoyable).What I want to talk about is the wingman controlling:The wingman is behaving like a little child, you must always have an eye on him and tell him exactly what he has to do.He gets often in the ""hunted position"" in a 1v1 dogfight and therefor you must help him out or he will get shot down. Sometimes he also do not want to shoot, although he is in a good firing position. Something what happens seldom, but really sad and funny at the same time is, that your wingman is flying circles with his dog--fight-contrahent, where no one wins, because they cannot hit eachother . This is maybe of tolerable, because you just have to carry him ""little bit"". The main problem is, the wingman-order-system itself!I still do not understand why there is not always an ""engage enemy""-order instead of ""attack my target""?! You must aim to the enemy plane, you want your wingman to destroy and THAN order it. Why can I not attack an enemy ship and tell my wingman by the way to attack (for example) the MIG-29 Charlie 2 (that keeps spamming missiles towards me)? This is 1000x easier than seeking for the enemy between tons of other planes and ground targets.I am also wondering if the enemy planes have infinte ammo or if they just shoot anything they have to me.All in all this is game ok, you can enjoy. I had some good experiences, for example how fun it is to attack an enemy base or protect some friendlies or to dodge enemy missiles, outflank them and finally shoot multiple planes in the same time.And yes, I think I can recommend this game, if you like military flight games, although there are some problems, which Novalogic could avoid, but this game is fun. You must be ready to practise to fly the F22 here, it is not like the recent Battlefield series.			"
