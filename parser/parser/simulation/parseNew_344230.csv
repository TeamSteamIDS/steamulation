												I was liking the Pixel Puzzles series until this one, where they decided to make the game difficult to interact with in pointless ways. As you can see from the featured screenshots, the background you have to do your puzzles against is just a mess of random lines.  If you have ever wondered why people don't choose to do their jigsaw puzzles on a paisley tablecloth or their clan tartan, then here is your answer.As you can also see from the screenshots, the UI buttons float in the water with the puzzle pieces, making it harder to pick the pieces up.The crabs... the crabs that run out from under the pieces are simply a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Add in the fuzzy, low-res, and rather boring pictures of birds, and it starts to look like the features screenshots on the store page are not so much an enticement to play the game, but a dire prophecy, foretelling the horrors that await within.It's not a bad thing to mix things up a bit, and make some changes to sequel games to keep them fresh, but every change they made to the series with this game has been for the worse, and that is what I find most puzzling of all.

												I liked Pixel Puzzle Japan the best. The koi were a little annoying but you could stuff one in the spout and end the annoyance.  I played the Zombies butI didn't much care for the timetrials of that one.  This one, the crabs.  They are so annoying, as are the floating button buoys.  The crab collecting is part of the game (crabs = hint currency), but still annoying.  The rotation of the pieces isn't intuitive (the instructions aren't clear you hold both mouse buttons) at first, but the mechanic is a nice twist on the series.I got it for 66% off in the Steam Summer sale and I think US$3.39. If you can find it for less, then even better, but 50% off or better it is a thumbs up (US$5 or less).			"

												 Pixels Puzzle 2 : BirdsWell the game is self explanatory . Just like in the traditional board game , you try to fit the jigsaw pieces to form a picture. In this case pictures of various birds, e.g. penguins , ducks , and so on .The jigsaws are all scattered and you have to rotate them most of the times to fit . Graphics : 7/10 Well to rate this game for graphics wouldn't be fair . It can't be compared to games like Call of Duty graphics wise . But still for the genre it is in , it's okay.Music :  7/10 Okay , don't expect it to be spectacular . Music/Sound consists mostly of relaxing birds singing and nature sounds. Quite fitting.  I personally like to turn the sound & music down and listen to 80’s radio streams online ^^ . Gameplay 7/10 Just like a jigsaw, that it is on your PC . It supports Steam Cloud , has various Steam Achievements and Trading Cards . I thought it was quite refreshing to finally have a puzzle game on PC . I had a lot of fun playing it and even though the very first puzzles were not that hard, the final puzzles with 200 Pieces and up were quite tricky .The rotating of the jigsaw pieces made things more difficult than in Pixel Puzzle Japan , which I thought was a tad too easy .Synopsis Ideal game for all casual gamers , Grown ups and kids (8 years and up ) "

												This is the fourth Pixel Puzzles game I've played, and the only one so far that I would not recommend.  I love puzzles, both physical and digital, and I finished every puzzle in this game, but there were so many built-in and unnecessary annoyances that I couldn't recommend it to anyone else.First and most importantly, someone had the idea to make the background patterned.  I'm sure they meant well, but building a patterned puzzle on a patterned backdrop is extremely difficult, especially with the larger puzzles that have smaller pieces.  With some, seeing the edges was nearly impossible, even with changing the color of the patterned backdrop.  Without being able to make out the shape of the edges, adding pieces became a sort of ""trial-and-error"" of dropping every somewhat-matching piece into the spot and hoping one will fit.  There is, as far as I could see, no way to get a nice solid background to work with, only color-changes of the pattern; this can help but doesn't solve the problem.  To me, this is a game-ruining design flaw.The hint system isn't awful but it adds another layer of annoyance.  The crabs you have to gather to ""spend"" on hints spawn directly under your cursor.  If you're trying to work in an area, you have to drop the piece you're working on to move the damned crab out of the way.  If by some chance the crab spawns where you have a few pieces piled up, you have to move every piece before you can grab the crab.  If you have a LOT of pieces piled up (i.e. if you're sorting them), it can take forever to get everything moved so you can get the crab moved.  Not game breaking, but very annoying.The other problem I had with it was purely aesthetic.  Birds aren't the most interesting thing to me, but I was expecting bright birds with pretty plumage, tropical birds and pea♥♥♥♥♥, things that are pretty and make great puzzles.  Instead, you get a lot of penguins, ducks, and raptors, and very few were bright and engaging.  The end result for me personally was boredom.  By the final, largest puzzle, I was sick of brown birds, brown ducks, and hundreds of penguins.  So I opened the last puzzle to fiinish this game off, and there were more penguins (I shook my head with a sigh and sallied forth anyway).  There was some variety in the pictures, but even the variety was dull.  Now, this is a personal preference so others might not agree here, but it was my personal opinion on it.So after 20+ hours playing the game and finishing every puzzle for the sake of my own achievement-seeking OCD, I just can't recommend it to anyone else unless the poor background and annoying hint system aren't likely to bother you.

												I am extremely disappointed in this version of pixel puzzles.  I played Pixel Puzzles: Japan and thoroughly enjoyed it (outside of not being able to easily click the piece you wanted).  Seems they fixed that with ""Birds"", but the background is so horrible I cannot see the pictures.  In the pond area where the pieces are floating, there are 6 buttons floating around getting in your way of seeing the pieces plus one ginormous fishing net where you are supposed to drop  crabs - that are annoying and run all over your puzzle building space.  When you fill up the net, you are supposed to get an award, but they don't seem to work and the crabs have now completely obscured the puzzle pieces floating ""below"" the net.  It is hard enough locating the pieces you need, because they are all mostly blue and they are ""under"" the water, altering their color slightly, so it is hard to pick the piece you want.  There is an option to put a little staging bar at the bottom where you can store pieces, but that also has a craggly, rippled background (as does the building area) which really plays havoc with your eyes.  Also, when you put that little staging area there, the pieces floating above the building area are hidden from view.  You have to take that away to ""find"" them again.  I tried to take a screenshot of what I am talking about, using the F12 key, but that too seems to be broken.  I am so annoyed that I purchased this.  It is not fun at all; It is not relaxing at all, and I do not want to play it at all.  Boo - hiss devs.  Took something great and made it something I'm sorry I purchased.			"

												if you like jigsaw puzzles you will love this game for sure.i enjoyed all 3 Pixel Puzzles games that they released so far, this one has added the rotation feature ( you have to rotate the piece to figure how and where it should be placed) which made the game harder and it will take more time to solve the puzzles, i really recommend them all to any jigsaw puzzles fan.i would suggest Putting your own music while playing.

												A significant step down from their previous puzzles.  The ""Minigame"" that takes place during the puzzle is now much more of an annoyance, asking the player to pause the puzzle 8-10 times per minute to get the annoying crabs off the screen.In addition, the pictures selected for the jigsaws are noticably mediocre.  Some have well definded sections, large, but easy enough, but a LARGE portion of the puzzles are unnecessarily difficult.  Many puzzles have a bird in focus in the foreground, but with the entire background out of focus.  Others (like the 1st large penguin puzzle) has an inordinate amount of extremely similar small figures on a nondescript background. Have you ever done a jigsaw of a Jackson Pollack painting?  That's what a lot of this f**king game is...			"

""Birds and Crabs""PixelPuzzles2: Birds is another game from the PixelPuzzles series. It's still a nice and entertaining jigsaw puzzle game. But typical for PixelPuzzles 2 it has become a little bit harder. Puzzle pieces can be rotated into four directions. So more possibilities to do it wrong. Thankfully there's a built-in help function. Collect crabs into a fishnet bar on the right side.They appear randomly between the puzzles pieces on the playfield. Unfortunately for puzzling the playfield is not very decent. Tough you can change the color but the stone bumb map still remains. The bird pictures are also pretty much one sided like many penguins and shore birds.			"

												Pro and Cons at the end for those of you who don't like readingAhh, another serving of Decaying Logic's Pixel Puzzles.  This is my second review of a Pixel Puzzles game, my first one being Pixel Puzzles: Japan.  I had to give that one a thumbs down due to some glaring issues within the game but with this version I was pleasantly surprised.  So, if you love jigsaw puzzles then sit back and I'll tell you a story about how Decaying Logic isn't living up to their name but perhaps should learn what their publisher’s name, KISS Ltd, stands for......First let me begin by saying perhaps I was a bit harder judging on this one.  I went in looking for mistakes, expecting them, wanting to find some.  To my surprise there are very few and this tells me that perhaps Decaying Logic is listening to their fans and that makes me take notice.  When you find a developer that cares about what their fans think and makes honest attempts to make their games better you'd better keep an eye on them because they will be going somewhere soon.The first thing you should know if you've never played any of their other puzzle games is that the pictures in this one are as good as you get with any jigsaw puzzles.  There's actually quite a few more offering within this one than in Japan as well.  All the pictures in this one fit the ""bird"" theme so if you’re not a fan of birds I suppose it could be off putting but I'm not going to knock the game for that.  The pictures give you quite a bit of challenge in terms of matching up pieces by color but it's not entirely impossible.  It gives you a good sense of working a physical jigsaw puzzle on the tabletop.Again in this version the pieces are cut in ways you could never truly cut a physical jigsaw puzzle so that added challenge is left intact which I enjoy.  Many of the cuts in this one match the bird theme as well with birds and fish around the edges of the pieces.  These funky piece cuttings can raise the difficulty of solving the puzzle up to some frustrating levels but overall I feel it's a positive.  Some of us enjoy great challenges.The pieces still once again ""swim"" in a pond around the main puzzle.  This is an innovative and interesting way to present the pieces and probably gives you the best representation of ""shaking the puzzle box"" as you will ever find.So far the game sounds the same as the last, my review does as well.  So where did they get things right??  I'm about to jump right into that lake of beauty..  For starters there is now an auto save feature!!  It will save all pieces placed correctly on the puzzle if you turn the game off or even if you start another puzzle and come back to that one later.  This feature alone is enough to bring this review to a YES but wait, there's more..The puzzle pieces now float around the whole puzzle, giving them more room to spread out so you can hunt for that one piece you know you need easier.  This plus a seemingly better piece selection tool has practically removed the old issue with needing to click through millions of pieces to get the one you want.  The puzzle area is smaller now but to make up for this there is a zoom tool that will enlarge the puzzle to your full screen and still let you move around pieces you have deposited up there.  They also added an option to open up a bottom ""sorting area"" that runs along the bottom of the screen where you can put pieces you find that you know go somewhere but haven't figured out yet.  And finally you can now rotate the pieces.  That's right, just because you pull em out of the water doesn't mean that's the direction they go.  Just one more thing added that makes this feel like a real table top puzzle.So far they've fixed many of the problems that the previous puzzle games had and even added a few fan requested features.  This certainly makes the game much more playable and enjoyable and gives it a much deserved ""yes"" rating.  However, as much as Decaying Logic went against their namesake and actually improved their game, there's still room for them to improve and learn that KISS (name of their publisher) stands for ""Keep It Simple Stupid.""So where are the flaws??  First off the pieces now actually look like they are under water.  It's a neat effect but it discolors the pieces and makes it harder to pick them based on color matching.  It's not game breaking but I now find myself picking up a piece and having to hope that it's a match for the color I'm looking for.  Might have just been easier to keep those pieces floating on the surface the way they were in the previous games.Second flaw is that they've now got the controls floating around in the water with the pieces and they get a little annoying.  First off they get in the way of piece selection and second off they are subject to being missed when I try to click them and I pick up a piece instead.  Once again, not super game breaking since there's hot keys but perhaps just grouping them into the bottom or top corner, or better yet, having them slide out when the ESC key or another key is hit would have been better.So at the end of the day is this version of Pixel Puzzles better than the last??  The answer is a resounding YES.  This is the one I would recommend to my friends.  This is the one that gives us features we needed in the other ones.  This is the ones that prove Decaying Logic listens to their fans.  I'm a fan now.  Can't wait to see what the future has in store for us with this line......  Now if we could only convince them to do one that can have fan made workshop puzzles.......Pros:+Good picture selection gives good challenging puzzles+Interesting piece cut-outs+Improved piece floating and selection+Rotating Pieces+Mid-puzzle save feature+Optional sorting area+Innovative ""hint"" system that gives you options+More puzzles than ever beforeCons:-Nothing but bird pictures-Colors on pieces are altered while ""in"" the water, making it harder to select pieces based on color-In-Game Menu buttons float around with the pieces and are sometimes difficult to hit without picking up a piece			"

												Pixel Puzzle franchise. Recommended for those who literally like to put puzzles together, and I do mean piece by piece. Pixel Puzzles 2: BirdsFeatures birds, of course, all kinds, everywhere - fenceposts to snow covered areas, big, small, entire colonies.  There is even an introduction puzzle found on the main screen.  25 puzzles in all ranging from 60 pieces to 350 pieces, with some odd shaped and bird themed puzzle pieces.  All the puzzles can be seen in the picture gallery once the puzzle is solved.  The game grid is more or less choose your path around the grid.Puzzles: 60 piece - 6, 112 piece - 6, 153 piece- 4, 220 piece - 6, and 350 piece - 1.The game board is surrounded by water where the puzzle pieces float and MOVE.  The pieces also must be rotated to gain the correct orientation (like in a physical puzzle.)  Fortunately there is an option for the player to choose the correct orientation permenantly (or until such time as the player chooses to turn it off).  I recommend having this feature on for the 220 piece and 350 piece puzzles due to the size of the pieces.Best feature of this game: Crabs.  Now, now no laughing.  These helpful crustaceans can be picked off the puzzle board and put in a net.  When the player has collected enough a hint can be used.  ""G"" stands for ""ghost"" (cost 5 crabs).  This power-up shows the puzzle picture for approximately 10 seconds.  ""Ctrl"" (10 crabs) will cause that puzzle to have the correct orientation (unless the player rotates the piece).  ""space bar"" This helpful power up (20 crabs) shows exactly where that piece belongs in the puzzle, edge or middle.  Other functions: ""T"" make a tray to hold the pieces, ""S"" shuffle the pieces. ""Z"" zoom in on the puzzle board.  ""C"" change the puzzle board's background color.   There 33 achievements including ones like 'No More Crabs' and 'Ghost Power'.  Trading cards are available.			"

												This is the third Pixel Puzzles game that I own and it's one of the best of the series, along with Undeadz. The rotation mechanic is great and I hope to find it in future Pixel Puzzles games.Pros+ Rotation of puzzle pieces! = higher difficulty+ 25 puzzles (significantly more than Japan/ Undeadz), longer gameplay ~16h total+ Fun tile edges e.g. bird beaks (as in Undeadz)+ Ingame bonuses: sorting tray, shuffling pieces +/- collect crabs for your hints+ Menu small bonus: minigame, art gallery, instructions + You can access easily puzzles with a lot of pieces and return later to smaller ones (unlike in Japan/Undeadz)Cons- birds birds birds photography, no sketches, paintings etc (unlike Undeadz) - annoying detailed texture background for the puzzle (cliffs with water) - somtimes too similar to the puzzle pieces- ads in main menu for other games			"

												Pixel Puzzles 2: Birds is a jigsaw game with a particular theme: birds. The goal is to rebuild a picture of them to unlock more puzzles. If you're familiar with Japan and UndeadZ, nothing is really changing: the pieces are floating in the water, the more you advance, the more puzzles with a big number of pieces you'll find and the forms are different. There is a new mechanism for getting some bonus: you have to catch crabs.Also, you have a bonus level on the TV interface, which is nice.Anyway, I've enjoyed this game less than the other three (I'm counting Anime in it as I've played at the time of the writing). I suppose it's due to the fact that it's real pictures and not drawing or with effects like in Japan. However, you wanted birds, you have all kinds of them.If you like jigsaw puzzles, go for it.			"

												This is a good puzzle game, though I found it to be a bit tougher puzzles than the previous in the series.  Still, a puzzle is meant to be difficult and so this definitely satisfied the need.  I found that there was a significant enhancement in the ability to pick the specific puzzle piece you chose when dealing with lots of little puzzle pieces floating around in close proximity.  Previous iterations were more difficult and would often result in selecting the wrong piece from a crowded location.  This time around, I did not get the same frustrations as before because of this enhancement.  The pictures, I do wish were better pictures.  I'm hoping that in the future they use good puzzle art and move away from just photographs.  Definitely recommended not only because this genre is lacking a large selection, but also because Pixel Puzzles does it well.			"

												Like the former version Pixel Puzzles : Japan, it is not really a bad game, but it has some flaws that make it a bad experience.Sum up of my review : + rotation + few more or less useful functionalities (zoom, tray, shuffle, switch backgroud color) + corrected issue with selecting pieces in Pixel Puzzle : Japan version - slow - crabs that appear and ""dance"" randomly over your pieces on the board - no sample of the finished image - no music (only bird sounds) - buttons in the pond that hide pieces - water in the ponds blurs and alters the color of the pieces +/- only bird images (well, that's the theme of the game, so it's good if you like birds, bad if you like diversity...)First I'm going to review its good points (in comparison to Japan version) : There is a rotation feature, easily done (right click while holding the piece), the problem is that right click while not holding the piece sends it back in the pond. This is not a big problem, but it can be frustrating. Then, there are a bunch of new functionalities added, like shuffling the pieces in the pond (which helps you locating them sometimes), zooming on the board (never used it, but it exists), switch background color of the board, and a tray on the bottom of the screen to put pieces you don't want to loose. I also have to mention the problems for selecting pieces in Japan version are fixed in this one, which is great.Now, on to the bad points : First is the slowness (I don't know if it is my computer, but even when I'm not in HQ, I have some issues with slow moving pieces), of course the problem increases with the amount of pieces. That sometimes made me miss my clicks. Then, I have to mention the crabs : in the previous version, you would sometimes select crabs in the pond instead of pieces. Tha was a problem they fixed in this one : now you catch them to get ""powers"" : they will randomly appear ON THE BOARD and dance on the pieces. The idea is that you can catch them and throw them into a net on the side of the screen. When you have enough of them, you can use them to get some hints. Well, I don't really care about hints, but I care A LOT about the fact that damn crabs are dancing over the picture until I throw them out. And they will reappear 10 or 20 seconds later. By the way, you CAN'T remove them in the options, because you can't do much in the options anyway.Still no sample of what your puzzle would look like when finished (well, there is an image that fades quickly at the beginning, but after that, you're with your memory ...Unlike the previous opus, there is no music in this one, there are only some bird sounds in the background, so it feels a bit empty. At least the previous game was pretty relaxing, but this one is not.I mentioned the crabs that prevented you to pick your pieces in Japan version ? Well, there are buttons in the pond that do pretty much the same thing : these buttons are the ones that allow the new features, like zooming or changing background color, but they hide pieces behind them, and when you want to click on them, you often select the piece behind instead.I also mentioned a tray to put your spare pieces you don't want to loose, well there is also a flaw in that one : the tray appears at the bottom of the screen, and hides the top part of the pond (and obviously the pieces contained in it).And I kept the worst for the end : The pieces in the pond are not at the surface, they're IMMERSED in it. That means that the water blurs the details and even ALTERS THE ACTUAL COLOR OF THE PIECE ! If you want an orange piece for instance, you will have to search for a brown one.			"

												EDITED REVIEW:  With the 11 March 2016 update (v 1.0.2.16), the developers finally fixed most of the mechanics which made this game unplayable before.  About the only thing they didn't fix was the squiggly background in the sorting tray at the bottom of the puzzle.  Unfortunately, even though I can now play the game (and finished it after 23 hours of game play with 100% Achievements), I'm still not recommending it.  My lack of recommendation, though, is now borderline.  The big problems now are:- The pictures are not very good for jigsaw puzzles.  In general, they consist of vast fields of background (rocks, water, sky) and a picture of a bird somewhere therein.  Usually, the background is partially blurred due to depth-of-field.  Sometimes instead of a bird or two, there's a flock of birds.  These pictures are not object-oriented enough for a jigsaw puzzle.- Of the 26 pictures in the game, 6 of them are 220 piece puzzles and 1 is a 350 piece puzzle.  On my 24"" 1920x1200 monitor, the pieces for the 220 piece puzzles became much too small to work with (can't really see the shapes or connectors, and the amount of picture on the piece is too small to be useable).  The single 350 piece puzzle is even worse.  Now, if you have something like a 28"" monitor (or bigger), maybe this particular problem would go away.  But, for me, those biggest 7 puzzles were nothing but a pain (especially coupled with the poor pictures).- It's a small issue compared to the above two, but the picture numbers and progression through the pictures in the game don't make sense.  You'd think the progression through the game would be from smallest number of pieces to largest number of pieces and the picture numbers would reflect that.  Nope.  It's almost arbitrary.  It doesn't really make any difference to the puzzles, but it's just odd.Again, my lack of recommendation is borderline.  If you have a 28"" monitor, I'd say it's probably worth trying.  With a 24"" monitor, it's pretty iffy.  Anything less would probably drop it into the avoid category.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  With the current interface on ""PIxel Puzzles 2:  Birds,"" there's no way I can recommend it.  The biggest problem is that for some unknown reason, they've decided to have:- the pieces float underwater in the pond instead of on the surface,- the pond, itself, to be filled with a squiggly background,- the UI controls float around taking space in the pond,- the puzzle table has a squiggly background- the sorting tray at the bottom has a squiggly background.All of that conspires to make it almost impossible to see (let alone find) the pieces.  On the very first puzzle (the easiest one with the biggest pieces), it's almost impossible to even see which pieces are edges as they float in the pond.  PIcking them up and dropping them on the sorting tray is of no help, since the background image there is worse than the background image in the pond.  Ditto for seeing pieces (properly positioned or not) on the table, itself.  Plus, if you expand the sorting tray so it appears at the bottom of the screen, it just pushes the top of the screen (i.e., the top of the pond) right off the display.  So, pieces can float around up there and you have no idea they exist.Adding insult to that injury, the main screen for the game seems to be a set of advertisements for the company.  There's a list of ""channels"" along the right hand edge that you scroll through to see other games (including this game).  I bought and paid for this game.  I sure don't want to be subjected to advertisements for other games right at the start.  All of that stuff needs to go away.  Instead, when we start the game, it should put us into the actual starting screen (the one that currently comes up when you select this game from the channels).Hopefully, Decaying Logic/KISS will revise this UI to remove the pointless noise.  ""Picture Puzzles:  Japan"" was a beautiful, restful game to play.  This game is making me blind.  I'm putting it away for now as unplayable and hoping for a UI update.			"

												A bit of a change from their previous games.The puzzles themselves are much more difficult now. Puzzle pieces can be rotated now, and there are many more puzzles this time around. Only downside was the actual pictures themselves. The camera focuses on the birds themselves, but there is a lot of background noise in most of the photos, which leaves unfocused, blurry objects in the background. Some puzzles arent so bad, but some have so many blurry background objects that the puzzle can be annoyingly difficult. Most puzzles arent bad though.Sounds wasnt bad, but it got annoying after awhile so I turned it off. I cant comment much else on it. Worth giving it a listen to see if youll like it.The minigame didnt bother me. Was a vast improvement over the zombie minigame from their zombie puzzle game. Basically, as you bring pieces on the board, crabs appear. Drag the crabs into the net and after awhile you unlock some hints. 5 Crabs for a full view of the picture that will fade out after a few second. 10 I believe for a hint to the right rotation for the piece youre holding. 20 to find where the piece goes. Between the frequency of the crabs and the hints, even on the tough puzzles you shouldnt get stuck for very long.Only bug I found was related to the settings being saved (an issue Ive had in the previous games as well). When Id load the game, it would go into fullscreen and volume for a few seconds before ""remembering"" my settings and adjusting.Overall, its a nice addition to the game series. Its true to the previous games, sticking to the jigsaw puzzles, with some improvements to the minigame gimmick. Id have loved better picture selections, but these were quite nice. Worth grabbing, especially on sale, and especially if you just want a relaxing jigsaw puzzle to finish.			"

												Birds? Please. More like Penguins. Which...actually I like better anyway.If you were expecting Hawks, Eagles, Chickens, Turkeys, etc, sorry to disappoint.Most of the pictures are seabirds, with an emphasis on penguins.Puzzles are puzzles though, so enjoy!			"

												This is similar to Pixel Puzzles 2:Anime but not quite as good. Reasons: 1. The background is not a solid colour but contains a pattern.  This sometimes makes it hard to see a pieces shape once placed.  Although you can change the colour, the texture remains in place, so if a ""black"" part of the texture is behind a black piece, it is very hard t see. 2. The pieces float in water which ""tints"" the colour of the pieces.  This makes it more difficult to match colour to colours of pieces already picked or placed. 3. For some reason my computer often slowed down while playing this game.  I'm not a tech, so I don't know if this was a memory leak or that background programs would kick in.  All I know is that I didn't have this issue with Anime.  When it happened, I pretty much had to stop as the ""lag"" would make it unplayable. Still a good puzzle game and I'm a fan of the series.

												Great game. I enjoyed almost every Pixel Puzzle game before. In my opinion, Pixel Puzzles 2: Birds had more challenging puzzles than the others, because there are some pictures with so many similar patterns inside that I had to try-and-error place a lot of pieces.Same cons as the other games. Pieces snap into place very easily, even when far away. And the floating pieces are still annoying.			"

												Even though I like the others, this is hard to recommend as the images chosen have so little to differentiate each piece making it an effort in brute forcing each piece. So instead of being a relaxing jigsaw, it becomes an exercise in tedium. Also, it's still lacking a mid-puzzle save which is sort of essential for stuff like this.To improve in the future, choose better pictures and add useful features rather than graphical gimcracks that don't provide any value to the player.

An improvement over the last two Pixel Puzzles games, Japan and UndeadZ.Now there's a save function, system settings stay the same after you restart the game, there are window resolution options though minimal, and the floating puzzle pieces on the pond are a little easier to click on.When you start up a puzzle all progress is automatically saved when you exit. You can even start up a new puzzle and have the previous one you were working on stay intact.If you want to make the game slightly tougher you can enable puzzle piece rotation as well though they still snap on to the mat like a magnet and you still can't put two puzzle pieces together outside of the magnets. For some reason though if you disable piece rotation the game won't remember what you rotated when you restart the game.As you move puzzle pieces around on the mat, crabs will start appearing though only 2 can spawn at a time. Apparently you're supposed to drag them to the net on the side of the screen so you can use handicap abilities depending on how many crabs are in the net. You use 5 crabs to show a ghost image of the puzzle for a few seconds, 10 crabs to have a held puzzle piece correctly rotated if rotation is enabled, and 20 crabs to show where the piece you're currently holding is supposed to go to. If you exit the current puzzle the crab net will be emptied out.There are varying puzzles that have exactly 60 pieces, 112 pieces, 153, 220, and one with 350 at the very end. There's no specific order you can complete them but finishing a puzzle unlocks the corresponding locked puzzles on the puzzle select screen.From the technical side of things it's an improvement. Getting interested in this game is just going to be based on if you somehow actually got into the premise of the other Pixel Puzzles titles and/or if you fancy pseudo-jigsaw puzzles that magnetize on a mat with birds as the theme.

												Well, this was a switch from the usual games I play on Steam but I have to admit, the kids and I have had fun putting these puzzles together.  The pieces floating around the edge adds to the challenge because the pieces don't stay in a stationary location around the puzzle.  The kids love catching the crabs as they appear around the puzzle.  One fix would be to make the bonuses from collecting the crabs clickable instead of keys on the keyboard.For a slow paced challenge, I'd say give this one a try.			"

												If you're reading anything about this game then chances are you're already pretty familiar with the series, since, unless you REALLY have a thing for birds, it's unlikely anyone would start with this over Japan, UndeadZ, or any of the later ones that have been released since. So you should already know more or less what you're getting into here - some puzzle pieces float in some water around the edges of the screen and you have to pick them up and assemble them into a picture in the middle. With each new entry, they try to add something a little different on top of the new theme (which is now birds, for some reason). This time, the extra feature is being able to rotate pieces. It doesn't sound like much, but that one small change makes a great big difference.Previously you could just brute force your way through a puzzle if need be; pick up a piece, drop it in an empty space, repeat until you find the right one, profit. Now, while you could do that if you were absolutely desperate or determined, it pays instead to make a more calculated effort in your approach and take the time to look closely rather than hammer away mindlessly. It's an extra layer of complication that does mean puzzles can take a little longer to complete than in previous entries. But, thankfully, they've also added in a new range of abilities to compensate for this fact.As you move, drop and rotate pieces around the board, crabs will randomly appear from under them and slowly scuttle around the play area, which can then be picked up and placed into a fishing cage at the side of the screen. For every 5, 10 or 20 you gather, you'll have access to a special ability - either briefly display the finished picture on the board, auto-correct the orientation of a held piece, or show the correct location to drop a held piece. Even though there never seems to be more than 2 crabs running around at any given time, there's never any shortage of them appearing. So even if it might be more time-consuming, the game is at least pretty forgiving in allowing the player to progress. If you want to use the abilities, that is. You can always chose to remove that element from play completely and just have a vanilla jigsaw puzzle if you'd prefer.I do really like how flexible they are with each element they add to the games. if you want to have crabs, keep them. If you don't, get rid of them. The same also applies to the new rotation mechanic, which can be disabled at any time, though I kinda wish I had've realised that at the start of the game rather than the end, as it's tucked away in the options and is never expressly pointed out to you. In fact, the way the game communicates with you is a little sloppy overall, if I'm being honest. There is a How to Play section in the menu, but it's a jumble of information all thrown at you in a single image rather than introduced as you play. It would have been nice to tell us an automatic save feature has been added for each puzzle as well instead of having to discover it accidentally ourselves. Also, rather than pausing the action, pressing Esc spits you out of the puzzle and back into the menu screen, meanwhile a list of immovable options are on show at the left side of the screen throughout, which can sometimes get in the way of pieces floating underneath. Which seems an odd oversight for what has so far been a pretty competently made series.The whole thing kind of feels like two steps forward and one step back. The new features are largely welcome, and they've finally managed to all but eliminate the sometimes awkward issue of picking up pieces by having more space for them to float in, but it feels like more could have been done, or some things just handled better. I don't know why birds were the main attraction this time around, either, or why it's only photographs. Maybe some artworks would have been nice? Or, instead of using images that were all taken from one guy, all seemingly from his one trip to a single island with a small variety of unspectacular birds, they could have had some more exotic examples; some birds of prey or paradise, a few emus running around, or even the common pigeon as a jokey finale or extra. The images used are pleasant enough and all, but the game could have been a far more flamboyant, engaging or enthralling experience for the player rather than just... nice.It's difficult to know where to place this among the series as a whole. The tiny added extra of rotating pieces is actually something of a game-changer which potentially pushes it above the others, but then the subject matter may be a bit of a yawn for some and make it the weakest of the series yet. But if you enjoyed the other games and still want more, then you'll hardly go wrong with the many hours of casual, laid back fun on offer here. Though, all that said, you will get covered in much more poop here than the other games, so you might want to prepare yourself for that.			"

												I enjoyed the earlier Pixel Puzzles games, and looked forward to this one.  I found the earlier games fun and relaxing (in No Zombie mode, at least).  This one is mostly aggravating.  I do love the fact that your puzzle progress is saved.  I'm neutral on the addition of rotation.  It does add a challenge and is fine for the pictures where you can make a reasonable guess about the orientation.  I don't like the dimming of the floating pieces.  You only see the actual colors after you pick up a piece.  And I could do without the picture of a hawk killing a seabird.  But what really ruins the game for me is the table you build the puzzle on.  It is so strongly patterned and colored that it's very hard to see the shapes of the puzzle pieces against it.  You can change the color of the table, which doesn't help enough.  It would be best if you could switch to a solid color background.			"

												Crab pickup simulator (CPS) Pros:  You do pick up an excessive amount of crabs.Cons: Way too many crabs! Only picks them up one way.The Pixel Puzzle, Birds:  there are a lot of pictures, but did we really need a picture with a dead bird?  The background is not helpful.  It strains the eyes and changing colors does not help.  Nor does it help with building the puzzles; it just makes it harder.  The biggest downfall, in my opinion, is CPS (see above). While the pickup of the pieces was improved over the previous game (Japan), the colors of the pieces in the water are different than when they are out of the water.For all of those who have gotten this and have gotten through all the  puzzles, congratulations! For me, this is the last Pixel Puzzles game I will purchase from this company.			"

												I enjoy the pixel puzzle series, whether it's the ultra cheesy zombies one, the rather charming and relaxing Japan one, or the one full of anime wiafus and the pixel fairy, but I was super excited to see a one full of birbs. Big birbs, small birbs and all other birbs. I wanted it as soon as but decided to get it on a heavy discount after reading some reviews and found out I can see why.This is the least entertaining jigsaw game in the series, especially since the game is really unattractive. The use of backgrounds and the UI are just an eyesore. It'd be unfair to critisize the pictures since you can't make a jigsaw of birbs super special, none the less how the pieces are cut does sometimes look super idiotic.Overall the UI is incredibly messy, the crabs are super annoying, the backgrounds are horrible and there's just not much to it. Unlike the wiafus I'm not excited to find out what the next birb is, and why crabs? Why are crabs hint tokens? Penguins and Crabs don't even exist in the same area, do they?			"

												Would you like to start hating penguins? Then this game is for you. The penguins themselves are not the problem.The problem are some design choices in this game that seem to be done with the sole purpose of making the game more frustrating to play. Either that or the creators just never actually played tried playing their own game after that after adding them.The most horrible of these is the background. Everybody would expect at least a uniform neutral color background (preferably selectable), but no, they went with a horrible pattern that makes anything put on it much harder to see. Sure you can change the color of the background, but the pattern is always the same and the colors are ugly and too vivid.The next horrible thing is the fact that all the pieces are under water and they get a bluish tint which makes it impossible to see the actual color of a piece without actually picking it up. The pieces also float freely around in the water so a dropped piece doesn't stay where you dropped it and there is a big chance you will pick it again and again. Sure, there is a tray on which you can put the pieces on, but that's off the screen and doesn't change color with the background so it's practically useless.The next horrible thing are the crabs. Little funny creatures that pop up under pieces you move around the table and give you bonuses that can help you with the game. Sounds good on paper, but in practice they are totally annoying as they pop up right under your mouse and you tend to grab them instead of the pieces so you can't just ignore them. Sometimes you even end up throwing away pieces while trying to get rid of the crabs. The bonus they provide isn't worth the hassle in most games, as you have to collect 20 of them to get the only useful powerup.On the positive side, the photos that you have put together are rather beautiful and the design of the pieces is very interesting and not boring as it changes from game to game.I can't recommend this game to you unless you are a really hardcore fan of jigsaw puzzle games that can get over all the frustrating stuff in this game.UPDATE: Most of the issues I had with this game are now fixed. Background is now of a (almost) uniform color and the colors aren't too bad.Bluish tint on the pieces in water has been greatly reduced so it doesn't bother you that much anymore.Crabs can be removed from a puzzle if not tha which is great because sometimes they are really annoying and sometime you need them.I can now recommend this game. 8/10 must play for jigsaw puzzle lovers. You might still end up hating penguins but that's because some of the jigsaws are very hard and not because of bad design.			"

												Just finished my second Pixel Puzzle (first one was the anime version).To start with the bad:  - background.. it isn't a one plain color background which makes it sometimes hard to put your puzzle pieces. - crabs: not being able to turn off the crabs is a real annoyance, in anime I liked the pixie, but you had the option to enable/disable her. And the basket to put them in is also obscuring a large part of the 'pond'.    you put the crabs into the basket to get extra options like ghostimage/position the piece etc..     But I never used those options as I like to do it all by myself. - floating buttons: I found those annoying as they also obscured pieces.. - some of the images (with the smaller pieces puzzles) have too large out of focus parts, or even too many the same type of birds (one where a lot of pinguins).. It would have been better to have those images have larger pieces..But the puzzles themselves are fun to do (sometimes a bit frustrating as I point out above), but I do like the floating pieces as it gives another gameplay dimension to the puzzle..If you like the anime version you'll propably like this one too..I bought it in a bundle with the anime version and some other games too for only $2, but I would certainly recommend it for around $1-$2 per game, but not the 9 euro's it normally is for this game or 5 euro for the other versions.. So I'll wait until those are also on sale..hmmm. and just when I typed this review, I see zombie and japan on sale for 1.40 euro each.. so just bought those too..			"
