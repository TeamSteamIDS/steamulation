												So far over almost 60hrs of game play and i luv the game.  Unlike some players who play it u can pause the game and everything will stop running while your gone.  when you play the game there are settings u can choose to slow down game play or leave it on med pace or fast pace.  those different settings mean how fast your tribe ppl age in the game.  when ever i been playing i'm almost about to get all trophies only 2 left.  an i must say its been a challange.  i recommend that if your going to play this do understand it does take time. an when your say playing for a few hrs and u choose to stop say because u dont want to play for a few days.  Then enter the settings page an pause your game so none of the workers keep working while your gone.  if u leave the game and leave it running your tribe will continue to age while your gone.  Now all i can say is fun game good for those that enjoy a long game of waiting u must pay attention and spend up to nearlly 80hrs to 150hrs to get all the trophies i could be wrong but the hardest one so far to get is make a person live for over 969 yrs or something around that.  Thx god for fountain water, golden relic and mushrooms. use on a person over age 65 or 66 to give them youth to age 36 again.  anyways i luv the game and cant wait till i get the remaining trophies.

												This game was basically my childhood.  My sister and I tried everything we could to extend the many 1 hour free trials we downloaded.  It's a really chill, sweet game.			"

												Love the game, I used to play the free version when I was younger, and I saw it on steam and immediately bought it. Great game and would highly recommend playing it, it is definitely a classic.			"

												I played this game as a little girl. I loved making my tribe grow and naming everyone. I looked forward to coming home every day and checking on my cute little tribe. Did they finish that house? Ooooo I wonder if they got more science points! It's a very enjoyable and cute game. It takes time but it is very addicting. You grow to love your little creations and work hard to make your little island prosper. I would recommend this to anyone, no matter how old.			"

												This game is all but a very watered down version of The Sims with much fewer customization options. Taking care of and growing your tribe is fun and addicting at first, but eventually most of the game is idle while you wait for villagers to rack up Science Points to unlock new clothing styles, building projects, farming, and possibilities with Potion brewing. Once all of those are unlocked, building the large projects takes quite a bit of time and it's easy for your villagers to run out of fire for cooking food while you're not playing. SInce you must manually check trees for harvest, they may all starve to death to lack of fire despite there being tons of trees to chop down. It makes it difficult to go to sleep or keep busy with your real life for the fear your tribe may have run out of wood while constructing. Solving the 9 mysteries is fun, but the rewards are variable. You can gain berries for making hair color changing potions, access to orange flowers for decoration, which aren't very exciting. You can get access to making youth potions though, which is essential for two of the trophies. The trophy system is fun up until you get to the time consuming ones, one of which requires you to keep a villager alive for nearly an entire month- in real life. It'll keep you busy for a few weeks, but by then you've done pretty much everything possible. Overall, it's a fun little game if you're fond of games like The Sims.			"

												Genre:RTS->Real time strategy.This game:RTS-> Real time survival.The game is very cute and fuzzy. I had a thriving island with lots of lovely settlers. This game can also be sad and cruel. I left a new island for a few days and the people ALL DIED. (i crie evrytime) Depends on how much you play it.Overall, it's a great game and for whoever want to take their time off on a intense RTS game. (Starcraft II for me)   "

												Your tribe decides to set sail to a new island. Your mission: * keep your tribe alive (in other words, keep ordering to make babies because they won't do it themselves).* Train their skills: Woodcutting, rock gathering, fishing, agriculture, science, art and construction* collect all trophies* Solve the eight mysteries (that's a trophy too, by the way)The game actually continues when you exit the game, so keep checking on them every so often (though you can pause this option if you don't play very often). What I personally like the least about the game is that there isn't really an ending to the game. Once you collected the trophies it's just done. There is no bonus or what so ever for completing them all, nor is there some sort of ending to that little bit of storyline they give in the beginning in the game. But all and all it's a fun game.

												I feel a little bit sorry for My Tribe being put in Virtual Villagers' shadow, but it's basically inferior to the whole VV series in every way, especially VV 3 onwards.- The puzzles are weaker and fewer- The environment has much fewer interactible points, you don't explore and experiment with it in the same way- There's straight up less content- The artstyle is worseYou can design your villages as opposed to restoring pre-placed structures, which might be a plus for some people, but honestly, there's not much to do in terms of design anyway. Since I've played all of the VV games already and really like this type of game (and very few exist..) I might play this game for a while longer just to solve the rest of the puzzles and build all of the structures. Still, it's hard to recommend it when there's a game series which is frankly superior, at the exact same price.			"

												when I was little and our internet kept getting shut off and was really bored I would go to the liberary and download free trial games on wild tangent, I would play my tribe offline. I loved playing this game, and the best part about this being on steam is now you won't have to deal with wild tangent slowing down your computer.			"

												Would recommend only if on sale. If you do have time to play RTS (real time strategy), skip this one.   It gets frustrating when you have to create a tribe each time they die because you are not there to baby sit them.  Other than that, I enjoyed the game.			"
