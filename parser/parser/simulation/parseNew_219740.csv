												One of my absolute favorite games. It's quite a challenging game, especially until you get the hang of things. It's a dark, twisted survival game where pretty much everything is trying to kill you. You've got to scavenge, build things, and defend yourself, all while trying to pay attention to the environment (weather) and the fullness of your stomach. The developers also seem to be constantly updating the game and adding huge amounts of awesome content for free. It just keeps expanding and you just keep wanting to play again and again. Highly recommended!October 2014 Edit: Multiplayer is coming to Don't Starve! It's currently in closed beta at the moment, but should be coming along eventually!			"

												Don't Starve is one of the games I will never forget!I'm sure you ask yourself why? Let me explain:When I saw the game I were like ,,Naahhhh I'm not going to buy this.'' but a few days later I looked a second time and tought ,,Why not?It looks funny. And it says you can celebrate with your piggy friends.''  that was when I bought it. I can tell you I got addicted to the game. The first day I played 12 h's. I told my brother and my friend they should buy it. They did it and got addicted, too. I think nearly every Computer can run the graphics and the the characters are funny, too. With every game I started a new story war born. For example I started my first game and forgot to make a fire when the night came up I died and I was like ,,Why?I should have know''. And I learned with every new day that the game hates me. The game likes to punch you in the face. And the community is amazing. In the forums you can see artist, storywriters, survivers and so on. Pretty fast updates with new content to explore and even merchandise. It's a tip for everyone who like survival games. You will love it.Graphics: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Sound: 10/10I hope you enjoyed my review.If yes press the like button :§D			"

												Do I recommend this game? Hell yes. Every single time you start a new game file, it's an entirely random generated world where nothing is the same as the last. You can play this game for weeks and still not discover all its secrets. It's a sandbox strategy game that keeps you on your toes for anything and everything that's trying to kill you. And believe me, there's a hundred and one monsters who all want your face on a platter. GAME TIPS:1. Always have a means to make fire. Always.2. Pigs are your friends. Build your base near them.3. Spiders are not.4. BEWARE THE BEES. 5. Beefalo herds are awesome. Fill your pockets with their endless poo. Great fire fuel.6. Prepare for periodic hound attacks. Make spears and tooth traps.7. Pick flowers. 8. Not starving is the LEAST of your worries.			"

												This survival rougelike is excellent. You are trapped in a cruel, randomly-generated world where everything wants to kill you, and left to fend for yourself in the wilderness. You will start off with nothing, collecting supplies to make a fire and survive your first night. The goal is simple -- survive for as long as possible.The randomness of the world generation keeps it fresh for every playthrough. There are countless ways to die, ranging from freezing to death to getting mauled by a tentacle. Once you die, you will be forced to start anew, which can be frustrating.I seriously love this game, and it really is worth picking up. You should also pick up the DLC which adds a lot more challenge to the game. This game is EXTREMELY addicting.			"

												You desperately fend off Eldritch horrors manifested by your own insanity while you turn your fallen friends' remains into a colossal bat made out of ham and run from a giant badger who shares a fondness for your dead compatriots. The sun begins to set, counting down the seconds before you are struck blind, tethered to a flickering light with the terrors of the night. Forests are mowed down behind you as the beast pursues.You dive into a sinkhole that dumps you into a pitch black cavern where you are promptly mauled by a horde of spiders and rabbit-people. You scream in terror as the light from above grows fainter, the rabid shrieking of gigantic insects growing louder and louder.10/10, extremely relaxing game.			"

												Don’t Starve starts off slow and punishing and continues to get even harder as you play. Its merciless difficulty coupled with its monotonous gameplay can leave some players feeling frustrated and bored. Those who enjoy a good challenge, however, will relish in the satisfaction they’ll get when they manage to outlive their previous record or clear the game’s evil Adventure mode. It may not be for everyone, but if you’re looking for a roguelike game filled with charm and challenge, be sure not to miss Don’t Starve.			"

												This game is fantastic.It combines roguelike and survival gameplay, dumping you in a strange territory to explore, forage, learn, craft and progress on your own terms. For the most part, the controls and interface are intuitive, so it's simply a matter of deciding where to go or what to do.The game is called Don't Starve, and hunger is indeed a major theme. If you go a few days without food, you will die. That said, there are plenty of other things to kill you - a variety of animals and monsters, environmental hazards, and your own dwindling sanity. To battle this, you rely on building your own equipment, consumables and structures, ranging from weapons and armor to crock pots to unwholesome magical devices.Don't Starve can be brutal, so you should expect to die, but just making good progress is rewarding in itself. You unlock new characters as you play, each with little touches or specialties to diversify your experience. And while there are some pretty powerful or useful items you can make, there are still a lot of ways to play, and they're all valid (which is good, because sometimes you don't have much choice.)If you're bored or frustrated, you can change your experience by starting a new game and adding or removing features. If you're tired of fighting certain monsters, you can just turn them off. I haven't messed with this myself, as I like the feeling of surprise, and playing the game as-is, but the developers have left the doors wide open for custom play experiences. In the same way, you can make use of a wealth of user-created elements.There are a few things I missed for awhile, like the fact that you can view a map of everywhere you've been so far, but overall the game doesn't suffer much from lack of tutorial or hand-holding. You can go read everything on a wiki if you prefer, but this is a game where I don't actually begrudge trial and error learning. Encountering strange new things and deciding what to do with them is a ton of fun, even if it sometimes gets you killed.A warning (at least from my perspective) - this game is so immersive, I prefer to keep playing it for hours on end once I start. It's not a game I enjoy having to stop, unless I come to good stopping point like dying at the end of a long survival run. In fact, sometimes I forget to eat for a long time when I play this. So, yeah. Irony.			"

												Boy Scouts should be required to play Don't Starve before going on any camping trips – they could even get a badge for it, in the form of a gaping, pointy-toothed wormhole. Or maybe a friendly campfire.Don't Starve is, at its most basic level, a survival game. It features crafting, mysticism, science and all manner of nasty creatures, especially once it gets dark. In order to stay alive, players have to use the surrounding flora and fauna to craft increasingly complex tools, starting with a simple axe and building up to items as intricate as lightning rods and carpeted flooring.When you die in Don't Starve, your current world is destroyed, along with the things you created while surviving in it. There are advanced tricks to escape death – constructing a Meat Effigy or finding an Amulet – but rest assured that you will most likely die before gaining the experience required to craft or dig up these items. A Touch Stone will also resurrect fallen players, but finding that structure early on is more luck than certain death. I did find it, at the beginning of my second run, but I didn't know what the strange circle surrounded by pig heads was, so I didn't use it, and when I died, I was dead.That said, curiosity and a desire to poke at unfamiliar things are essential in Don't Starve.Dying is a fundamental gameplay aspect. Death won't always come from starvation; it inhabits many forms, including beasts large and small, and the terrors that hide in the night. A clock-like status bar in the upper right corner of the map shows how many days you've survived and the current time, and it provides health, hunger and mental gauges. It's an efficient system, the clock hand moving from yellow to red to blue – day, afternoon and night – and circles of health systems draining without proper care. One glance and it's instantly clear how long until you have to build a fire, or if you need to eat or rest.On top of a solid survival game, Don't Starve is a deep, layered experiment in crafting and exploration. Throughout the biomes are wormholes that transport players to different lands, which offer new materials for building science machines – which unlock new crafting recipes – and heartier structures. New characters are unlocked with experience – 20 points per day survived. This is all in Sandbox Mode, but Don't Starve also features an Adventure Mode, which players can enter by finding and activating Maxwell's Door. Adventure Mode is Don't Starve's campaign, pitting Wilson against Maxwell, the demonic genius who brought Wilson to the wilderness in the first place. It's five grueling chapters – upon first entrance, players lose all items and crafting recipes, and can only carry four items between Adventure Mode chapters. Die in Adventure Mode and you're spat back out into Sandbox Mode, precisely where you left it.For its art style, deceptively dark vibe and experimental approach, Don’t Starve is certainly worth a look.

												Don’t Starve tries its best to be a haunting challenge, with a Tim Burton art style. It does a good job. The core gameplay is simply trying to survive. gathering materials and food during the day, and huddling by a fire, trying to craft useful tools at night. As the day to night cycle progresses, so does the seasonal cycle. After a couple days, winter comes, making it harder to collect food, and hunt. The nights become longer and the days become shorter as you huddle by your fire, trying not to freeze to death. During winter, your homemade farms stop becoming useful. Huntable animals disappear and other more dangerous animals come in swarms. As far as the story goes, there is an oddly rich story, which can only be experienced by skilled players. Whenever a new game is started, Maxwell, the games antagonist, warns him to get food. The real story mode cannot be achieved unless the player has found the four pieces, and then moves to the next level. After beating a few levels, they reach the epilogue, where maxwell is unlocked as a playable character and the game is complete. Don't starve’s graphics and art style is very Tim Burton. The monsters, alone have a scary but yet cute feel to them. The sound of the game is very creepy yet welcoming. depending on what the player is doing at the time. The music changes whenever the player is in combat or not, making the combat feel even more immersive. Don’t stare also has a large amount of options. Not only can you pick your character but you can also modify the world and its many resources. Players can make the world a food rich wonderland, or a barren wasteland, randomized each time. Each playable character has its own stats, and buffs/debuffs, tailoring to each possible playstyle. The in game crafting provides a large variety of machines, tools, farms and structures. The player can craft anything from carpets, campfires, spears, drying racks, walls, bee-based mines and a large variety of clothing, all with special perks. Winter coats to keep you warm, mining hats to provide light, feather hats to increase how many birds there are, armour to reduce damage, and a flower garland to keep sanity up.Don't starve does lots of things right. The art style and sound design is amazing for this gameThe crafting feels organic and worth the effort.The clothes in the game change not only how the player looks, but also has bonuses. The Monsters in the game are interesting and fun to hunt.The many varieties of food make the game more interestingThe story is enjoyable, even if you don't play through it. The antagonist is one of the best “bad guys” i've seen in games for a whileThe different playable characters are fantastic The game has a customizable world setting.The game has playing cardsDon't starve does a few thing wrong.The cave mechanic is hardly explored until late gameThe game has a few bugs still needing to be fixedThe follower mechanic should be touched upThe vanilla game can be a tad boringThe player may rage-quit after dieing on a long time world.The game lacks achievementsThe game lacks vanilla co-opDon’t Starve isn't only a magnificent survival game, but it is also a well told story, for those who care to play it. I believe that there is a large market for this game, and that market keeps on growing. If you don't already own this game, pick it up on sale. Its on sale almost every winter and summer sale. I payed full price for it and i think its worth it. "

												Updated now to include the massive lot of new content and Klei's commitment to the game -So. Tim Burton designs minecraft, this is what it would look like. That's the quick version. The not so quick version involves you attempting to survive in a world which is pretty much entirely out to kill you (even the trees will try to kill you...), having been dumped there by a mysterious character called Maxwell. It is down to you to, as with many Minecraft games, start from the ground up by collecting flint and twigs, and putting together rudimentary tools, before hacking down trees and mining rocks for the more advanced stuff. As your toolset grows, so do your options, and thankfully, so does your diet choices (berries work for a while, but there's nothing like cooked rabbit).The game now has a fair bit of lore and background to it, and with the addition of caves, and sub areas, now has a more ""exploratory"" feel on top. Combined with the Steam Workshop, a slew of unlockable characters, and a soundtrack which I seriously suggest everyone who picks up the game -also- collects, results in an outstanding offering that will appeal to survivalists and minecrafters alike.

												It’s a pity that Tim Burton hasn’t been involved in video games: both his visual style and his storytelling abilities would be welcome additions to our industry. Thankfully, niche approaches to style can find a welcome home in today’s indie market, and the folks down at Klei entertainment have turned that particular style onto the video game scene in their new 2-D open world survival title Don’t Starve. It’s a refreshing and unique entry into the genre, one that puts extra emphasis on the ‘surviving’, and that’s sure to give players a welcome challenge.The goal in Don’t Starve is simple and straightforward (hint: read the title). The player takes control of a forlorn, classically British-looking protagonist, and although there is only one default starter character, other playable characters with potentially useful abilities unlock as the game progresses. When you start in the world, you’ve got only your bare hands to work with. There’s no tree-punching, thank goodness, but you’ll need to start off by hunting down some flint and sticks so you can fashion yourself an axe. Your first priorities are simply to acquire fire (which you must have to survive a night) and food (which, as it turns out, delays starvation). As luck would have it, it’s not enough to simply peg down a steady source of calories; if you’re not careful, you can also be killed in the conventional manner, in other words, by being ravenously eaten, poisoned, or pecked to death by some of Mother Nature’s wonders. There are also some native inhabitants, better armed and armored than you, who are probably best avoided. As if that weren’t enough, there’s one more danger that feels just a tad artificial: your character starts to go insane without having new things to think about (aka, crafting new items or gathering pleasant items). This provides an impetus to keep you gathering harder-to-find materials, and although this seems like a bit of a poor man’s way of encouraging you to explore and ‘techify’, the crafting is fun enough that it stands on its own two feet. Generally you’ll be quite happy to spend time gathering special items just because you want to, say, build yourself a suit of armor, or a new kind of animal trap. There are even cute hats to make that have the added bonus of keeping your sanity up.If all of this sounds like an open-world creativity journey, think again. Don’t Starve does give you several nice options for survival. For example, your food sources can come from scavenging, farming, hunting, or even cultivating your own bees. However, in the harsh climates that you’ll be fighting through, your options are usually so limited that you’ll need to focus all your efforts on whatever strategy is most likely to let you live another day. It’s not a game of fun and frolicking: you’ve got to fix your problems now, before they grow to big and doom you by your own stupidity.That’s all well and good for the basic ‘survive-and-thrive’ aspect of Don’t Starve, but there’s also a form of campaign in the guise of the Adventure Mode. Here, the player is placed into specially created worlds with particularly difficult settings: it might be extra cold, or extra dark, or the food might be extra hard to come by. Surviving in each world long enough to collect pieces of a McGuffin allow the player to progress to the next challenge, slowly uncovering a thin story as the adventure continues. It’s not a strong enough narrative to be an independent draw for most players, but gives a nice added challenge to the standard gameplay.From its title to its music, Don’t Starve does an excellent job of perfectly nailing a unique tone: it’s always a little dark, a little humorous, and a little self-conscious. The soundtrack is mostly made to mimic small-ensemble Victorian era motifs, the sort of thing that you would expect to hear in a haunted mansion movie. That said, it feels like there’s not enough of this high quality music to go around. The light-hearted morbidity of the game is even reflected in what characters you can play with: it’d be so easy to simply make the player a terribly frightened little girl or boy, crying for his or her mommy. Instead, the characters in the game gleefully watch trees burn and take pleasure in slaughtering whatever cute furry animals they can find. It’s a kill-or-be-killed world, and your character loves every minute of it. But the best part about the game is that the environment itself practically has a character. Nature isn’t just a harsh environment: it’s out to get you. Chop up too many trees, or wring the necks of too many fluffy bunnies, and you might find yourself facing some particularly vengeful avatars of the outdoors.The worldbuilding in Don’t Starve is a special treat, and is quite possibly the most enjoyable aspect of the game. The scenery and enemies are given a dark, edgy sketch style that looks a bit like a flannelgraph or felt puppet show. Birds and critters all have their distinctive hoots and whistles, and even the trees quiver when they grow new leaves (which, appropriately, happens in a sudden ‘pop’). Genre-wise, Don’t Starve sits nicely in that sweet spot of gothic aesthetics, partway between simple turn-of-the-century technology and homespun magic.Comparisons between Don’t Starve and Minecraft are inevitable, but unfair. Don’t Starve isn’t nearly as open-ended: it’s more focused on the challenge of survival, and there’s very little call for customization at all in the game. All recipes are technically given to you in advance, although you may need to traverse a tech tree in order to gain access to them. The crafting in Don’t Starve is also more focused on utility - generally speaking you’ll be so busy trying desperately to build the weapons or shelter that you require, you won’t ever find yourself making something just for the fun of it. Instead of offering limitless exploration, Don’t Starve offers a particular feeling; that of being in a creepy, kooky horror story.With only a few biomes and enemy types currently implemented, the game as it is only carries a decent amount of material, and replay value is sadly limited. The sticking point here is that, like Minecraft, Don’t Starve promises continual updates (and cleverly posts the date of the next game addition on its main menu). This makes the purchase of Don’t Starve something of a gamble: maybe it will fill up to the brim with new content, maybe it won’t, and only time will tell.More so than in other genres of games, world building in survival games is important, because the world is your enemy. Just like every good heroic RPG needs a delicious villain to focus your conflict against, a good survival game needs to give the environment itself a personality. While most outdoor survival games do this by making the environment be something like an inviting, friendly host, Don’t Starve goes in the opposite direction by making the Mother Nature seem more like that weird cat lady who lives in the boarded-up house. It’s not so much an invitation to explore and enjoy yourself as it is a long list of dangers to avoid. Don’t pick fights with the locals. Don’t stay in one place for too long. Don’t ignore that growl you hear in the night. Oh, and just in case you forget... try not to starve.Highly Recommended "

												This game is so addictive, while trying not to starve on the game you may starve in real life, you won't sleep and you will go insane keeping your charactor alive. This should come with a health warning but the games name should be a reminder in itself, maybe add an ingame timer that saves the game and tells the player 'eat and go to bed' after they've been playing 20 hours.If you have lots of spare time this game is definitly worth it's money.

												Best. Game. Ever.I seriously cannot express how awesome this game is. Whether it be the overall gameplay, the lore, the deaths, the nomming, the insanity, or having your base burnt down because of one lightning strike in Spring, the game delivers on all of what it promises and more.Buy this game and you will not be disappointed.

												What is Don't Starve all about?Don't Starve is a survival horror game that drops the character in an open and fully explorable world filled with numerous monsters and many interactive objects. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys a game where the player is given total freedom to do what they want, how they want and when they want. So as a player and big fan here is my own personal experience on such an awesome single player experience game. J20Hawkz Personal OpinionI have been playing this game since early release and still find it extremely hard to stop playing it. Personally for me I enjoy adventure, action and rpg, Don't Starve combines all three in a unique way and blends in survival horror and a sort of farming, resource hoarding element also. If you enjoyed playing games such as Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon you will definitely feel right at home playing this. The added twist is you are always on your feet to make sure you don't go insane and lose health. Oh and of course don't starve. Seasons, Days, InteractionsAlmost everything can be interacted with, from catching small butterflies and bees to having epic battles with huge lumbering monsters that hunt you in the coldest and hardest of times. Yes Don't Starve has seasonal changes, and not only do you live to survive, you must survive to live. Days go from light to dark, they don't last very long making it all important you do enough to survive the dark night and start again when the sun comes out. Anything that moves and would potentially pose a threat can harm the player if you choose to get too close or in some way anger it. Weapons, Traps, Armour, FoodCraft weapons, armour, traps and walls to defend yourself against continuous threat. Capture, kill, gather and cook food to make sure your hunger never drops. Everything you see can be used to collect valuable resources that will be used to craft hundreds of helpful survival items. Explore a living worldNot only are we free to explore a fairly large open map, we can also go deeper into the caves and explore a strange and creepy ancient world. With the addition of such levels Don't Starve replay ability went through the window. Again exploring either the world above ground or venturing deep into the darkness of the caves, is all up to the player. There are no strings attached. You do as you wish. Minor IssuesThere are some minor faults with the game, but the team behind this game are very supportive and at least one member is on hand to help sort out any technical issues or those annoying bugs we encounter while playing. Never have I seen a more committed development team than Klei. Most questions can be answered by reading the community made Don't Starve Wiki, you can also visit the Official Klei site and post questions or reply to other friendly members of the Don't Starve community. The Steam Don't Starve forum is also a good place to share or ask what's on your mind. DeathDeath can be a pain, if you die that's it, you have to start all over again. The further you get is based on the number of days survived. However you gain experience points based on this number that is used to unlock other playable characters all of which have unique aspects about them. There are ways of avoiding a permanent game ending death so not all hope is lost. Play alone or togetherDon't Starve was originally planned as a Single player game only. On the 6th of May 2014 multiplayer was announced for late summer 2014. More to follow. FinallyAll in all, this game is a great single player oriented experience. The achievements we get is what we find hard and over come. With no online capabilities or steam associated achievements, some may find this game not worth buying. However if those are the only negatives in a game you will be hard pressed to find something that is as captivating as Don't Starve.  I give this game a solid 85/100.Here is just one example of what can be made in Don't Starve.

												Aside from ridiculously fun gameplay, Don't Starve's art style is eye-candy, reminiscing the feel of a Tim Burton movie adapted into a video game.Don't Starve doesn't hold your hand at the start. You pretty much figure out what to do by yourself. Oh look, that looks edible. And just like that, you could be dead.It's a trial and error game with a flair of adventure. You could stumble upon something very interesting or dangerous. You may have met your potential pigman allies. Tread carefully as the world of Don't Starve is perilous and unfriendly. Most importantly, don't starve!			"

Charmingly addictive // Recommended for survival gamers who don't want their hands held+ The longer one lives, the more XP is accumulated; characters are unlocked via XP, so unlocks can be obtained by those struggling to acclimate to the game, albeit not as quickly+ Boasts myriad environments and biomes, all of them offering a unique pallet of items and consumables+ Camera rotation is a godsend, and makes camp construction much less frustrating+ Permadeath offers a rousing incentive to succeed, particularly due to nighttime being so fatal+ Absolutely fantastic art style and animations+ Has an intricate, yet fairly intuitive, crafting system; this is greatly complemented by the mechanics of magic and scientific advancement+ Controls are practical and responsive; works very well with mouse and keyboard+ In addition to the hunger and health meters, the player must also consider the needs of the 'sanity' meter, adding further to the logistical challenge; sanity requirements can be satiated differently between the unlockable characters+ Worlds are all procedurally generated, making each experience into something refreshing and unique+ Sound design is nothing less than superb- Game can often lend itself to tedious frustrations, in large part due to the unforgiving environment and the fragile nature of the player's character- Crippling lack of a tutorial or beginner's handicaps; this will not appear as a negative to most enthusiasts of the genre, but less experienced survival gamers may find it off-puttingLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

The silent whisper of your demons, as you slowly go insane.The witty analysis of each character on their environment, showing how unique they are.The breathing you hear in your left ear, but cant see beyond the piercing dark.Dont Starve is a great game, with devs that listen to their players. Open mod support encourage the community to build the game they want to play. The addition of Dont Starve Together adds an almost primal need. Survive with your pack, feed them and fight with them - Survive. A hidden gem, a beautiful game.			"

												At around day 100+ I feel obligated to review this masterpiece of a game.Imagine you're stranded in a world which his only point is defeating you.Now imagine it's a video game. that's Don't Starve.You start in a world without any prior knowledge to what it contains, no idea on what to do, how to craft, how to eat food, how to survive.You roam around and pick up grass, saplings and flint without any target on your mind, doing it like you feel obligated toAfter a while of doing so, you hear a wild *DING* and a flashing bulb captures ontop of the crafting tab captures your eye.What could that be you possibly ask, as that is the tools tab.You continue your pointless journey by crafting your self a pickaxe and an axe, respectively.You start by getting some wood, maybe some stone if you're lucky and it's already night.Luckliy, another light bulb ontop of a campfire logo has captured your eye and you've got a campfire, just in time for the night.After the night has fallen, a new day had began. You're low on food and sanity so you start picking up these berries which you haven't thought about doing in the beginning, and you also found flowers. You try eating them but notice that whenever you pick'em up your sanity raises. that's good.After a while of looting the enviorment you come across a rock biome. Great, you've gathered enough rocks to make yourself nothing because the night came again.After almost dying at night you start getting stone and come across a gold nugget. What could that be?And, again, a bulb ontop of the symbol of Atom has caputred your eye.You make a science machine as you start grapsing that basics of this game. After a while of exploring your general land you come across a pig village with, ofcourse, the king pig inside. These pigs will turn out to be your only allies in this game. They have farms, they offer protection for any kind of meat and will save you from some of the horrors of this game. So you start making your base next to them as it is the only logical choice you could make in this game.After more days of looting and gathering resources you hear a faint woof. What could that be?Hounds.As you run relentlessly without understanding what's going on, your fellow pigsman are there to save the day, not for long though. You came out clean this time, which you should thank the gods of this cursed land.You started making up a base, you crafted random items from the science tab and again, a bulb has lit up.You craft an alchemy engine which will help you craft more scientific items.After roaming around in the world yet again, you come across ancient guardians of this cursed land.They work like clockwork, they defend their land like no other creatures. You bribe your fellow pigsman and you go to fight these ancient creatures, winning the battle.After looting their corpses, you come across gears. When arriving at your house, you craft an Ice Box to slow the spoilage of the food. Neat.You have a base, well protected from the horros of this world, you have everything you'd like in it.Now, there are two scenarios which can happen:1. Summer starts.You have no idea what to do, your character starts to heat up without any knowledge on what's happening.Your house starts burning and you, yourself, is overheating.Okay, lets say that didn't happen and you miraculously didn't any fires or didn't overheat because you mined ice.Guess what?Dragonfly. I'll leave that for you to discover what's that.Scenario 2:Winter starts.Great, you're cold, you're almost dead but you came across a failed survivor which had a Puffy Vest, thermal stone and a Cat Cap. How lucky you are. So you barely survive this day and come back to your house, rapidly fueling your campfire as it's the only gateway from this hellish environment. You have food in your ice box, you have enough wood somehow to survive the winter (Who am I kidding, this never happends, but for the purpose of this story let's assume it does).A saxphone sound comes out of your characters body and a text appeares, ""That sounded big"".I'll let you guess what's going to happen next.Ofcourse, there are 2 more seasons, Autumn and Spring, but I feel like they shouldn't be focused on now as they are pretty similliar.You die.Again.And again.And again.And again, until you master the horrors of this cursed land, feeling success after surviving your first winter, summer, autumn, spring. You survive the countless waves of hounds. Great.You come across a sinkhole.I'll let you find out what's going to happen next.All in all, this game is a well polished survival game with a giant replay value, very little bugs are found, great developers who listen to the community, great DLC's which add a LOT to the game which are very cheap aswell.If you like survival games and want to feel what a real survival game is, check this game out, it's on sale right now aswell.This game will always have a special place for me.

												EDIT: Well looks like wherever I got the multiplayer information from is wrong(?). I have to say the mutliplayer is very fun, however can get tedious with long sessions.Action packed adventure game. This is probably a more realistic approach to what surviving is really like but with an obvious cartoony visual. This game requires its player to always be thinking about what to do next so that they can always be prepared for a bad situation. Don't Starve is a very fun and feels refreshing each time you play, the characters with unique abilities and the randomised maps help the game stay addictive and attractive for a long time. It has an absoultely huge variety of gameplay and things to do and explore.I would have to say the only two cons there are with this game are there is absolutely no chance of multiplayer (apparently something with the scripting idk) and that if you get ambushed by monsters, all your hard work will literally just disappear, aka sometimes its just too easy to die.9.2/10 definently my favourite indie game at the moment			"

												Don't starve is a game that really grew on me.It seemed very unforgiving at first, but when i learned my way around it, it felt very rewarding. Then, just then i realized how challenging this game really is. I felt like i really had accomplished something.It wasn't just delivered to me with flashy signs or arrows that indicated what i should do or when.And this is without saying how beautiful the art and the music are in this game, which is only a plus side to the amazing gameplay that was carefully crafted.Is it worth buying? Yeah, i don't know, can you handle being challenged to a frustration point? Because unless you took a look into the game's code, getting around the situations you will be put in, on the first attempt, will be extremely hard.And if you care so much about beating a game like i do, you will get mad.Personally, i feel like this game changed the way i see things, that the weird and bitter sometimes can become your biggest passion.

												Since I have no idea how to review this game, I am just going to tell a tale of one of my adventures.Please note, this was played on Reign of Giants 1st update.Day 1 through 7. Getting Started.I pick Wilson as my character and start my game. It dumps me in a birch tree biome full of Twigs, Grass, Berries, Carrots and Flint. So I walk around gather all that crap, cut down some trees gathered wood and acorns and made a fire and waited through the night. The next day comes and I start exploring. I come across a biome full of Boulders and Gold nuggets. So I make a Pickaxe and just start going through every Boulder getting Stone, Flint and Gold Nuggets. I did that all day. The next day comes and I went to search for Beefalo. Within the first 2 minutes I find beefalo. My reaction was “Yes! I can now get their poo and start a farm!” I then realise I got excited over poo... So I got a bunch of poo and found a decent spot to make my camp. The next day I cut down a ton of trees and made a lot of stone walls and marked my base. Once I had set my walls, I replaced the floor with wooden flooring. Then I placed my Science Machine, Alchemist Machine, Crock Pot, Drying rack, Lightning rod and made 3 improved farms. Everything was going great!. That was all in the first 7 days. A great start for me.Day 8 through 12. The Rise and Fall of Friendship.I go exploring looking for spider nests for webs and the Pig King for Gold Nuggets and Pig men to recruit for help. I take 4 steps up and boom! Forrest Biome full of spider nests! And right next to biome was the Pig village with the pig king. Having killed a few spiders on the way to finding the Pig king I had some monster meat. So I recruited 2 Pig men called (And I am not kidding you) Nacho and Libre. They helped me out killing spiders and getting webs and they also helped with cutting down trees. The next 4 days pretty much went like this. I got my webs, made the Bug Net, Bird Trap and Tent and then…something I was not expecting happened. You need to keep giving the Pigs meat for them to keep following you and I have been giving them Monster Meat that the Spiders dropped. Day 12 I give the Pig men Monster Meat for the fourth day and…they turned in to Werepigs… I had to kill them both. So at this point I go on the Don’t Starve Wiki to find out why this had happened. Turns out giving them 4 Monster Meat turns them in to Werepigs… R.I.P Nacho and Libre. Day 8-12. Day 13 through 21. Preparing for Winter.Sad. Having killed my fellow Pig friends, I continued on. I go to an unexplored area and I find something surprising! A skeleton with an Ice Box next to him. I smash the Ice Box, take the items and ran back to my camp and made an Ice Box. This made me very happy. Now I can now store food without them going bad in 3 days. This also gave me a purpose to go mine the Ice blocks since Ice never melts in an Ice Box. For pretty much day 14 to 21 I stocked right the up on food. Making several meals from the crock pot and stocking up on Berries and Carrots that I could find. Just before day 21 hits, while just looking around in a forest I find yet another skeleton and this time he had a Winter hat and a Breezy Vest. I had loads of food in the Ice Box I had the perfect clothes and a fully heated Thermal Stone and my beard was fully ready. Bring on winter!Day 21 through 31. Spelunking and Giant encounter.Winter arrives! Snow everywhere! PENGUINS! And trying not to freeze to death! Winter was a pretty slow and boring time. Can’t really go out much without freezing so I thought to myself “I’m going to go explore the caves!” Expecting it to be dark and full of bats, I prepared myself. As soon as I go down the cave there was yet another skeleton! This time he had a lantern and a chest full of this green slime. I thought “Great! This is will get me around the cave without using 50 torches” It didn’t stop the fact that the caves are terrifying! At first it was just a marsh biome with GIANT TENTICLES! trying to kill you. As soon as am out of that biome I enter this new looking place I haven’t seen before…and I encounter something that made me ♥♥♥♥ myself! Now keep this in mind, the cave is pitch black and you can only see with a lit source. In this case the lantern I found. The lantern does not light the entire screen. You can only see like 3 feet around you. I encounter ROCK LOBSTERS! Which are (As I find out later) these terrifying yet harmless mob. My first reaction was to turn around and run the ♥♥♥♥ out of the cave but I noticed they didn’t follow me. So I approached one and it did not attack me. I learn that you can befriend them by giving them stone. I befriended 1 and continuted. Then I encounter the 2nd most terrifying thing…GIANT BUNNYS! These big furry bunnies are also Harmless and you can befriend them by giving them…Carrots…I also continued on without them. From then on it was just Cave Spiders and Bats. Having explored most of the cave I decide to finally leave it. I resurface only to be attacked by 5 hounds. I don’t attack them. Instead I lure them all the way to the Pig Village and got the pigs to help me out! The hounds died with the cost of 1 Pig man….So I took the meat he dropped and dried it and made Jerky!Having not died in the cave and surviving the hounds I decide to just take these next few day’s slowly. Having planted a load of acorns outside my camp I cut down all the trees and made 3 pig houses just outside my camp. Just in case anything comes to attack me (Like a Giant perhaps). I decide to venture out to more unknown area and I encounter a strange bug, I encounter the Goose Moose in winter. It left me confused considering it is a spring giant. So what did I do? Recruited a bunch Pig men and killed it! And it was successful! I gathered the Meat it dropped and yet again headed home. But on my way over I got caught in the darkness and can to settle in the middle of nowhere. During the night I was attacked by like 6 bats. So during night I was just running around my fire like I was doing a rain dance.Day 32 through 54 The Quest for the Fire Staff and Leaving the World Behind Me.The snow has stopped. The rain continued. And I have literary no worries of dying anymore. I have all the food I need and I have my fellow pig Neighbours for protection. At this point I thought I had nothing else to do. So I wanted to start messing with magic! Luckily I found a bunch of collapsed rabbit holes so I caught 4 of them, made a Top Hat and then made the Prestihatitator. The first thing I made with it was the Meat Effigy which pretty much acts as an 2nd chance if you die with the cost of 20% of your total health. But what I really wanted to make was a Fire Staff. But first you needed a Shadow Manipulator. Which are not easy to make due to the fact you need 3 Living logs and 7 Nightmare Fuel. Getting the Nightmare Fuel was easy but getting the Living Logs was a quest in its self. After many days of searching I finally found a Living Tree and got it. Now with my Shadow Manipulator made I needed 1 red gem. So I found graveyard and started digging graves until I got one. Literary the 2nd grave had a red gem. So I was happy. I made my Fire Staff and it was total worth losing lots of my sanity! I burned Bees, Spiders and an ENTIRE FOREST!. So that was fun! and pretty much from then I had a daily life and I left it on day 54. During all of this I happened to find all 4 of the “thing” items to enter a new world. Having explored the entire world and not wanting to stay any longer, I head over to the “Wooden Thing” location. Knowing it is guarded by the Clockwork mobs I of course, yet again, had a pig army!. We made our way over, killed the mobs and I said goodbye to the world and my fellow Pig friends. I have yet to start the new world. The End.I love this game. 10/10			"

												Ever had a feeling of utter helplessness? An impending sense of dread? Well if you like pressure, Don't Starve is your game! A bundle of wicked all wrapped up in a funky little art style which we all know and love.+Like I stated before, these graphics are wonderful, they aren't next gen but they don't need to be. They are like old school Tim Burton and grab your eye like a sexually frustrated teenager grabs a breast; they make this game what it is.+The game balances a sanbox survival aspect with a real purpose which I won't spoil. In survival games I just feel as though I wander round aimlessly until I inevitably die, with Don't Starve I feel like I am really accomplishing something with every decision I make.+You get a ""keen sense of despair"". Like the game says, there really is fear aspect to this game. Every choice is crucial, fraught with unseen consequences. A choice you make 5 minutes into your run could make the difference 50 days in. There are countless terrible creatures out for your blood. One of the worst moments you can experience is in the dead of night as you are racked with pain as insanity takes over. You will hear a child's tune play like that from a Jack-in-a-box. Then you will see an evil shadow hand come to steal your fire and envelop you in darkness.+It's downright witty and fun.There are no negatives to Don't Starve: this is game at it's finest. -Developers open to suggestion, always adding new and exciting content.-A welcoming and inspiring community.-A game that challenges you to think but remains fun.

I had always been fond of it, but playing it was far better than I could have imagined.Don't Starve has won a very special place in my heart. So much that I even bothered with a review.One of my favourite titles of all time.Can't be  Recommended Highly Enough "

												If your a fan of games which don't hold your hand from the get go and are actually quite challenging to the extent that you will no doubt die multiple times during your time playing but which also reward skilled play and efficient micromanaging, then this is the game for you!Engaging, immersive and enjoyable experience. You will find yourself actively making mental notes on what to do the next day, stocking up on vegtatles for winter and scouting for animals to hunt to get loot which will accelerate you into the games not so obvious progression curve.Even once you have a fully established base with a constant supply of food and a surplus of anything, you will still end up dying to the natural environment. This game encourages you to be thinking on your feet and be ready for anything, whether that be an incomming wolf attack, or a surprise giant you are always on your toes. Thats what makes this game so unique, there is no time to be bored while playing because you always have something to do and it feels good once you accomplish it. If you are not a fan of busy work tasks then you will also like this game, there are no objectives set in the game, you essentially set your own path and every task you set isnt one you do for the sake of doing it - its because you need to to survive.Looking forward to the Shipwrecked patched, cannot wait to sink in (lol get it!) hours of fun into the new content to come. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes rewarding games. I was skeptical at first when I saw the graphics, then I realised how ignorant I was, the art fits the theme perfectly and gives the game a bit of charm. Recommend!			"

												An unforgiving perma-death survival game with a Tim Burton aesthetic that rewards planning and management. A beef jerky you reluctantly ate on day 10 can lead to your demise on day 30. Features a diverse range of characters to play and a great modding community that promotes replayability. Who would have thought we'd see an indie survival game that actually functions properly.

												If you like hard, stressful, moody games, Don't Starve is for you.The rogue-like qualities of permadeath and procedurality have spread far and wide, and now we have Don't Starve, a survival game with a Tim Burton-esque aesthetic that demands you navigate a hostile world of unforgiving plants and wildlife. And then, come nightfall, deal with monsters.This game is equal parts stressful and fun. In directly proportional amounts.The lack of achievements just goes to show the game's focus: You can play this game however you want, change the spawning rate of specific plants and critters, the length of seasons, all of which would undermine achievements and their place in the community. But could make the game more fun, if you want to enjoy it that way.KLEI seems intent on polishing a single aspect of a game in each release, SHANK the action, Mark of the Ninja the stealth, and now Don't Starve the procedurality. Their previous games were tightly focused and linearly designed, but here we have something almost infinitely replayable. And incredibly unforgiving.Crafting, managing resources, and carefully avoiding conflict mean that long term you might manage to erect a homestead with a farm and wander the world with a loyal pet. More likely you'll die trying instead.But I like that. If you do, too, then this's for you.			"

												An awesome art style like if it was made by Tim Burton himself, an amazing OST in one of the most creepy open world games.ProsImmersive is one of the worlds that describe this game.An art style that makes you remember the Tim Burton movies, pretty well realized.The soundtrack is amazing and fit with the world in a outstanding way.Gameplay simple but well realized.Pretty original.Enjoyable and variated Characters.Lots of amazing mods.ConsDoesn't have a Tutorial.Its trial and error, and unforgiving, if you die you lose all.A really great game, if you like open world survival games this game is for you, and its not like the other games of the genre, this will give you a lot of surprises, especially if you lose your sanity.

Maybe you'll die from a spider attack,Or maybe you'll die from a raging wolf pack.Maybe you'll die from the sting of bees,Or maybe you'll die from a sentient tree.You could even die from a beefalo horde,Or possibly die with little sanity restored~At which point your shadows would begin to kill,Within the midst of all of these thrills.It's unlikely that you'll die from an ongoing storm,But good luck later on when snow begins to form,As you start to have trouble keeping things warm,Whilst nature breaks down and becomes deformed...Maybe a tallbird will ruin your day as you decide to grab your lunch,Pecking away at the trail you leave, persistent in it's hunch.And just when you get away from it's frighteningly large size,The montrous Krampus will come to grab both you and your prize.Perhaps the end will come to you just when you think you're safe,Your chests are set, your fire is lit and the grass begins to chafe.But, somehow, you will forget about the most important affair-Then soon your belly will start to scream in hopelessness and despair.When you scramble for warmth and shelter,When you battle big beasts on your own,When you worry about the the sweltering summer or the ghosts lying under gravestones,Make sure you remember the main point of this journey you are on,And make sure that this December,You Don'tStarve Alone.

												Simply, wow!  First look at the game, I loved the whimsical, gothy caricature artwork of the characters and environment.  I didn't survive the first night because I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do.  Round two, I lasted about 3 days.  I would have lived longer had I not gotten too much into exploration mode.Don't Starve is a quite the time/resource management game packaged into such a casual looking box.  It's quite complex.  With each time you die, based off of how long you survive, you earn experience points which helps unlock a new character to play with, each with their own quirks and personalities.I highly recommend this game and can not wait until they release the multiplayer version!

												Hi, The first big paragraph is me ranting about FPS games, if you want to hear about DS, skip down a bit... How to create a review that doesn't just repeat what everyone else has said 10, 000 times before? I don't know if I can, so instead I wish to share a little version of my journey through video games, and use that to explain why I settled on this huge gem, and why It's the first game in my library (about 420 as of this writing) That I paid full retail for.I'm a gamer. no, seriously, that's what I am. I play games, I collect games, I live games.*For reference,FPS=First Person ShooterPvP = Player Vs PlayerPvE = Player Vs EnvironmentI have always liked and preferred FPS single player shooters, and only much later did I start getting into skill based FPS (vs Perk based FPS - read: CoD is not in my games library. Shucks, Battlefield BC2 flet like a mistake to me after playing it, even for $4.89). I only started playing CS:Source to shut up some young know it all in my internet cafe. Next thing I'm playing tier matches on CS:GO with $800 of DLC in my account. Why? It's a tight, fast paced tactical game with the only advantage over the other guy being my skill, not my special gun.I actually can't remember why, but I got this urge to start playing some slower paced survival type games, I do know I was beginning to tire with the fastest fast paces of PvP, and often not knowing or caring about my teammates, as I'd be in a different match in 4 mins anyway. I tried with Nether which feels like PvE until some base camping 12yo snipes you from 3 blocks away. I got tired of getting 8h in and then permadeath to that. But all of a sudden, I like permadeath. You failed? start again. No, really. Start Again. Perks? Byebye. Guns? Gone. Here's a kitchen knife, go stab some guy with a full kit in the back. If it had true PvE, I might still be there. I wanted to give Nether a go, because other games like DayZ, etc already had a huge negative reputation. And I really don't like Zombie themed games except maybe Killing Floor, which is team based PvE, and they are clones, not zombies, but they are called Zeds... hmmm... Don't even know why I got KF in the first place, I think it was because it looked interesting and I actually wanted one of their other games, ""The Ball"" - a single player puzzle oriented FPS with no shooting but lots of squishy (Puzzle-Solving via Giant Rolling Artifact Of Death).So at some point, I saw this title, and instantly dismissed it as a cheap flash-based game that was popular in a similar way to ""Candy Crush"". Heh, that's what you get for not looking into something properly before forming an opinion. Wish I had - was on sale for half price with a second copy of the game for free. (I don't think Klei will ever do that again for this game). This game was suggested in a Nether thread I had started about wanting a better PvE experience. I'd put in a  list of requests/prerequisites that would make it a game I would want to play, and someone suggested Don't Starve to me again. I thought 'no', but I saw in one of their threads that they adamantly refused to add multiplayer, because they wanted to create the best single player experience possible. This had my attention, as I saw it as now being a truly PvE experience, and by this time, I was craving it.I likely would have got into this game much, much sooner if it had ever gone on sale. It only had sales in the early days, whilst it was still gaining traction. Now, they are planning on making it more expensive when they release the next DLC (multiplayer patch). So it's pretty well now-or-never.___________DS is a brutally unforgiving game. You are dropped of in the middle of nowhere, in a foreign world, no idea about anything, except that night is coming. You will die. but you will learn, and live to day two. then day 4, then 7, then 22 (trust me you're gonna die on day 22 the first time). but you learn, you progress, a little bit, a little bit more. You try this mushroom, nope - not good. But cook it, and it is good. There are no quick save / reloads, no retries, no mistakes because you will be greeted with the realities of permadeath and a new world generated, Day 1. The reason that I love it, is that it's open ended - the goal is to get through until tomorrow, and that is always the goal, and it never, never ends. It's often a slower pace than FPS, and you pick days dedicated to exploring, resource gathering, or building better defenses. You gather. You plan. But when the stuff hits the fan, it's all on, and if you get through it, it feels like an accomplishment, and brings a huge feeling of quiet (is that it? are they all gone?) and satisfaction, because, well, it's all you, and the odds are stacked against you. That, right there, might just be the reason this game is so great.Should you buy it? Is this game for you? Probably. Should you wait for it so go on special? I wouldn't hold my breath. Check out some Let's Plays. Read some reviews. ask an IRL  [In Real Life] friend if you can have a jam (you'll want to put 20h aside to start to get a feel for the mechanics of this game. Anything less wouldn't be a fair assessment. That's how deep it is). But if you want something challenging, rewarding, and a game that is designed around long-term play, you have found it.			"

												So the winter is almost over, and thanks to the crook pot I'm doing pretty good.And then the hounds came.I heard their houls in advance and prepared myself to deal with them by equiping my spear and grass armor.The beasts arrived and they numbered at least 6.The ghost of my dead sister tried protecting me but the beasts overwhelmed her, but not before she took down 2 of them.Unwilling to give up I ran a short way to a pack of Beefalos. I kited the hounds tru the pack and made them fight each others.I survived the hounds, but how long will it be until something else gets the best of me?----This game is AMAZING!It's hard, but with knowledge you can survive.I feel that there is little luck involved. Either you learn how to survive or the game will eat your character.The graphics are AWESOME!I love the ""Tim Burton style"" and the creepy victorian feel!I bought this game at a Christmas sale and I recomend you do the same.

												There's a definite element of horror to survival games. It could be the fear of a wild animal tearing apart your fragile corner of civilization, or simply the sickening realization that you planned poorly and you're going to starve to death. Don't Starve capitalizes on both of these fears and more, pitting you against a stretch of nature that isn't just inhospitable, but actively seeks your destruction. And if that sounds stressful and downright painful at times, you should have a good idea of what you're getting into.Don't Starve starts you off with a spread of characters to choose from (with more to unlock) and world customization options, and then deposits you into an isometric wilderness. Just about every object in the world is interactable and will become important to your survival and prosperity, but the initial steps are simple enough. Flint and twigs make tools for chopping wood and mining stone, which can be refined further into building materials that unlock new equipment options. You'll be setting up fully-featured camps but be aware that cabins and castles aren't in the cards... the best you can do is walls and some simple flooring.This feeling of permanent exposure is important to the atmosphere, because you are never fully safe in this cruel world. There's a pervasive sense of ancient evil to everything, from the twisted trees to the dead-eyed spiders to the writhing tentacles beneath the marshes. One key to survival is light, because without it the pitch-black night is certain death. I'm not just waxing poetic here, if you get caught in the dark for more than about five seconds, you die. But even a roaring campfire is no guarantee that marauding wolves, angry frogs, or far larger things won't end your life.Death is where the real tension of the game is, because death is permanent. No do-overs, no checkpoints, no reloads. When you die, that character and that world are gone. Now, permadeath has proven to work for short roguelikes but a game where you spend hours exploring a world and building a settlement is a whole different ballgame, and it's here that Don't Starve threatens to lose most of its audience. Dying in this game really, really, really sucks, because it's always from something perfectly avoidable, comes so quick, and wipes out literal hours of progress.So why beat your head against this game? Because as long as you DON'T die, it's an excellent survival simulator. You'll never reach a point where you're fully comfortable in the world, and there are always greater beasts and scarier places to overcome. Even the most basic materials remain relevant as your mastery over the land grows, and while you gain new ways to make gathering resources quick and painless, you still have survival tasks to complete. Eventually you'll be cultivating farms, researching artifacts, and preparing for harsh winters, all of which are involved and gratifying goals.You'll have to deal with some trial and error in finding the best ways to survive and use what you find, and that can mean some frustration as you learn to deal with food spoiling or beekeeping or other surprisingly lethal pastimes. But once you do there's a big, strange world to explore, and that's really only the beginning. There's a story mode hidden out there in the wilds that you'll only find once you master survival, and getting through THAT is its own grand adventure. Wrapped up as it is in charming hand-drawn graphics and rich sound design, there's plenty to keep you invested in Don't Starve. It's a game that asks for a lot of patience and understanding, but it's one of the few that really earn it, too.			"

IntroThis game was developed and published by Klei Entertainment. This game has received positive ratings from critics and users alike. Its mostly compared to other games like Minecraft and Terraria where the goal is survival. The main difference is that in those games mentioned above you are digging deeper and deeper and its usually about getting resources from the depths of the world. This game on the other hand is about utilizing resources on the surface for survival. Which brings about many difficulties as a result since you cannot hide in a cave for the winter.Difficulty:The permanent death component of this game really adds tension to surviving and trying your best to live the cruelty of the world. The difficulty really feels tailored made once you actually get into all the settings for making your own world. You basically have options over all enemies and resources to customize the world you desire in a fashion that you would want to explore it in. By having the player able to change the difficulty dependent on variables to such a degree they have made this game fun to replay over and over.WorldThe world can be medium to grand depending on what options the player chooses. However despite the size you end up with you will always feel like there is plenty to explore which is a important component of this game. The idea of exploring for resources, gathering them and utilizing resources to survive is important.CraftingThe crafting system was well done and has plenty of diversity of what you can create to enhance your odds of survival. Its interesting that you need the labs to first construct the objects but are able to construct them anywhere after your first time.GraphicsThe art direction is actually really good, the eeriness of the graphics combined with its other components really makes it stand out from other games, if you were to show me a ton of games i would never confuse it for don't starve.

												Fun and obscure, survive as many days as possible. Passing through the seasons, including a harsh winter that will kill him cold!Varied characters with unique characteristics facilitate their adaptation to the game. From various animals, such as rabbits common to more rare and buffaloes. Of course, without leaving out a dear friend and companion Chester.The gameplay is very simple and easy to understand, which can complicate a bit is the selection of items. Many materials and raw materials that you collect throughout the day, and this opens up new combinations and creating tools to help you on this journey. Worth it if you're a fan of survival kits.So buy this game as soon as possible and test how many days you managed to survive 20? 100? 1000? ... "

												Don't Starve is an indie game in the somewhat crowded genre of ""survive a hostile environment by crafting"". I bought it just as it went out of beta, drawn mostly by the TimBurtonesque graphics.I feel I gave Don't Starve a fair chance, investing 13 hours into it, although the prospect of abandoning it felt tantalizing after just 5. I have to be honest: 13 hours is far from enough to experience the most sophisticated tiers of crafting. It’s unfortunately more than enough to resent the experience and I’ll soon get to the reasons for that.But first, the positive. The initial impressions are excellent. The graphics are intriguing and can best be described as what a children’s pop-up book could look like if it was designed by Tim Burton. Almost all of the game's elements (animals, plants, …) are delightful and original. The only flaw in the graphics concerns some of the ground’s textures, which are slightly pixelated, at least on Full HD resolution. Music is rather sparse, but the sound effects are realistically bucolic and I loved the idea that when your character “talks” (in reaction to one of your commands), he/she does so with the sound of an orchestral instrument (luckily, with English subtitles)The first couple of hours with the game are great. You feel very free exploring your environment, and yet captive of the timing: night comes all too soon! At the very minimum, on your first day, you need to collect a couple of food items (even as weak as berries and carrots) and get enough material to make a fire, which itself requires an axe (that you also must craft on the first day). The next day, you must to learn to balance three vital gauges: heath, satiety and sanity. Should any of them reach 0, you’re history. Speaking of which, let me introduce you to your new nemesis…PERMADEATH! If you've played roguelikes in the past, you two have already met. If not, let me explain. Permadeath means that when you die, there is no pressing a load button and re-starting from a safe point from the past. The game allows you to save your progress, but only when you quit, so that you don’t have to play a full game in one session. But should you cross path with the Grim Reaper, Don't Starve will mercilessly and meticulously destroy any save file that might inhabit your hard drive, forcing you to go back to the very beginning each and every time you die. In many games, this is not problematic. Many roguelikes are fun to start again over and over, because their random world generation often comes up with a unique situation and/or because you can try a completely different strategy, maybe by creating a character of a different class.The problem with Permadeath in Don't Starve is that there aren't many different strategies in the beginning. Sure, after some in-game days, you can specialise your crafting in one way or another, but the first real-time hour will always be kind of similar. Which means it’s not fun any more after a point, and you’ll start to really dread the endgame, for the wrong reasons. The point of a crafting/surviving game like this, especially one where you have to figure out most everything by yourself, is to experiment, to try crazy things and hope for a reward. But here, with no way of knowing in advance if a new enemy is fair game or completely badass, experimenting often means dying, and being punished by re-playing the same boring first days.You’d be forgiven to think that Don't Starve's unlockable characters alleviate the above-mentioned problem. But you’d be wrong: they mostly add a bit of flavour to the game, but don’t offer any real potential for strategic diversification. As if repetitiveness wasn't enough, the world generation algorithm hates you. The algorithm basically creates a huge map made of different “biomes” (forests, plains, swamps…). A biome has a specific population of animals, plants and other resources. Some of those resources are really basic building blocks for crafting, yet the algorithm sometimes takes great pride in placing the biomes that host them very far from you. You therefore often have no other solution than to spend several in-game days running around without crafting anything useful, just because there is no gold or even plain rocks, anywhere near your starting position. Judging from my experience, it's not a rare occurrence. There are some interesting special features disseminated across the map, but they’re spread fairly thin. In the end, it's hard to understand why such a huge map was needed in the first place.The last major complain I have is perhaps partly inherent to the genre and therefore not entirely the game’s fault: an almost complete lack of information. I already explained how not knowing anything about an enemy could mean death by experimentation. But it’s the same for almost each of the game’s features. The crafting recipes are mostly public, but the uses and strengths of the crafted objects are not. So, I've crafted a helm or an armour: Just what difference does it make? Beats me. So, I see my sanity declining dangerously. Why? What can I do to improve the situation? The game never tells, leaving the player to try things and not always finding a satisfactory answer. There is a fan-made wiki that you can consult if you’re curious about this or that aspect. But it's still very difficult to find just the information you need without having other secrets spoiled for you at the same time. I really wish the game would give you clues, even infrequent and vague ones. At the very least, I expected the game to explain the controls, how to move my character or rotate the view. Turned out, I needed to visit the official forum for that too!Overall, I was extremely disappointed with Don't Starve. I find it hard to recommend to anyone, save maybe the most patients among you who don’t find repetitive grinding objectionable. It’s a shame really, because for the purpose of this review, I read a significant part of the Wiki, and there are some really neat ideas. But more of them should have been used to diversify the starting strategy and they also need to be spread less thin across the map.			"

Hold Me !! See i love this game!!! Don't Starve is a Indie/Adventure/Survival/Crafting/Sandbox game. I also love games like this that are Small in size and a good bit of content to keep the player engaged...even if you die over and over and over you will keep coming back for more lol The art style in this game is very whimsical and real good with a lot of good animations.The controls are done real well and have found no issues with them so far.I recommend a controller for this game it makes the game a bit more relaxed and faster to switch through the menus.This helps also in crafting and eatting and so on and so on.I also recommend getting the DLC also to add more to this already impressive game! The game also has Steam Workshop also so there are a good bit of mods and stuff to add to it!!!And also i think its real good they are also giving the new Stand Alone DLC Dont Starve Together FREE to all that bought Dont Starve !!! Even though i bought the Dont Starve MEGA BUNDLE (Came with it BETA) on the xmas Steam Sale lol I say if you love a good indie survival game ,i say pick this one up ASAP!! FYI dont punch a bee :P  "

Your withered husk will melt into the computer chair and it will be with the last wisp of willpower that you'll manage to direct your trembling skeletal hand to uninstall it, freeing you from this torment. You will be free. You will finally be able to get up and go to the bathroom.It's very good, is what I'm saying.			"

												This game is the epitome of obscenity. It starts off innocent enough, promising a nice ""build-to-survive"" experience, until you glance at the clock and realise you've lost most your day. It takes a fair bit to get into the swing of things, having to learn how to play from scratch as there is absolutely no hand-holding in this game. But it still somehow remains simple enough to grasp quickly, and yet complicated enough that you continue to discover new things with each play. First time I managed to work out how to not die immediately, I lasted 16 days, until death by giant bees. The rage I felt to then have to start again, from scratch, in a new completely randomly generated world left me unable to keep playing. And yet, same time the following day I had returned, if not out of desire to play, as much as a desire to flip the birds at this game, so that it knows it has not beaten me yet. Highly addictive, very engrossing, and overall just a really awesome concept. I definately would recommend this game.			"

												Don't Starve is the kind of game with a steep learning curve, and a process of discovery which can only truly 8e analysed through trial and error. This is a recurring theme, too, as the Game is permanently Permadeath, and is incredibly unforgiving. Admittedly, I did only get this game for the pre-order Hats for tf2, but I must say I haven't been disappointed. Don't Starve is small and easy to run on even the oldest computers, and a good way to pass the time if you are unfortunate to not have access to multiplayer games (Like me ;-;). The design scheme is sinister and eerie, but never actually scary. The game is all about surviving, and is more about managing resources than anything. Multiplayer was always a heated de8ate, 8ut finally the developers have decided to add it to the game, finally. So, with more DLCs and Multiplayer to look forward to, the game is only getting 8etter			"

												""So much to do, so much to see""Don't Starve is a beautiful challenging survivor indie game.In this game you explore the world and craft different things and of course don't die.This game is also little bit humorous and it keeps getting updates, so it's fun to play and it has many hours of gameplay.In Don't Starve there is currently 9 different characters (11 if you buy the Reign of giants DLC) with their own unique abilities.When you die you can always start a new save with a different character, and the world is always different.

												I blink. I appear in a strange new world only to be suddenly confonted by a sleek man wearing a rather dapper suit and top hat! I was confused and scared, yet somehow comforted by the man, probably due to the strong sence of security he held. I could roughly make out the words: ""Say pal, you don't look so good."" ""You'd better find something to eat before night comes!"" his figure then swiftly decended into the ground in a puff of smoke. I trembled, I had somehow braised my knee, as I rose to my feet, my head dizzy and aching. i didn't have a clue how I got here, I only knew that I had to find some food and some supplies to make it through the night. Frantically, I began to run across the luscious meadow in search of some food that I could ravage.After what seemed hours, I finally spotted a bush that contained some sort of red, exotic berry that I could pick. As I approched the bush It became clear to me that the berries could be poisonous, despite their decieving looks. However as I looked up to the sky and took a glimpse of the savage birds circling me, I saw that the only viable option, and inevitable, was to rob the bush of its resources. I reached for the crimson berries, my mouth watering, when out of the blue a majestic turkey looking creature sprung from the bush, stole the berries and made its escape with great speed. I set off to chase the gobbler, that is what I had come to call it due to its adept ability to steal berries, however realising it was beyond my reach, I took off in another direction looking for another cache of food. Hours later the sun began to set and the birds flew away to some distant land as if they were afraid of something. I had aquired a vast quantity of sticks, flintstones and grass tufts on my travels, but still no food. I had lost all hope on finding any source of sustenance and my chances of survival, yet the image of the dark, sleek man was the coal in the furnace of my shrivelled body. Suddenly a rare sight in this harsh world: a dead rabbit; mine for the taking. I lifted its limp corpse as saliva built up in my mouth. It was time. Without realising, a dark blanket covered the sky in a matter of seconds, envoloping my body in total darkness. But I didn't care. I became a feral beast and ripped into the lifeless rabbit with my teath, tearing its flesh from its body. However I felt a tickle on my leg, something had brushed passed me. I took no notice and continued with my soul rejuvenating meal. Before I realised my legs were ripped out of their sockets, cold blood splattering across my face. I screamed for help, but only recieved the soft, lonely chirping of the crows. I lay there for a few seconds reviewing the few hours I had lived, cuddling what was left of my rabbit, before my head was pulled from my neck in a slight struggle. In my last few seconds all I heard were the wicked screeches of the wind and the laughing of the dark, sleek man.Brilliant game with a fantastic community, I love this game and is one of my all time games. I can't wait for the multiplayer and some more awesome things that klei will produce. 10/10			"

												So far my favorite game ever. TF2 coming in at a close second, this game. THIS GAME. I cannot express how awesome and entertaining this is, and just to top it off it's easy and fun to mod! (I modded the game myself, not so much now) The amount of content those updates in those 6 months of free updates was just immense. The fact we HAD updates for 6 months is amazing in itself, and now we're getting a DLC! I cannot wait for the amount of content that'll probably overwhelm me... BUY. THIS. GAME.			"

												The concept art of the game gives it a unique vintage look. I'ts a funny indie survival game.Let's resume the gameplay: ""You wake up and you've realised that you are lost in a forest, what will you do?"". The gameplay is basically that, you have to survive as many days as possible by collecting resourses, crafting stuff and eating food that you collect/craft. Also remember to put some lights at night.			"

												One scientist, nature, wilderness, night, cold, food, dangers, friends and enemies. All is good as long as you ""don't starve"". The amazing visuals (Tim Burton like artwork) and music sets the tone well for this masterpiece. In Don't Starve they tell you nothing about your adventure as it unfolds. You will start out with no knowledge, and will run around grabbing objects until you find out how to build things. Whenever you discover something new, it adds it to a list of item to build. This is truly fantastic progression.Don't Starve is a incredible game and with the updates they keep putting out every few weeks, this is a game that I will keep playing for a very long long time. 10/10			"

												A surprisingly immersive and aesthetic game that is effortless to get into and play for hours on end. It's entertaining for hardcore gamers and casual gamers alike and as much as it is engaging to play alone, it is also fun to play alongside others even without DST. I can easily run it on a laptop not built for any type of gaming which is a huge plus especially for a game so well rounded. This is one that I recommend anyone curious to try out at least once because the odds seem to definitely be in favour of your liking it. Please be warned that it is extremely addictive. Those who have enjoyed Minecraft or frequent games where the object is building or/and surviving etc will be thrilled with Don't Starve. Have fun! ;)			"

												TL;DR: skip to the verdict at the bottomThis game is a masterpiece. It truly shines in comparison to the other modern survival games.The art style really fits with the game's setting, making for one of the best immersion experiences out there.Other survival games *cough* The Forest *cough* give you a handful of starting items and tips when you press the magnificent ""new game"" button.Well,no,♥♥♥♥ you, The Forest.In Don't Starve,you are told literally NOTHING about the enviroments that surround you,what can kill you, or what is edible.It is the authentic survival experience, where you wake up in the middle of nowhere, with absolutely no idea of what you are going to do next.That brings me to the learning curve. It is a really harsh and unforgivable one (Dark Souls style),but once you get used to it, and that should be after your first 5 worlds created, you will get the hang of what's what in the world of Don't Starve.Heat kills you, hunger kills you,spiders kill you,pretty much never ask yourself the question ""what does that thing do?"".You will regret it a short 10 seconds afterwards.Where the gameplay can't do the job, atmosphere is further more created by the Tim Burton-ish twisted art style,with a slight touch of a cartoon character design.This game is also a true teacher. In my humble 30-ish hours of trying not to starve, I learned that frustration never leads to something good,so don't get mad the first 5 times when you die,it's part of the game, and it's a healthy method of learning the ropes and the mechanics.Basically, the trial and error system would be the best description of your first playthroughs.The game is full of new content, it makes sure that you always discover something just when you tought that there couldn't be more to it, so don't worry, it is NOT a short game, nor one with an empty open world.The DLC, Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked, expand the content of it to whole new levels,easily adding 60 more hours of gameplay to the 50-ish of the original content and the 100+ ones that mods add, and (I can't believe I'm saying it), they are worth their full price.Verdict: If you want a serious survival game with tons of content and an expansive open world, tough with a harsh learning curve, but that is worth your time, Don't Starve is perfect for you.Actually,scratch that,Don't Starve is for you no matter what kind of survival game you are looking for.Just try it,because I'm giving it a 10/10.

												Okay, first thing first. Thank you for the gift, George.At the first glance, I don't know anything or have any ideas about what this game is supposed to be (well, no instruction, almost no tips, nothing, only funny dialogues when clicking on certain objects), but that all makes sense, and it's quite interesting.- You have an inventory to (of course) store things to help you survive (light up a fire, foods - including flower petals, seeds, carrot,...).- You have basic recipes to make useful tools like axe, traps,... for what? The player must figure his/herself.That being said, I have survived for 5 days. If I have time, I will re-install this thing. It's a good game, but I have something else to play also. I will continue play this later on (and they provided a CD Key to redeem on Google for every single copy).Oh, no achievement, sad, but no.			"

												Well I have been a fan of Don't starve for quite some time. Pretty much back when it was in beta, back before caves, back before rabbits had an ai. Watching it progress has been interesting.So this game is a survival... sorta horror game? It is hard to say it has things happen that are kinda creepy. The point of this game is to try to stay alive for as long as you can. It is easier said than done. Throughout the game you will have problems trying to stay alive. Hazards include hunger, wetness, heat, freezeing, monsters, giants, the dark, sanity, seasons, thunder, and fire. So basicly you start the game if you can survive long enough you will be able to get a little camp going and have enough food to live off of. But things in this game never go your way. Random mobs sometimes attack at the worst times, and bosses can randomly come and destroy your ""house"" and set your crops a blaze. This is basicly one of those games where you can be having fun and then your fun will be ruined and you will go sour on the game. Pretty good for an indie game, I give it...8.5/10.Ah, almost forgot, console commands![dont-starve-game.wikia.com](`) So you can cheat your heart out and not starve!			"

												-Rabbits are trolls-Night is no time to rest-No animal is innocentDon't Starve throws you into the wild, and uses everything it's got to kill you, literally. Did you build a farm? Good because I hope your well fed because were going unlease a pack of angry dogs at you. Did you kill those dogs, did you? Well, you just ran out of food and to get more you'll have to go across the other side of the map. Oh, good your still alive, then I guess we can test this forest monster on you. Don't Starve guides you to progressively find intuitive ways to survive, but with perma-death around the corner, lurking behind your every shadow, you'll be doomed to start over again. That's right, Don't Starve challenges you to cheat death.Recommend purchasing the 19.99 bundle or the mega pack...Now who wants to go make some science - Cave Johnson, founder and CEO of Aperture Science...

												In this clever, strange and unforgiving surivival game, you have one job over all else:DON'T STARVE.With that being said, it's perfectly fine to:-Surivive.-Die.-Fight off spiders.-Go insane.-Have an army of Pigs.-Cheat Death.-Annoy Maxwell.-Be a Gentleman and a Scientist at the same time.-Become a pyromanic.-Have a twin sister that's a ghost.-Be the strongest there is by over-eating.-Be a humanity hating robot.-Wonder why you aren't in your library.-Have a talking axe and a dark secret.-Become the weakest Mime there is, but hey, balloons!-Get murdered by pengulls.-Learn to respect nature the hard way.-Try to escape.-Have the slim chance of getting destroyed by a giant Deerclops.-Start a forest fire.-Scream a refrence while getting chased by bees.-Find a herd of Beefalo.-Get run over by a herd of Beefalo.-Play a cruel version of Splunky.-""WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SPIDERS?!""-Fail.-Try again.-Get farther, but fail again.-Unlock secrets.-Tense up when you hear howling in the distance.-Become who ever's a playable character in the workshop.-Wonder what happens when you jump in a wormhole.-Get hunted by a fashionable Walrus.-Science!-""OH, IT BURNS!""-Get hunted by robots protecting statues.-Many other wacky occurances-Realise you can never win.Yet dispite all that...You'll laugh. You'll yell. You'll wonder why you even bought this game in the first place. But you'll retry, and retry, and get better. Then realize that you haven't even touched the mulitplayer or the DLC.10/10			"

												If you enjoy playing survival games; you'll love Don't Starve. In this game you will die a lot and realize how much this game hates you. However, for every death you will gain knowledge of the game and experience to unlock other characters whom all are different and unique. You start off by collecting many items such as wildgrass and twigs so that you can survive for the first couple of nights but, the game get progressively harder with each passing night which makes this game so challenging. Once you die in this game, the game deletes your save file and you have to start all over from scratch but, the games world generator always keeps the game fresh and new for you. The community workshop also has many mods to help assist you in learning the game as well as adding new characters that already exist from other games,shows or even just made up.For some, Permadeath in this game is what ruins it. For others it gives the game a more realistic feel to the game. There are various guides and tutorials on Don't Starve but, I highly recommend not looking at it because the beauty of Don't Starve is finding out yourself the ups and downs. There are also various ways to give you an ""extra"" life such as touching the pig alter or the life giving amulet.Here are some of my experiences of the game:-1st time playing- Day 0: I spawn and start collecting items. I see a pig alter unsure of what it does and avoid it. I see an odd white sphere out of the ground and proceed to head towards it. I am ambushed by spiders and die.Day X (Can't Remember what day): I see the odd white sphere which I know now is a spider nest. I approach the nest and kill the first spider that greets me. The other 2 come out of the nest, eat the meat of their fallen brethren and proceed to chase me.Day 35: The Deerclops is chasing me and has killed all the beefalo with 2 hits. I proceed to shoot a fire dart at him which kills him, and starts burning all the drops from the beefalo. I run to the drops panicing and die to the fire from all the drops. I respawn from one of the pig alters that I had previously touched and immediately get ambushed by 6 hounds.Day 48: While I am collecting berries from the row of berry bushes I had gathered, it starts to rain. After a couple of minutes a lightning bolt hits one of the nearby trees burning all the bushes. Today is sad day.11/10 would attempt to survive again			"

												It's a game where you don't starve.But, it's more than that.These days, games are just for entertainment value and fake praise. That's cool and all, but, this game does more than that. In this game, you not only eat, but you explore a randomly generated world, ranging from the aboveground and underground, plus many biomes to explore and traverse, like the Forest, Savannah, Swamp, etc.There's also a wide range of different characters to unlock. Some unlock by gaining EXP (Which you earn when you die or other reasons), or when you do a in-game action, which unlocks them!Plus, this game is updated regularly, with all new kinds of new content to explore and discover! There could be simple bug fixes or changes to items, or even something big like a new biome! This brings the player back so they can explore the new content and see what it does and how it's affects them!This game reminds me of an arcade game -- you see how many points you get (or, how many days you can survive), until you eventually die. When you do eventually die, you may ask ""How the heck did I die!?"" But that's the fun in it! As you progress, you face greater and more challenging things to face and survive from! And, by dying, you learn more about the game, so you'll want to do it again and last longer and longer!So, that's my two-sense on this game. It's overall a fun little experience those Cod and Minecraft fans should experience, so they can see that there's more to life than gunfire and a bad game! "

												Don't Starve is a wilderness survival game.  You are left in a world to explore, set up camp, and above everything else... Don't Starve!   Here's my review as a disabled gamer (I play with only a mouse).


YouTube™ Video: Can I Play... Don't Starve? 

			Views: 222		

			Are you a disabled gamer... ever saw a game, and wondered ""Can I Play That""? Do you need to see options and settings for accessibility? You're not alone! Join me as I test options and find out...		

Don't Starve begins in Full Screen but you can immediately access options to change to windowed mode.  Windowed mode is borderless so you can access your desktop without exiting the game.  No colorblind settings were in the options.  Mouse only gamers can play with ease.  When you start this game you may not see your friends or family for weeks...  the game is just that good!  Everything can be controlled with simple mouse clicks, a few keyboard buttons can help you lower your right clicking and adjust camera settings.  You can left click to move your character collect objects or attack.  For keyboard only gamers the news isn't as good.  You can walk using wasd & collect items with space.  My problem came when trying to access build menus.  I personally never found a key to access them and looking through forum posts I failed to find a solution.  If keybindings do become available,  I'll definitely update notes here!			"

												This game is HARD.  You get thrown into it with no tutorial, no explanation and no help.  Not gonna lie - I ended up looking a lot of things up at the beginning because I don't deal with these types of games very well.  However, you learn quickly and it gets to the point where you don't care why you're in this other world, why there are shadow creatures trying to kill you, etc.  You just have to survive.  There's a lot of item collection and the opportunity to build bigger and better defenses, offenses, etc. There's no real right or wrong way to play this game.  You will probably die a lot but there is tons of replayability.			"

 Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  is a standalone expansion to the base survival game  Don't Starve . Let it be known that I have not played the original game to any extent and my impressions are based on the expansion and its content.  Narrative  The narrative is entirely freeform and allows the player to create their own story according to personal playstyle. Your enjoyment in this regard is mostly limited to your own imagination. However, each playable character has his or her own personality quirks, quips and unique gameplay interactions. For example, my favorite character is a snotty librarian who is able to bypass certain tech restrictions due to her vast intelligence and in exchange is unwilling to eat spoiled food.   Gameplay  Due to the nature of permadeath games, the player's response to death is paramount to whether or not the game succeeds. When the player inevitably sees the ""You died"" screen, frustration will be a natural response. However, does the player feel enticed to try again? Has the player learned valuable information that will serve to prevent the same death from occurring?  Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  succeeds for the most part in this regard. For example, at a predetermined time a certain mob will spawn and attack the player. This acts as a test to see if the player has adequately prepared. The first time I had to fight this mob, I instantly died - I was  not  prepared. How could I be? I did not know that the pounding footsteps and the shaking ground were signs of my coming death. However, during my second attempt, I realized that this certain mobs' movements were incredibly predictable and burdened with a long attack animation. I kited them and dispatched them with ease. Five minutes later, while congratulating myself with a hearty vegetable stew, I was punched to mincemeat by a enraged ent revenging his fallen children who I had unwittingly used as my kindling for said stew. And so the ouroboric cycle of punishment/information/success/punishment continued. During the downtime when you are not being chased by rabid sharks or angry buffalo, you will spend your time traveling from island to island in search of new materials, new technologies and establishing bases of operation. There is also a beautiful settings menu with ample customization options for certain mobs/events/seasons/resources to be tweaked, increased or even removed. Do you really love picking berries? Increase the berry bush seed. Do you HATE @#(%@^( KLEPTOMANIC MONKEYS? Remove the monkeys... Or just feed them a banana next time, recruit them permamently, and start a primate civil war. Watch their monkey huts burn down; watch the baby monkeys scream for mercy while you lounge by the shore sipping some iced tea and listening to Rage Against the Machine. Sensory  The art style looks like the baby of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and American McGee's Alice: sharp lines and bright, contrasting colors all wrapped up in a twisted design. You will never look so good being mutilated over and over again. The sounds are interesting, unique, and did not devolve into repetition. However, the musical soundtrack needed more variance - I eventually listened to my own music and was perfectly content. Conclusion  Do you enjoy being slapped in the face repeatedly by someone other than your wife? Do you relish the idea of convincing monkeys to murder each other with their own feces? Are you titillated by the notion of spending five hours building an empire only to die from a coconut falling on your head?  Do you enjoy complex games with a myriad of gameplay elements which allow you to play your own game against the game? If you said yes to the above then  Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  is a game definitely worth dying.			"

												Don't Starve is a 2013 action-adventure video game with survival and roguelike elements, developed and published by the Canadian indie company Klei Entertainment. The game was initially released via Valve's Steam software for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on April 23, 2013. A PlayStation 4 port became available the following year and further versions for iOS and mobile phones are under consideration. Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30, 2014, and a multiplayer expansion called Don't Starve Together became free for existing users on June 3, 2015.[1]The game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark, dreary world and must survive as long as possible. Toward this end, the player must keep Wilson healthy, fed, and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him. The game's ""Adventure"" mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's antagonist, Maxwell.Time by time, you unlock more valuable and specific-abilities characters.'Rate: 11/10			"

												This game really turned me against myself. A part of me really liked the game, while another was eagerly waiting to get off. Dont Starve is a survival game that blends a unique style of artwork with a fasinating story. By all means, the story is very well done and the gameplay is not bad, and if you like survival this is the game for you, but somewhere it just failed. It failed when it came to replay value, or how much you can play a game after you have finished it once. i felt that it started getting repetetive, doing the same things over and over for the same objective. Overall, i do recommend this game to anyone who loves survival, but i would only buy it if it were on sale.			"

												Picked some flowers, dug up a grave, found a gem, made a ice wand, ate some pork, burned a pig villiage, killed the pig villiage survivors, went through a worm hole, went back throught the worm hole, ate some berries, sat down, made a backpack, cooked some rabbit, shaved a beard, went insane, saw shadow people, lit a torch, ran form shadow people, torch ran out, watch my arm get torn off, died.

												Minecraft as a rouguelike experience drawn in a style I associate somehow with the works Tim Burton. It's funny, dark, difficult and pretty addictive. First time you die after a new personal record streak of survived days, you'll find yourself cursing and frustated...for about 10 seconds and then restart the game. Highly recommended for those who enjoy rouguelike and sandbox games. Also, the devs are updating the game with new content constantly. One of the few games I have in my library I'm always looking forward to see what's new.			"

												Let's make it quick: I believe Don't Starve is the best sandbox survival game in the market. Whatever the price, the lower the better. Just buy it. The DLC as well, especially the multiplayer standalone expansion: Don't Starve Together. Why?Because it's really well made right from the start. Don't Starve has a very robust system in place within the gameplay. Despite being a survival game, it plays out almost like a 4X strategy. To survive, you need to eXplore the world. eXploit its riches, eXpand yourself and your base of operation, and eXterminate the enemies that threaten your life. Except you're just playing a guy, not an empire or somethingThe visual is fantastic. It has a very distinguished art style that people can easily recognize. The animation is smooth like a cartoon on TV. The characters are all unique and plays very differently. The monster are varied with its challenge and the world, oh the world... It pose a lot of question. It begs to be explored.It's really great that the devs didn't cop out with retro pixel art like a lot of other indie game out there and it really shows. Very few of those game looks decent and most simply look terrible. Don't Starve is a proof that hiring actual artist is worth it.I absolutely have fun playing the game and can't reccommend it enough.EDIT: I nominated this game for Steam ""Steam Best Use of Farm Animal"" Award			"

												""Don't Starve"" is an amazing survival game that manages to merge the beauty of Tim Burton's well known art style together with the normal aspects of survival that you'd find in games like Terraria or Minecraft.It's a game that'll challenge you, even if you get the hang of things. It's a dark, twisted survival game where even the friendly pigs will eventually try to kill you. To survive, you will have to scavenge, build things, and defend yourself - all while paying attention to both the environment and your own wellness (hunger, mentality & health). The developers of the game (Klei Entertainment) are also constantly adding new content to the game, making it a game that'll offer hours of endless fun (and to times, bits of frustration too).Conclusion: Buy it.

												This game is addicting.The style of the game in my opinion fits this scenario and the humor behind it is clever.The game offers you countless hours of fun and plenty of stuff to do around.One thing I love about it is the fact that once you're dead..you're dead.This makes you stay in constant fear of losing all of the progress and this fear only intensifies with the progress you make.Again,the number of things you can do are almost countless.You can set a whole forest on fire just because you want to or because you want to kill something that is after you!You can explore caves and fight bats and spiders or just build yourself a small town from which you can sustain yourself without exploring.You can choose to be a explorer and wander from one place to another to try and discover new creatures and new resources.The replay ability of this game is insane due to the fact that the game has tons of good mods and that the devs put so much work into releasing a lot of free updates.Also the game randomly generates the world,that means you will never have the same experience twice.

												Jeeeeeeesuuussssssssssssss, I just love this game. When I first booted it up, I was perfectly normal about it. I didn't think much of it in the game menu, but immediately when I spawned in my first world, a man appeared and said I have to prepare food and shelter before dark, I am on my own, and he drops me off in the middle of nowhere. Right when I saw him, I cracked a jolly smile. The man was tall, in a suit, holding a briefcase, and with dark brown hair. Sound familiar? Yes. Very. What? Dafuq? Not familiar? Well, let me give you a hint. GMAAANNNNN. Yea, NOW, does it sound familiar? required resources are randomly scattered along the terrian, and different biomes containing many useful resources. The great thing about these resources, is just so cool. Picked up something useless? Not possible. Everything has it's own purpose. I just love that. When The day turns to night, EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. Im not kidding you, EVERYTHING goes black. And you get hit by... something... And you die in a matter of seconds. This, of course, can be avoided by building a torch or a campfire, which are very cheap items. There are so many good things about this game, if I listed all of them, this review would be 45 paragraphs long, so I'm just gonna stop writing here. I highly recommend this game and if you have a spare 15 bucks, buy it. Immediately. Or I'll eat you. Well, anyways thanks for reading, goodbye!			"

												10/10Easily the diamond of the survival genre, with so many unique and wonderful ideas.  Don't starve is a unique take on said genre, with an almost 'cute' gothic tim burton esque aesthetic containing characters that literally exist purely to make your life a misery, chase you, eat you, crush you, sting you, hunt you, steal your♥♥♥♥♥♥ evict you, destroy you and your base, backstab you, become mobile npc bases that still hate you and there is even an npc that goes on a spree looting the map of all resources. I can remember when this first came out and played from like 7pm until about 4am one time and i loved every second. The game starts you off with no tutorial or explanation to anything at all. You are required to fend for yourself in this unforgiving land of permadeath and bees, and if you are the more casual sort of player i'd highly recommend giving the wiki a look as it may explain some things. You must fend for yourself, build a camp, set up crops and as the title implies...don't starve. But starving is the least of your worries. Everything in this game exists to murder you in ways you never thought possible. On top of that, you must worry about your sanity, temperature and health as well. Too many spider bites and you'll die. Been out in the night for too long? You'll go insane and even the shadows will be out to kill you. Oh look, it's become winter! Good luck, because you'll need to wear some nice warm clothes or you'll freeze to death! The game does have some less than lethal additions to it as well. You can come across villages of friendly pig men who you can befriend and trade with, which is wonderful since they are can sometimes be farmers, giving you free resources, food and even defence as the pig men are rather hostile towards monsters.This game really is bursting at the seams with content here and the maps are even randomly generated to ensure that no playthrough is like another. Even if you manage to ""beat"" survival mode by finding all of the tele-portato parts an exploring the cave systems for super duper loot, you can always play campaign for increasingly hard scenarios that are really fun as well. Avoid bees. Avoid all the bees.			"

												One of the most fun and addicting games I've played. Originally played console version on PS4, but had to pick up the steam version to play on my computer. The controls are great once you get used to them. There are an endless number of things to do, and every time you play, you discover something new. It's a little confusing at first, but stick with it and you get better with each playthrough. This has quickly become one of my favorite games. Great community support and mods in the Steam workshop as well!			"

A while back I reviewed this as boring, basic and lacking. And it was. I played during the first days of release, and didn't give it enough time to get interesting. After sinking a ton of hours into this and still finding new things to want to check out, mess around with, explore and unlock, it's safe to say Don't Starve is a well made and interesting game.It's stacked with charm and intrigue. It still has a dead end in terms of discovery, tech and gameplay, like any survival or city sim game, but it's going to take you a lot longer to get there in Don't Starve than most other games. It's also fuelled by lots of strange little gameplay mechanics and items that you find along the way.I haven't even touched the DLC yet, and I'm not the greatest fan of survival games, but Don't Starve has definitely given me my moneys worth after investing a little time and effort.Pretty boring survival game. Don't Starve starts off with the same feeling you get playing Minecraft for the first time: You want to collect food and items to survive the first night and it's pretty exciting and fun.Unfortunately this is about it, and after the first few days of experimenting and finding out what everything does all you're left with is exploring and fighting. Fighting never really seems very exciting and has no real purpose other than maybe collecting items, and exploring seems like a waste of time since it doesn't help you survive any longer (which ultimately is the goal of the game). As a result this game gets boring very quickly and there doesn't appear to be much to do.Pretty boring survival game. "

 Long Story ShortDon’t Starve is an extremely difficult masterpiece that will take you 50+ hours in order to learn how to survive in this unforgiving universe. The art style is unique and the sounds/music is beautiful and creepy.  The game play is outstanding and it will, whether you want it to or not, draw you in for hours of game time without giving you a chance to take a break. You’ll probably starve in real life before you can put your controller down. It’s without a doubt a 10/10 and is one of the few games I think couldn’t even be improved upon. Long Story Long- The Game PlayDon’t Starve is a survival game and therefore your only natural objective is to survive. This is accomplished by keeping your sanity, hunger, heath, warmth, and sogginess in check. In order to do so, you’ll gather resources, make your camp, plant crops, craft recipes, etc. in order to create a working outpost. The game will constantly become more difficult as Maxwell, the villain, sends his hounds to attack you, you run out of any resource, and then there is the ever looming threat of winter. Variations to the game playThis game is almost 100% customizable whether you want more or less tall birds, no winter, or if you want to commit suicide by making it permanently night.  There are also several unlockable characters that all have different stats, starting items, and uses. Lastly, you can, if you’re lucky enough to find a rare portal where you’re able to switch to adventure mode where you are plopped in a premade world, opposed to the randomly generated worlds in survival mode, where you attempt to live past the more increasingly difficult worlds you’re put into in order to make it to the next and, eventually, toss Maxwell off his throne of lies!Music and SoundThe creators of Don’t Starve cut no corners when it comes to the music and sound effects. The music is beautiful, exiting, and darn right creepy depending on the circumstances. In fact, me and my roommate once did a scientific experiment in order to see if playing frightening music, in this case music from Don’t Starve, at night while we were asleep would affect our dreams or not. We both had nightmares. The sound is also perfect for whatever action is happening. I often want to eat my food reserve just so I can hear Wilson munching away at the meat or kill a spider so I can hear it shriek.ArtThe art style for Don’t Starve is completely original and shows character for objects through its harsh strokes or gentile lines. Combined with the music and sound, the art gives the player a perfect atmosphere that, in my opinion, has never been matched by another survival game.DLC and Don’t Starve TogetherThe DLC for Don’t Starve, Reign of Giants, adds craftibles, items, enemies, and even two whole freaking seasons! If you ask me, this DLC adds difficulty and challenge to this already challenging game and, unless you’ve played lots of survival games, I wouldn’t suggest using it till you’ve at least made it till winter in the normal version. As far as Don’t Starve Together goes, it adds a little content as well as making the game significantly easier. I’d suggest you’d get it if you’ve already bought and liked the original but find yourself wanting to shake things up by tossing in some other players. ConclusionGame play- 10/10. Music and sound- 10/10. Customizability - 10/10. Art style- 10/10. DLC- 10/10. This is the best survival game I’ve ever played or ever seen played.  It’s addicting, entertaining, and challenging. Without a doubt it’s one of my top ten favorite games. It’s also one of four games I think is as flawless as humanly possible.  Oh course, like all games, there is those who won’t enjoy it. So if you’re someone who doesn’t normally enjoy intense, extremely difficult games, the most likely won’t find Don’t Starve appealing. However, to anyone that doesn’t fall in this category, I’ll say this: Don’t Starve is a chef-d'oeuvre, a masterpiece beyond words, perfected in every way, and I can’t suggest it enough. Final rating- 100/100 one of the few perfect games on this earth.			"

												YES! YES! Another Minecraft themed game, not first person, not 3D but that's what makes this game unique, Almost as good as Minecraft if not better. In this game, you are given a character (you unlock characters later) and you need to survive for as long as you can, picking up resources that will aid in getting you a weapon or Light Sources and helping you in battle. There are lots of food for you to pick up which in my opinion was limited in Minecraft. This game also gives you access to Mods so you can download Mods from the steam workshop which i find helpful especially the mods that have a neverending light source. I am loving this game. This game lets you save your progress, Food is much easier to find than in Minecraft. Some of the features are better than Minecraft already. This is a 2D Minecraft! Simple as that. I definitely recommend you buy this game because it has come to the point where every Steam user MUST have a copy of this game. 10/10 Fricking Awesome			"

												This game is unique. The gameplay is awesome. It's not too hard nor too easy. The graphics are nice. There are many funny character which you can unlock by surviving as much as you can and when you die you get experience points which unlock your characters. Even more there are mods which you can download for free which makes the game even better. All in all I recommend this for every person who likes survival games. I rate it 10/10!			"

												The game really revolves around collecting basic ingredients and crafting them into survival gear/items. You are going to want to collect food RIGHT away, you will get hungry fast. You are going to want to cook this food with fire. You are also going to want to build tools like axes, pickaxes, etc and harvest quite a bit of raw materials. Then you are going to want to build science machines in order to build better tools/survival gear/weapons.Combat is fairly basic, click and run is the general tactic. I really think this is a wiki friendly game despite spoilers. You should learn about what items you want and how to craft them by searching a wiki.This is really a fun game.  The Devs have released a ton of content and fixes since then and continue to update once a month or so. And the good part is if you have a low - end pc you can run it though with the netbook modus.

												Don't Starve is one of those games that put you right up on the difficulty roller coaster making you learn as you go with no real direction as what you are supposed to do. This lets you explore things slowly as you begin to get better at surviving and unlocking new characters along the way to keep the game a bit more fresh. The Reign of Giants DLC gives you more unique items and adversaries to play with.Overall, this game is great. One of my personal favorites on Steam.			"

												In its minimal and simple atmosphere, Don't Starve succeeded where many failed: delivering a balanced, challenging and story driven survival game.As the obvious main focus is to survive (and how hard it can be at the beginning!), the player will progress through a story that has an impact in the game (trying to avoid any potential spoilers).The survival machanism is traditional and unique at the same time:There are many resources to loot, and several items can have multiple uses (for example pine cones can be planted, used as fuel to feed the fire or become crafting material); exploring the land around you not only gets you to secret or story-related areas, but also signals how the world changes due to nature rhythm (for example seasons will progress and according to them resources may grow again faster or slowlier, the day/night cycle will change), moreover, it is always best NOT to explore during the night: the land becomes completely dark, pitch dark, and creatures will literally devour you unless you have a source of light, so it's best to build a safe place and dedicate the night to crafting and refining materials you gathered in the day.Crafting and researching new ""technologies"" is, of course, the vital part of the game. You start with some basic knowledge of craftable items, but you need to build scientific buildings (and stand next to them) to unlock more advanced options.The grotesque atmosphere is one of the winning points of this game: everything is weird and questionable, from totem-adoring pigs to crawling shadows. The overall feeling of Don't Starve is similar to when you read a fantasy book, curled up in your bed sheet as a thunder storm is raging from afar.If you love survival games, dark settings and challenging stories, get this game!

												This is the best survival game I have ever played. If you love survival, you are not doing yourself any favors by avoiding this game. It throws you to the wolves and does not hold your hand. Yes, the graphics are cartoony, but dont be fooled. This game will test your skills and you will die and die and die again. Grab the DLC's and you have a beast of a challenge to survive. Especially the new Shipwrecked DLC.I have owned this game for years and still keep coming back. The mechanics are deceptively simple, pick up as much stuff as you can and start trying to figure out how to survive. Not starving is only one priority. You will want to set up a camp and start doing science to unlock the best stuff. You will also have weather and heat and cold to contend with on top of the fact that nearly everything will try and kill you in one way or another. Caves add another layer of challange to the game with multiple levels of darkness and monsters to explore. You cook, build, explore, fight, and science the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things to try and survive.Use Wiki or Youtube to help get started.Overall this game is one of my favorite all time games.

												Wow.....I knew I would enjoy this game...but I did not expect to put 250 + hours in it and still going! I had not played minecraft before this but it is cleat that Don't Starve takes the survival aspects of that game and totally runs with it...making the experience more brutal and tense. It is hard because you die...alot. But around the 12th time or so you start to learn what to do and what NOT to do. Once you pass the amount of days you've stayed alive...you feel a sense of accomplishment! Then you just try to beat your record over and over. But the game isn't just about that...there is a mysterious charm to it and very deep! There is a story even! Its hidden. Also, there is additional game modes that can only be accessed by putting time in the game and exploring. There's too much to say about the game....to newcomers...I would say give it time and enjoy the challenge and charm...try new things and eventually the game will click for you! I give it a 10/10....amazing job Klei!			"

												I've been playing games since I was 8 years old. I'm 21 now and I can tell you that this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life.With that said, I want to tell you why this game is so good.1st and most important of all is; this is a survival game. Meaning hard difficulty and permanent death. Even though, you can customize the world to your liking and survive with your conditions. The default version being the intended difficulty.2nd is the gameplay. You can move with clicking your mouse, just like in any Diablo-esque games. You can move with ASDW (which I prefer and recommend). It's simple to play and is very responsive. The game is simple in graphics and has really good animations (meaning anyone can play it!). The music and sounds are awesome but they might become repetitive at some point (at which you just turn them off :D). This may be one downside that bothered me a bit, but it is not a big problem at all.3rd is the game itself, you are placed inside a world where you are only told that you should look for something to eat. Don't starve is not nearly the only danger you should look out for. You have to stay warm in the Winter, stay cool in the Summer, protect your things, avoid monsters, kill monsters, survive giants, maintain sanity. But more importantly, you build structures, walls, farms, protective structures, traps, weapons, tools. Furthermore, you explore secrets, caves, biomes, animals, monsters, items! There are so many options in this game to explore. I have 40-ish hours on this game (for now) and I have only explored barely half of all the things that can be done. I haven't even customized the starting world yet! I've been playing default untill I got the hang of it. But the number of settings and customizations you can make to your world are nearly endless! You can also unlock other characters which all have different perks and abillities.4th and last are the community mods that can expand and improve your game greatly (I'm using 8 mods at the moment). Not to mention the upcoming multiplayer that will allow you and your friends to experience this survival game in a world that has your rules and settings.I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes: survival / fighting / building and crafting stuff.Best regards, Devon.

-Quick Review-Don’t Starve raises the bar on “survival games”, while many games hold your hand, or let you have an easier game mode, Don’t Starve is actually the opposite, when I start to lose in don’t starve, I feel the game kicking me while I’m down.


YouTube™ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Don't Starve - But he's still very Hungry 

			Views: 92		

			Atratzu is blessed and plagued with a very active metabolism, this is good because he stays skinny... but he's always hungry and trying not to starve. Tired of my puns yet?		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  ""Say pal, you don't look so good. You better find something to eat before night comes!"" Those are words to live by. I haven’t actually finished the story myself, I’m still working on that, (I prefer to just explore and try to live as long as I can). I would recommend the trailer[s] to anyone who would like to know more about the story.Some things just aren’t able to be put into words, and the trailer with the conversation between Wilson and Maxwell is just summed up best by watching the trailer.


Well, I found the door... too bad I'm a sucker for punishment. *walks away* 
A Screenshot of Don't Starve
By: Atratzu




Game Play: The controls are quite straight forward, you can control how your character moves with ASDW, or by clicking on the ground/objects, or click and holding down the mouse button. Your inventory is very limited, but I can’t complain about that, it simply requires you to make backpacks/chests/etc.There are three “resources” to juggle in don’t starve: Sanity, Hunger, Health. As the game itself implies, don’t let yourself be hungry for too long, once your hunger drops to zero, your health drains very fast until you die. Once your health is gone, you’re dead. Sanity is an interesting resource, but I’ll let you find out why for yourself if you get the game.


New Defenses are successful!

Price: Don’t starve costs $14.99 (as of July 25, 2014) and the DLC “Reign of Giants “is $4.99. Apparently this summer there’s supposed to be an expansion to allow the game to become multiplayer, I’m looking forward to playing with friends on this great survival game.Thankfully for those who already own the game and the DLC, you don’t need to worry about buying anything else, but for those that don’t own the game; the price will be increased to $19.99. I’ve put 52 hours into the game so far, I have no doubt I will go back to playing more of this game, so regardless of when you get the game I feel the price is very fair. Conclusion: I used to say that if I had to own only one game, It would come down to a three way tie between ""Minecraft"", ""Terraria"", and ""Don't Starve"". All three are excellent games, and all three have different play styles, Don't Starve is probably the most unique.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=395630283------Edits and updates------Edit/Update January 13, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for Don't Starve TogetherEdit/Update September 18, 2015:Added screenshots to the review.Here's the URL to see my review for  Don't Starve Reign of Giants DLCEdit/Update February 29, 2016:Added YouTube Video Review Link!

												This game's art style is really what caught my eye in the first place, so I thought I would buy it whenever it went on sale.   Basically this is a game of survival and there are many things that can kill you. Your character is thrown into a world of vast wilderness and left to fend for himself/herself. Each world is randomly arranged and have random spawnings, keeping the game pretty fresh and new. You gather natural materials like sticks and rocks, make tools like axes and shovels, make traps or weapons to catch animals for food, set up campfires for survival, etc.  In the game you have three things you want to keep in check when surviving: Health, Hunger, and Sanity. If you lose your health, well, you can die. If you lose your hunger, you lose your health and die. If you lose your sanity, you start seeing things. Eventually your hallucinations become violent when you're insane and can hurt you. You can also unlock different and unique characters depending on in-game events or accomplishments.  The art style of this game in my opinion, is very unique and eye-catching. The game is very smooth and doesn't lag alot in general. (depending on how your computer is running though.) It does crash sometimes though. (I've had it crash twice on me.) I have also found a few glitches in the game (before Reign of Giants.)  This game gives you alot of chores for survival to keep you occupied, though sometimes it does get repeative. The worlds in Maxwell's Gate are the true challenges, whether its going through endless winters or rain. Or even hunted by hounds. Every world is filled with multiple monsters and critters to kill or survive from. There are also tons of material to collect for tons of creations you can unlock and survive with, giving this game some variety if you get that far. I really love the different characters in this game too, each one having their own charms and personalities. (My favorite character is Webber.) At times I get alot of creepy vibes from this game, especially at night when my sanity is getting low. And accomplished vibes whenever I survive from stuff. This game does have its charms, but it also has its fair share of flaws. Some of the flaws with this game is the repetiveness when trying to survive multiple times. Dying is definitely a big disappointment, especially when you get pretty far. This was not meant to be a very easy game though. The farther you get, the harder it gets. I would also say that some of the music (mostly in reign of giants) is a little too...cheesy, in a way? (I suppose its meant to be like that but still,) And some of the character's voices (which are instrument sounds) get a little annoying at times. Like Wilson's, for example, and when he gets hurt. The things they say give them alot of personality though. Especially Wendy. One more thing, sometimes (especially when you're a newbie) you encounter things that you have no idea how to deal with unless you look it up. (Which I suggest doing research before eating any of those colorful mushrooms unless you want to do it yourself.)   One last thing I have to say about this game is this: It's not for everyone. Some people (like me) will really like this game, and others might think its as boring as heck, everyone has their own tastes. So, if you're interested in it, I suggest checking this game out and maybe watch other people play it. Its a very fun game and can get time-consuming, I'd say its worth a buy. 8/10.Another thing: Multiplayer is comming soon! :D			"

												Don't Starve is about surviving in a hostile fantasy world filled danger! When night falls you must have a source of light, else the beasts of darkness will strip the flesh from your bones!  You must collect wood and start a fire, but even the trees in the forest can turn against you. Explore harsh landscapes with varying weather, collect resources, and attempt to protect yourself from not only the monstrous creatures, but the environment itself. Don't forget to mind your mind, either, lest insanity grasp you, and the bearded ones return!			"

												Don't Starve is an absolutely awesome survival game with a mesmorizing soundtrack and genuine dark, mysterious -- and sometimes satirical aura surrounding it.You start off with no weapons, no protection from the elements (aside from the preset clothing the character of your choice is given, which I will get more into later), and most of all, little knowledge as to where in the heck you are -- or how you got there (unless you watched some of the trailers.)You are spoken down to by this mysterious and dapper being sporting a traditional suit 'n tie, very reminiscent of the ""G-Man"" from the Half-Life series, he addresses you with a few words, and then poofs into nonexistance -- though you'll meet up with him in the near future.Don't Starve may SEEM like an absolutely pointless survival game with an infinite number of days, and that the clock won't stop ticking until you die (permadeath is a real thing, and you can't come back unless you've crafted yourself an effigy!) but fret not, there's more to this game than meets the eye!After what might be hours and hours of grinding, you'll find yourself coming across a variety of different scenarios - what looks like towns inhabited by xenophobic pig-men, stone ruins patrolled by mechanical 'robots', and much more. You'll find mysterious objects like ""Box Thing"", ""Ring Thing"", and they might just be miscellaneous objects you can just throw around and never pay any further mind to.. or they might be the key to 'beating' the game.My experience with the game has been absolutely splendid, I've encountered moments when I've been absolutely mobbed by armed pig-men, nearly scared to death by what looks like extraordinarily large turkies which pop out of bushes, and nerve-racking moments when my characters sanity begins to deterioate, causing haunting figures to appear..But lets break it down, shall we?PROS - A Survival Game: But a more well-designed and optimized one, constantly managed and won't be forsaken like what happens to most survivals.. (looking at you, DayZ)A Neat-o Crafting System: Items can be either very simplistic or slightly trivial to create, starting off is quite easy - mere flint and twigs and you have yourself either a Pickaxe, Shovel, or Chopping Axe, and can now chop down all them trees! (""Take that, Nature!"" -- Wilson)Insanely Vague Story: This can go both ways; some people enjoy a story that's fleshed out, has alot of dialogue, and is clearly presented to you, but not this game - the game itself doesn't provide the player much information to work off of, conclusions will have to be made on your own end, and there are plenty of wiki's that'll help you further understand the game.Wild Encounters: There are alot of things to see in this game, from the occasional mysterious item surrounded by 'Evil Flowers' that'll drain your character's sanity to wormholes that'll consume you whole and transport you to a different part of the map. (Wormhole transport systems are great, yo.) Not to mention the shifting of seasons, an abundance of sinkholes leading to caves, and with the addition of DLCs, you could be taking down colossal giants or sailing the seas. You could also purchase ""Don't Starve Together"" (free if you've already bought the base game prior to the DLC's release) and try and survive with friends, or random people on the interwebs!A Variety Of Characters: Wilson is the preset character, and has no other special abilities other than the ability to grow the most manliest of beards (I mean, what more do you need than that, right?) but there are also little old ladies, muscular men afraid of the dark, and even a little pyromaniac girl and her dead sister at your disposal. All with their own unique abilities.CONS -Tedious Gameplay: There are people who have yet to beat the game despite having weeks logged into it, YouTubers still at the first stage whilst on Day 300, so on and so forth. So if you can't handle devotion or have commitment issues.. might wanna steer away from this game a bit.Rage Factor: The rage factor in this game depends on your progress, really. I wouldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ if I was brutally slaughtered by a spider on my first day.. but if you're the kind of person that has over 50 days, collected the items that'll help you progress through the game's ""story"" and are mistakenly killed by one of those♥♥♥♥♥♥headed frogs, well.. I'll set up a prayer circle to mend your broken heart and sanity.Game Length: This goes along with 'Tedious Gameplay', but just take a gander at the people who've actually 'beaten' the game and the hours THEY have. Or just go on YouTube and see for yourself.TL;DR - An absolutely phenomenial game, the music makes it all better. Don't buy it if you can't handle the whole survival concept, permadeath, and sheer overall length of the game.Graphics/Art: 4.5 out of 5Gameplay: 5 out of 5Story/Lore: 2.5 out of 5 (if not researched) 4 out of 5 (if researched)Overall Grade: 4 out of 5 "

												This is my favorite survival game ever. Even if you're not into the 2D graphics the gameplay is super easy to get started with but really tough to master making it *IMO* very fun. Everytime you play you'll have a slightly different expirience as the ""world"" is randomly generated so there's a lot of replay value here.When you're getting started the base game should be enough but once you have mastered winter you'll need to upgrade to the ""Reign of Giants"" DLC.9/10PS: If you're having a hard time mastering the ""kiting"" technique and want an easy way to get started play as WX-78 and increase the number of clockwork robots in the customizeable world settings. The gears they drop will keep you going until you've got a decent base and having to kite them will teach you a lot quickly.			"

												This game's art style is really what caught my eye in the first place, so I thought I would buy it whenever it went on sale.   Basically this is a game of survival and there are many things that can kill you. Your character is thrown into a world of vast wilderness and left to fend for himself/herself. Each world is randomly arranged and have random spawnings, keeping the game pretty fresh and new. You gather natural materials like sticks and rocks, make tools like axes and shovels, make traps or weapons to catch animals for food, set up campfires for survival, etc.  In the game you have three things you want to keep in check when surviving: Health, Hunger, and Sanity. If you lose your health, well, you can die. If you lose your hunger, you lose your health and die. If you lose your sanity, you start seeing things. Eventually your hallucinations become violent when you're insane and can hurt you. You can also unlock different and unique characters depending on in-game events or accomplishments.  The art style of this game in my opinion, is very unique and eye-catching. The game is very smooth and doesn't lag alot in general. (depending on how your computer is running though.) It does crash sometimes though. (I've had it crash twice on me.) I have also found a few glitches in the game (before Reign of Giants.)  This game gives you alot of chores for survival to keep you occupied, though sometimes it does get repeative. The worlds in Maxwell's Gate are the true challenges, whether its going through endless winters or rain. Or even hunted by hounds. Every world is filled with multiple monsters and critters to kill or survive from. There are also tons of material to collect for tons of creations you can unlock and survive with, giving this game some variety if you get that far. I really love the different characters in this game too, each one having their own charms and personalities. (My favorite character is Webber.) At times I get alot of creepy vibes from this game, especially at night when my sanity is getting low. And accomplished vibes whenever I survive from stuff. This game does have its charms, but it also has its fair share of flaws. Some of the flaws with this game is the repetiveness when trying to survive multiple times. Dying is definitely a big disappointment, especially when you get pretty far. This was not meant to be a very easy game though. The farther you get, the harder it gets. I would also say that some of the music (mostly in reign of giants) is a little too...cheesy, in a way? (I suppose its meant to be like that but still,) And some of the character's voices (which are instrument sounds) get a little annoying at times. Like Wilson's, for example, and when he gets hurt.

												We are all familiar with the stereotypical grunting, primitive, idiotic caveman. But have you ever tried going outside (bear with me, we're all gamers here) and trying to make a simple tool with only rocks and sticks? Given the fact that they were born into a world where it was kill or be killed and every day was a fight for survival, it's incredible what the cavemen managed to accomplish.In Don't Starve, you take control of a scientist named Wilson*, who has just been thrown into a world as deadly as those the cavemen lived in. However, you have the advantage of knowledge. You know what fire is and how to make it. But you better make it quickly, because the night is fast approaching, and unlike the cavemen, your stars and moon do not provide light. At least, not enough to keep the shadows away.Welcome to a world of survival, where terrors lurk around every corner, where hunger and madness can prove more dangerous than wild beasts, where death is always a few steps behind. Can you gather the resources you need to defy your own doom? Can you build, research, and advance, all while keeping hunger and madness at bay? Can you build a civilization to stand the test of time? Oh wait, wrong game. Anyway, the world of Don't Starve is filled with horrors and dangers. And that's not even including the winter.Oh, yes. Winter. The most dangerous time of year. Perhaps you thought you were safe from starvation with your bountiful crops of fruit and vegetables. But when the ground freezes over, the plants become stagnate. Now, right when you thought you were safe and secure, you find yourself on the brink of disaster again. For winter is the season of the hunt. But what are you? The hunter? Or the prey? Brace yourself. Winter is coming.Wait, wrong thing again. In any case, this game is a must-have for those who love surviving by the skin of their teeth. The art style is reminiscent of Tim Burton animated movies, making the game truly unique in its field. The gameplay is great, either with keyboard and mouse or with the steam controller. At the time of writing this review, I've played 70 hours of Don't Starve, and I've only scratched the surface. Maybe that's just because I suck at it, but even so I enjoy it immensely. And I haven't even gotten started on the DLC's yet!*Wilson is the default character, but there are many others, including Willow the Firestarter, Wolfgang the Strongman, and Woody the... well, you'll see. ;-)			"

												If you often lament about you as a player having low control over high-level events in a game or over the game environnement, this is the game for you.Don't Starve is a survival game and a nice sandbox: go explore, gather stuff and make the best possible use of ressources by combining them in one way or another.The artistic direction is endearing (think of Tim Burton works, for instance) and comes with some welcome sense of humor much needed in that cruel game world - you will die again and again.Last but not least, the developper support on this game deserves praise, there have been tons of very valuable updates to the game.

												Well, Don't Starve Together, the multiplayer expansion of this is out, but it doesn't mean that this game is bad. It's a survival game. It's like Minecraft, but not in the slightest. This is the game that gets all the DLC that Don't Starve Together doesn't get. Also, the boss health in this version is smaller than in the Don't Starve Together game, so if you want to play alone, this is what you should get. Only problem is that the base game doesn't get updated anymore, but Don't Starve Together does. The DLC costs like 3 or 4€, i think. And the fact that the base game doesn't get updated, doesn't mean that the DLC doesn't. Fu*king cash grabbers. "

												I already reviewed this game, though I didn't do it justice the first time. This is by far the most addicting game I have ever played, and its stood strong for three years since its release back in 2013, and given that I have managed to survive for over 250 days in a world I generated two months ago, I felt it proper to give my overall thoughts on the game in general. I still recommend it for someone looking for a challenge, and anybody interested in this should definately give it a try, since it does offer a lot that other survival games do not have. On top of managing hunger, you need to manage sanity loss and health as well, making for a challenging experience. With Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked DLC, you can further expand your worlds with new challenges and items to craft. With an endless until you die Sandbox mode, and a portal to an Adventure Mode that offers six harder more challenging worlds, the replayabillity is near endless, with each world generating a completely different world layout every time.Also, if you end up liking this and would like to play it with friends or strangers, I'd suggest to take a look at Don't Starve Together, the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, complete with all new content and the Reign of Giants expansion content already included with the game.

												This is a very tentative upvote on my part.There isn't anything objectionable about this game; the aesthetics are excellent, the system in place is very well put together. However, I think this is much a case of YMMV on if it's fun for you or not. In my case I found myself searching for a goal and not finding one, which borked any reason I might have to continue playing beyond the first 10 or so runs. Sustaining interest by burning down the forest all through the night can only work for so long.If you are considering buying this game, look to the mechanics as you make your choice. Do you enjoy a procedural world where the only thing to do is gather resources and survive as long as you can? Then this is the game for you. If you need a goal the game gives you to work towards in order to maintain your motivation to play, then bypass it.			"

												This is a very tentative upvote on my part.There isn't anything objectionable about this game; the aesthetics are excellent, the system in place is very well put together. However, I think this is much a case of YMMV on if it's fun for you or not. In my case I found myself searching for a goal and not finding one, which borked any reason I might have to continue playing beyond the first 10 or so runs. Sustaining interest by burning down the forest all through the night can only work for so long.If you are considering buying this game, look to the mechanics as you make your choice. Do you enjoy a procedural world where the only thing to do is gather resources and survive as long as you can? Then this is the game for you. If you need a goal the game gives you to work towards in order to maintain your motivation to play, then bypass it.			"

The combination of discovery and fear (fear of hunger, darkness, insanity, etc) are a wicked combination.My one recommendation to those playing is to _not_ consult the wiki for clues.

 Don't Starve  Is one of a kind survival game.You hear people talking about  Minecraft  being a difficult survival game, well you haven't seen anything yet. Don't Starve  Brings in all the basic elements of survival games - yet it twists them in a strage, yet clever way.It's difficult to explain - it just  does  Besides the obvious title, "" Don't Starve "", I don't think Not Starving is your main concern.Your more ""serious"" concerns should be  Don't run out of light  And  Do not go insane ""Don't Starve - Refueling your childhood irrational fear of the dark since 2013""			"

												:dsham:Isometric view survival game with quite unique, memorable art style.As you may imagine from the title, focus here is on non-combat survival - fighting hunger and adverse environmental conditions like weather or darkness at night. Granted, monsters are out there to get you as well.The game is rather open ended, no clear goals other than survival, although there's an adventure mode to find, which is a more focused challenge.You're definitely meant to discover things yourself on the go, through many deaths of you, forging mad in-game survival skills in fires of hell. If you're looking through guides, wikias, videos... you are somewhat missing the point and missing out great deal on the intended ""fun"".And good riddance, as far as I am concerned, and wikia contributors be praised. Otherwise game is very unfair, puts constant pressure on you, demands great deal from you yet explains nothing, all the while throwing curve balls at you from all possible directions simultaneously and just waiting for any suitable moment to sucker punch you with extreme prejudice. And on top of that this is perma death. You screw up royally, you're out of luck, and have to start from zero on a new random world (but hopefully with more experience now to do better; also I should say there's a way to secure resurrection, but not like it's fool proof, so the royal screw up is always an option).Seriously, eff that noise. I'm pretty sure die hard fans who went through this without any external help are suffering from Stockholm syndrome.As you may see I'm not entirely a fan of the frantic gameplay and main design decisions in general, but I cannot claim the game is bad. What it wants to do, it does very well, and it's an interesting experience to get out of your comfort zone, change the pace a little. Although I did get me some external help on how to survive in this hell, missing a lot of the intended ""fun"", I had some quality time nonetheless to appreciate this title and I don't regret it.It's not really that hard to set up some nice sustainable camp and a variety of defenses from weekly wake up call, you can even set up reasonable supplies despite your main focus here - food - being perishable... It's just that at some point this becomes a chore that prevents you from doing the real good parts. At least IMHOI had way more actual fun with, say, Terraria, which has quite a different focus - on combat and exploration, with ample addition of creative projects you can undertake, where gathering up resources is a means to an end not your primary worry. I guess I like to mess around in games, especially such that promise sandbox experience, at my own pace, rather than being constantly rushed and pushed and with perma death looming on the horizon to make me lose my entire progress. For the latter, I'd rather play some rogue-lites with well balanced pacing.You may probably get bit philosophical about this and claim this game gets it real... Too real for my taste, I guess. Where's my goddarned escapism, eh?Oh, a final thought, though - the above mostly concerns default settings, but actually the game is extremely configurable so once you do get the taste of the intended default experience, you can tweak practically every aspect of the game a lot to match your tastes and perhaps make it easier or even more difficult. Workshop support also something to consider, and official DLC that adds two more seasons, overheating on top of freezing and some other elements, is also something to mix things up. So despite my whining above you can really get a lot from this title, so give it a shot if you have a chance.:dsham:			"

First of all it's pretty smooth i mean yeah it's a 2d game in a 3d environment but hell it runs nicely. The game gets challenging to survive and the world is random. The magic of Steam Workshop makes this game replayable.For this game, and the steam sale for $3 it's amazing. Would i recommend it for $15? I wouldn't, but yes i do see this game to gave lots of replayability to it.			"

												Let me start this review by telling you how I absolutely LOVE this game. Do note that this review contains spoilers and stuff that might ruin parts of discovery and fun in the game I cannot put my love for this game in words but I will try to explain some points of why I believe this is the revolutionary game that help video games progress as form of art.--------------------------------------First of all let me start by telling about the social commentaty this game makes. I know it's hard to see the social commentary in a game where you're all alone in the wilderness but it's there to be found. The social commentary is subtle and told in a very dark soul-ish way which is leaving hints and bits of information that the player figures out. There are multiple parts implying that the silent protagonist is a female-to-male transgender. For example the protagonist has very feminine jaw and chin. He also has feminine hair with lots of volume. Another not so noticed part is the depression in his eyes. Many think the depression is from being alone in the wilderness and darkness of the world. Well they're wrong. It is from the depression caused by being transgender and being oppressed by white cis men and women.---------------------------------Now to the story of the game. I know this is hard to believe for most people, even the most diehard fans of the game, but the game doesnt actually happen in wilderness but inside the person's dreams. The story is very metaphorical about everything. The safety of fire means support of loved ones when transitioning to opposite gender. The angry animals of the wilderness represent the people who are against his transitioning into a man. The neutral animals/critters are considered bypassers. Those are the people he is able to interact without the people being rude/different towards him just for being transgender.The day and night cycle represent the mood swing caused by hormones in transition. While this is not social commentary, it tells about how reality reflects to his dream which the game is. This mechanism is one of the subtle things that make this game a masterpiece.------------------------------We're done with the story now, lets progress to the gameplay.The gameplay is something completely fresh. You start of in a hostile world of no comfort, like transgender person is before getting his/her support for transitioning. Slowly you start gathering materials to get fire. The materials represent bits of trust you build up with other people. Fire represents, like I earlier explained, the support. This is a big gameplay aspect that makes this game extremely good.Another excellent game mechanic is the hunger mechanic. Hunger reflects upon the character's need for love. If he is let without love, he will most likely die. In the dream he isnt just likely to die if the hunger for love isnt fed, he will die.-------------------------------I know this might be shocking to even most diehard fans but everything in this review was researched for a very long time. I spent countless hours finding out all of this and much more. I didnt include everything I found out in this review because I wanted to keep this as a Steam review and not a full review for a bigger site. If you're hungry for more information and stuff I've found out, just ask me.This concludes my review and I strongly recommend everyone to play this.If you're big fan of art games, this is a must have.

												Definitely one of the best strategy/survival games that you can get. The rogue-like gameplay is challenging but your brushes with death will leave you with a feeling of satisfaction that many other games fail to deliver. The games style is like something taken right from a Jhonen Vasquez comic. The rich gothic theme is mesmerizing and make playing the game for hours on end easy. The environments and creatures never fail to make you smile. This game is a beautiful take on the survival genre and everyone should play it.			"

												A great survival game with many hours sunk into it.  I'm not too fond of the giants DLC however -- while it adds many nice new features, I find it makes the game much too heavy on it's 'perma death' genre.  Chances are, you will lose your sanity and die before you're able to explore many parts of the game.I recommend starting by customizing your map settings...disabling the giants and perhaps even lowering the rate at which your sanity lowers.  Unless ofcourse, you're the gamer who enjoys dying over and over again...then the default settings should be ideal for you.I still enjoy this game and find myself comming back...there's also a decent mod community in steam's workshop.

												Awesome little game. I was gifted it by a friend and I immediately was captivated by this little survival. At first the game seems very simple and the concept easy enough, but as you play you realize how incredibly deep the game actually gets. The days gets tougher, the enemies appear more, and winter slowly approaches causing you to rush yourself to get the material you need to survive! Fantastic little game and I definitely recommend it to anyone. I also heard it's on PlayStation Plus for free otherwise it is a 10 dollar purchase there. Either way, play this game.

												Wandered far from my house on the second day of winter, my thermal rock gave out, I lost half my health, but made a fire to hunker to. Got cocky and tried to get back to my home, and then froze to death. All for some gold.Pros: Replayability: This game almost makes you want to hit retry, and if you find yourself bored, download some mods. DLC: Reign of giants is a DLC that changes how you play your game, adding 2 seasons, and a handful of new mobs to farm, kill, or be killed by.Roguelike: This makes the game exciting, if you were to respawn constantly It would detract from the difficulty of the game(IMO)Cons:Minor bugs that screw with my control settingsOverall I give this game no rating because ratings suck. Buy the game if you like roguelike games. Please don't get it if you have the intentions to play something similar to minecraft.Webber is the best...			"

												Alot of people say this is if Tim Burton invented minecraft, but I compare it to terria the more I play it. It's a top-down survival with a sense of despair. I love the simplicity of the art direction it's dark but charming.It's got nice mod support, but I'm gonna say 2/3rd of the workshop is just totally OP OCs or furry charaters with such little changes that It's basically Wilson( stock charater, he's not a bad option, he grows a beard that helps him with the cold and it can be shaven to make an item that could save your life) but without the beard.It doesn't have multiplayer which some people have a major proplrem with, but I sorta like it because I don't have the patience to keep my friends on par with what I do and it allows your friends to learn the game, which makes a dark and scary world not as scary.Definetly recommend it, but it can be annoying having to go through the begging of the game and get your base camp set up. Don't (starve) be overwhelmed by the cast of charaters, you die enough get to give them all a chance.			"

												Tim Burton meets Gathering / Crafting adventure game goodness.This game captures my imagination like very few others. What it lacks in immersion it makes up for in truckloads of creativity and art originality.Some of the mechanics feel a little ""left by the wayside"" such as combat, which to me has always seemed to work a little haphazzardly. But the exploration and curiosity factor are so over the top its very easy to forget such things might get in your way.The music and sound fit perfectly with the art style in a melancholy yet purposeful romp through a dark and twisted wonderland of putrid or warped settings.I've had a blast playing Don't Starve, on and off Steam. Don't let my Steam playtime fool you, I'm a long standing supporter of Don't Starve and highly recommend it to anyone with a penchant for slightly warped or morbid yet humorous adventures.			"

												Definitely one of the best strategy/survival games that you can get. The rogue-like gameplay is challenging but your brushes with death will leave you with a feeling of satisfaction that many other games fail to deliver. The games style is like something taken right from a Jhonen Vasquez comic. The rich gothic theme is mesmerizing and make playing the game for hours on end easy. The environments and creatures never fail to make you smile. This game is a beautiful take on the survival genre and everyone should play it.			"

Posted: May 1, 2013
												  Terraria gameplay meets The Binding of Isaac creepy style.   Don't Starve is an odd game. It has no story, no instructions, doesn't offer much help. This is rarely a good thing. In this case it really really is. You get tossed in a strange, not to mention very dangerous, place with nothing but the clothes on your back.   First thing's first. The title. Don't Die wouldn't have had the same impact that Don't Starve has. Being honest, not starving, even though being tweaked countless times during beta, is a lot easier than not dying. The dangers are countless and unforgiving.   When it comes to graphics, the style is something to appreciate. Everything seems to have been drawn by a kid with too much imagination and that is actually remarkable.   When we look at games we look at certain things like story, graphics, gameplay, mechanics and so on. This being a personal opinion, I mostly look at gameplay and how good and fun it feels. Don't starve does that in style. From collecting twigs and grass you get to weild things from blow darts to magic wands, to wear from Log Suits to Miner hats and Football helmets, from gathering carrots and berries to creating a farm with plots to grow vegetables from quite an interesting variety. .   The best part about gathering food? You get to cook it. Cooking can be done at a simple fire that you build to survive the night or at a more complex Cooking Pot which allows you to combine to up to 4 items to create specific dishes from a nice variety of recipes.   As I mentioned above, you get to craft the tools and items you need to survive. The crafting system is interesting and it works great. You require certain items to do so.  Actually gathering the ingredients can be quite demanding and more often than not requires you to hunt some of the most dangerous creatures, a lot of the times costing you time and health that could cripple your survival or even end it.   The world itself is as it was in Terraria or Minecraft if you will. You encoutner different biomes each with its own rewards and dangers, from grass fields to rocky terrain, marshes and so on.   The goal of the game? There is none. You do everything you can to survive for as long as you can. The days survived counter is a testament of that. The in-game time is calculated in days in increments of 3: daytime, evening, night. The night time is the most dangerous time of the day as your field of view is limited, monsters roam around the world and your sanity gets drained a lot faster.   Your adventure time is also split into season. Winter is of course the most perilous season, requiring you to wear warm clothes or being near a big enough fire for fear of freezing to death.   On the topic of sanity. Sanity is an interesting mechanic. The more time you spend in the dark or fighting, for instance, your sanity gets drained. The more sanity you lose the more paranoid you become and shadow monsters, for a lack of a better description, start seeping into reality, from them creeping at the edge of your field of view to actually being able to attack you and you attack them.   The so called monsters, or should I call it prey, offer quite the challenge. From Beefalos to Tallbirds, Hounds and Tentacles that come out from the marsh, to Treeguards that intend to revenge their fallen brethren.   In the case of characters, WIlson comes out as the main protagonist but he is certainly not alone. The assortment of playable characters allows for different strategies. The other playable can be unlocked in an interesting fashion. You have to die to get experience and you get experience based on the number of days you survived.   The main conclusions are that even though permadeath causes you to obviously start from the beginning again and can prove tedious at times, the urge to see how long you survive and adapting your strategies as such provides quite the reward when you see the days survived counter go beyond your last try.   The other main conclusion would be that for the current price, the value is undeniable.9/10			"

												Simply Fantastic.  Can't say I've seen anything like it in all my gaming years (over 20  years now).In a class of its own, despite being a survival game.When I saw the game in the Steam store, I watched the videos, read some reviews, then checked out the community and workshop.  The art direction of this series has always intrigued me, I just wasn't sure if it was something I could get in to.The game went on Sale this week, so I picked it up.  It's safe to say, 'the rest is history'.What an amazing little survival game!  I literally have to watch myself with this one, because what seems like 15-20min ends up being an hour or two, without even batting an eye about it.  The sounds, music, mechanics, map design, 'critter' art and designs, all of it are just superb, and unique.The game runs flawlessly, without any hiccups, so far.  The modding community for this game is alive and well, ensuring that this series won't be going away anytime soon.I highly recommend this game to ANY kind of gamer, it will surprise you!  I haven't really played the ""Together"" version yet, but I'm quite certain it will only add even more fun to the game, and without a doubt, some hillarious moments!5/5 Stars for this one.  Buy it.  Play it.  I'm not responsible for any addiction that occurs there-after.  ;)			"

												Many survival games are a play it and you're done experience of the been there, done that quality. Not this one. Literally every playthrough is a new experience. Randomized land and creature spawn means one play may be much easier or much harder than the next, depending on what you get. Will you have enough lumber? Will there be enough prey? Too many spiders? Will you camp and be attacked by hounds your first night? Will you even find enough stuff to make a fire your second night?! And of course, if you're having too much trouble with something, you can customize the world and turn that creature off for a playthrough, OR you can up the chances of encounter to test your skills if it's getting boring. This combined with the colorful character options (every one has a personality that determines what they think of everything, and some are downright hillarious), means this game neve rgets dull or tiresome. I always find my way back to try my hand at lasting a bit longer. So far I'm up to 9 nights. My hint? Never camp near a pig village. No matter how tempting. Full moons just -suck-, The mods available through the community are amazing as well and I very much recomend a look through of those also!			"

												Two hours in and I am completely hooked on this seemingly silly little game. I did not expect the mechanics and setting to be so immersive but they stand up strong next to any ""3D"" games that can be found in this genre. When night falls I feel a genuine sense of peril and urgency to get back to my camp or risk death by any one of a variety of night-time creepies. Thats hard to pull of in a cartoony 2D game. Im not a huge horror fan, but this game has juuuuuuuust the right amount of suspense to make it exciting but not nerve-wrackingly scary. On that point - the graphics are fantastic for what they are meant to be, a dark comedic romp through a 2D survival sim that seems to be something out of a Tim Burton movie. My only small issue is the controller option is a tiny bit hard to use for construction on your site. Its hard to get things in the right spot to place, making it frustrating when building your shelter. Otherwise fantastic so far :) 9/10			"

												The title says it all. Don't Starve is one of those addictive survival games, delivering you with the idea that your character(s) lives are at stake. Alike many other survival games it aims to make the idea of food a priority, and the rest will seamlessly fall into place. However Don't Starve wouldn't be complete without its amazing mod support, in which you can build new stuctures or delve into new stories. The options are endless! Some of the mods can't support some of the options in the vanilla game, causes crashes and save wiping issues. Faced with alot of hideous monsters and natural dangers, Don't Starve is one of the best survival games on the market!Pros: Fun survival, great mod support.       Cons: Mods can cause crashes, would love to see it multiplayer~8.5/10~			"

												If anything there is to say about Don't Starve is that it's probably the best survival game out there at this moment. Besides having a very interesting art style and a great sense of humor, there is a large amount of things to craft and the resource gathering sates the kleptomaniac in me. All those grass and twigs you spent the past 30 min picking up? Yea you're going to need them. Unlike games such as Fallout where you can kind of just pick up things you want and avoid small drops, you're going to want to get everything you can. Nothing you find in the game is worthless, every drop and resource has a purpose which is a nice touch. There is an extensive wiki on this game, so if you need to know the use of a certain item or a crock pot recipe it's all available to you. I have to say a few things. One is that if you're dumb like me and didn't know that charcoal is burnt wood, let that be an indication of how to get it (Crock Pot is one of the most important items to survive well past winter). Two is that you might want to get the mod that shows your status (in numerical value) and shows the value for food. It may make the game less frustrating while not taking away from it. Third is that this is a game with perma-death (although there are multiple ways to revive yourself) and dying is the only way to earn experience to unlock most of the characters. Either way as you can tell I've sunk a large chunk of my time into this game and I highly recommend it.			"

												Definitely one of the best strategy/survival games that you can get. The rogue-like gameplay is challenging but your brushes with death will leave you with a feeling of satisfaction that many other games fail to deliver. The games style is like something taken right from a Jhonen Vasquez comic. The rich gothic theme is mesmerizing and make playing the game for hours on end easy. The environments and creatures never fail to make you smile. This game is a beautiful take on the survival genre and everyone should play it.			"

												This is one of those game i looked at and said bleh who would want to play this... Well with the beauty of steam sales  myself and this game met and we decided to crawl into a dark corner with each other and play...So why would i recommend this game? First of all it's pretty smooth i mean yeah it's a 2d game in a 3d environment but hell it runs nicely. The game gets challenging to survive and the world is random. The magic of Steam Workshop makes this game replayable.For this game, and the steam sale for $3 it's amazing. Would i recommend it for $15? I wouldn't, but yes i do see this game to gave lots of replayability to it.			"

												If you are a fan of sims,like survival games,have a love for Tim Burton styled graphics,great humor, and detailed game play mechanics then look no further. This game has a lot going for it .Game comes with adventure mode and sandbox mode.In adventure mode you go from world to world surviving til you find all the pieces of a item that takes you to the next world.The game has a ending in adventure mode so its worth doing if you wish to see it.There are different characters in the game you can play as each with their own plays style.Some characters can only be unlocked in adventure mode but with the power of mods you can unlock all of those characters if you wish.Speaking of mods,the game is quite mod friendly and has many mods on the steam workshop for your pleasure.You need to know how to do slight lua scripting if you want to do some beefy mods,but tweaking value sets of items in the game is easy to learn.You hunt,set traps,gather resources(pick things,chop down trees,etc),grow crops,fight mobs,lead pigs,herd beefalo(a sort of bison),make camps,dry meats,fish,craft items,etc in the game.The game has 4 main status types you need to worry about; Hunger,Sanity,Freezing, and Soggy.To take care of hunger you eat.Sanity is a interesting status because when you start to go insane you being to face new challenges that can end up killing you.The world itself starts to look different and does more than just look different. There are various ways you can treat your sanity as there are ways that can make you go insance.Freezing, occurs but only during the fall - winter season and can kill you if you do not keep yourself warm.Soggy is a condition that affects food and fire, you do not want soggy food trust me..There is far more to this game than even I explained in this lengthy review.Still not convinced? Watch some lets plays on youtube or just have blind faith in my opinion :PP.S. Don't Starve together incorportes many of the vanilla content for co-op but incorporates things not found in the vanilla game and even its DLC expansion Reign of Giants.As of this review Don't Starve Together (a standalone co-op sandbox) is in beta status.

												Frustrating, and yet a great game to play! You got 1 life, and thats it! Don't starve is a very fitting name for this game, hunger will be one of your greatest opponents, but sanity comes in great as a second! At night, when the creepy monsters come.. When you're nearly dying of hungry and slowly start to go insane. That is when things start to get creepy! Where did that music come from!? Stay off my campfire! Oh no, My torch just ran out.....The art is simple but appealing, reminds me of Tim Burton a bit. The characters speak an amusing jibberish, and all of them have great up- and downsides depending on your playstyle.This game may cause some rage-quits, but it is very rewarding to stay alive! .. My Rage quit: . After i set my own farm on fire by accident with a very nervous Willow (character, who loves fire a tad too much) my hp started to drop because i was starving without my crops. A few minutes later 3 hounds came and ate me. Damnit! Mother of all ragequits.. And yet i started to play again within a day. It's just so appealing. The Reign of Giants DLC is fun, but not my cup-o-tea. I prefer the normal version. But it is fun to mix and match up at times, i would still recommend atleast trying it.			"

												Personal Rating: 9/10Yeah, that's how good it is. When it comes to gaming I hate most games, I didn't like Saints Row 4, Payday 2, Call of Duty and I'm sorry to say that I didn't like Dota 2 all that much, just haven't had the time to sit down and play that game.But, on with the review at hand. Don't Starve. I got this game for £4.07 which is an absolute BARGAIN in my opinion. This game is truly amazing and it's in my top 15 games of all time.Playing this game made me realise a few things. Firstly, this game is beautiful. I can't find anything wrong with this game. The art style, beautiful, the music, fantastic, the characters, extraordinarily made, designed and animated.This isn't a review, this is a praise report, I love this game as I'm a HUGE fan of survival games and I put my hands down when I say this is the BEST SURVIVAL GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.

												Don't StarvePros: Great time killer, cute animation style, deep crafting and survival system, always a new experience with plenty of replayability.Cons: Difficult to grasp at first, must learn from previous mistakes to improve, at times can feel slow.I enjoy Don't Starve a lot and it is really fun to try and 1 up your previous attempt(s) and live for just a little longer. Although the game will constantly surprise you with somthing new that kills you, that is all part of the fun. Trying not to starve is usually the least of your worries here.			"

												can't say much about this game.. I only spend 11 hours and it's should be considered  as quick playing :)this game is really something. I like all Klei games (i have one less favorite though, it was mark of the ninja.. i' m bad at 2D stealth) and I watched their videos on youtube. This game is about survival of the fittest, it's you and harsh environtment. once you died, you died forever and have to repeat again from the beginning (unless you use mod that allow load on last save)I really like the capability of modding the game! I have to be honest, I still can't survive more than 20 days in-game so I use the mod I mentioned before to make the game ""easy"" as I want to see the ""feature"" and memorize them before playing ""harsh"" modepro:- great sound effects!- good graphics- great gameplay.. you should play without guide.. don't use them :)- it's updated! and together dlc will be free after early access- and it's discounted now (it's winter/holiday sale when I write this)- community mod supportcon:- nothingI rarely write nothing in con. this game is really great and you should buy it :)9/10!

												8/10The game is ammazing and bloody addictive!!!The game is A lot of fun, You dont really get any instructions as to how to play the game. So a good way to figure it out is to use the WIKI here http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Wiki I've used this a number of time's to figure out things that are a bit confusing at the start.The Main goal of the game is to simply try to survive and ""Dont starve"" :D.....This game has kept be busy for ages, And I jenerally dont survive any longer than 14 days in the game.Another note worthy thing about the game, Is the Modding community. Lots of brilliant mods to make the game either harder or easyer. Really depends on how you like playing.The new DLC ""Reign of Giants"" Adds a lot to the game as well. Lots of new things to find, explore and figure out what they do. It's enough to confuse you again and make the game seem fairly fresh.As per normal with my higer rated games... DO YOUR SELF A FAVOUR AND GET IT. It's worth the price			"

												Don't Starve will want you dead with everything in the world after you. The game is deceptivl easy at first but after night 20 thigs get out of had fast. There is a story mode which can be found randomly in each world, and features 5 worlds with 2 unlockable characters. If you dont quite like the game the is a terrifiying mod caled Screamer i recomend it for it will scare you if you play at night. just remember one thing. Don't Starve.			"

												Personal Rating: 9/10Yeah, that's how good it is. When it comes to gaming I hate most games, I didn't like Saints Row 4, Payday 2, Call of Duty and I'm sorry to say that I didn't like Dota 2 all that much, just haven't had the time to sit down and play that game.But, on with the review at hand. Don't Starve. I got this game for £4.07 which is an absolute BARGAIN in my opinion. This game is truly amazing and it's in my top 15 games of all time.Playing this game made me realise a few things. Firstly, this game is beautiful. I can't find anything wrong with this game. The art style, beautiful, the music, fantastic, the characters, extraordinarily made, designed and animated.This isn't a review, this is a praise report, I love this game as I'm a HUGE fan of survival games and I put my hands down when I say this is the BEST SURVIVAL GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.

												can't say much about this game.. I only spend 11 hours and it's should be considered  as quick playing :)this game is really something. I like all Klei games (i have one less favorite though, it was mark of the ninja.. i' m bad at 2D stealth) and I watched their videos on youtube. This game is about survival of the fittest, it's you and harsh environtment. once you died, you died forever and have to repeat again from the beginning (unless you use mod that allow load on last save)I really like the capability of modding the game! I have to be honest, I still can't survive more than 20 days in-game so I use the mod I mentioned before to make the game ""easy"" as I want to see the ""feature"" and memorize them before playing ""harsh"" modepro:- great sound effects!- good graphics- great gameplay.. you should play without guide.. don't use them :)- it's updated! and together dlc will be free after early access- and it's discounted now (it's winter/holiday sale when I write this)- community mod supportcon:- nothingI rarely write nothing in con. this game is really great and you should buy it :)9/10!

Gets the wood and hears thundering footprints as a giant pine ent (level 3 treeguard) walks into the campfire light. O.o wtf is that. Dies. Respawns at the touchstone only to get killed by a herd of mating beefalo. Takes a moment to soak in that I just got 4 levels in 1 go.

												Don't Starve is one of the most captivating games I have ever played, out of any single player game this is one of a few that has had me playing it for over two hundred hours. Don't Starve isn't like alot of games, theres no tutorial and no singluar way to play it. Don't get me wrong the game has it's shortcomings and is still changing alot, especially since the Reign of Giants DLC was released but the beauty of Don't Starve is a combonation of its amazing art style and the amazing unique gamplay style that makes Don't Starve great. Over all Don't Starve is a great game for anyone and I would think most would enmensly enjoy it.			"

I think there could be more craftable items.2. Extremely unforgiving. I think there should be some mechanism that allows you to get back to base from the resurrection stone otherwise it gets too hard if you die in winter.Overall, its an excellent game and I have made 4 of my other friends buy it as well. If you're an indie game lover and can't commit to long gaming sessions, then this is the game for you!			"

												The game is indeed a great survival adventure and I don't regret wanting it and then buying it at all, but I also can't deny that I'm pretty disappointed in developer's choice of not supporting ""Steam achievements"". I like tracking my progress and my dedication for a game through those achievements, and displaying those was often the only way of showing off. I don't mind the perma-death and the frustration that comes with it, it's a survival game after all. It reminds me quite a lot of those WC3 survival maps, which is a good thing cause those were really fun, but also of Faster Than Light because of the frustration and perma-death parts.Anyway, the game is awesome, artsy without getting fancy, complex without getting complicated, and incredibly addictive. I can hardly wait the arrival of the multiplayer mode too.			"

I have just managed to survive the winter with some ease but I haven't even tried the adventure mode nor gone into any caves nor hunted the Koalephant nor fought the walrus or any of those chess-inspired-geared-thingies... meaning that I have yet to explore more than half of what Don't Starve has to offer.I can't wait to experience the rest of it and maybe someday even try out the terrifying-sounding DLC Reign of Giants....or at least gain some experience so I'll be a good partner in Don't Starve Together. The game is worth definitely every euro (or dollar) it costs. It has a vast, beautiful, intricate and carefully built world with interesting mechanics and adorable sounds!			"

With the hostile and unpredictable environment, players must fight for survival at all costs, revelling in the luxury late-game provides. Whilst yes, you do hit the content wall, name another wilderness survival craft em' up game that doesn't.I could not be more excited for the upcoming DLC.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E31 Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together 

			Views: 179		

			Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together: Don’t Starve & its multiplayer component, Don’t Starve Together, is an indie sandbox survival game of the weird & mysterious variety.		

Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together: Don’t Starve & its multiplayer component, Don’t Starve Together, is an indie sandbox survival game of the weird & mysterious variety. Developed & published by Klei Entertainment. The gameplay is simple which is pretty common for Klei, the controls are nothing special which isn’t bad, the gameplay itself is mostly fun although I have some personal gripes with combat.But, first, let’s talk about the graphics, the game is an isometric 2.5D game, with this really intriguing dark pencil drawn art style, the fact that the world of Don’t Starve itself is this mysterious & weird world also lends itself to this type of art style. The music also reminds me of this sort of twisted carnival feel, with lots of weird strings & brass instruments used to set the tone, characters also speak with mashed up music tones from different instruments, sounding mostly unpleasant.So as it’s about survival, you’ll brave all the elements of the seasons, the ever present drain on your sanity & your belly grumbling. Don’t Starve also features plenty of dangerous creatures as well as some neutral ones ranging from the Pigmen to the aggressive fish like Merms & of course with the Reign of Giants DLC, Giant boss monsters like the Deerclops. It’s a pretty challenging game, don’t expect to survive very long with your first forays into Don’t Starve, you’ll die plenty of times but, never unfairly so, as you learn the game you will become a better survivor & the game rewards you for how long you survive by unlock more characters to play with a total of eleven to choose from all with their own strengths & weaknesses. The story of Don’t Starve is only accessible through the sandbox mode which you start in, if you wish to know how to get there, you’ll have to experiment to find out.My only real gripe is with the games ‘combat’, you interact with the world mainly with the mouse, you can hold the spacebar to pick up nearby objects which is really handy, you can use the mouse or keyboard to move around, but, when in combat, I only ever was able to use the mouse, this is a problem, since the world is flat it is very easy & common for things to get in the way. This is only exasperated when things are hectic, it’s very annoying when there is multiple enemies. There are several ways to avoid combat, but, when you must it’s a pain dealing with multiple enemies at once. Other than that gripe the game is just pure fun, the multiplayer part was so simple to setup I can’t find anything to complain about, it’s the whole single player game with friends up to six & it’s easy to use plus you get two copies for the one price so it’s pretty cheap. I personally love Don’t Starve, it was a bit to get into at first, mostly because I was failing a lot at the beginning, but, once I gave it a serious shot I began to get better & better & could survive a very long time before dying, if you like survival type games in general definitely check this out, if you don’t like a challenge, or don’t like indies (for some reason) or just don’t like things that aren’t 3D ultra-graphics & “realistic” then steer clear of the quirky world of Don’t Starve, for the rest, we’ll be trying to survive despite the odds. Its $14.99 USD which is a pretty good deal, I’d recommend getting the bundle with the Reign of Giants for $18.99 USD which will give you a ton of stuff, or get the bundle that comes with a copy of Don’t Starve Together which includes the Reign of Giants DLC & bring a friend along for the ride! Thank you Klei Entertainment for awesome deals on awesome games!TL/DR; Don’t Starve is a wonderful survival game that doesn’t take itself too seriously but does offer a serious challenge for new comers. It’s got a very unique art style. The game is simple to play & simple to run with the sandbox goal of ‘survive’, it holds no hands & still expects you to succeed, it’s a fun game, & its multiplayer component Don’t Starve Together makes the experience even better with the ability to bring friends along for the suffering. I highly recommend check out both titles, they offer good deals for the single & multiplayer experience, unless you can’t stand the look of the game, or need that “realistic” approach to survival then check out Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together! -Double Thumbs Up from Royial			"

												This is a wilderness survival sandbox featuring lovecraftian horrors pig men jackalopes and other strange things. You start in a sandbox mode shanghied by the mysterious maxwell and can work through an adventure mode within the sandbox.You have 3 stat bars health hunger and sanity controling these stats is the key to surviving as long as possible. You build prototypes of new equipment and structures to advance in the game and increase your probability of long term survival. This is not another minecraft clone and is an awsome game despite lack of multiplayer. Hunting gathering trapping beekeeping crafting fishing herding, all possibilities in this immersive game. Overall definatley worth the price if you like sandbox games and survivalism in general intruiges you, give this game a try.			"

												This is a great game, I've suggested it multiple times to anyone watching my twitch channel while playing it. It's got an amazing Tim Burton-eque art style with plenty of survival aspects. The world is randomly generated so you'll not get the same map multiple times unless you wish to (there's an option to retry if you die on current map).Many people ask, ""How do you get further than 10 - 20 days""? Practice, play the game, it's a survival game. Explore, craft stuff and mainly look at your surroundings for what's most helpful (beefao).Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves Survival games, give it a try and if you get stuck there's an always growing wiki page for the game. You're going to die, it's a feature.			"

												Highly addictive game. 9/10.A lot of great character/game mods.One things that annoys me though is spider,frogs, and the furry creature with an eye ( not sure what it is though ) , they attack you even though you don't bother 'em.Also one thing that i think would be great for this is achievements. Like i think it'd be great if there was 'cause some of us players would want to have 'em.Edit - shipwreck early access review- This dlc is just amazing and it just makes the game 50% more fun and better than it already is.Jellyfishes, crabs and coconut coming from a palm tree, I mean what can we possible not like?

												Don't Starve is one of those games where the only word that justifies it's quality and content is ""perfection"". It is such a complete experience, it has everything you would want in a survival game, and the level of content is monumentous. The one thing that really makes this game a treasure is the simplicity. What? You might ask. I will try to explain:The UI/ menus are perfectly uncomplex. They are neat, responsive and incredibly easy to navigate as everything is very well organized.The inventory spaces are placed neatly at the bottom of the screen and are always available to you. you have the option of organizing your materials into a few groups with slight spaces between lots of inventory slots. The clicking + dragging mechanism makes this process so much easier. I often organize all my edibles into one group, main building materials into another and tools/ armours/ weapons into another. The crafting system is also very easy to grasp. You can click whatever it is you want to build in the menu to the left and see what kind of resources you need to craft that item, with pictures of the actual items which makes the whole identifying process a breeze. The map is excellent. You can see (as far as you have travelled) key locations such as berry bushes, forests, different biomes e.t.c... You can also see where you've built stuff, if you have. This is very important if you don't want to get lost!The actual physical game map that you travel on is amazing. Resources are easy to find, click and collect. Your main tools (hatchet, pick-axe and shovel) require the most basic resources so you will easily be able to replace them without much hassle. This is also probably the only game where people won't question your pathological excitement over poop.Trust me, you will have so much fun just collecting hordes of resources and then putting them to use and generally just trying to survive another day. The game does get difficult, especially if you have the expansion enabled, which offers a whole new and exciting experience, but even if you fail, you'll want to immediately start again and perhaps learn from your previous mistakes and do things differently. I simply cannot find one negative aspect in this game, it is, as I said before, perfection. "

												Totally got immersed with the world of Don't Starve the moment I started playing it.Survived for 36 days so far without dying and boy oh boy this game is so much fun and at the same time friggin hard. Went exploring around, met some penguins who tried murder me. Then came winter! Apparently, I build my base next to a walrus camp without knowing and that blob sent his dogs        and was blowing darts at me with 100% accuracy. Killed his dogs and chased him and it took forever to kill him since        he was running away.            Survived two more days after that then ffs a giant abominable cyclops with horns destroyed my base! My point is everything in this game hates you and tries to kill you (If you try to hurt or kill them) Either you get killed by living tree monsters, bees, warthog looking animals, penguins, spiders or you die if you starve. Oh and the Tim Burton visual style for this game suits it very well.Overall, 10/10 for this game and is a must have for those who like Survival games genres. "

With Together coming out in a few months there are no words. Multiplayer in an awesome game. SWEET! Well a downfall to this would be according to the title. Starving.

With many characters to test, so many items to find, and so much to do, you will get lost while playing this game.

												I strongly recommend this game.  Reminds me of Minecraft's first few minutes/hours where you're scraping to stay alive, but this is harder, and more rewarding, minus the building for the most part.  The art style is great, very atmospheric and fun to watch.  Though no in-game instruction is given, the difficulty of picking up on how things work isn't bad, after a couple deaths, you'll know how to progress through the first few days.  That's my one gripe, dying starts you over, with no save game, it automatically deletes it for you.  This lends urgency to your quest to survive, which I like, but the first 3 days or so take half an hour, and there's not much variation in during that time, so it starts to feel a little repetitive.  But after that, there's tons of cool stuff, so it's a minor annoyance.  Also, to be fair, I wouldn't have to play those first three days so many times if I'd just follow the direction, ""Don't Starve""			"

												One of the most difficult games I've ever played, yet I keep coming back for more. It'd be easy to stop playing out of frustration, the game doesn't teach you anything and you learn simply by doing. With every death means starting over from scratch, the permadeath is both punishing and extremely rewarding to see how far you will get and how you must adjust your strategy in order to survive. The odds are stacked against you, but it never feels unfair. There is always something you could have done better or a different route you could have taken that may have lead to you living longer. Believe it or not you can even beat this game, or so I've heard.Nothing is more satisfying than figuring out a new mechanic while you are playing simply from experimentation, this game is so finely tuned and balanced that it must've been a nightmare for the devs to make. The combat is excellent yet simple and easy to understand, it is really all you could ask for in a Survival Crafting type game. And to make things even better the Multiplayer version of the game is even more fun, although not yet as feature complete as the singleplayer variant.The graphics are simply beautiful and extremely charming, nothing is more adorable than a sleeping homeless spider or a recently shaved beefalo. Add in unlockable characters, an excellent and tweakable world gen, and a plethora of mods on steam and you have a game that is well worth replaying.			"

												I always wanted to play in survival game where EVERYTHING CAN KILL YOU! :DDied by:- my own weapon? - CHECKED!- my own tools? - CHECKED!- my laziness? - CHECKED!- my stupidity? - CHECKED!...and that is only the beginning of nightmare you going to face.Lets go deeper, shall we? What may kill you in big bad world?:- bunnies? - CHECKED!- flowers? - CHECKED!- trees? - CHECKED!- bees? - THEY WILL DESTROY YOU!- penguins? - THEY WILL OBLITERATE YOU!...and that is only the top of the whole mountain, you will spend alot before you discover all ways to die.After...- tens of hours spent in the game,- hundreds of slained monsters,- thousands of gathered materials,... I am still on the Day 1. Yep! Totally worth it!Great game. It has very nice art style, and music. It is gameplay wise, it may seem like other ""survival"" games out there, but this one is really different. On the first look, you may think ""Oh damm.. it is a Minecraft copy"", but that opinion is far from truth. On conceptual layer they are both simillar to each other, but on the gameplay leyer they are completely different. They got completely different priorities expected from a player.My Walkthrough Guide:

												This is an entertaining--but unforgiving--survival rogue-like that oozes with mystique and absolutely unique creepy charm.  It's one of those games where the only goal is to set goals for yourself, but you might have to set it down every once in a while because you once again have to start over because you did something stupid... or you come across something new and exciting that you accidentally found out is very lethal.

												Don't Starve and Dwarf Fortress share one thing in common; losing is fun!The game itself is a huge learning experience, and you'll always get further (usually) the last time than you did the first time.  Even if you manage to make a self-sustaining base that was indeed somewhat indestructable, the game would lose a lot of what made it fun to begin with.  Of course, getting to said point requires said experience; which depending on the person may or may not actually come.It's brutal at first glance, but even after you get better; the game doesn't stop getting harder.  If anything, the longer you live, the more merciless nature itself gets.  If you're not prepared, then prepare to die!			"

												""AH♥♥♥♥♥♥HOUNDS!"" i yelled, running through the woods in my attempts to escape the beasts. nearly bled out from making mysterious 2 legged pig men angry. What did i do to deserve this harsh world? Everything is fubat. Tree monsters hide in the forrests, spiders all over the place, insanity growing, hunger rising. Now this. Will this finally be my un-doing? To loose all i have gained onlt to start a life anew in the constantly hostile world. Only comparable to that of a schtizophranic mind. Beasts roam wild and all is dangerous. So few are the safeties of the fire in winter, and so rare is the safety of defences at night. Scavenging was hard enough to survive for the first few weeks. Now im going to die bie these blood thristy hounds of hell, or wherever such beasts were created. WAIT! a hole in the ground! I must get to it in order to survive. I jump down, only into darkness. Insanity is building, i see things in this dark tunnel. What awaits on the otherside? When i awaken my eyes, i am in a land i have yet not seen. My pursuers may not have easily given up, so i must run. Run fast, run far; only that i could if my stomach wasnt so empty, aarg i must have something to eat. Thankfully theres some bushes, but is that....a spiders nest? with little strength left, and a spear in hand, I make the short path to the dangerous bushes. To so i dont allow my self...to dont starve.9/10 for immersion: Very dangerous gameplay, you must be quick to think, or die from the elements of this vast and wierd place. I must say even being experienced in survival games, the night times in here are terrifying and detrimental to your health if you are un prepared to venture fourth in such time.10/10 for creativity: Very different sense of survivalism, if you like turkeys to be hulking 2 legged beasts, and any sort of socialness to be between a living pot following you, and pigmen. This is definitely for you.8/10 mechanics: Simple to use, as simple as click to move, use, everything else you need to know. Though i had alot of problems with picking up items behind other items. Which quickly became a nuissance.			"

												Combining the aspects of survival, adventure and sandbox into one game full of mystery and wonder makes this well worth playing. Since every world you play in is completely randomised, the adventure never stops as you explore, fight and survive as you delve deeper to find every little thing to do and uncover. So, if anyone out there is up for a good challenge, then Don't Starve is the one for you. Plus, with the Reign Of Giants DLC coming out soon, you can be sure to be surprised and running for your life as you discover what this game has in store for you...			"

												I love this game so much already that I decided to play it for about six hours and then drop by just to leave a good review. This game is like a twisted combination of a survival and adventure game, yet every time you play it you get a completely different experience that is definitely worth your time. There are so many different things going on in this game that it's a bit overwhelming at first, but there is a bit of a learning curve and it all gets easier after the first hour or two of gameplay. If you are at all hesitant about purchasing this game, do yourself a favor and buy it now.			"

												This games lived well past my expectations, with an extraordinary art style, unique game play and tactical. You're not only trying to survive but achieve your best. Each day that passes you scurry off trying to gather as many things as possible and hope that your base is in a safe enough spot. The achievements and points system is easy enough to gain and progress fast. As you explore this vast land you'll encounter creatures, friendly beasts, mysterious entities and the weird, wonderful and scary abilities of Mother Nature and the human body.I'm only on day 13 but I've already built walls, floors, a fire and tools for building and crafting. This game is an experience like no other and is one of the best sandbox style games I've purchased in ages.			"

												This game is incredible its just like your basic Sandboxish game with the build and stuff but it also has a legimate adventure mode once you make the diving rod and find maxwells portal anywayDont starve has many aspects so you will die eventually (unless you have a crap ton of farms to last you forever)Plus even if you do die you get xp points so you can get a new characterDont starve offers a very simple way to install mods like all steam stuff anyway~And Dont starve never gets old because if you die you still havn't found everything in the game yet.Another mechanic there is in dont starve is the Sanity system and the being afraid of the dark.During night or doing other stuff such as picking evil flowers can reduce your sanity and the lower it getsthe more Ghosts you see that want to kill you,At night if you dont have any light around you,then you'll just die cuz of monsters lurking in the darkEdit: The dlc ""Reign of giants"" is a great addition for hardcore players who tend to find dont starve too easy and are looking for a better challenge,one thing we would all like to see tho is Multiplayer in either a mod form or just added to the game.Anyway dont starve is a brilliant game and this is the longest review i've written.

												One day, My brother showed me this cool game, Don't Starve. I was quite interested in getting this game and after buying it and playing it for a while, I got addicted to it!I recommend this game to be played because to me it's an EPIC survival game. It has great graphics, Great gameplay, and really easy controls. Its best suited for survival game lovers like me.But yet, be careful when you play this game, There is a ton to monsters to fight. One wrong move and you might end up getting a one way ticket to DEATH.Good luck and remember....Don't Starve. "

												I read one review which said minecraft + Tim Burton + pain. I'd say this is pretty accurate. I dont think it was quite mentioned in the game description but if you die, then the game stops - you have some methods of resurrection but you have to be really careful in this game! :DYou will die many times before you start to get the hang of things. I've played 50 hours before I even decided to start Adventure mode..... so I thought I was going to find it quite easy to begin with. How wrong I was....I like this game for its difficulty and the random quotes you get when examining stuff! I wasn't expecting much, but it really is fun.Update @111hrsI can still easily spend all day playing this game and I still haven't mastered it! Half the time Im just fighting for survival that I can't get to explore the caves and stuff. Haha I guess I'm just bad at the game although I have managed to survive a few 100+ day games.. I don't think my review does the game justice. Its definitely great fun but hella challenging			"

												Nice little game.  If it was multiplayer, I would say go full price, but you should catch this when it is on sale.  It also includes a second game mode that is worth checking out that plays kind of like the ""Slenderman"" horror minigame.  It is challenging, at least in the beginning while you are trying to figure out how not to starve to death or get murdered by darkness.  The second character you unlock basically allows you to play endlessly, so if you want a good challenge, try skipping her.  Also, the game seems to ramp up difficulty the more days you survive, which I know sounds typical, but the game lends itself to a feeling of opening new areas for higher difficulty instead of time-based difficulty progression.-It plays like a point and click hack n slash in an open world, but no traditional rpg elements.-The art is cute and works well with the play-style. -Craft to survive.  Bang on a tree to get wood for a fire, build an axe or pick, even a snare to catch dinner.-If you have played DayZ, Rust or one of the other Survival Horror games, then that is what you can expect, but in an isometric, 2D environment which is a refreshing pov shift for a genre I enjoy.

However, there's something undeniably satisfying about seeing just how long you can stay alive as it endlessly tries to brutally murder you.If you like brutal, unforgiving survival games, you'd be hard pressed to find one better than this.

												One of the most difficult games I've ever played, yet I keep coming back for more. It'd be easy to stop playing out of frustration, the game doesn't teach you anything and you learn simply by doing. With every death means starting over from scratch, the permadeath is both punishing and extremely rewarding to see how far you will get and how you must adjust your strategy in order to survive. The odds are stacked against you, but it never feels unfair. There is always something you could have done better or a different route you could have taken that may have lead to you living longer. Believe it or not you can even beat this game, or so I've heard.Nothing is more satisfying than figuring out a new mechanic while you are playing simply from experimentation, this game is so finely tuned and balanced that it must've been a nightmare for the devs to make. The combat is excellent yet simple and easy to understand, it is really all you could ask for in a Survival Crafting type game. And to make things even better the Multiplayer version of the game is even more fun, although not yet as feature complete as the singleplayer variant.The graphics are simply beautiful and extremely charming, nothing is more adorable than a sleeping homeless spider or a recently shaved beefalo. Add in unlockable characters, an excellent and tweakable world gen, and a plethora of mods on steam and you have a game that is well worth replaying.			"

But it is most certainly fun and entertaining. It's a challenge but a welcomed one.You are trying to survive, scrounge for supplies, make shelter, find food, and stay in the light.

												With a title like ""Don't Starve"", you'd think you'd only have to worry about finding food. And you would be sorely mistaken. The maps are randomly generated, so what was a problem for you last time you played might not be such an issue for you now. That said, the things that came easy last time may not be so simple this time. For example, I frequently found myself running out of food on my first few attempts, while things like developing new technology came easy. However later on food was a bit easier to find, but I had trouble finding the stone and gold needed to unlock new recipes. THEN once I'd finally found a balance, I made the foolhearty mistake of taking too long to light another torch at night. This game is extremely difficult and while normally a frustrating mechanic such as having to start over everytime you die would put me off, I found myself going, ""Well, that sucked. But I wonder what's in store for me next time?"" If you're like me and love a good adventure, even if it tests your patience a bit, check this title out. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Second Edit: 26 January 2015(NOTE: This review is aimed at new players)So I thought I'd elaborate a little on the context of this game to make this a more useful review like others have made.First of all, this game is HARD.Like. REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING HARD.If you're a newbie at this game, you are going to die ALOT.But that's not a bad thing.If there is one thing this game does right its create an atmosphere thats both immersive & chilling.It is not only a wonderful survival game but an absolutely brilliant adventure game aswell (Once you manage to get to grips with how hard the game can be that is. And you stop dieing as much)By the way, do you think i'm exaggerating with that ""You're going to die ALOT"" remark?Trust me, I'm not. Though I really wish I was.I'll start you off properly by describing the basic mechanics of the game at the start.First of all, this game is survival based-so you are gonna have a few things to watch out for when you start up a new game. Health, Hunger & Sanity.These are you three basic survival bars which you have to maintain.Hunger being quenched with food items (raw or cooked), and health being quenched also by food, but only certain foods. This means that some foods will give you much less health than others (That is that a majority of the food you come across like carrots, berries and meat will not heal much)Health will  regen slowly over time if you cannot afford to waste limited food resources on it though.And then there's sanity...oh boy.Sanity is the bar that will quite literally wreck your own sanity in real life if you fail to maintain it.It can be regained when lost by picking flowers and you can make a hat from the petals you recieve from those flowers which will majorly slow down the rate at which you loose sanity for a few in-game days. If your sanity get's too low though, shadow mosters will start to physically hurt you.I will describe enemies a little later in this review. But first, crafting!(NOTE: I may re-edit this review another day to describe the crafting in full detail)Crafting is the most important mechanic in this game and can be a littl complicated for begginers to understand in the beggining.For most newbies I would suggest the dont starve wiki to get to grips with the different section of the crafting menu, as describing it here would take me all day.So onto that description of the enemies! Enemies come in all shapes and sizes in Don't starve, and they all spawn in the moment you start.It is your job to avoid them until you are ready to take them down...which takes a while.My suggestion is the same as most would suggest, if you're going to attack anything in the first 10 or so days...make it spiders or singled out pigmen.If your sanity gets to low you will not an immense increase in the amount of shadowy creatures lurking about. These creatures will actually be able to hurt you if your sanity gets low enough.I won't go into too much more detail about the enemies as you probably get the point, most are harder to defeat than some.Now we get to seasons...When you start a new world you can pick to either start in winter or summer. (FYI. Winter sucks)After you get through summer you get to autumn, then winter & then it goes back around to spring and then the cycle repears itself, like real life (not that this game mimics real life cause jesus that would be terrifying)All in all this game is a terrifying but interesting dark survival experience that never fails to get my blood pumping and my brain on overdrive.If you are looking for a survival game that isnt a zombie filled gorefest and actually has some genuinly spooky chill-inducing atmosphere and tight survival gameplay, then this may just be the game for you.An absolute 10/10..............................................................................................................................................First Edit: 29 June 2014I absolutely love this game.Survival mixed with dark/horror themes, your sanity will drain slowly overtime as you encounter strange beasts and dark pits.Not to mention the countless amount of nights spent in fear of literally EVERYTHING.10/10			"

												To all those who say there is no story, you obviously have not played enough. Inside the game there is an ""adventure mode"" which is basically story mode(and very challenging).Crafting is a primary part of the game. It starts very simply — you'll pick up items in the landscape to construct simple tools, necessary to break down more raw materials. The system expands all the way from grass and twigs up to scientific machinery, complex farms and magical devices. The tech tree has enormous depth and room for experimentation, all dependent on your priorities.I recommended this game to anyone who wants to have great time for a couple of hours.			"

												Awesome game, favourite survival game of all time. It is so great cause you have such a big choice of what to do. If u wanna survive on only meat go for it, on only carrots and so on. When dawn comes it's time to step away from the fire and head out on adventure. It is great that there are diffrent characters, and that they all are diffrent. The style and art of the game is really cool it makes the game dark and a bit spooky. Sometimes you can get a really annoyed with this game, especially when a pack of hound comes or when you die, but there is something that always keeps dragging you back. I would recomend this game to most people but you have to put in some time to the game to learn to survive in this world. It is also a great game to play while whatcing a movie. And remember to eat anything you can find so you Don't Starve.			"

												IT'S NOT MINECRAFTThe name of the game is really deceiving as starving is one of many ways to die in this game. I'd like to point out here I was expecting something like old Horde game - you stay in a camp, build your defences during the day, defend at night and reap your rewards.It was not the case as instead the developers gave me a game about survival and exploration. I have to say that second ""X"" part is really crucial for the game, as in early stages you will starve or freak out if you don't collect a lot of food, branches, some little stones that help you start a campfire. This game makes you watch out not only for your hit points but hunger level and serenity as well. Strange things happen if you become insane.Gameplay also brings you back to point'n'click adventure games where you had to find out what can be combined with what. Here it's similiar, it's trial and error with a bit of punishment, but keep in mind: this game is not an extreme hardcore self-destructive masterpiece. The learning curve isn't any steep. It's just a pleasure.As the days go by you learn new things, which gives you a lot of satisfaction. Surviving more and more days also gives you that feeling of progress, because there are new characters to unlock (with different abilities and stats).The downside to this game is that it's kinda cryptic at times and thanks to random generators you can either be in a very good starting position or a very bad one, but usually it doesn't go as far as spawning you next to a lvl 9001 mob which one-hits you.I can recommend this game. I'm not exactly a fan of survive, craft and explore games, but it still gave me some nice memories and I will certainly play it again.			"

												This game has some good depth for the price. My only problem is that I don't really like minecraft games. It almost feels like I should be getting paid to play because it's like work. I tried this one knowing I didn't like minecraft games. I still don't like minecraft games. Thankfully you can set the world up just about any way you choose, so that alleviates some of the anxiety.So I dunno...If you like minecraft games, this one could be umm... 8/10?Otherwise 6/10.			"

												Is this game worth £11 you may ask? Silly question, of course! Inclusing the DLC too, this game is a bundle of amazingness. Don't starve is , if not, on it's way to becoming the best gaming experience around. The fact you get dropped into a completely random world full of so many things that can kill you is so much fun. Of course the main objective is to not starve, but there are so many other obstacles to overcome, and so many ways to do just that. Don't starve is an amazing game that has taken up around 100 hours of my time, and soon to be much, much more. It will soon be multiplayer, so being able to experience all the dangers, problems and sucesses but with some company is something to look forward to.If you do not have patience, then this game probably isn't the best idea. You start off with mainly grass and wood, but as the game flows on, you can be speeding around with a cane, a top hat and some turkey dinner! What could be better? This game just offers such a thrill. The fact it also has great replayability, with other characters and that you can edit your worlds however you like, making it more difficult or easy, or even install some mods made by the fabulous people in the Steam Don't Starve workshop!Overall, if you have some spare time, a bit of money and are looking for a good, fun game, then I definately recommend this one.

												As Myself I didnt enjoy just LOOKING at the pictures in the Steam Store when I first saw this but when I bought it I didnt expect getting punched in the face for saying the game isnt great. ITS EXCELLENT! FANTASTIC! I highly recommend this game if you like fighting your way against things you dont know in this Dark and Bright world. If you love starting from scratch and then after a few months of playing you finally got a big fort then this is your game. Your World is unique and you are the one making the story behind your world. This is awesome thats all I can say THIS IS AWESOME, hands down.			"

												This game is plenty of fun delivered in a highly stylised fashion. There's more depth than you first expect; the game can be somewhat difficult and unforgiving at times, but it's always enjoyable.The only thing I'd recommend is to take it slow; don't rush in expecting to kill everything in sight and survive simply by stabbing and punching stuff. You need to build yourself up first before you can take on the big game.On top of that, the game has a good modding community; everything from new items, to tweaks to game mechanics to make things far easier or much harder, new fan-made characters and even total conversions (the base game comes with an official surivival horror themed TC).Overall, Don't Starve is well worth the money.

												My review is based on all expansions, not really vanilla. I was attracted to this game due to its art style and cute little Chester. Little did I know this artsy survival game had more to offer than most survival games I've played. Unless you have ROG you're missing out on a lot of content. Don't Starve is far from forgiving, at times you might feel the developers had an evil laugh when coming up with ways to kill us helpless survivors. Don't Starve ROG feels like vanilla to me now, playing Don't Starve itself is not enough to give the game its justice, in my opinion. Don't Starve has a lot of depth, if you're more than just a casual there are so many different things to do on this game besides survive year one. (If you can make it past summer) I do wish, however, Klei put more effort into end game (other than caves OFC) I also feel SW is lacking as an expansion but all in all the price for this game in general feels awfully low for something so wonderful, I would've paid a lot more. If you don't like surviving on your own make sure you give DST a try, the community is great, I prefer Don't Starve over Don't Starve Together but that's just my cup of tea. PS, too the noobs, if you're sceptic due to one death causing your world to be erased, there are items you can craft or things you can find in order to have several lives, not only that, but also mods. The mod community for this game is HUGE, if you ever find yourself bored or feel like you need the game to be a little easier, you could try using mods. Some mods completely change Don't Starve, some make the game easier by adding items and characters, or tweaking things, other mods make the game harder. Don't Starve is a great game and the developers are fantastic and helpful.			"

This game is like a twisted combination of a survival and adventure game, yet every time you play it you get a completely different experience that is definitely worth your time. There are so many different things going on in this game that it's a bit overwhelming at first, but there is a bit of a learning curve and it all gets easier after the first hour or two of gameplay. If you are at all hesitant about purchasing this game, do yourself a favor and buy it now.			"

												This game is truly amazing.I found this game and bought it back in may, and I do not regret it. I've had many fun and exciting moments when playing, and in the beginning, as a noob, it's even more fun and at the same time 'scary' to explore the world and all the interesting stuff that happens (?!).The point is to not Starve (obviously) on an island where an evil man called Maxwell puts you. The island is full of things that want to kill you, as well as resources, food and so on. Time counts in days, thus, you can see how long you've survived and try to beat your records. There's no achievements or such. Just follow the one and only rule, ""Don't Starve"", and you'll loose many hours in this amazingly, fantastic game. "

												I wasn't too sure about this game when I first saw it.  Then I saw the pocket edition for my phone and decided that I would give it a try.   It took all of 5 minutes for me to realize that I HAD to have this on my PC.  I bought the bundle of the original game,  Reign of Giants, and Shipwrecked. I cannot put this game away.   I think it's totally possible that this game got its title not because of the starvation that can happen in the game but the starvation that can happen to you in the real world when you start playing this game!  I love the exploration that this game puts you through.   I have resisted the urge to watch videos or get tips online because the ""not knowing what's going to happen next"" aspect really adds to the experience.   Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.   It's well worth the price for the intense HOURS of fun,  stress, frustration, and obsession that you will experience while playing.			"

												First let's just start with I've put around 10hours into this game and there is still so much I don't know and have not even touched. The best part of this game is not knowing anything about it. Running up to an animal and poking it only to have it two shot you. While you might think like a typical surival game you'll eventually get a cozy farm and endless meat and resources... Suriving is only half the battle. If you want to advance the story and actually get everything out of the game you'll need advanced items, food enough to last you a while away from base and luck in finding what you're looking for. This game has so many layers and so many ways you can play it!There is so much replay value to this game as it is rogue like and your world will be destroyed if you die and your file deleted. While there are one or two methods of gaining... basically an extra life... they're far and few between so just be prepared for lots of deaths at first. You unlock new characters as you progress and survive more and more days so each time you get different buffs ande debuffs making each experience unique and with its own challanges. Overall and amazing game with a ton of depth that is so much more than your average survival game.A huge thing is multiplayer coming out for this game. It says Summer 2015 ALPHA will be released called ""Don't Starve Together."" This is a major enhancement to the game. Buy it now! The devs have stated once multiplayer is fully released the price of the game will go up to $19.99 from $14.99. So grab a copy and buy one for a friend in preparation!Most importantly, don't starve!Edit 3/23/15: I'd like to add that I reccently added Reign of Giants and oh wow. You should play don't starve to death until you get bored then add the RoG dlc to it. It's a whole new game. The difficulty is much higher since you now have to deal with the rain in Spring and the heat in Summer. It feels like they've added such a huge element to the game. It honestly makes the original base game feel like it was in Early Acess or something. I won't spoil it but there new mobs, tons of new items, new playable characters and just so many new ways to die and ways to avoid dying. Get it!			"

												This game. Gameplay: Don't Stave is a survival game which is a genre that has recently been more prominent in games recently due to the success of some game where you punch rocks and ride pigs? anyway Don't Starve in my opinion stands out among the best survival game I have ever played and thats primarily down to the gameplay as its incredibly fun to explore this tim burton style world and survive its dangers. You have a variety of different characters to unlock that each have their own pros and cons and its that diversity which makes playing Don't Starve different everytime you play.. well that and the world is randomly generated everytime you start a new game! so who knows what you will bump into I am still finding new enemies and items to craft and this is coming from a guy who is 20+ hours into the game. Essentially the gameplay consists of gathering wood, flint, stone and food (which is pretty obvious.. I mean the game is called Don't Starve). There are so many items to craft to improve your camp or camps in the massive world you are dropped into and you get a lot of joy from planning out exactly what you are going to collect and make each time you play but that said the game can be a bit overwhelming for new players as you have to think for yourself rather than the game holding your hand which in my opinion works to the games advantage as it adds a sense of accomplishment when you make something to help you survive and if the game told you how to do most things that feeling would not exist and the game wouldn't be anyway near as entertaining. The gameplay is fun and addicting and also stressful at times but not in a bad way as its not the games fault its your fault for forgetting to make a valid step to survive in this beautiful but dangerous world.Story: The story doesn't seem to be the main focus of this game but there is a story hidden in there behind each character you unlock as they are all wacky and have a dark sort of wit to them which I love. The basic premise of this game is that you are dropped into a world by the main villian Maxwell and you have to survive and escape (Or just survive for as long as you can for the lols). There are subtle hints dropped by the characters at points in the game about each characters back story which is very nice.Graphics: This is a beautiful game... its no Skyrim graphical wise but thats not the point this game focuses on art style rather than realism and it works to its advantage as all the characters look like they were taken from concept art by Tim Burton and they are all unique and just as visually interesting as the world of Don't Starve. This is Art. Overall Verdict: Don't Starve is a great game and I look forward to playing it for years to come and I am also looking very forward to the new game mode ""Don't Starve Together"" which is introducing co-op to the game and I am very interesting in that. Note: People that hate survival games should at least give this one a chance as this is what got me into the survival genre.  "

												I really like the game. It's easy to just start playing, you can use the mouse for everything (particularly crucial for me with repetitive strain injury so I can't do much typing). If you dip into it without preparation (reading forums and the wiki) it's pretty brutal. Permanent death, and frequent! But that just makes it very addictive. I've survived 130 days and can keep my character fed but I'm still being killed by the later hound attacks. There's so much in the game. I like the insanely demanding resource-management against the clock aspect of it. I'm constantly planning and refining new strategies and trying to be more efficient. Inventory-management with so many resources and relatively little space (15 slots main inventory soon fills up. Even with a backpack and Chester I'm still running out of room for everything) is a constant pressure. There's always a hundred different ways to go with each problem. For example, with hound attacks, I've tried toughing it out in melee (works if not too many hounds), hiding under the berry bush hat and hoping the hounds get distracted and killed, and running like a mad thing, hoping they start attacking other monsters on the way. Those are just the most obvious strategies. I could use darts against them (hopefully not taking too much damage if I take some hounds down at range) or build tooth traps with the hounds' teeth they keep dropping when killed, or find a way to get my character resurrected when the hounds kill me (there are at least three ways to resurrect I can think of offhand). And the monsters and their interactions can be so amusing. When I find a beefalo herd, I sometimes take time off from the relentless grind of survival just to watch the baby beefalo playing or sleeping. It still cracks me up.			"

												Don't Starve is an inventive indie game with endless replay value. It constantly updates, so there's always something new to discover. The art style is creatively done like a storybook and the graphics are very sharp. Story wise, the goal is fairly simple: to survive through many worlds in order to defeat Maxwell once and for all.

												Very difficult but really enjoyable - you have to have an interest in indy games as well as craft games such as minecraft, dayz, you know,♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. I know Co-op was in talk, although I'm not sure if they actually finished Co-op, this game has so much potential, it's easy, but very... very hard. :P Buy it while it is on special, I promise the cool graphics and Tim Burton theme will capture you, unless you just hate everything, then just keep hating. :)			"

												I love this game so much already that I decided to play it for about six hours and then drop by just to leave a good review. This game is like a twisted combination of a survival and adventure game, yet every time you play it you get a completely different experience that is definitely worth your time. There are so many different things going on in this game that it's a bit overwhelming at first, but there is a bit of a learning curve and it all gets easier after the first hour or two of gameplay. If you are at all hesitant about purchasing this game, do yourself a favor and buy it now.			"

I am a fan of Don't Starve because of the easy to pick up game play and the surprising depth to the game's mechanics.The Tim Burton'esqu hand drawn style graphics are not really the sort of thing that would attract me.  The sound effects are fine but could use some more variety.  The music is good but repetetive.There are hundreds of hours of fun to be had playing this odd little game.			"

												The graphics are unique and fascinating, personally I love them. Some people even fear the game a bit because the graphics are unsettling to them which I personally just think would only add to the experience of being in a new, hostile world.There are tons of mods for the game if you'd ever get bored of it, a large variety of characters and hours of playtime.The game at first seems real frustrating but in a way that you'd want to give it another shot and avoid what killed you.Also the amount of pets and styles of pets are pretty fun. I personally love Chester most, a treasure chest looking dog creature that follows you around and lets you store things in his mouth.Whenever you seem that the world has dried out and you are sure to die unless you find something that will rejuvinate everyting, it is time to head into the caves. But you risk your life to the new enemies that await you there.It's not ONLY survival as far as you can go, there is for example the Adventure Mode.The different mechanics to the characters and different stats for them make it seem like you're playing another game since you'll have to play the game a completely different way if you're to gain an advantage, so when you've unlocked everything you still might not know what character it is you want to use. None is better than the rest.If you are looking for a realistic game, then this is probably not for you.If you're looking for a game to spend quite a lot of time in and see new types of enemies and like games that look pretty (Perhaps such as Sworcery and Bastion) then this is something you should give a shot.

												Don't starve is 2d survival game with a gorgeous art style that looks like Tim Burton movies have turned into cartoons. There is a sandbox mode, where you try to survive as long as you can, as well as an adventure mode with a minimal story. There is also a wide variety of crafting (as well as cooking) which is neatly organized into different tiers.While the game's purpose is quite simple -not to starve- you get no handholding whatsoever. Your character is stranded in an unknown world, where you need to figure out what to do in order to survive. This can result in several deaths initially, as well as loads of hilarious situations which inevitably occur when you run around poking things. Don't starve is mostly unforgiving to your mistakes -which can end in permanent death- but rewards you with unlocking several characters with unique abilities, in order to spice up your gameplay. There is an option to tweak several world aspects as well, if you are looking for a more casual sandbox experience. I should also mention there are constant updates and a workshop community for this game.Definitely recommend it, if all the above are your cup of tea :)			"

I then ran away and still chopped down trees until I magically turned into a giant beaver. I continuosly ate wood to replinish my health and began attacking the devil tree as the giant beaver. I killed the giant demon tree, which left some wood for me to use. I later used the wood for my campfire, where then the wood screamed at me once I put it in the flame. I ran out of resources for a light source, so then I went into the dark. Then the darkness itself killed me, spilling out all my stuff that I earned up to this point.10/10, would die again			"

												One of the most difficult games I've ever played, yet I keep coming back for more. It'd be easy to stop playing out of frustration, the game doesn't teach you anything and you learn simply by doing. With every death means starting over from scratch, the permadeath is both punishing and extremely rewarding to see how far you will get and how you must adjust your strategy in order to survive. The odds are stacked against you, but it never feels unfair. There is always something you could have done better or a different route you could have taken that may have lead to you living longer. Believe it or not you can even beat this game, or so I've heard.Nothing is more satisfying than figuring out a new mechanic while you are playing simply from experimentation, this game is so finely tuned and balanced that it must've been a nightmare for the devs to make. The combat is excellent yet simple and easy to understand, it is really all you could ask for in a Survival Crafting type game. And to make things even better the Multiplayer version of the game is even more fun, although not yet as feature complete as the singleplayer variant.The graphics are simply beautiful and extremely charming, nothing is more adorable than a sleeping homeless spider or a recently shaved beefalo. Add in unlockable characters, an excellent and tweakable world gen, and a plethora of mods on steam and you have a game that is well worth replaying.			"

Trust me, with permadeath, you will be replaying this alot. Most of the game is infinite resource farming, after a while on a single world. With many characters to test, so many items to find, and so much to do, you will get lost while playing this game. If you like a challange, or ANY kind of sandbox/survival type game, Dont starve is worth the low price tag. 8/10.			"

Also, please make a way to create your own characters in a simple way, such as a ""Character Creation"" option, where you can draw a character in each frame, change their sound to one of the character sounds, and choose their heath, sanity, hunger and other stats.

												Such a unique game, I've been playing this since the early access days and it was amazing to see how it evolved, this is the way all Early Access should be managed. The game was always highly playable but evolved into a completely different beast as it neared release, constantly adding, improving and refining content so that each update made the game feel fresh.There's nothing else on the market quite like it, it's not just the tone and aesthetic that differentiate this from other survival games.  Don't Starve is a unique, fun, highly replayable experience that everybody should try, and hopefully it's only going to be improved by the upcoming multiplayer patch.			"

												I have a very soft spot for this type of games. You start in the wilderness, destitute and alone. You gather, you hunt, you hoard, you craft, you create, you survive. You build an entire civilisation on your own, and what was once an unknown and terrifying place becomes your home, your conquered land, where you have become the apex predator.			"

												Awesome game, favourite survival game of all time. It is so great cause you have such a big choice of what to do. If u wanna survive on only meat go for it, on only carrots and so on. When dawn comes it's time to step away from the fire and head out on adventure. It is great that there are diffrent characters, and that they all are diffrent. The style and art of the game is really cool it makes the game dark and a bit spooky. Sometimes you can get a really annoyed with this game, especially when a pack of hound comes or when you die, but there is something that always keeps dragging you back. I would recomend this game to most people but you have to put in some time to the game to learn to survive in this world. It is also a great game to play while whatcing a movie. And remember to eat anything you can find so you Don't Starve.			"

												Don't Starve is a survival game at it's core and at it's best. You control one of many character that you can unlock, every character has something different about them, from growing beards or having better stats and so on. The goal really is to survive, meantally, physically and eating a lot of crap.The graphics are 2D sprites with a very Tim Burton feel to the graphics, the first character actually somewhat reminds me of him. It's an intresting change of pace.Overall i really recommend this to anyone who likes Terraria or Minecraft and wants a more harsher experiance and tests his/her survial skills. I give this game a 9/10.Pro's- Great survival game- AddictiveCon's- Leanring everything may take a few turns, ride these out though- Building a house to live in would be a nice addition on than just making walls			"

												This game is plenty of fun delivered in a highly stylised fashion. There's more depth than you first expect; the game can be somewhat difficult and unforgiving at times, but it's always enjoyable.The only thing I'd recommend is to take it slow; don't rush in expecting to kill everything in sight and survive simply by stabbing and punching stuff. You need to build yourself up first before you can take on the big game.On top of that, the game has a good modding community; everything from new items, to tweaks to game mechanics to make things far easier or much harder, new fan-made characters and even total conversions (the base game comes with an official surivival horror themed TC).Overall, Don't Starve is well worth the money.

												Review of Don't Starve : Survival games are somewhat my thing, even though i am not good at them, i manage and enjoy playing them!Most survival games are repetitive, like the same world/maps...etc, But not Don't Starve, it is a pandora's box, each gameplay is not the same!The survival in this game is based off 3 thingI) Hunger : it is obvious that a survival game without a hunger meter is no survival game, in this game, there are two ways to get food :1\Hunting2\ planting II) Health : every game has this so there's really no point in explaining!III) Sanity : This is what made the game challenging, you have to keep yourself sane, that is by many ways, but the only one i've discovered is gathering flowers!So let's recap the whole thing : + Single player ( there's a multiplayer version too will be free when you get the game at this time )+ Workshop ( mods )+ Art Style (so you do not have to worry about needing a killing machine PC to play this game)+ Actual working DLC ( Adds a few monters and stuff, so it's worth it to improve the gameplay, but i strongly suggest you get the DLC when you get truly bored from the game )+ Replayable ( since each gameplay is not the same )+ Not a slight bug in sight= Fair XP system+ Many vanilla Characters that differ in skills!So that's a 9/10 i suggest you get it!

												My review is based on all expansions, not really vanilla. I was attracted to this game due to its art style and cute little Chester. Little did I know this artsy survival game had more to offer than most survival games I've played. Unless you have ROG you're missing out on a lot of content. Don't Starve is far from forgiving, at times you might feel the developers had an evil laugh when coming up with ways to kill us helpless survivors. Don't Starve ROG feels like vanilla to me now, playing Don't Starve itself is not enough to give the game its justice, in my opinion. Don't Starve has a lot of depth, if you're more than just a casual there are so many different things to do on this game besides survive year one. (If you can make it past summer) I do wish, however, Klei put more effort into end game (other than caves OFC) I also feel SW is lacking as an expansion but all in all the price for this game in general feels awfully low for something so wonderful, I would've paid a lot more. If you don't like surviving on your own make sure you give DST a try, the community is great, I prefer Don't Starve over Don't Starve Together but that's just my cup of tea. PS, too the noobs, if you're sceptic due to one death causing your world to be erased, there are items you can craft or things you can find in order to have several lives, not only that, but also mods. The mod community for this game is HUGE, if you ever find yourself bored or feel like you need the game to be a little easier, you could try using mods. Some mods completely change Don't Starve, some make the game easier by adding items and characters, or tweaking things, other mods make the game harder. Don't Starve is a great game and the developers are fantastic and helpful.			"

There's a huge amount to discover in don't starve to the point where it's entirely likely no two games will end up the same.  If you fancy a bit of stylized survival and crafting with a sense of humour and a really well designed, addictive mechanic.. You want to grab this.			"

												Totally got immersed with the world of Don't Starve the moment I started playing it.Survived for 36 days so far without dying and boy oh boy this game is so much fun and at the same time friggin hard. Went exploring around, met some penguins who tried murder me. Then came winter! Apparently, I build my base next to a walrus camp without knowing and that blob sent his dogs        and was blowing darts at me with 100% accuracy. Killed his dogs and chased him and it took forever to kill him since        he was running away.            Survived two more days after that then ffs a giant abominable cyclops with horns destroyed my base! My point is everything in this game hates you and tries to kill you (If you try to hurt or kill them) Either you get killed by living tree monsters, bees, warthog looking animals, penguins, spiders or you die if you starve. Oh and the Tim Burton visual style for this game suits it very well.Overall, 10/10 for this game and is a must have for those who like Survival games genres. "

I am not the type of gamer who wants to sit through an introduction on how the game is played, or the 20 minutes of intro scenes. This game takes all of that away and leaves you will really unique game play where you have to constantly keep up with your hunger, sanity, and health. After playing for a few hours, I realize how much more to this game that there is. If you have $15 to spare on a game, this would be a good choice!			"

Permadeath with make you punch something after losing your 6 hour + game to a stupid mistake.  I have lost a ton of characters to just forgetting about something like poison or not healing before a fight.  The game gets better with additional playthroughs and you will see very different worlds each time.  The game has changed a lot since launch and I think klie is making even more content.

												The game starts out maddening but as you figure out exactly how to play and what strategy you're going to follow it becomes completely addictive. Love the graphics, the ambiance and how the game actually feels different when you change characters. It can be frustrating when you put so much time and effort in and then lose it all when you die, but I think that is what the game is about. It doesn't pull any punches and it is incredibly challenging. Makes it feel all the sweeter when you do make it further or learn a new trick that gets you a lot further.			"

												I strongly recommend this game.  Reminds me of Minecraft's first few minutes/hours where you're scraping to stay alive, but this is harder, and more rewarding, minus the building for the most part.  The art style is great, very atmospheric and fun to watch.  Though no in-game instruction is given, the difficulty of picking up on how things work isn't bad, after a couple deaths, you'll know how to progress through the first few days.  That's my one gripe, dying starts you over, with no save game, it automatically deletes it for you.  This lends urgency to your quest to survive, which I like, but the first 3 days or so take half an hour, and there's not much variation in during that time, so it starts to feel a little repetitive.  But after that, there's tons of cool stuff, so it's a minor annoyance.  Also, to be fair, I wouldn't have to play those first three days so many times if I'd just follow the direction, ""Don't Starve""			"

												Don't Starve.  Sounds simple enough.  Also, don't go insane.  And don't get eaten by hounds, smashed by Tree Guardians, crushed by the Deerclops, hunted by MacTusk & Son, stung by killer bees, bitten by spiders, slapped by tentacles, mauled by were-pigs, or even stampeded by Beefalos in heat.  Got all that?  Well, then you're going to need some supplies.  Supplies that are guared by hounds, Tree Guardians, Deerclops, MacTusk & Son, killer bees, spiders, tentacles, were-pigs, and beefalos.			"

												Don't Starve is an inventive indie game with endless replay value. It constantly updates, so there's always something new to discover. The art style is creatively done like a storybook and the graphics are very sharp. Story wise, the goal is fairly simple: to survive through many worlds in order to defeat Maxwell once and for all.

												Don't Starve is a top down 2D survival game! As the player you are dropped into the middle of a wilderness as Wilson (you unlock more characters as you play and survive for longer) and must survive by gathering resources, crafting and fighting monsters as well as your sanity.The art style is incredibly unique and I'm very fond of the gothic look and feel it has. The gameplay is very easy to gain an understanding of, you simply point and click to pick up resources and click to interact with the world. But the difficulty comes when as the days progress and you come face to face with more challenging environments and creatures that don't like what you do.Thing is, in Don't Starve, when you manage to kill certain creatures or you manage to survive past a certain amount of time, you feel like you've really accomplished something. For example, by killing Beefalo, which are incredibly tough very early on you will get great resources for future use which can help you go on for much much longer!This game will constantly frustrate you at the beginning, but learning the game is massively rewarding!

												I wasn't too sure about this game when I first saw it.  Then I saw the pocket edition for my phone and decided that I would give it a try.   It took all of 5 minutes for me to realize that I HAD to have this on my PC.  I bought the bundle of the original game,  Reign of Giants, and Shipwrecked. I cannot put this game away.   I think it's totally possible that this game got its title not because of the starvation that can happen in the game but the starvation that can happen to you in the real world when you start playing this game!  I love the exploration that this game puts you through.   I have resisted the urge to watch videos or get tips online because the ""not knowing what's going to happen next"" aspect really adds to the experience.   Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.   It's well worth the price for the intense HOURS of fun,  stress, frustration, and obsession that you will experience while playing.			"

												Don't Starve is a survival game at it's core and at it's best. You control one of many character that you can unlock, every character has something different about them, from growing beards or having better stats and so on. The goal really is to survive, meantally, physically and eating a lot of crap.The graphics are 2D sprites with a very Tim Burton feel to the graphics, the first character actually somewhat reminds me of him. It's an intresting change of pace.Overall i really recommend this to anyone who likes Terraria or Minecraft and wants a more harsher experiance and tests his/her survial skills. I give this game a 9/10.Pro's- Great survival game- AddictiveCon's- Leanring everything may take a few turns, ride these out though- Building a house to live in would be a nice addition on than just making walls			"

												For such a simple objective--not starving (or dying by creature, cold, heat, darkness, or other means)--this game is extremely rich and complex.  It has two modes; a sandbox survival mode in which your goal is simply to explore and become self-sustaining, and an adventure mode in which your goal is to overcome harsh environments to complete a machine to move to the next world.  You can play either in the spirit of discovering how to construct, create, and build everything yourself or consult and external reference for help, but either way, you'll be presented with a challenge that will keep you occupied and wanting to go a little further for weeks.  I highly recommend it!			"

												Awesome game, favourite survival game of all time. It is so great cause you have such a big choice of what to do. If u wanna survive on only meat go for it, on only carrots and so on. When dawn comes it's time to step away from the fire and head out on adventure. It is great that there are diffrent characters, and that they all are diffrent. The style and art of the game is really cool it makes the game dark and a bit spooky. Sometimes you can get a really annoyed with this game, especially when a pack of hound comes or when you die, but there is something that always keeps dragging you back. I would recomend this game to most people but you have to put in some time to the game to learn to survive in this world. It is also a great game to play while whatcing a movie. And remember to eat anything you can find so you Don't Starve.			"

This game is brilliant in its simplicity and depth.  With each death, you learn a little bit more about how to survive for longer.  My only complaint is that once you figure out how to survive, the game can stagnate and become rather dull.  Sure, you can make up your own endgame goals, but I wish there was better endgame content.			"

Sure its a survival game, but after playing it the first few times you feel as if you are on a mission show what killed you before whos boss. The art stlye beautiful and despite being out for a while it continues to grow as a community and a game. Everytime you die you start over with new knowledge than you had before. DLCs  and Mods add for a fun experience that change things up when it seems a little tedious, but as a whole it is fun to try and beat your own score of how long you can survive. Make bold decisions, and don't give up. "

												I absolutely love this game. You get thrown into the world with absolutely no real tutorials, just the challenge to try to not starve to death, or die from insanity. A tutorial is honeslty not needed though. You can quickly learn the basics through trial and error, exploring new combinations of actions. The ui layout is simple, you have various characters to choose from and even a short minimod available if you choose, which is awesome even for how short it is. I originally saw this on a game stream a friend was watching and had to play it. I am not sure if this still works, but I was able to take my game key and register it within a chrome app so I can even play quick games in my chrome browser at no extra cost. Amazing replay value.

												This is basically the premier ""survival game"", and barring a few classic roguelikes it is also the premier randomly generated game. It owes these high honors to its extremely long development and constant updates, bugfoxes, and balance patches. It's important for a randomly generated game to have a significant amount of content in order to keep replays fresh and exciting; I'm sure it was for this reason that the developers did not stop when the game was merely ""adequate"". My only complaint is the occasionally inaccurate diablo-style controls that occasionally force the player to learn some strange workarounds. In conclusion if you're not Not Starving yet why aren't you Not Starving?			"

												Don't Starve is a wonderful survival and exploration game for the ones who crave adventure. Durring the day, You are free to do what you wish. At nightfall, Stepping into the pitch black of the night will get you killed. Make a campfire, or be adventerous and explore with torches and a miner hat! Beware however, death in this game isnt just a simple click to respawn. Death means you must start all over again, in a new world.Oh, and a word of advice: Dont play with fire.			"

												Gather resources, build weapons, cook food, kill mobs ... sounds like Minecraft eh?That's where the similarities end. This game can be brutal as everything in this game will kill you ... I mean everything!!!Bees ... kill you!Spiders ... kill you!Hounds ... kill you!Horny Beefalo ... kill you!Insanity ... kills you!Hunger ... kills you!Darkness ... kills you!Even winter ... yep, you guessed it, winter kills you as well!If you like survival games and the Tim Burton style graphics, you'll love this game! However, you may find the game challenging and a little frustrating at first until you start to find your way. Don't let this put you off because as soon as you find your way you will immediately find yourself addicted and telling yourself ""just one more day then i'll switch off I promise"" only to find yourself playing through at least another 10 days ... well, if you survive that long.My tips for getting started:- Explore anywhere and everywhere but find a good base within 5 days if possible ... pigmen are your friend and so are Beefalo (just not when horny!) so pick somewhere nearby- Gather resources as quick as you can and when you think you have enough, collect more ... you'll NEVER have enough!!!- Always make sure you have the ability to make fire, and- Get a weapon ... you never know when the first attack is coming.Remember folks, winter is coming (as well as a lot of angry mobs) so be prepared ... and whatever you do, Don't Starve!

												Don't Starve is a game about surviving and well, not starving. You search the enviroment collecting necessary items and sometimes even non-necessary items. You encounter monsters. You craft things. It's a game. There are multiple characters. I love it.Pros, things that are good.- Multiple characters with different traits and abilities!- Much replayability!- There are lots of mods to make it even better.- New updates frequently!- GREAT DLC!Neutral, things that can help you and not help you.- Randomly generated world. You could have tons of food, flowers, trees, flint, rocks, other great stuff. And then you could get no food, flowers, trees, flint, rocks, ect.- You play alone. You may have trouble surviving, but you can go at your own pace.Cons, things that are bad.- Day 9 - 11, it's random, gives you hounds to fight.- There are lots of dangerous monsters.Overall, there are more pros than cons, so I reccomend this game to people who like survival games.

												I'm a big minecraft fan, especially playing survival game types. Unfortunately, I have a big issue with minecraft and survival games - it's too damn easy! It's too easy to make impervious shelters, stockpile food, and there arent any mobs that are dangerous if you're cautious and attentative. It's really hard to make the game difficult while still playable, so I've been looking desperately for other options.Don't Starve addresses many of the issues I mentioned above - shelter is hard to build (and never impervious/safe), food can't be easilt stockpiled (it spoils!! Woo!), and enemies can be VERY deadly, even when you are prepared. The seasons are also great in that they impact food availability and hot/cold can do you physical harm. So many great mechanics!Only downside is the game is currently only single player, but they are currently working on Don't Starve Together, which I'm super excited for.In short, if you like survival games but want a more challenging environment, check this game out.

												This game is incredible its just like your basic Sandboxish game with the build and stuff but it also has a legimate adventure mode once you make the diving rod and find maxwells portal anywayDont starve has many aspects so you will die eventually (unless you have a crap ton of farms to last you forever)Plus even if you do die you get xp points so you can get a new characterDont starve offers a very simple way to install mods like all steam stuff anyway~And Dont starve never gets old because if you die you still havn't found everything in the game yet.Another mechanic there is in dont starve is the Sanity system and the being afraid of the dark.During night or doing other stuff such as picking evil flowers can reduce your sanity and the lower it getsthe more Ghosts you see that want to kill you,At night if you dont have any light around you,then you'll just die cuz of monsters lurking in the darkEdit: The dlc ""Reign of giants"" is a great addition for hardcore players who tend to find dont starve too easy and are looking for a better challenge,one thing we would all like to see tho is Multiplayer in either a mod form or just added to the game.Anyway dont starve is a brilliant game and this is the longest review i've written.

												At first I had thought Don't Starve would be easy, but I soon found out I was way wrong when a tree suddenly turned into a giant monster and murdered me on Day 17. I honestly was not expecting that. That bad experience was not in vain, though. Now I know in my future lives not to chop trees at dawn (seriously, don't). This is a good example of how you must learn from your experiences in order to do well in this game. The only way to succeed is by trial and error, and although it can be extremely frustrating when you lose everything, that is kind of what makes the game fun; knowing such a fate is possible puts you on edge. Also, the mod support is amazing. Getting new mods is literally 3 clicks away, and you can then easily enable/disable them from a convenient menu at the main screen. This is truely a great survival game so buy it if you're in to that kind of stuff, and good luck.			"

												There is so much to do. There is too much to do. Not enough time. I'm going to waste my life on this game. Maximum I've lasted is 30 days. Either winter or summer, I have not been able to survive. Summer burns everything in its path. Winter is kinda ok, you just need a thermal stone and rabbit earmuffs or beefalo coats.I love the way the map is randomized every time. That way I don't mind beginning anew each time.The game is incredibly difficult. I wonder how many people have actually beaten adventure mode.Frogs and spiders don't attack each other. Or so I found. Thumb rule is to expose an attacking enemy (spiders, bats, frogs) to a non-attacking enemy (beefalo, bees, pigs) while you run around and collect their drops.Cons - no tutorial. That sort of undermines the value of unique items. We store them but we never get around to realizing what they are meant to do. Unless you build those prehestihilitator things.- pixelated graphics at close-up. Maybe it's just the settings. But I can't make out if it reads 12 stones needed or 2.- at default settings, not all characters are present on every map. Not that I've ever explored the whole map. But sometimes, some resources are really scarce. Buy the game. Support the developers. And remember, it's not just Don't Starve. It's Don't Get Hit, Don't Stay in Dark, Don't Eat Mushrooms, Don't nay NEVER Attack Creatures in Groups, Don't Stand Idle, Don't Stop Collecting Twigs, Grass and Rocks, Don't er Do Plant Trees.			"

												This game is one of the best games i have ever played that is a survival game. The main protagonist is a mad scientist called Wilson who gets sucked into a world, where he (you) have to survive by killing animals for their fur to make clothes for the winter and meat for not starving and pick, garden vegetables for not starving too... and you can make weapons, staffs (magical things), traps, armor and other really cool stuff to survive...The map in this game is random however you chose between small, medium and HIGH (size for the map) but it's nature. A lot of trees, water, flowers, fields and swamps. But be aware you are not alone... there are monsters and wild animals in this game that might not be so friendly as they look like... and you have to build a fire before night comes, because if you don't... shadow monsters will kill you in the darkness without you seeing it coming...And actually you don't always have to play as the main character you can play as other characters once you unlocked them... and you can download other characters at the workshop... but the original characters for this game always have names that starts at the letter ""w"" except the last character in the list...It's an amazing game with amazing graphics (cartoon graphics) ,amazing music, amazing story, amazing experience, amazing concept and amazing everything!!! :) 10/10 ...But i recommend you buying this game for ps4 (if you have one) because it has a lot of better control for the gamepad then.

												This game is really unique and charming.  I particularly recommend it to fans of survival TV shows as it gives you a survival game experience.In the game, it is a constant struggle to manage your hunger, health and sanity levels.  You are always prioritizing what you need to better your survival situation.  You rarely have time to sit around idle, and are always on the hunt for things you need while fending off occasional attacks from wild hounds or other creatures you come across.Also, with the addition of Steam Workshop, you can easily tailor the game even more to your liking.

												What can I say about Don't Starve?The game has changed so much since it's early access stages that it's like playing a different game in a good way.It's probably one of the best sandbox adventure game out in the market, with a huge and I say HUGE content from both the devs and all the modding community.Buy the Alone pack for all the dlc, or get the Mega Pack for the online experience with friends, either way you'll get hundreds of hours of pure entertainment.

												Don't Starve is THE good survival game. Colorful art style, nice music an TONS of chalenging stuff.The main thing: Maxwell lefts you in somewhere, and you'll need to sruvive. Sounds easy, huh? I'm telling you it will be MUCH more harder than any other survival game. No, there's no tutorial or something. You are totally alone and need to learn things to survive. I willl never get bored of it, that's for sure.Graphics: 9/10Music and sounds: 9/10Gameplay: 10/10Overall: 9.9/10			"

												Dying a lot has never been so fun.Super replayable and filled with all sorts of fun ways for your poor player character to perish. Also, if the base game isn't enough for you, there are two expansions and a bunch of mods to spice things up. (I'm loving Shipwrecked!)			"

												Dont Starve is a relitively hard game to start on without going on somthing like the wiki or watching others play it, though the first few times you might not know how to get a flint to make that axe and so you will die when night comes. But the great thing is, that you learn from your mistakes. Instead you will go do somthing else that isnt just picking flowers and chasing butterfly's. then you will go on, go and live your insane hungry life for a few more days.			"

												I love this game!  This is a survival game in every essense of the word. In a world where you can die at one simple mistake, it really embodies a true survival experience. The amount of sheer content is enough to pick up this game alone. With randomly generated worlds, many characters that change the way you play, a wide assortment of resources that i'm sure i haven't found all of yet, a great art design, a living, breathing world everytime you boot up a map, caves, ruins, a huge and complex crafting assortment, a story mode, multiplayer being put in after early access of DST, customizable worlds, and one of the best modding communities, this game has an imense amount of lastability and will age extremely well.      The soundtrack is interesting but grows old. After a few hours I started listening to my own music. This is what I call a ""wiki game"" meaning you will have to live on the wiki if you want to have a clue on what to do. The biggest downfall of this game is the fact that to utilize most of the content, you have to be good, which goes back to the wiki.      Once you've become a grade A survivor, you will find yourself losing countless afternoons on building up your camp, testing new mods and so on. It is an amazing survival games and one of the best indie titles to come out of the past few years. You owe it to yourself not to overlook this masterpiece 10/10       Just look out for penguins......I HAD IT THAT TIME YOU SCUM!!!! AAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! Just one more try.....			"

												I made fun of my roommate when he bought this game. i had seen it and it looked silly and boring. however, after watching him play for about 5 minutes and asking, ""What's that?"" about a million times i bought it myself. The game is surprisingly addictive. there is more depth to this game than many i have played and it also has a broad appeal. there is humor and strategy evenly mixed with a fair bit of action at intervals just long enough to keep the game from getting boring or repetative. It is both frustrating and rewarding. you will laugh at silly ways you can die after spending hours setting up you camp and smile as you load the next attempt.Pros:deep strategy and planning are rewardedCons:where did Thursday go?

												When I first came across Don't Starve I assumed it was just another Minecraft clone. After playing for a while, I soon discovered how wrong I was.The game itself, in my opinion, is far superior to Minecraft. It's addicting, quirky, creative, witty and overall lovable. You'll find yourself clinging to dear life as you fight against all odds to stay alive and make it to the end. The gameplay is smooth and easy to get used to, and the art style is magnificent. So much of the game is done perfectly and while the vanilla game is already lovely, the modding community only makes it better. Don't Starve is a great game and I recommend it completely. Oh, and once you get the hang of things you should look into getting the DLC. It's more than worth the price.			"

												This game is amazing. The style is incredibly cool, the music is great, and the gameplay even better. I cannot find the words to accurately summarise the level of awesome Don't Starve is, it's just absolutely brilliant, in so many ways. As you get no tutorial, no hints (apart from the obvious - don't starve!), it is a game of figuring stuff out at first, and there are so many things to expore, find, and craft! Seeing as you can customise just about everything in your world before you start a game, there are endless possibilities when it comes to difficulty, and not to mention, the dreaded Adventure mode which will make you want to gouge your eyes out with a rusty spoon and throw them at the treeguards while you scream with the fury of a thousand suns. If you like survival, base building, hillarious puns, exploring, crafting, and not having a game tell you exactly what to do at all times - Don't Starve is for you. 10/10 in my book!...Apart from the treeguards. F*** you, treeguards.			"

												Don't Starve is such a good game to play if you love a sharp and ""Tim Burton"" esque art style. The ideas and concept of this game are really cool, especially the characters such as Wilson, Willow, etc. Although the game has a nice aesthetic, the survival aspect is pretty relative for survival game goers. The workshop is also very good, I usually get custom characters and items and such. Overall a good game, definately worth a play if you love survival.			"

												The whole game is a buttload of fun! If you think minecraft was hard, this'll be even more difficult. The adventure aspect of this game is absolutely wonderful with the dangerous nights. The thing I don't like about this game is the delay when you're attacking. Whenever a tree guardian is about to hit, I immediatly dodge in don't starve together. In this game, when I stop holding the left mouse button, it has a 1.5 second delay and the mob ends up killing me. Other than that, the game overall is great.			"

												As a hardcore fan of RTS or RPG games such as the StarCraft or Diablo series I wasn't too familiar with too many indie titles and Don't Starve was basically the first sandbox action-adventure game I've ever really tried playing. I actually saw my girlfriend play it on my computer when she came over and it looked pretty interesting which is why I took the time to play it on her account and eventually decided to buy my own copy (this probably had more to do with wanting to try DST though). Even if English isn't your first language, Don't Starve is pretty simplified in terms of navigation.			"

												There are plenty of videos out there showing game play, but I think the best recommendation for this game is how much new stuff you still learn about the game on almost every playthrough. At first, the game appears impossible and that everything is out to kill you. While not impossible, most things are out to kill you, and survival is using it to your advantage. Then, as you learn what is important, when is the best time to do things, how to do them, where to go (or not go), and why you should, the game becomes ""easier"".Make no mistake, on my current playthrough, I am almost to Day 200 and the game is certainly not easier. In fact, some things have gotten more difficult, and death is around every turn. However, this is what makes the game so great.Then, to top it all off, there is Adventure Mode, which is accessed via an object in the Sandbox Mode (where all games start). While Sandbox Mode could be a full game by itself, Adventure Mode is like checking ""Hardcore"" as you have to take everything you know from Sandbox and use it to make it through all the Chapters (a feat I have yet to accomplish). These Chapters ramp up certain challenges, limit a random resource, etc. Fortunately, this is where the game does let up, as you can repeat Adventure Mode without consquences because you ""regain consciousness"" upon death in your Sandbox Mode to try again. The best part? The Chapters and levels are regenerated every restart, so you cannot memorize the maps, making it truly an ""adventure"".tl;dr You want a challenging game that makes you think, and punishes your every mistake? Get this game.			"

												After watching trailers and several pictures provided, Don’t Starve’s bettlejuice inspiration, alluring soundtrack, and hand-drawn adorable cast of characters to the wilderness the itself, it begged me to play it. Aside its show and tell features, Don’t Starve truly emphasis the survival genre. Survive however you want to survive: live off the land, wield dark magic, rely on old school hunting tactics, or take your enemies head on to a glorious death. Be prepared for anything and stay well stocked, because if you’re not, the telltale of winter will make survival become much harder. If you find the game too easy, too hard or isn't offering the challenge you want, no problem. There’s plenty of options for you to customize your own world, however you see fit.The asking price is fair or even spot on with its abundance of content and uniqueness makes this survival game truly stand out. Search no further for I utmost recommend this game for those who love survival and looking for uniqueness. The Reign of Giants (RoG) DLC made the game even more content, stronger, dangerous and funnier survival experience.			"

												This game is a very detailed and complex game that starts out with you waking up and this man pops out of the ground. He tells you to look for some food before nightfall so, you take his advice and get up off the ground in search of flint, food, etc. It seems so simple yet it is so complex! there are many characters in the game that you DO NOT NEED TO BUY! They are all unlocked by survivng and gaining XP. This game is a very addictive game that keeps you coming back! There are also mods like Wulfe, Easter Eggs, and Bigger Stacks (my reccomendations). Check this game out and get the Reign Of Giants DLC, its really cool! So, overall, this game is a fantasy-based game that feels like Minecraft and Terraria but in a 3-D world with more things to craft, much more things to do, and many other fantasy creatures out to get you like Hounds, Tallbirds, Spiders, etc. So, check this game out! And are you good enough to not Starve?			"

												This was my first ""early access"" game to ever try and probably the only reason I tried a lot of duds after that. Now that it's released, I still enjoy playing it. Plus there's a lot of mods that completely change the way the game plays, giving it a lot of replayability.If you like these sort of open-ended survival sims then you'll enjoy this one. The cartoonish artwork is unique in style as well as amusing and pleasant. The storyline is interesting but I more or less end up ignoring it and making my own fun. Catching frogs in baskets is endless amusement.			"

												When I first came across Don't Starve I assumed it was just another Minecraft clone. After playing for a while, I soon discovered how wrong I was.The game itself, in my opinion, is far superior to Minecraft. It's addicting, quirky, creative, witty and overall lovable. You'll find yourself clinging to dear life as you fight against all odds to stay alive and make it to the end. The gameplay is smooth and easy to get used to, and the art style is magnificent. So much of the game is done perfectly and while the vanilla game is already lovely, the modding community only makes it better. Don't Starve is a great game and I recommend it completely. Oh, and once you get the hang of things you should look into getting the DLC. It's more than worth the price.			"

												As a hardcore fan of RTS or RPG games such as the StarCraft or Diablo series I wasn't too familiar with too many indie titles and Don't Starve was basically the first sandbox action-adventure game I've ever really tried playing. I actually saw my girlfriend play it on my computer when she came over and it looked pretty interesting which is why I took the time to play it on her account and eventually decided to buy my own copy (this probably had more to do with wanting to try DST though). Even if English isn't your first language, Don't Starve is pretty simplified in terms of navigation.			"

												The whole game is a buttload of fun! If you think minecraft was hard, this'll be even more difficult. The adventure aspect of this game is absolutely wonderful with the dangerous nights. The thing I don't like about this game is the delay when you're attacking. Whenever a tree guardian is about to hit, I immediatly dodge in don't starve together. In this game, when I stop holding the left mouse button, it has a 1.5 second delay and the mob ends up killing me. Other than that, the game overall is great.			"

You spawn into a world with nothing, and you need to create a way of life which will contribute in your will to survive. Chopping down trees, killing Rabbits, crafting campfires to survive the pitch black night. A game you can easily put hours into without even noticing. Definately worth buying, especially while on sale.10/10			"

WTF WAS THAT! Anyways i died but i got resurected at a touch stone i didn't know about :D and he was gone when i came back! (lucky me)Finally the huricane season ended and im in the first day of the Monson (i think) season, and guess what, i found a friking cat shark, that chewed my boat, i thought that i can go fast on an island and prepare for him, yah not that great of an idea, because that freak came on the island and chased me, a friking fish came on the island ON LEGS... but i killed it :DAnd yah, thats why i love Don't Starve.

												This game is really unique and charming.  I particularly recommend it to fans of survival TV shows as it gives you a survival game experience.In the game, it is a constant struggle to manage your hunger, health and sanity levels.  You are always prioritizing what you need to better your survival situation.  You rarely have time to sit around idle, and are always on the hunt for things you need while fending off occasional attacks from wild hounds or other creatures you come across.Also, with the addition of Steam Workshop, you can easily tailor the game even more to your liking.

												I've played this game twice as much on old computer. For me - best survival ever.

												The game will constantly make you feel like you need resources. It will trick you into thinking you're comfortable but then you'll start dying and your entire base is now in ash. It's amazing. You're always on the move and you need to always be ahead of the game. Always thinking about what you need next. A race against time.			"

												At first I had thought Don't Starve would be easy, but I soon found out I was way wrong when a tree suddenly turned into a giant monster and murdered me on Day 17. I honestly was not expecting that. That bad experience was not in vain, though. Now I know in my future lives not to chop trees at dawn (seriously, don't). This is a good example of how you must learn from your experiences in order to do well in this game. The only way to succeed is by trial and error, and although it can be extremely frustrating when you lose everything, that is kind of what makes the game fun; knowing such a fate is possible puts you on edge. Also, the mod support is amazing. Getting new mods is literally 3 clicks away, and you can then easily enable/disable them from a convenient menu at the main screen. This is truely a great survival game so buy it if you're in to that kind of stuff, and good luck.			"

I killed the giant demon tree, which left some wood for me to use. I later used the wood for my campfire, where then the wood screamed at me once I put it in the flame.

												Don't Starve is one of the best crafted titles in my entire library. Everything works together exceptionally well. The Burtonesque art style is great, the slightly disturbing music continually sets me on edge and the things that go bump in the night make me jump in the day. The game is one of survival. You'll be chopping wood, mining ore, farming....oh wait, this sounds familiar. It sounds like every other survival game. Except it's not. You're going to be crafting some really odd things with odd ingredients. Without spoiling it for you, there's just a lot of weird things that you can and will need to make out of wood, stone, gold, monster meat, etc.  Weapns. Armor. Boomerrangs. Crock pots. Science machines. That's the normal stuff - the weird stuff is just weird. You'll be facing creatures that are cartoonish nightmares. You're going to explore a game world that's quite original and of course, randomly generated with each start.And you're going to die. A lot. In fact, Don't Starve isn't a game. It's a death simulator.You'll die of starvation.You'll die of exposure.You'll die from bees.You'll die from walking trees.You'll die from ostrich-looking things.You'll die from your beefalos in rutting season.You'll die from things that go bump in the night.You'll die because you went insane.You'll die by spiders. You'll die by a dozen other things.And maybe, you might just starve.It's a survival game and there's no saving, so one mistake and you'll be restarting again from scratch. I generally hate that and avoid games that require restarts. Yet I keep playing Don't Starve. It's the favorite game in my library that I truly, completely suck at playing. I'm terrible and yet I have a good time.This is one that no gamer should be without.PS - Note that there are a couple of expansions for this. I never picked them up because they make the game harder and I don't need the help dying.			"

												What can I say about this game what has not been said before?Beautiful style, a lovely story that many fans even to this day try to figure out the missing pieces and cannot wait for an official one to see how all the characters tie in.Many ways to die and some can be funny, others annoying but hey, live and learn. The mods make it a whole new game so plenty to do if your bored with the original game itself. I am delighted this game allows people to create mods as there are lovely ones yet still waiting for the mod which lets me make bridges to cross the sea ;)If you love Minecraft then you will love this with its extra challenges and surprises. Would highly shove this game into my friends faces until they buy it			"

												Don't starve is 2d survival game with a gorgeous art style that looks like Tim Burton movies have turned into cartoons. There is a sandbox mode, where you try to survive as long as you can, as well as an adventure mode with a minimal story. There is also a wide variety of crafting (as well as cooking) which is neatly organized into different tiers.While the game's purpose is quite simple -not to starve- you get no handholding whatsoever. Your character is stranded in an unknown world, where you need to figure out what to do in order to survive. This can result in several deaths initially, as well as loads of hilarious situations which inevitably occur when you run around poking things. Don't starve is mostly unforgiving to your mistakes -which can end in permanent death- but rewards you with unlocking several characters with unique abilities, in order to spice up your gameplay. There is an option to tweak several world aspects as well, if you are looking for a more casual sandbox experience. I should also mention there are constant updates and a workshop community for this game.Definitely recommend it, if all the above are your cup of tea :)			"

												I bought this game a couple of years ago and since then have notched up close to 1000 hours after probably a break of six months or so, I felt drawn back recently.  For those who don't know, DS comes in essentially four formats - vanilla (Original DS), Reign of Giants - more challenges more environmental hazards, DS Together (Multiplayer) and Shipwrecked.  DS is a quirky and fun survivalist game, the Tim Burton style graphics are part of the significant charm of Don't Starve.  Arriving in a world with nothing, you must forage, build a base camp, hunt, trap, fish and farm... all the time exploring whilst preparing for battle with the bosses and the harsh weather conditions of the next seasons whilst trying to keep the nightmares away.  There are multiple characters to play as, having different strengths and weaknesses and their own unique charm. There are many different ways to play this game, you can be an animal lover, just living off what you can farm, or hunt down the various animals in game for a meatier diet.  You can have a central base or live a more nomadic lifestyle with perhaps smaller satalite bases dotted around the world.  There is an adventure mode and also the ability to decamp and travel to a newly generated world when you get bored of your current one.  Since the launch of DS shipwrecked it is now possible to link a DS Reign of Giants world to a Shipwrecked world, allowing you the ability to world hop back and forth and enjoy two different worlds within one game.The world is extensive, and comes with significant customisation options to allow you to design bespoke worlds to suit your game play, in addition to this the modding community have gone to town with this game, providing all kinds of bolt on mods including additional bosses/beasts and characters for gamers to enjoy.  When I stumbled across this beauty on a Youtube video, I knew immediately that I wanted it.  I died so many times in the first few weeks and I remember the first time I made it to day 21 in DS and the start of Winter, only to spend a pitiful 2 days by the fire with no warm clothing and no means to make it far enough to find the resources to make the clothing... cue another frustrating death.  Fortunately, one of the best parts of this game is that starting over is as engaging as being 100 + days in, the battle against time to prepare for what's to come, the flexibility of world hopping when this world becomes a chore or over run with spider queens or stripped of resources.... The thought that has gone into DS is brilliant, its a game that is gripping, fun and challenging.  Don't be fooled though by its cute quirky graphics... you will die lots, you will laugh, cry, threaten to throw your computer through the window... and you will love it.  It really is a game that will provide endless hours of ammusment. I can highly reccomend.			"

												The graphics are unique and fascinating, personally I love them. Some people even fear the game a bit because the graphics are unsettling to them which I personally just think would only add to the experience of being in a new, hostile world.There are tons of mods for the game if you'd ever get bored of it, a large variety of characters and hours of playtime.The game at first seems real frustrating but in a way that you'd want to give it another shot and avoid what killed you.Also the amount of pets and styles of pets are pretty fun. I personally love Chester most, a treasure chest looking dog creature that follows you around and lets you store things in his mouth.Whenever you seem that the world has dried out and you are sure to die unless you find something that will rejuvinate everyting, it is time to head into the caves. But you risk your life to the new enemies that await you there.It's not ONLY survival as far as you can go, there is for example the Adventure Mode.The different mechanics to the characters and different stats for them make it seem like you're playing another game since you'll have to play the game a completely different way if you're to gain an advantage, so when you've unlocked everything you still might not know what character it is you want to use. None is better than the rest.If you are looking for a realistic game, then this is probably not for you.If you're looking for a game to spend quite a lot of time in and see new types of enemies and like games that look pretty (Perhaps such as Sworcery and Bastion) then this is something you should give a shot.

												This is a fantastic indie survival game with some dark themes and great artwork. The game can be difficult at times and requires some studying up or some trial and error to understand the different elements that exist in the world. The creatures are very unique and new features are still being added to the game even after the release. With the addition of easy modding and the steam workshop it's going to be hard to get bored of this game. I've payed 90+ hours so far and haven't even started looking at the mods.			"

You just have to learn how to play the first couple of times, learn from your mistakes and subsequently learn to survive. It takes some thought on how to manage your health, sanity and hunger. The different playable characters each add something to the game experience with good musical dialogue and perks.

Its such a great experience on so many levels that I can't do anything but recomend this game.Atmosphere and stlye are paramount here, but not at the cost of substence and gameplay as is sometimes the case. This won't be the first time someone has said this, but this is a survival game made to match the sensibilities of Tim Burton movies and its just great. A silly yet horrifying time is to be expected as you attempt to survive and craft your way through a world hellbent on killing you.A more long winded review can be found here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2013/03/dont-starve.html.

												This game runs fine on my old PC, and that's why I started playing it.  Then, unlike other less demanding games, this game is quite fun to play and can be addictive for awhile.  That's because you are watching yourself slowly going insane, starve to death, or die from loosing health, and it's difficult to deal with the problems right away.  It requires planning, tactics, and right executions to survive against lack of resources (food / rocks), cold weather, and sudden dangers from monsters.The game gets updated quite regularly, and it becomes slightly harder - because of introduction to new element : rainy day, new monster, etc.  If you have one in your inventory, I recommend adding it to your library and start playing it, before it gets too difficult.

												When i had first heard about this game my friend told me about it, but i wasn't sure if it would be as a mazing as he made it out to be but to my surprise it was. This game is so unique and it has a very creative style to it. It requires you to prepare and to strategize. This game was very well thought out and has impressed me. i've never enjoyed a game so much! Hope to see some updates soon!			"

												I like this game it is fun for the whole family and you can enjoy it anytime no matter what you are doing. The game can seem very hard and like you want to stop playing forever because you die. But this game keeps you coming back over and over for a long time. I think this game is great and with the new DLC coming out soon the game has a lot to offer.			"

												This game runs fine on my old PC, and that's why I started playing it.  Then, unlike other less demanding games, this game is quite fun to play and can be addictive for awhile.  That's because you are watching yourself slowly going insane, starve to death, or die from loosing health, and it's difficult to deal with the problems right away.  It requires planning, tactics, and right executions to survive against lack of resources (food / rocks), cold weather, and sudden dangers from monsters.The game gets updated quite regularly, and it becomes slightly harder - because of introduction to new element : rainy day, new monster, etc.  If you have one in your inventory, I recommend adding it to your library and start playing it, before it gets too difficult.

												An insidious little game that presents itself to you in an easy to understand and play interface but has astounding depth and replay value. You will die, a lot. And with each death learn, and become better at surviving. And try again. And again. And again. When you have mastered surviving winter, giant monsters will demolish you. When you survive giant monsters, cave dwelling beasts will devour you. When you survive even those, youa re ready for Reign of Giants and Summer witll make you long for winter. And you will never be able to put this game down.Dont get this game. IT will take time away from getting through your backloig. :p			"

												Don't stave is a very unique game. Not only because of the gameplay, but also because of the artwork.But seriously, i really can't compare this game with any other game i have ever played.It's a survival, sandbox, building, fighting and crafting game basically.You craft your own weapons, your own tools, you can build traps to catch other animals with, you can build your own base (not a house, but a base) and try to survive pretty much.The crafting menu in this game is very organized and readily comprehensible, which is a must, especially if you play other crafting games you sometimes forget how to craft what.You can also unlock and play as other characters who all have different perks, so that's another point for the replayabilty of this game.The seasons in this game also change from spring to summer to autumn to winter (if you survive that long.)There are also different ""stages."" On the map there are various locations of ""worm holes."" When you jump into them, they teleport you to another map.I haven't seen that much from this game yet, so i can't go into too much detail, but i like what i have seen so far.I would recommend this game, especially if you like survival and crafting games. It's very unique, both gameplay and artwork-wise and there is a lot to discover. Also because the maps are always randomly generated.			"

												Don't Starve is an addictive game that requires you to not only not starve but live through multiple challenges that constantly threaten your survival. It has wonderful artwork that creates a charming yet creepy atmosphere. It reminds me of Tim Burton's style. I love the size of the world and what you stumble across in your explorations. Artifacts (useful and not), skeletons with helpful equipment and my favorite, the Beefalo. It's great that you can tweak the game to your liking and have different characters to choose from. The characters are imaginative with their own strengths and weaknesses. I recommend this game. It's well worth it and has a lot of replay value.			"

												I'm not going to lie, I thought my love for games was dying. I struggle to put even 10 hours into most games, and I usually don't have a whole lot of fun while doing it.What I didn't realize, is that I was playing the wrong type of games. I don't need HD graphics and 3D gameplay. The majority of those games are bad anyways. Don't Starve has charm. It's everything I could want in a survival game. There's ALWAYS something to do. This may go down as my favorite game of all time.			"

												This is that sort of game that'll kick you in the groin and then give you a reasurring pat...ONLY TO KICK YOU IN THE GROIN AGAIN.I hate it....Probably one of my top ten games.Don't starve is a survival game with a mixture of 2D and 3D graphics creating a 3D world filled with 2D characters,items and what not. The game will send you into the wildreness without any tips and you'll learn on from there. Don't Starve is a game that offers a lot but does it slowly so there are those who would find the first one or two hours of playing in a new save (world) boring. The most GLORIOUS thing about it is,exactly,the sheer lack of knowledge. From the first five minutes,you'll learn the basic controls on your own,but you will encounter many new things that you will have no idea what they are and the only way to learn would be to interact with them....Experiment,pick 'em up,eat them,burn them,attack them...Of course,do know that you might end up dead and....Yeah,it's that game. It's that glorious perma-death game and it was delivered very nicely.Please,just,PLEASE don't go looking for 620 kink scope try hard guides on how to be PR0 at this game as it'll just remove all the fun fo learning on your own. It is much better if the player is forced to explore and learn on their own,even if it means going through trial and error. The worlds are always randomly generated which give the game a somewhat different flavour every time you play and let's not forget the different characters with different perks which will affect your play style too.Hunt,gather and make your own camp...Then spend the nights trembling in fear next to your campfire hoping those ''things'' don't gather the wits to come near the light of your fire....And then...When all of that is done and when you think that you've survived the worst,winter comes making everything much harder to get to and,once again,changing your tactics and food rationing.Definitely a game worth playing,thouh I can only imagine this having a small Multiplayer mode. Perhaps two to four players surviving together?  "

												Don't let the adorable Tim Burton-style graphics and cute beefalo fool you. This is a game that wants you to die.Repeatedly.Even if you make the game easier (you can disable some of the more game ending monsters from spawning!) on your poor, weather-beaten and starving soul, you are still going to die.But you'll like it. You'll do it again and again and you may just forget you were supposed to do adventure mode and actually accomplish something other than establishing your base camp.Since purchasing this game during the summer sale, I have been completely in love with Don't Starve. The object is simple; survive. It's just that the whole surviving part isn't that simple and you'll end up killing yourself if the wildlife doesn't do that on your behalf. I guess that's what makes it so addicting. I keep learning from my mistakes and I build better farms. I get myself better armor faster and I've figured out what I failed to do in winter that kept me from surviving the next summer.It's a survival game in which you'll collect items, learn recipes, and kiss your character ""good luck"" as you embark on a little adventure. Do some farming! Do some exploring! Do some fighting! ...and then run for your life!The music is lovely and fits the mood from each day dawning to a change of scenery (and boss battles with trees from satan). Worth noting with the music character has an instrument that serves as a speaking voice, embodying their personalities as you learn to get along with them as you well, don't starve! Each character is unique and provides pros and cons to their playing style. Personally, I'm a fan of Willow, Wendy, and Wilson. You'll notice that each character has a name starting with the letter W and there is a much larger connection to everyone than at first glance. It's rather neat and I'll admit, I spoiled myself after I reached day thirty and died in a ball of fire.Graphics are dark and cartoony. You'll think Tim Burton or one of your favorite ""edgy"" and darker cartoons of the 90s that we all had as some brain junk food. It's actually rather cute and can make even the most ugly and terrifying creatures in the game look very disarming until they try to rip your head off and suck out your fluids. For this type of game and the storyline eluded to, it works. It's delightfully creepy yet you're smiling along because it's a twisted little world you're traversing in. Nothing is at all what it seems, but you can't help admire what pretty little things are there.Until they murder you.This isn't a difficult game to learn. Use the mouse and the WSDA keys to move. I tend to use both and click with the mouse to harvest or order a character to act, leaving ample time to react to things such as demonic wolves wielding fire (yes they're in this game and I'm not sure why wolves need sometimes need fire when teeth and claws were perfectly fine, but the game is called Don't Starve, not Easy Super Happy Camp Time).You'll be tempted to sometimes play this game in long marathons. While there's no work-out you'll get from your mouse or keyboard, give your eyes a break. The only sudden flashes you'll find is from in-game lightning, but this can actually be disabled before you start a new world.While you might get a jump from things coming out of the woodworks to kill you and ruin your hard work or you may feel very frustrated when you accidentally set fire to your camp and ruin about a hundred days worth of work, I still find this game to have everything I was looking for after a long time of searching. No rampaging armies. Just me and the elements as my own doom.If you've got a short temper or you dislike doing repetitive things in order to build up a catche and THEN venture forth, this probably isn't something you're going to like. For me, however? I needed this game a long time ago and I'm very ashamed I didn't get it sooner. It's my new favorite game and you'll pry it out of my cold, dead, starving fingers. "

Posted: January 24, 2013
												Here is my personal review of Don't StarveGame play: Don't Starve offers an immense spectrum of how to approach surviving.  Players will be able to survive the way they want to survive and discovering what works and what doesn't is part of the fun of Don't Starve.  Use the Don't Starve wiki to a minimum and learn to play the game your way.  Don't Starve can be fun for children and adults.  There is very little room Don't Starve leaves for boredom, really the only downtime I have found is those nights I get caught away from my base, which often turn out to be the scariest.Sound/Music: Not much to say here.  The sound is not annoying or appealing in any significant way.  I often turn the music down or off, as it can drown out the hounds calling.  When tired of the music  I replace with any music that I enjoy listening to at low volume.  The music is fitting and well done, but pretty repetitive after so many hours.Controls: I have now played with both keyboard/mouse and controller, I will have to admit I prefer the controller now.  There are times where I wish I had the mouse again, so there are advantages and disadvantages to both.  In a way that is unique, I usually find myself of the opinion that one method is superior to the other.  The control system shouldn't disappoint a new player or even a veteran player and the control mechanics will not leave much to be desired.Graphics: Being a 2D and stylized game, the artwork must be impressionistic to vitalize the player's cognitive reception.  Don't Starve accomplishes itself graphically with a simple approach that does not get in the way of the game's strengths.  The only part of the graphics that seem odd to me is the ocean or shore lines, but again that doesn't actually affect the game in any negative way.  Value: Currently at $15 Don't Starve is a great value.  The game is fun, appropriate for family, and has good replay value.  Also purchasing now is a good investment for Don't Starve Together which is an update coming soon that adds multi-player.  They plan to increase the price of the game by $5 when that update is live.  Likes/Dislikes:The most distinguishable ingredients of Don't Starve is the survival balance.  The game is not too hard and not too easy, yet if you feel one way or another you can modify the game world how you see fit.  I enjoy the ability to create a base, but not have it so powerful that it breaks the difficulty.  I also love that the game is a wilderness survival game and doesn't offer a house or tower to stand atop to break the threat of enemies on the ground.Little upsets I have had is the worm-holes and how you cannot enter a worm hole while being attacked; I've died like this multiple times now and still have not learned that lesson.  The need to rotate the camera is often aggravating and disorienting, but there are some remedies to that.  Conclusion:A very pronounced title that offers intimidating experiences in wilderness survival.  Don't Starve holds a key to my desire that many survival games do not.  I hope to see more of Don't Starve in the future, especially with Don't Starve Together.			"

												I adore this game. It's a quirky survivalist game, but don't let the adorable artwork confuse you---this is not an easy game. The UI is minimal and the controls are simple, and in the beginning the learning curve isn't too steep. Find food; collect items to make a fire. Stay in the light. Not so hard, right?Until you start exploring, and you find unknown foods, unknown creatures, and unknown items. Will you eat that mushroom? Those berries? Will you touch that giantic bird thing that you've never seen before and it looks like it might be frien----NO, OH NO, DO NOT TOUCH THAT BIRD RUUUUNNNNNNNNNNN....Ahem. This is a clever and wickedly addicting survival game that will keep you on your toes. Even better, it's now multiplayer--though don't think that makes it a whole lot easier... The main game has permanent death, which I actually quite enjoy. There's something so exciting about surviving longer than any other time you've played. If you really wish you can turn that option off, however. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to find out what happens when I use a sleeping dart on that giant tree thing over there.			"

												Do you like Starving? Going insane? Being bludgeoned to death by Pigmen, Tree's that walk, or Birds with long legs?Well this is the game for you!But honestly, After you get past the dying every couple days and learning how to craft, build, and survive through the night, it's a great, well put together game, still Hard as all hell though "

												Pros:        - Hunger, health, and sanity are all factors you need too worry about, keeping you on your toes       - If you die once, it's all over; Giving you bragging rights once you ""beat"" the game       - Once you have learned the ropes and have lasted till day 100+, you can do Adventure mode, Go underground, or          buy the DLC       - There are different seasons that each have there own sruggles and hardships       - In case this is too easy, hounds come every 7 days (aproximatly), getting harder each time. Cons:        - None that i can think of :)10/10 one of my favorite games!			"

												A deliciously brutal game of discovery.  The main game is highly customizeable for those who want to take a pleasant camping trip, but the game offers a real sense of accomplishment for those looking for a challenge.  Every death is a lesson learned, and you'll find yourself saying ""I'll just play for a couple more minutes so that I can build this or hunt that.""  There are plenty of characters to be earned as well, which helps keep the experience interesting.  This is definitely a game where you must set your own goals and plan ahead; if you are the type of player who wants quests and clearly defined objectives, this is not the game for you.			"

												Already died over 30 times. Wilson never even lived to see another day on the first game.The following characters lived for less than 10 days. As I learned more about the game, I got really hooked up with gathering items so that I can get my character to craft and eventually fighting monsters for the loot. I enjoyed looking for food sources and then cooking crockpot recipes. Figuring out how I should build my base also got me really interested more with other events that may happen in the game. Eventually I got Wilson surviving through the winter and was able to make him live for more than 100 days. Most of my playtime were done in survival mode, now I think I am ready for adventure mode.

												Dont starve is one of those games that every time you play you get a little better at it and in doing so you feel an overall feeling of acheivement not seen in many games (dare i say it,it reminded me of the feeling i had playing dark souls).Very much like the classic games from FROM SOFTWARE this game throws you in at the deep end and you either sink or swim,having said that every time you die when you play next time you know a little bit more to get that little bit further and survive for that little bit longer.I have many a time played this game and yet i seem to keep being surprised by the amount of new things i keep bumping into (especially during a full moon OH THAT WAS CREEPY).I love the games that the developers made before this one (the shank games are fantastic-still remind me of the film machete though) but i think that this game is their crowning glory and will be hard for them to top.The graphics suit this game and just add to the overall experience you have whilst playing.Again this is another game that again shows up the big developers and shows that smaller developers have more more orriginality than they do (money does'nt allways mean that your game is the best and shiny graphice dont allways make good gameplay please take note all you power hungry developers).In closing i love this game and if you want a challenge you should look no further than DONT STARVE.

												A richly animated and darkly humorous wilderness survival game for those who enjoy a bit of madness mixed in with their gameplay. Don't Starve includes a generous array of unlockable characters, each with their own strengths, idiosyncrasies, and caveats. This game is unforgiving, but the challenge proves highly entertaining and provides this game substantial replayability. This game will delight those who enjoy crafting, researching, and hunting, as all three prove to be imperative to survival in this delightfully quirky and dangerously addictive game. I highly recommend this game to all those who might enjoy a survival game with a darkly whimsical twist.			"

												While Minecraft promoted creativity and imagination, Don't Starve pushes itself more towards survival and reservation. The game knows how to keep the player interested enough to explore, but fearful enough with its Tim Burton eeriness to want to keep self-preservation on the top of the list. The only major flaw here is the common suvival sandbox flaw of rarity and practicality ratio. This is the type of world where the man with the pile of logs is a peasant to the man who has 10 units of poop. Manure makes you God in this game.			"

This game is really entertaining and not to mention the art work is outstanding. I love spooky, messy, hand-drawn looking art. It adds character to the game.The only thing I would change about the game is maybe supply a little more knowledge or tips within the game as the person plays. I found it hard to play at first until I watched a few guides on youtube. Maybe having a small trailer or clip before the first initial play might help this.Other than that, this has easily become one of my favorite games and I will/have referred it to many people.			"

												Don't Starve Review ThoughtsDon’t Starve is a game in constant motion, updates and gameplay overhauls are as common as pengulls in the midst of a freezing winter. Because of this Don’t Starve is a game that is impossible to review, but with the recently released Reign of Giants DLC, Don’t Starve has once again stolen significant parts of my free time. With tree guardians, giant geese and devastating half-bear-half-badger base destroying beasts taking place in my everyday thoughts, I figured now is a better time than ever to express my thoughts on this truly unique hardcore survival game.Don’t Starve starts with the player waking up into an unknown world, you are equipped with nothing but the clothes on your back, your goal at first seems to simply be: find something to eat. Though as time progresses, starvation becomes the least of your worries, as you discover the world you find yourself in is filled with mystery and threat beyond your comprehension. Don’t Starve is a game of brutal challenge, the one life you are given keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat, death can come at the most unexpected times and each one becomes more painful than the last. This challenge is not an unwelcome one, the repetition can become mundane, and it may discourage some, but the nature of the one life system is necessary to make the game what it is. Don’t Starve would be a very different experience if things were not the way they are.Don’t Starve is as much about survival as it is about exploration, as I mentioned before, the world is filled with many mysteries and things to discover, the world is quite enriching, and the lore is fascinating, nothing about the game is generic or uninteresting. Every character, enemy and locale is unique and like no other. Whether it’s the bunnymen or koalefant, mechanical chess piece, or boy trapped inside a spider. Don’t Starve is a spark of creative genius. Don’t Starve is a game that has really caught my interest, this is not a review, (Though it seems this has turned out in a way that heavily suggests that it is indeed a review.) so I am not going to tell you that you should buy the game of question. (Though technically this is supposed to be a recommendation, at least according to Steam’s standards.) However, after reading this post, (See how I am careful not to use the term ‘review’.) it should be glaringly obvious that I am enjoying my time with Don’t Starve. However, I am not going to recommend this to you as I decided early on that this is not a review. Actually, I changed my mind, I have rambled long enough on this last paragraph and I don’t care anymore. You should buy Don’t Starve. Done. "

												Imagine. You are a mad scientist, plucked from your lab and dropped in the wilderness with naught but the clothes on your back. And it's not just any normal wilderness, oh no! It's one filled with strange and dangerous creatures! Its up to you to survive, using all the natural resources available to you, as well as your own ingenuity! Just, don't forget to eat. And dont forget to pack a torch either.Don't Starve is an exercize in survival. You need to keep yourself fed to avoid starvation, you need to fight off monsters as you explore your surroundings, and whatever happens, you need to make sure you have a source of light at night. Failure at any of the aforementioned three means you die, and have to start over in an entirely new world! Don't Starve is surprisingly complex and can eat away hours of your time as you try to figure out new items to build, new food recipes to try out (that may or may not be poisonous) and new ways to help you stay alive in a hostile world! If you're an avid lover of indie games with a flair for the strange and the creepy, Don't Starve is at the top of my list for you to buy!			"

												Don't Starve is an addictingly entertaining game, worth every penny. It is a survival sandbox game, where the ultimate goal is to... don't starve... and explore the vast wilderness and survive for as long as possible. The game is based on a rogue-like concept, which means that every time you play a game, everything is randomized. In addition, the game offers no tutorials or guides on how to play, which only enhances the aspect of exploration. This is definitely the best element this game has to offer, as there are numerous things to discover, even after 90+ hours of gameplay. As with most rogue-likes, the game can be quite difficult, and death often lurks behind every corner. The game also features permanent death, which means that once you die, you will have to start all over again, although there are ways to cheat death a couple of times. There are a number of different characters to unlock through varius means. They have emphasis on different aspects of gameplay, which can either make the game easier or harder for you. In addition, they have all a unique ability that differentiates themselves from the other characters. The visual aspect of the game is pleasing, and the audio is very enjoyable. It perfectly supplements the cartoonish atmosphere of the game.Additionally, the community is great. There is a plethora of mods and guides available. The modding community is vast and the mods can either make life easier or more difficult for you, depending on your preferences, and veteran Don't Starve players can utilize mods to keep the game alive for a long time. For new players, there are tons of guides to be found, many of which I have used myself. They are a valuable resource when you are in need of tips and tricks. All in all, a great indie survival game, which I would recommendable: 10/10			"

The developers are also planning workshop support.EDIT 4/12/14: The new DLC came out, and it added an absolute boatload of new stuff and features, and adds so much to the game, even though it's still in early access.

												There are obvious comparisons to be made to other crafting games and evryone loves the Tim Burton-esque art style (as do I). However what I really like about this game is the fanastic use of tension. The music, the lighting, the apparitions that come with insanity. It feels like you are moments from death at any time and it's wonderfully immersive in this sense.There is also a lot to learn, I recommend keeping the wiki open in the background at all times, it saved my life more than I care to mention.

												3rd death on ""Don't Starve"" but I feel I have learnt valuable lessons.1. Darkness kills you. I don't even know WHAT killed me, so I will say it was a mutated Jigglypuff.2. Do not attack bees with an axe, they dominate you. THEY ARE STINGY DOOM PIES THAT FLY. 3. Even if you have a spear, it will not kill the massive one eyed bird of doom and deathly deathness. It will also destroy your very being and you'll also die harder than the doomy bee death.So yes, buy the game, it is stupidly fun, even when you die. Beautifully created and your character is lovely and sarcastic at times. One day, I will survive long enough to build my own house and survive through the doom. Until then, I will just randomly charge at the unknown and probably die ^.^			"

												Very charming art style. But don't let that fool you. You are given no instructions at all, monsters are ruthless (you have no ""cooldown"" moment when hit, you can be killed in seconds), and nighttime is dangerous (like, REALLY dangerous). Just survive and thrive. And don't starve, but that's like the least of your problems later on.			"

												I've loved this game, but at the same time I haven't been able to stay interested in this game over time. It's probably just my own preference, but I love achievements in games, and I don't stay interested if there aren't any to get. However, this game is cute and fun, easy to understand and a great game to pass the time. I like the ability to customize the game you play, and the mods are fun. I would definitely recommend this game to others, especially because my only complaint is the lack of any achievements.			"

												I really love this game it's so addicting. When i got the game i didn't know anything and died so fast haha, but then i started learning stuff and it's really fun and challenging, especially the Adventure mode. Wow.. so hard. Just the art in the game is simply amazing. I really like how everything is drawn and just the characters. They are so well made. I really like surviving games and in this game it's sooo good cause everything is trying to kill you. I would totaly recommend this game to people who like surviving games, challenging games or just really cute spiders. lol.			"

												I got this game on the Chrome Store when it was first out, got it for only a few bucks too. I wish I had more time to play the game cause it is well worth the money and time. If you enjoy a dark cartoony adventure, survival, simulation games. This one takes the cake. Just writing this makes me want to close it out and start playing again, I know they have updated it a whole lot since the last time I got to play so I am excited to get down with it.			"

												Just now getting around to this, okay Don't Starve is a dark, humorous and challenging game. I can only last a few days before dying by some random monster I've never seen before but it just makes me more determined to last longer than I did before. Things that are neat about the game: Each character is different, the visuals are creeply delicious, the sounds are adorable, the turkeys especially, various monsters, crafting, etc.And you can edit each world to your liking, like how many carrots you want or trees, stuff like that.Also there are some really neat mods.I'd recommend it for any survival game fan who is looking for something different and challenging.

												Engrossing, challenging and accessable. I've spent many hours trying to survive. I even found a gateway to Maxwell, but then I died. I've died hundreds of times. I've survived to 22 days on more than one occasion. I've gone insane from lack of sleep too many times to count -- I finally learned how to make a bedroll and survive longer than a few days. I've fought tree guardians and eyes that grow from the ground. I managed to kill a turkey once and I have killed *tall* birds to get meat and their eggs. I've mind gold and made machines. But in the end, I've always died. Don't starve is well named. It's all about survival in a *very* hostile world. Who would every have thought that dying would be fun?			"

												If Tim Burton were to make a survival game, this would be the product of his labor. With a quirky art design and PC friendly controls, this game feels very polished (even though its in beta at the time of this recommendation). With that said its nice to see updates often to keep the game fresh. Those of you that like rougelike games will welcome the brutality this game offers. It even starts you with no direction on what to do. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys Rougelikes and Tim Burton.			"

This game is really entertaining and not to mention the art work is outstanding. I love spooky, messy, hand-drawn looking art. It adds character to the game.The only thing I would change about the game is maybe supply a little more knowledge or tips within the game as the person plays. I found it hard to play at first until I watched a few guides on youtube. Maybe having a small trailer or clip before the first initial play might help this.Other than that, this has easily become one of my favorite games and I will/have referred it to many people.			"

												A very good, interesting and challenging  game. If games upset you easily, this will be a nightmare for you. It's easy to die, and if you die, you are dead. You can find or craft respawning objects, but it's hard and they can be used only once. This sounds bad, but this way It's another feeing to play. You shouldn't try to just try things sayig I will just respawn and continue. And this is the thing what makes the game very good. I totally fecommend this game for everyone who likes surviving and think graphics is not everything.			"

												Don't Starve is a very fun, yet challenging game.  If you have a enjoy survival games, this is one of the best I've played.  The characters you can play all come with their own characteristics that can help or hurt your gameplay.  The somewhat macabre artwork and attitude in the game will amuse the darker sides in all of us.  The only problem I have with the game is the lack of back-story.  All around a fun game that you can get on the cheap. 8/10			"

												Was running through the darkness in winter with my torch about to go out and no way of building another or making a pit. So I set the forest on fire for warmth and light. Overheated and died. 10/10But really, this is a game you cannot win. You can only survive until your inevitable death finally catches you. And it'll probably be something ridiculous compared to all the things you survived. Frogs want to kill you. Hounds want to kill you. Penguins want to kill you. You might go insane or starve or die alone in the dark. Even the things that generally don't want to kill you may decide to kill you.			"

												Out of all the survival games this one os hand draw and the solo consept of the game is very challenging. It brings all the consepts of survival to the hardcore extreme if you die its all over and you can unlock a DLC called The region of the giants which adds Giants and 4 new bioms to the game but the real game is awsome and my highest day is 157 and im still going thanks for getting the game after reading this XD "

												Last year there was a try-out weekend. I saw this game in my library and I thought: ""Why not give it a shot?"".So I installed it, and 10 minutes later, whoop, I am thrown into the world of Don't Starve.5 Minutes later I died.And 7 minutes later I died once again.Eventually I purchased the game when it was on a discount later on and I have to say it was well worth it, I got it in a package with RoG.Also one time I had an Alchemy Engine and I was super excited. My food kept spoiling, but I had finally aquired some gears and was like ""YES, FINALLY GETTING THAT ICE BOX."" Sooo I was excited and all, and I was like ""ok tomorrow I'll gather the last supplies"". That night a thunderstorm came, and lightning struck my Alchemy Engine. I starved a few days later.Over all an amazing game if you dig deeper into it. Might seem simple from the outside, but it has A LOT to it. Also, I wouldn't recommend buying this if you hate dying a lot. Because you will.9.5/10			"

												Fun survival game, emposes a challenge with simplicity, some times to the point of frustration. Even so, it's addicting to me, and keeps me coming back. Progressive dangers as you survive longer, but not much of a story line, even the story mode doesn't really enlighten you on much of the games world. You can make it more or less challenging, based on how you decide to play. Over all, a fun game, and very good buy, even when not on sale.			"

Don't be discouraged by it's difficulty, you will learn and eventually prosper and then probably die and learn and prosper and die all over again.EDIT: With the early acess release of the Shipwrecked DLC, I can say that this game has something for anyone who loves a good survival game.

												As a fan of these type of games (in which you have to work and work to get what you want - ex. Harvest Moon, games like that) , I recommend this game to those with a lot of patience and time, who won't just quit in frustration after the first few plays. If the gameplay doesn't drag you in, then the plot-line will if you follow it. The Tim Burton style gives it a nice, creepy touch that I applaud it for. The mechanics are well-implemented, and the time-management factor is a great touch to it, since you may have to plan out what you're going to do and how long you have to get to a certain area, what's more important to focus on for a day (dedicating a day to rabbit-hunting, chopping wood, tending to a base) and so on and so forth; some survival games don't put this in very well, but this one certainly does. Sometimes it does get a little frustrating, but once you get the hang of it, it gets very fun and addicting; you never know what's ahead until you explore. 10/10, definitely would recommend.			"

												Imagine. You are a mad scientist, plucked from your lab and dropped in the wilderness with naught but the clothes on your back. And it's not just any normal wilderness, oh no! It's one filled with strange and dangerous creatures! Its up to you to survive, using all the natural resources available to you, as well as your own ingenuity! Just, don't forget to eat. And dont forget to pack a torch either.Don't Starve is an exercize in survival. You need to keep yourself fed to avoid starvation, you need to fight off monsters as you explore your surroundings, and whatever happens, you need to make sure you have a source of light at night. Failure at any of the aforementioned three means you die, and have to start over in an entirely new world! Don't Starve is surprisingly complex and can eat away hours of your time as you try to figure out new items to build, new food recipes to try out (that may or may not be poisonous) and new ways to help you stay alive in a hostile world! If you're an avid lover of indie games with a flair for the strange and the creepy, Don't Starve is at the top of my list for you to buy!			"

												You are put into the game with no tutorial.  Nothing.  Consequently, you will learn things by surviving or dying or getting sick or losing your mind (in game, in game).  The point of this game besides survival? No clue!  But that is half the fun, the simple not knowing.  You will ruin this game by googling info.  Don't Do It.  Trust me.This is not a game where you will sit down for hours at a time.  You can only play in sessions or you will lose it (mind, patience, laptops).  The game is artfully done in a very Edward Gory fun way.  I refuse to explain anymore, for fear of ruining another's experience.			"

												Hello and welcome to the unforgiving world of Don't Starve!This game is my pick for a true survial game, even the slightes mistake can have a huge impact for your future or even can cause your demise.You will be always on the run to improve and prepare yourself for the next commingSeason or threat. Nights are real nights, you NEED some lights to see.. or else..In this world it's Eat or to be eaten :Hunt down your prey or foes to either get value materials or stock up your foodsupply. Because remember to ""Don't Starve"".. because food is precious and you really need to stock up on it.. or else a bad season can cause your demise.Take care of your surroundings and base setup :Where you settle down and how you place your precious Buildings, chests and allis important. Lets just say you settled somewhere close to a forest. What will beso bad about it, right? Well.. you may have alot of wood, berry and branch supply..But what if a thunderstorm comes to say hello?There's alot more to say about this game.. but I want you to explore and experienceit by yourself.

												[TL;DR, Never owned the game, but I've played it before. Here's my view on it.]For the few minutes that I played this game when I had it free, it was a plesant expirence.I spawned in a world, in the middle of a desert. There were a few rocks, some bits of tall grass.As I explored some more, I found a forest with some trees and berry bushes.As I was gathering resources though, it became night. I set up a campfire and roasted some berries, keeping myself alive through the darkness.When it became morning, I found a touchstone to set a temporary respawn, and set up shop nearby.Soon I had grinded enough things to create some tools, and was able to quickly mine some rocks to aid my progress to a science machine. After I got it built, I had already created some armor, a few chests, a campfire, some farms and rabbit traps.Then I discovered my new found nemesis: The Hounds. Terrifying pig-dog creatures that attack you around every ten nights, about full moon time as well. I was able to kill the two that attacked, but was wounded horribly.I cooked up some meatballs in the crockpot I had made not too long ago and was able to restore most of my health.My journey ended in the harsh winter, when my crops wouldn't grow, and rabbit were scarce. The Hounds came for me in my weakest state, and I died not once, but twice, after respawning from the touchstone.Sure, I never owned the game from buying it, but I do highly recommend it for the people who like adventure, challange and exploration.

												This game took me through a loop originaly. I had no idea what to think, being greeted by a man who came from the floor whos advice was simpley ""you should get something to eat before night come's"" then hes gone. That first game I survived 1 day. This game can throw you to the wolfs quite literaly whenever it fells like. you can have every piece of food in the game and the 40 day winter will make you scrounging for grubs in beefalo dung piles. This game is an example of Nature's wrath being the orcistrater of your demise. I recomend this game for anyone who likes a challenge, with all the different characters providing a unique play style that is one size fits all. plus the main goal of the game is to make something called a teleportatoe who wouldnt want one of those?

												Just now getting around to this, okay Don't Starve is a dark, humorous and challenging game. I can only last a few days before dying by some random monster I've never seen before but it just makes me more determined to last longer than I did before. Things that are neat about the game: Each character is different, the visuals are creeply delicious, the sounds are adorable, the turkeys especially, various monsters, crafting, etc.And you can edit each world to your liking, like how many carrots you want or trees, stuff like that.Also there are some really neat mods.I'd recommend it for any survival game fan who is looking for something different and challenging.

None existing story in my opinion, you just want to stay alive. Simple as that. If night comes, better be prepared or in the dark Illidan will one shot you, unless you're level 90, and you're not and if you're nekid it wont help, because it will freeze off, I mean you.

												Very cool little survival and crafting game.  Casual in it's gameplay but also challenging and rewarding at the same time.  The graphics are in the stylized in a creepy comic book sort of fashion that serves the theme of the game very well.  The sound design and music are excellent and only enhance the experience rather than distract from it.  Most importantly though, the game is simple to get into and features some very intuitive and streamlined controls.  Whether you're using a mouse and keyboard or a gamepad, players will be able to jump into the game and explore the Don't Starve with relative ease.  The challenge is finding the ingredients and materials necessary to survive while discovering the usefulness of each item and tool that becomes available, all while avoiding the dangerous creatures that come out at night and the lingering darkness they bring with it.    ---  The Good  ---  - Nice graphical style- Great sound design and music- Intuitive gameplay and user friendly control scheme- Made for gamers of all skill levels and backgrounds (casual and diehard gamers alike)- Both Mouse & Keyboard and even Gamepad support!  ---  The Bad  ---  - Nothing really, this game is very good all around!- The only thing that might throw off newcomers is the fact that they  will need to discover what they'll need to do within the game all on their own without very much help.  The game is relatively easy to figure out though and shouldn't cause frustration for even the most casual of gamers and newcomers to gaming.			"

												One of the hardest game i have ever played, yet one of the best. However, anybody can change game difficulty: add more food or less monsters, and for others who high-seek challenges can be far more harder by adding plenty spiders, pigs, monsterous bosses. That makes just epic game: checkboard robots fight with buffallos when spiders try to kill both of them. More of it, having all kind of supplies trying to kill boss for about 20mins with magic, medieval spikes or even with fellowship pig squad. Characters is well optimised for all kinds of players. Wigfred is just amazing at fights, Maxwell having his own astonishing duplicates of himself, what makes him evil master. Have to mention Woody with his terrible secret, that is just ridiculous!Map has several district areas, what eventually makes you go deepeer in the woods, or even in dungeons against rock skin crabs, mystical and huge bunnies, insane monkeys, or even dragons. Yes, that's right - tremendous DRAGONS!Also, one of the most amazing thing in this game is seasons: i thought winter is hard to stay warm, but when update released summer, it was far more harder to understand how to survive. Although, some of survivers say that this game needs some tutorial, but i think it's better to understand by yourself how to survive, that's what make this game awesome. 9.5/10			"

												I liked this this game because it was unique in art style. I liked how the survival mechanics worked, like warming yourself up, keeping your sanity up, and food. I also really liked weather and seasons. I don't see that very often in survival games. I liked seasons in Don't Starve because surviving in each season was different and had to be played differently. There's also magical weapons and a cool crafting system.  I only have 2 negative things to say about this game.  There's not really a tutorial. So things are pretty confusing at first. Needless to say, your first games you probably wont live a week The game get's slower paced and repetetive after you start getting good items. Fortunatly, Reign of Giant remedies it to an extent. "

												Don't starve is one of those Indy Games that you like, play fore a while, get addicted to, play a little longer and the put it away for a year or so to start the process again later on.The way this game plays, feels and is being experienced just works for me. the art feels both safe (mainly because it is cartoony) and yet dark too. And for a game in which the dark will kill you and you'll have to create light to stay alive that is great! At night you'll be terrified while feeding your campfire with the last pieces of wood, and during the day you'll be ready for an adventure to gather supplies, food and weaponrry for the next night (and day).I must admit, after playing it for too long it will get boring. mainly because it's still an indy game which just isn't build for great scale and an unlimited supply of options (Except for the all-known Mojang Project, if you get my drift). But, after a while, you can pick it up again an loose yourself again for a couple of weeks (maybe months).For the price I would say it is definately worth it!

												Don't Starve is an amazing game, not only because of its gameplay but also because of its feeling of discovery mixed with the will to survive a world that definitely doesn't want you alive. I'm serious, almost everything will have you killed. :) You start the game with Wilson, a young scientist who was tricked to enter the world of Don't Starve by a voice inside a machine, but soon you'll realize that he isn't the only playable character, some others are unlockable trough experience points which are gained once you die or once you beat the game. (Believe me you'll unlock almost all of them by dying, A LOT.).All those characters are connected by a story, a story of magic and shadows. Each character has its own perks and downfalls which brings a lot of variety to the game itself!In my humble opinion Klei did and is still doing an amazing job with this game. After all this years we are still getting updates like Reign of Giants or the new stand alone Don't Starve Together which is a fantastic experience for both veteran and new players. Added to all of this Don't Starve has a unique (and beautiful) art work sided with a fitting soundtrack. Reader, if you like survival games and you still didn't get this gem the only thing I can truly say to you is that you're missing a lot. Thank you for your time reading this!!(10/10)			"

It is even modded by the wonderful steam workshop.There is no tutorial and it can be rather tedious sometimes, performing the same task over and over again.I love the challange. With no tutorial, your dropped into an unknown world and told not to die. It really feels like an adventure game.8 out of 10 stars.-Kamlyn			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The whole concept of 'Dont Starve' is so simple, yet so easy to make HUGE. There are so many ideas you could get while developing a game like this, and the developers seem to have created and adapted their own ideas along with the wide open world and the lingering feeling of despair to create a downright great game.The monsters, resources and yourself are all put together into a bowl and mixed about, combining the three and making endless posibillities for what can come out of a game. The characters you play themselves have unique personas which makes them their own person. Not only does this game have fear, death and the constant feeling of dread, but it also creates a bond between you and your character, with laughs and creativity throughout.  "

Overall i really enjoy playing Dont Starve ive had many run throughs with the abundance of characters you can choose from.

												Don't Starve is a very difficult survival game if you're not used to the required skill it takes. It is kind of like Minecraft but goes more for a survival aspect than a building aspect. It is at least worth checking out if you have the time.			"

												This game is amazing for many reasons, but one of the best things is your sanity, you have to watch it or else imaginary things attack you. It adds a layer of depth to an already deep game. It makes you really watch out, I also love the diversety of charaters and all the diffrent powers they have, also the mods for the game adds even more to an already deep game. I recommend this to everyone!			"

												Don't Starve is was the first game I ever got into pre-release, and now I'm still playing it. I'm hoping to get the DLC, Reign of Giants, soon, and I know I'm going to play and love the heck out of it, as well as Don't Starve Together. It can be played and replayed over and over, which cannot be said about a lot of other survival-based games. It was a wonderful soundtrack, and encorperated ideas into its gameplay that I don't think any other game could get away with.The only little thing that I think could be improved upon, (and I've heard this has already been worked on in RoG) is the storyline. The game has a sort of half-developed storyline to explain the general premise of the game, but it doesn't continue after the brief intro or before Adventure mode, which is the majority of the game. I think a few small cut-scenes, or some dialogue, or even just some hints could fix this no-problem.Don't Starve is great, because for once there is a realistic, or in some instances not so very realistic, survival game, that tests the boundaries of what makes good gameplay, and is just spot-on. It isn't the same repetitive old collecting resource and killing monster crud that you get over and over with every low-graphical survival game that becomes popular, but rather it takes that and makes it, throws half of it away, and replaces that with a beautiful, and dark, atmostphere. I think this game is a must-get for any survival, fantasy, or general PC gamer.			"

												Don't Starve is...It's really amazing, to be simple about it. It's one of those games that can make you as angry as you've ever been without driving you away. I'll go ahead and get to the point.Don't Starve in and of itself is a great concept, simple at face but so very intricate and complex in the inner mechanisms. You'll find yourself dying multiple times due to your sheer overconfidence, feeling like you've judged the situation properly but dying due to your own malfunctions. There's so much to do, so many different ways to survive, and a huge open world that's generated differently each time in front of you. You can change and edit the world you wish to explore to your own standards, which is amazing. The crafting mechanic is really well made and I love that you have to build higher tiers to get better things. The sanity is so easily overlooked until the moment when everything starts going grey and the monsters from your mind start trying to murder you. There's so much in this game, and it's all really, really wonderful. 10/10 "

 Don't Starve  A game developed by Klei Entertainment that brings you a Survival game like no other; with a very unique art style that (I quote) , ""Resembles Tim Burton's conceptual art"", and 3D props in a 2D terrain, Which many gamers (Including myself) have found pleasant to the eyes, either they're fans or not of this odd, eerie, but still cool style. The game has this aspect that I believe is essential in every survival game, and it is that it puts you right into the world; with no tutorials, no resources, no help, whatsoever (Only if you dont read any internet guides). The game wants you dead, and the fact of being clueless about the wilderness surrounding you serves as a motivation to keep exploring, crafting, and knowing more details to increase your survivability. In the end, that's where the fun is at.I would tell you more about these details within the game mechanics, but that would just ruin a great part of your gameplay, which is, DISCOVERING and DYING... a lot. The audio -though being original, fitting, and makes experience to be more immersive- through the game you find it repeating itself in several occations. This could be improved if more diverse audio files were added to the already existing one. Maybe in the future this might be changed.The community is oftenly putting their creativity on display at the Don't Starve community workshop, which helps your game expand through mods and more cool stuff that other users have to offer.Another thing worth mentioning is that Klei will be releasing Don't Starve Together, allowing you to join efforts with your friends to not die that much; It doubles the fun you know.Overall, Dont Starve is a great game, with an interesting backstory for the character(s) and the game in general, amazing graphic style, well-thought mechanics, and personally, I find some elements of the game as pretty hilarious.I highly recommend it for gamers interested in the genre or even those looking to play something different but that'll bring hours of entertainment. I give it  9/10. Have fun... and remember, DON'T STARVE.			"

												Don't Starve is a Survival Simulation game that makes you a character named Wilson (or other characters you can unlock) who is trapped on a place by this person named Maxwell. Your job is to find a way out of there but also keep yourself in one piece along the way. You'll have to deal with starvation, hostiles, sanity, and maybe some temperature. It also has Steam Workshop support, so you can install mods to give you new characters or maybe even cheat to experiment with different things. I like this game, with a 250 IQ points from me.			"

It's not even complete yet! And following my other recommendations: ♥♥♥♥ you, Maxwell!			"

												The game is really good for people that like survival and exploration games but nevertheless Don't Starve brings something new to the table, seems like every creature makes sense in the world and having many stuff to craft helps you create your own style of playing.Each one of the characters have their own story and perks that are really good to explore and are really well designed, the art work is fantastic.Although the game can be a bit unforgiving and frustating at times when you get experienced, Don't Starve will entertain you for quite sometime, also allowing multiplayer with Don't Starve Together and develop or use any mods available.Have fun guys.

												Don't Starve is a fun little sandbox-type survival game that's been all the rage lately. However, Don't Starve takes the survival aspect a lot more seriously, with actual different mechanics than just being another Minecraft or DayZ. Don't Starve has a variety of encounters, that makes it so each time you die and start a new world the expierence is completely different. Randomly generated worlds really do wonders for Don't Starve as it helps craft a different experience each time you start a new file after you evidently die. Don't Starve is survival done right, and with Don't Starve Together coming, now you can not Starve Together with friendsGreat Survival game 7/10 ""Pretty Good"" It's a great pickup for anybody into survival games  "

												i find this game to be one of my favourite steam games because of the dark yet beautiful tone to the game with a bunch of cool characters (Add-on or not) with awsome perks like when wolfgang's belly is full, he becomes a one man army, or the just awsome perk for wilson because when he has a beard, it helps you stay warm in the cold weather. I just love the sheer amount of add-ons for the game created by fans all over the world, like a bunch of tweaks to the game or cool characters from other games :). i only played the game when it was free for a week, when i started i didnt know much, but i did know that you dont want to starve. after that i told my friend about the free week gameplay and i got him adicted to the game XD. now im getting the game (possibly the DLC if i have the money) and i cant wait to get back there and continue what i started and maybe not starve like i have did a handfull of times and for one acually save maxwell, or do something along the lines of that like finally stop staying at my camp for like 10 days and for once explore the world and get those buckets of loot the game says when it loads the world :), or maybe just try and live as long as i can (my record of days survived is 28) (died because of wolves). now im going to talk about the DLC reign of giants (sorry if i spelled it wrong). now i like how theres more nature, enemies, and just a more fun expirience of the game like the wettness mechanic where it adds a mechanic on when it rains you start to get wet, and when it fills up you start to freeze to death. i love how the game adds new boss enemies like the giant cyclops deer thing that comes in the snow, or the dragonfly in the summer. now i cant wait to get the game again and play it possibly with the DLC and see what the game has to offer me again :) (hopefully some cool stuff like chester and maybe, just maybe a few touch stones)  "

												Charmingly addictive // Recommended for survival gamers who don't want their hands held+ The longer one lives, the more XP is accumulated; characters are unlocked via XP, so unlocks can be obtained by those struggling to acclimate to the game, albeit not as quickly+ Boasts myriad environments and biomes, all of them offering a unique pallet of items and consumables+ Camera rotation is a godsend, and makes camp construction much less frustrating+ Permadeath offers a rousing incentive to succeed, particularly due to nighttime being so fatal+ Absolutely fantastic art style and animations+ Has an intricate, yet fairly intuitive, crafting system; this is greatly complemented by the mechanics of magic and scientific advancement+ Controls are practical and responsive; works very well with mouse and keyboard+ In addition to the hunger and health meters, the player must also consider the needs of the 'sanity' meter, adding further to the logistical challenge; sanity requirements can be satiated differently between the unlockable characters+ Worlds are all procedurally generated, making each experience into something refreshing and unique+ Sound design is nothing less than superb- Game can often lend itself to tedious frustrations, in large part due to the unforgiving environment and the fragile nature of the player's character- Crippling lack of a tutorial or beginner's handicaps; this will not appear as a negative to most enthusiasts of the genre, but less experienced survival gamers may find it off-putting			"

												I'm really enjoying this game and definitely reccomend it for those who like the survival genre. There are mods to make it hardcore for a lot of you out there, but I do wish there were just more mods in general.			"

												I personaly enjoy this game. It takes a little while to get in to this game and it takes a long time to learn all the little tricks and tactics. Game is very straight forward, you search for materials and food. You set up a camp and you try not to starve. I really like the DLC Shipwrecked. I would recommend to buy the Shipwrecked DLC after you have learned little bit about the game. The Shipwrecked DLC has cool new features and offers new type of gameplay and tactics.			"

												This game only wastes 8 minutes per day in the game. I recommend you keep your tools and equipment in the left section because you don't want to eat food before you cook it. There is no tutorial but is not needed because it is easy to learn and  very fun. 10/10			"

												Full of danger lurking around literally every turn, Don't Starve is a fantastic game. Thrown into a very unforgiving world with nothing but the clothes on your back, you must work quickly to build tools, find food, and make a shelter in the often vain attempt to survive. This game is pretty difficult, and only gets harder as the game goes on; the longer you survive, the more dangerous the world becomes and harder it is to continue.I cannot recommend this game enough to people who enjoy difficult and survival games. From plants and animals that want you dead to the very shadows and darkness of night out to get you, this game will have you huddled around just about any light source you can find in minutes. I give this game a very easy 9.5/10. In short: YOU WILL DIE.			"

												Well, where to start?... I bought this game back when it was released as an early access title on Steam. From there it has improved and developed in so many ways that it's hard to describe...Don't Starve is a cute & sometimes a little creepy survival and crafting game. Upon starting it you're dropped in a strange and hand-painted world full of mysteries, monster and ressources. From this point you'll have to build up a base and explore the world to improve your equipment and survive against the wilderness... By discovering some in-game secrets or by plain out surviving long enough you'll unlock many different characters with certain strenghts and weaknesses... The greatest thing about this game is, that it's very content rich and open to exploration...With the two DLCs ""Reign of Giants"" and ""Shipwrecked"" even more content is added to the game. In Reign of Giants you'll have to fight far stronger enemies than before and thus develop new tactics to defend yourself from those new creatures that were added to the game. You'll also have to face new environmental threads, such as dangerous and unforgiving deserts.The newly released DLC ""Shipwrecked"" features the exploration of a tropical version of Don't Starve, featuring completely new bosses and items, giving the game a nice and new kind of concept and tactical approach.I certainly recommend this game to anyone whos interested in open-world survival games. Don't Starve can be very harsh and unforgiving on the player, but uppon learning from your mistakes you'll survive longer and become better and better until you finally ""beat"" the game. I can also recommend both of the DLCs since they are extremely well made! Have fun playing and good luck surviving!			"

												This is Honsetly as good a Survival Game gets, Its Unique Play Style makes it different from the plain old MineCraft Or Terraria        One You Start You wont stop. Having the Feeling of 1 Life Only makes you try harder than just respawning.Although there are some ways to Ressurect your self ( Touchstone, MeatEffingy, ETC) They Are Very Hard To Claim and you leave all your stuff behind when you die, Unlike Mine Craft Stuff dosent De-spawn Including most Mobs. Frogs Raining? Better Leave your base or Hire an Exterminator. With The New Multiplayer Coming This summer ( SO EXITED) possibilites will be endless with a couple of friends or random people! You Could build a huge base..... Fight awsome bosses together, Have an all out war on each other..... Play as webber and get a bunch of spider to ivade their base- er what?Anyways This Was The Best Survival Game Experince ive ever had so Buy it or Maxwell will find you			"

												A disturbing, slender, and well dressed gentleman bids you to wake up, and insists you find food before nightfall. What he doesn't tell you, is that come nightfall, should you be lost in the shadows, something terrible might happen. Several days pass since the start of your adventure, and you may feel pretty good about yourself, your supplies, and your structures. Just know that nothing is permanent... nothing.In Don't Starve, you're thrown into a sandbox survival game mode immediately. There is no tutorial. Death is your tutorial. Learn from it. Your goal, to find out what your goal is. There is no hand holding. Figure it out. Because if you don't, you will enevtually die. If you find out, and are ill prepared, you will also die. Take your time, but don't waste it. There is also a door, somewhere in the world. Within it, you may find answers.I was very skeptical of this game at first. ""Oh great"" I said, ""Another sandbox survival game. Just what we needed.""Then I played it, and I was hooked. The gameplay manages to be fun, rather than tedious like so many other survival games. The art style is distinct, and reminiscent of Tim Burton's older works. Each playable character works a little differently, adding to the game's replay value.This game is like being in an abusive relationship with a sociopathic puppy. In that you never know what it wants you to do, it actively tries to make you miserable, but you can't help but love it. All in all I am very pleased with this title. I would reccommend it to anyone who enjoys survival games, structure defense games, or someone just looking for a good challenge.			"

												BUY THIS GAME, BETTER THEN IT LOOKS !When I first seen this game I though it looked okay, not real big on indie games. But this game is addicting as hell! Only comparison I could think of is Minecraft on the Xbox. It’s about survival and crafting. But like crafting for Minecraft on the Xbox where you don’t drag you just click and if you have what you need you successfully craft it. (does make remembering what you need to craft things a bit difficult. you could just look but if you keep checking you will waste precious time you could be using to find supplies)Not only is it super fun but you discover new things about the game every play through, but it’s also in the steam workshop! Sometimes it’s a little hard to find compatible mods but if you look in the right place there’s some pretty nice ones out there! After you learn all what the game has to offer and mess around with the mods there’s still a sweet $5 DLC with new enemies and stuff its sweet and worth it. Btw this is not a spoiler but there is an adventure mode with 5 missions in it, you’ll find in survival mode. That gives it soooooo much replay value! It will scare you, put you on the edge of your seat, and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. But is sweet when you live longer than you ever have before. "

												It's really hard to get into. You have to start off knowing exactly what to do and how to do it if you wanna make it past day 5. Luck is also a huge factor, if you start off in a bad area there's a good chance you'll die before you can do anything. Getting into it and making it to winter is rewarding though and makes you feel like you're hard work paid off. Graphics are VERY pretty and unique. It's not quite worth the total price but if you can get it on sale for at least $11 then it is. 6.5/10 game, very nice for it's price range			"

												Let me get this out of the way. I really like this game. You can tell by the hours I have put into it. However,  I do have some...Gripes with this game. Prepare for a long, insightful review. *Please note, as of right now, this is a single player game, but multyplayer will be incorporated soon sometimes this summer. It will not affect the single player game*To make things short, I was growing tired of many a game. I needed something different, something...Difficult, but something I would enjoy. I chose this survival game above all the others fro it's....Rather overused to say it, but Tim Burton like visuals and its dark humour. Very serious games get me down somewhat, and I don't regret buying this out bit.   Simply put, you start of as Wilson, a gentleman scientist, as he is the default character you will get first. You can unlock other characters by the experience points you garner by days survived. For most of them, at least. They all have their...Perks, as it were, that differentiate themselves from other characters, so you aren't just playing as a reskinned character. As such, playstyles will vary. The cold Winter wont be as tough on Wilson because of his beard, Wendy can only do half damage, but her ghost twin sister can be the brute strength. Wigfrid is an actor who takes her role seriously, but dang, is she a good fighter. *note, 2 characters are DLC content only, Wigfrid and Webber. Yes. The DLC is completely worth it. Honestly, you won't go back to the vanilla game afterwards when you play it*The game will constantly throw challenges at you to overcome. Your main priorities are shown as 3 different symbols. Health is a heart, sanity is a brain, and hunger is your stomach. You must keep these up adequately, or suffer the consequences, though the amount you need to look after these vary somewhat on each character. Most characters have a default of 200 sanity, 150 health, and 150 hunger, so keep this in mind.  Even with this challenge to overcome, it never so much feels like a cheap shot at you. It really does feel like its your own fault for dying, which is a nice change of pace. You do need armour, you cannot just run head first into things. Fighting really does have a risk here.I said amour, didn't I? You see, in this game, you need to make things. Crafting is the key  to survival, as one expects from these games. A large majority of things you need to craft come from something called the science machine. From there you can build most things, providing you have enough materials. Don't worry. Science machines are easy to craft.Speaking of easy, you can make the default game, *which is called survival* easier on yourself, or more difficult. You can change the settings to suit your needs, such as amount of grass and twigs, *very very vital!* amount of monsters, food such as berries and so on. To get the fullest out of this game, some self control is needed to not put all the food to highest and monsters to low. It will get boring, trust me....Also, don't set everything to highest. Really. You will regret it. If you grow tired of survival, which is never ending, *if you really can survive that long* There is an Adventure mode. To clear things up, this came after survival mode, and adds several different things.   Maxwell, *the tall dapperlly fella that greets you sarcastic like every time you start a new character* will greet you as per survival mode and be on his way as quickly as he appears, and you will end up in a randomly selected location. You have to survive 5 worlds, or perhaps islands, in a sense, before you get to the ending. The first location you end up has 3 possible spawn points. Hopefully luck will be kind on you and you won't get King of Winter, a place of permanent cold.   To get to the next level, you must build a door. To build a door, you must locate all of the *things*. Things are parts of the door scattered about each level, and are often guarded by creatures called Clockworks of varying sorts. They sport a chest piece theme, if you are curious. If you can successfully locate all of the things and put them were they need to go, you can traverse to the next location, however, you can only take 4 things with you. *for instance, 20 logs, 10 twigs, 5 gold and 20 rocks* Think carefully before you go through the door, as once you go through, there is no going back.Besides the monsters, there are seasons. I keep mentioning Winter, but there is of course Summer, Spring and Autumn as well. Autumn is the easiest to start out on, and each season is roughly 15 to 20 days in length on default settings. You also have caves to wander into as well if you so desire, but they won't save you from the weather. Trust me.I've said all of this and hold these mechanics in great  regard, but what do I find rather...Not quite so good?Well, on a good note to start the bad, developer feedback is a nice feature of this game. Suggestions by players are taken into account, things are tweaked, fixed or added. It's one of the high points of Don't Starve, that such a thing is allowed to happen. The downside could be said that since things are still being added or revised all of the time, not all gameplay mechanics will be dandy. Summer for instance can be quite annoying, what with things burning up on screen, *your base and items included, fortunately nothing in your inventory* However, Summer is DLC content, but its reassuring to know the developers take time to work on their DLC. Other times the game will encounter a few glitches, but very, very few of them are game crashing or breaking. Most crashing comes from mods, which again, is a nice feature of the game. I have not yet encountered something were I would have to restart as a new character, so you are in good steed.   What else ain't so great? Well, to be honest, this will be a hit and miss to many people, but for me and those like me, the biggest problem is the story. There is very little of it.  It is there, we are not talking Minecraft or Mario levels of story. *pretty much non existent* But.....Considering the style and tone of this game, you expect something more. The developers are looking into expanding the story as far as I am aware, and what little is there in terms of story and the whole tone of the game is a great start. You know Team Fortress started with pretty much nothing? Look how far that has gone. Still much more to go, but the world they have is fantastic with all the story possibilities it could take. Don't Starve is one of those games. You really do want to know more of the bad guys story from what you learn about them. You wonder why people are being taken to this island. Why did Wilson, a scientist with little luck, got chosen to be stuck on this nightmare of a place? Why did any of them? Who are the things in the darkness? the shadows...Watching you?..... With all of this being said though, the characters you will play as do have their own personality, as you will discover when examining objects or doing general survival things. Wilson himself is rather kooky, not really using scientific terms for things...Or....any intelligible terms for many things, honestly. Willow is like a child, but like Wilson is in her early 30's, and likes...Burning things. Wendy the child speaks of death and decay, Wes...Well....he is a mime, so good luck trying to get any words out of him...At all. You'll find a character  you like here,  as there are just over 10 of them, and with the added scenario, and the darkly humorous tone to the whole game, its a joy to think of the things that could happen story wise, if the developers ever get around to it. I'm hopeful they will.   On a whole, the gameplay and mechanics have very little fault to them, most every death feels like its down to your own idiocy instead of a cheap shot, the characters likeable in their own way, the idea itself both in terms of story and gameplay intriguing and visuals great. Get this game now.			"

												Hello and welcome to the unforgiving world of Don't Starve!This game is my pick for a true survial game, even the slightes mistake can have a huge impact for your future or even can cause your demise.You will be always on the run to improve and prepare yourself for the next commingSeason or threat. Nights are real nights, you NEED some lights to see.. or else..In this world it's Eat or to be eaten :Hunt down your prey or foes to either get value materials or stock up your foodsupply. Because remember to ""Don't Starve"".. because food is precious and you really need to stock up on it.. or else a bad season can cause your demise.Take care of your surroundings and base setup :Where you settle down and how you place your precious Buildings, chests and allis important. Lets just say you settled somewhere close to a forest. What will beso bad about it, right? Well.. you may have alot of wood, berry and branch supply..But what if a thunderstorm comes to say hello?There's alot more to say about this game.. but I want you to explore and experienceit by yourself. Because it's awesome, a Must Have!			"

												A beautiful game with a dark, gloomy art style that I personally find very appealing. Definitely one of my favorite games.It's very hard at the beginning, and still hard after getting used to it, (I still die from the most stupid things from time to time) but that's what makes the game so fun. It's unforgiving, but never unfair. Beside, you can tweak the worlds to your liking if you're having a hard time, like more food, less water, longer days, etc. Or crank up the difficulty to test your survival skills. However, I recommend playing on default setting a couple times before you start tweaking.There is a lot of different characters to choose from too, each with its own sets of abilities, like a pyromaniac little girl or a upgradable robot. There's also a little touch of dark humor that give the game quite a charm. Combine the characters with the world generation's semi-random nature and you get quite the repleyability.I recommend this game to any fans of survival/crafting games, or anyone that want to be alone on a twisted island.However, I don't recommend this game to anyone who likes to feel overpowered. Yes, the game gives you total control over yourself, but believe me, you will be overwhelmed by this game. You will die. A lot. It's not like minecraft or Terrarria where you'll respawn on death, if you die, you lose EVERYTHING. But then again, this introduce the concept of risk to the game. That's something I personally really enjoy since I feel like it gives a lots of weight to each of my decisions, but I can also see how it can be a turn off to some people, hence the warning.Hope you'll enjoy the game as much as I did.

												Don't starve is one of those Indy Games that you like, play fore a while, get addicted to, play a little longer and the put it away for a year or so to start the process again later on.The way this game plays, feels and is being experienced just works for me. the art feels both safe (mainly because it is cartoony) and yet dark too. And for a game in which the dark will kill you and you'll have to create light to stay alive that is great! At night you'll be terrified while feeding your campfire with the last pieces of wood, and during the day you'll be ready for an adventure to gather supplies, food and weaponrry for the next night (and day).I must admit, after playing it for too long it will get boring. mainly because it's still an indy game which just isn't build for great scale and an unlimited supply of options (Except for the all-known Mojang Project, if you get my drift). But, after a while, you can pick it up again an loose yourself again for a couple of weeks (maybe months).For the price I would say it is definately worth it! Great and addictive to certain extend, 8/10			"

												One of my great fall back games. Even before the Reign of Giants DLC the game received much love in the form of updates by the developers. In the game you start out as Wilson, you are pulled in to a bizarre world and someone named Maxwell and you basically have to survive. There are two implicit game modes (you don't have to choose they just both are there) to play. One is just the pure survival in a bizarre world and the other is to find the person who got you in the world and ""deal with him ""Both things are really entertaining to do. The game is hard enough as it is on its default standing but you can change any custom generated world as you please. If you don't like a world all are random generated so best start a new one. The game has its own art style you either love or hate. Its got a unique atmosphere and an isometric 3rd person view when playing the game (camera can be turned)I personally just love this game and every once in a while check what has been changed. I'd say if you like how the game looks, like a challenge, like random generated worlds, like survival games and this art style, than this game is for you!			"

												Don't let the small amount of time fool you, I've spent many hours in game both online and offline. I must say when it comes to survival games this has to be one of my all time favorites. I had a fasination with them back in the old days of WarCraft 3 Wilderness survival. At first this game appeared as a typical collect stuff, Build, Eat, survive. But, it offers so much more and with a unique twist using your characters sanity. There is an added bonus of so much to explore.For a game with the price set at $14.99 I don't know many games that can beat it. I would give this game a soild 9/10 in my books. The only downside is getting started is a little overwhelming as there is so much to be done (In no particular order).			"

												This game probably doesn't need another positive review, but I've been having fun with, so I'll add one.  It is essentially a survival crafting game where you try to outsmart the world (which is constantly trying to kill you) in order to live as long as possible and discover it's secrets.  The best aspect of this game is discovering secrets, so play without instruction and discover all these secrets for yourself.  It seems simplistic in the first few hours; then you realize there are lots of fun surprises that let you overcome seemingly impossible obstacles.You will probably die a lot in this process.  And when you die, you start over.  It can get frustrating.  But if you put it down for a while, you will want to come back to it.  The game would have benefited from 'undefined' achievements; e.g. achievements where you don't have instructions on how to achieve them.  This would provide a record of what you have discovered without giving you a grindy laundry list of things to do and wouldn't make you play for the wrong reasons.  The developers (and particularly the forum mod) have a strange attitude of not allowing discussion of development decisions on this topic and others, which is off-putting for those who like to discuss the games they play, but it does not directly impact the enjoyability the game itself.It's a lot of fun, has a great art style, and definitely worth playing.  I only hope it doesn't get too repetitive before I'm able to survive adventure mode.			"

												This game is fun to play in short bursts.  It's relatively easy to get into and start learning, but the finer points of survival take time to figure out.  I really dig the aesthetic, and all the little sound design touches.  The different playable characters you unlock add a good bit of variety.  It can get a little monotonous once you've sorta figured everything out, though.  Long-term survival means needing to do as little as is possible in as regular a routine as is possible, so naturally it sorta equals out to boredom in the end.  But that's cool, just go die and start over.			"

												Don't Starve one of my favourite survival games of all time.Unlike games similear to Minecraft or Starbound Don't Starve gives you a lot to do without using any mods (although mods in Don't Starve are fun) this game will have you playing for hours as it will take you a good 5 to 10 days to complete everything in Don't Starve at a fast pace. With the new Reign Of Giants DLC the game expands mabye even doubles in normal Don't Starve for only $5 more (which is better then most DLC) you'll be working your butt off trying to slay giants find items and most importantly SURVIVE. Overall this game is fun with a sence of rush in it and i give it my score of 5/5 for the normal game and 5/5 for the DLC.			"

												Suprisingly complex, great looking, hard game! Trying to stay alive in deadly enviroment and realising how fragile your life is has never been so fun! ;) And that feeling of learning something new with every playthrough and sustaining your life longer and longer is priceless :P Solid 8/10 for me.EDIT: warning, it requires A LOT of trial and error and time in general.

												I just started playing this game last night, and I really like it. It's one of those simple survival games but you always seem to have to reach for something ex: a pickaxe, a campfire, etc. It's nice because it has lots of replayability. I've been living off flower petals for the past 8 days and its been great. 10/10 would eat flower petals again.**EDIT**It's been about 3 days with this game. Day 70 I reckon and I managed to build a decent base, and I have a pet Beefalo by my side. Fantastic.! :)))))))			"

												Don't Starve, people, no seriously, Don't Starve. is just a great survival game, how long can you survive...! this game is all about survival. I played this for hours once and even pulled an all nighter playing it. so recommended. the game even has a crafting system where you can craft new items by using the crafting recipes. can you survive through night and day..? or will you die of starvation or by wild creatures. or by losing your sanity... this game has some dark humor in it... overall, its a great Survival game and its worth the buy.
