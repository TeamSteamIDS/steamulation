								Review Update - Assetto Corsa V.08Short version: I highly recommend bying  AC. Although right now it is not a finished  game, but still a game in early acces (~beta) and key fetures like MP are not enabled yet.But what you get right now, is well worth the money and one of teh best racing sims out there. What the heck is Assetto Corsa?AC is the work of a small Italian independent Studio: Kunos Simulazione, in sim racing circles around the world known for Net Kar Pro, held in highest regards due to its driving/physic engine and tyre model.  Never heard of it? -  Just like me. I was happy with the likes of GT 5/6 and Forza, never cared for what was going on on pc and didn't know what I was missing. Anyhow, Assetto Corsa is a pc racing simulator that tries not only to appeal to its own core audience of pc sim racers, but is aimed at console players too.  Assetto Corsa builds up on the predecessor Net Kar Pro, and if successfu,l will see updates, DLC and additional features for years.Assetto Corsa  - What makes it special?IFUN!  - Yes Fun, becausedriving is as much fun in the game as it is in real live. AC is a simulator which gets and provides exactly that.Unlike a lot of otherr sims AC is very accessible, easy to get into but hard to master. The Driving Experience in AC: Just take a seat in the 1st car you like and start driving (my 1st love: BMW E30 DTM@Mugello) - Within the first round I had a big smile on my face, never before had I experienced such a great feedback and immersion with a Racing Game. - with a pad none the less The cars are  alive and responsive, you really feel  weight transfer, the tyres, and every part of the track - imho neither the GT Series, nor the Forza titles or the Sim Bin games I tried on pc  come even close. AC's driving/physics and tyre model is exquisit and unique in its way of easing you into it and letting you explore its depths. If you are looking for something in a racing game that is more detailed and refined than what you already know, then Assetto Corsa is without a doubt the right choice for you. Pad/WheelGreat improvement with Pad support in the latest update, no issues anymire.Though every Sim Racer will tell you, that you have to buy a wheel to enjoy this game that isn't true at all.  To this day I'm driving with a pad and have put 100+hours into AC with a XBox360 Controller and had more fun than I ever had with GT 5 or Forza or any other racing game - i.e. most of the pc simulators sounded like work to me till AC came around. I don't own a 3 Monitor setup, Racing Seat, wheel etc. - just a decent pc which allows me to play on high settings. So you can have fun and lots of it, and the driving experience is still a lot better than GT/Forza.  Amount/Quality of contentKunos got their hands on some 1st rate licenses, among them Mercedes (not yet in game), Lotus, BMW and Ferrari and more. AC focuses on GT2/GT3 cars and open wheelers  like the ""almost F1"" Lotus Exos S1 and the awesome old ""Lauda"" Ferrari . But more cars are to come, historicals F1, and much more. Every car is beautifully modelled and whileForza and expecially GT feature hundreds of beautiful cars from all ends of the spectrum,  Kunos is not an industry giant like them and can't ever compete with that amount of original content. But the car selection is still more than decent, all  the tracks in AC are laser scanned and the variety is great - i.e.the Nurburgring GP track and it feels and plays awesome!But here is the main thing: Assetto Corsa is moddable, that means fans are invited to produce and create tracks, cars, skins, Apps and much more - easy to install and a superb enrichment to AC. Just take a look at the beautiful skins or useful apps in the community videos - absolutely amazing, the creators deserve much praise. A big thank you to all the modders and unsung heroes out there!Graphics/Sounds:Very good, but not the very best (upcoming Project Cars) and the performance depends as always mostly on your GPU.  I use a Palit Geforce 770 4GB and play it with high settings. But this game is as you know by now not finished yet and will see a lot of improvements on quality and performace - and some of it has already been done. A low level pc with onboard grafix won't do, but with a high end system you can easily play on resolutions beyond 1920*1080.Sound is above average and good, but is lacking punch in some cars and will improve with future updates. For those who can't wait for that, there are of course already some sound mods out there.Conclusion  - Enough of the rambling rave - be part of Early Access!There are a lot of things that are not perfect in AC yet, and some that are even quite frustrating at the moment. Some issues like setting up and finetuning controllers have been fixed and teh latest update saw the AI behaviour extremely improves. Almost all the frustrating and unfair behaviour are gone, most races are really great fun now with clean racing. The new AI is certainly among the best out there: they really race, they do not drive in a straight line behind each other and bore you to death. They actually give the very immersive impression that they want to beat you, they overtake you and each other, they make mistakes, defend their racing line and so on. With Update 08 most if not all of the terrible AI behaviour is gone anf there are only minor problems left.I can't stress enough how impressive the work of the small KUnos team really is. They kept word on every promise they made, gave or announced additional free contet and their updates are coming every 2 weeks - V08 is definitely a hughe step toward a final release version. Full VersionThe full version of Assetto Corsa game is epected to be released within the next 2-4 months, and the complete content will be available then. That includes Multiplayer, Career mode and certain cars/tracks etc. Till then you get updates every 14 days, which include bugfixes, new features or new content. Until now Kunos stayed true to their word and kept the good things coming. To me this a must-by for everybody who likes to play racings games on whatever system or plattform. If you want the full time hard core simulation immersion - AC delivers just that, but if you just want to have fun driving or racing without a hassle, just pic a car, and AC delivers just that too.And while it certainly isn't perfect and unpolished in some areas, it is very stable and relativeley bugfree (2 crashes during 150+ hours of play). Of course there is much to be done, bugs to be fixed, Controller, grafic performance optimization, adding features like Multiplayer etc. - but I really feel by now that Kunos deserves trust.I will update this review when and if essential features are added and the final version is released.

								Maybe the saviour of PC sim racing?Don't get me wrong, there are other sims on the PC that are stunning in their own right, but Assetto Corsa might be the first in a long, long time that may be able to capture the hearts of the true sim racing crowd and the more casual racer/gamer. And boy does the PC racing scene need a fresh boost like this.Talking of physics for a moment, I am not sure it's as all-conquering as some are saying, but that doesn't take away from the experience - the physics are still pretty darn impressive and right up there with the best on PC and destorys the consoles (as you would expect). One of the breakthrough aspects of the cars is how planted and solid they feel under the limit, which means those fresh to real sim racing will find it less frustrating to enjoy and ""get it"". But push any car to its limit and you'll quickly realize there is serious depth here. I currently prefer AC to any other sim out there when i think of physics, fun factor, potential, and so on.The current car and track list--which is now coming in stages whilst in beta-- is drool worthy. Ferrari F40, 458, BMW M3 GT2, Spa, Monza, Imola -  it just goes on and on, and all the tracks are laser scanned, too. Some classics are missing, but with modding support and promises of DLC in the future, I can see many of these such as Sebring, Mid Ohio and Brands Hatch, coming in due course (along with many more tracks and cars).The key now is to intoduce good community aspects into it's UI, and a multiplayer experience that pushes the boat - not just a bland server list where to be in the know you have to join fragmented leagues in multiple forums all over the world. It should all be handled in the user interface.Assetto Corsa has the potential to bring a fragmented community together. It has the graphics, physics and interface to change the face of sim racing on the PC. Buy it and support Kunos, they seriously deserve it.			"

								+ vehicledynamics/handling+ looks good+ sounds good+ laserscanned tracks+ nice selection of cars+ mods- AI/KI- no weather- no night- first kunos wanted to sell it as a F2P Game and you feel and see it in almost every aspect of this game (5sec penalty, no false starts, pitstops, no flagrules etc)- kunos want to get a big company so they care more about nice pressevents and nice pictures then turning this game into a real racing simulator- no longer every 2 week updates- many, many, many idiots/jerks/♥♥♥♥♥♥s/cheaters in public multiplayer- maybe a DLC nightmare in the future (3rd party paycontet already available)- almost impossible to do close door-2-door racing cause of massive microlags in multiplayer- lags in general (when the player in front of you is hard on the edge of his car - his car starts to lag/warp and you most likely crash him/you/both of you out of the race if you dont slow down and let a gap of 1-2sec between your cars)- maxed out graphics needs huge gpu performance- damagesystem in its current state is ♥♥♥♥ed up from top to bottom- overall it feels like a tuned up forza motorsport (physic) with by far less content and costumisation of your cars (i played fm3 and loved it also) (most likely cause they wanted to sell it as f2p ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ where you would have to pay a lot of real cash for a nice paint or spoiler)- Trento Bondone Hillclimb Track is a bad conversation from netcar (the devs also forbidded to mod it into the game for modders) and is by far the visual worst track and yes you can also fall out of the hole track/level into an endless flyinspin when you crash at the wrong place...like in a 0.2 version of some modtracks. I HOPE THEY FIX THIS ASAP.So is it a good game? More - then +.If you like driving/racinggames like rf,gtr,iracing and own a wheel it is definitely a must have. ATTENTION: Nordschleife will come as DLC with 10cars and is NOT INCLUDED in the release version of this game.If you more confident with a simple xbox controller then wait for project cars or stay with forza motorsport/gt.Singleplayer sucks cause of KI and limited simulation of real racing.PUBLIC Multiplayer sucks cause of many, many, many wreckers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wannabe schumachers.Best solution is to download some hillclimb/rallytrack mods and enjoy the driving from point a to b. ALONE. Or join a racingleague for fair and hard racing (but not too close :))This is my personal opinion after 770hours of testing and driving, bugreporting and following the developement since day 1 of ea release.Cheers and have funUPDATE: now programm state is 1.1.6improved sounds: very nice, special in replays on shorter tracks. with headphones....5.1 surround sound sounds not so good aimproved graphics: good for people with 1gb vram improved tyres/physics: if you stay away from the simcade settings optimal - still benchmarkimproved multiplayer: yes, door-to-door is more possible, many options still missingimproved ki: thats the part what make me the most sick about this game. After they introduced the ki in the ea i had read a review about it in the official ac forums where the guy said that the ki is more acting like real human beings, some are aggressiv some passiv and he told his experience of his first singleplayer race. and after i tried the singleplayer mode 2 months after the release i had exact the same experience like he had when the ki was ""new"". its still impossible to do a simple trackday with different cars driven by the ki and have fun race. damn its even impossible to follow a abarth 500 train cause the ki driven ferrari behind is unable to overtake the 500 but when you overtake the ferrari he will most likely crash you instantly out of the race. whats the point of playing a racinggame where the ki is dumber then a texas instruments calculator? and the devs said in the ea phase that most players will only use singleplayer and not multiplayer so they focus more on singleplayer....ähm wtf?!?and now they splitting up the costumers into ""good dlc buyer cashcow players"" and ""bad only stock/mod content poor players"" in multiplayer....wtf?Yes the game is still in developement but where are the times when you buyed a game and it was (almost) complete and with all features players wanted and features which are also needed to say it is a simulator and not a mariokart. But no kunos said they dont want to get competion against simbin, iracing, rfactor so now you have the result. ki not working, singlepayer racing only 10 laps max....multiplayer which you also cant enjoy to its full capacity if you dont buy dlc(´s). Please Kunos stop seperating each part of you game into a calculation part to get money. If you have a full package you will get your money cause you will have a overall good product and not a thing which falls apart in every aspect when you watch it close.			"

								*UPDATED to .21*For me, one of the best racing sims out there. definitely recomendable. I will make a list of pros and cons (list for V0.94) so you can decide for yourself:Pros:-Best driving simulation I've ever tried, the car is so predictable that you can even go sideways playing with a mouse. Dont get me wrong, you really NEED a wheel to enjoy this game. Almost every car is easy to drive in your confort zone, try to go above it  to earn some tenths and it will become tricky before you lose the control of the car.-You get a bunch of cars (a bit of everything) and a few laser scanned circuits. We are talking of the closest to reality models you can get on a game here. More to come, the Green Hell as dlc in October I think-Mods (with dev tools soon *already released). mod apps (displays, corners performance,..),mod sound, mod tracks (one of high quality already, crappy ports too), and mod cars (soon* already released good ones: shelby cobra and gp2).-Small and friendly dev team. They ask, you answer, they give (list of wanted cars and traks) and you ask, they answer (if you have some problem)-Game modes: Im just here for the multiplayer but there is a lot of challenges, time atack mode, drift and drag mode too. *multiplayer is enjoyable already, you have some jump in and drive servers and more serious onesNow the cons:-As early access: everything works in single player, the AI needs a bit of agresivity tuning, now avoids you an doesnt defend its position. The devs have said to v1.0 there will be 2 sliders for strenth and agresivity. Multiplayer have some lacks but it was  released this friday so it will be better for sure.- you dont have a massive list of cars like lets say Project Cars-As the time writing, is not possible to have another light source than the Sun, so no night races yet. You can race from sunrise to sunset with dynamic time and stuff- Not weather yet- Car damage (visual and mechanic) is not implemented yet,  seeing the perfection of the grip simulation I'm sure it will be top-notch tho- *You will find some idiots on the multiplayer from time to time in open servers, but what multiplayer game doesnt have them? (btw i've only seen one in 150h, the rest is just lack of experience)final thoughts:If you are still reading this, buy it, you wont regret it			"

												Best racing sim ever.- Fantastic GFX, reflections, smoke etc etc- Cars look amazing- Engine sounds that actually get under your skin- Superb G27 support- Native tripple screen support and track IR- All cars FEEL like actual cars- Great tracks- Well optimised (apart from the smoke ;))- Decent multiplayer track days and eventsI've been playing AC for a while and it has been my go-to game for that racing buzz on the G27. No other game comes close in terms of making you feel that you are part of the car and giving you that racing buzz.My favorite racer for some time was GTR2, but it was getting a little old and tired in the looks department and it's feel. I've got a ton of racing games on various platforms and it is safe to say that AC has the best feel hands down of any.Step into the legendary 98T lotus as an example, up the boost, watch the engine strain, hear the tyres screeth and feel your car squirm as the boost comes in and you fight to keep the car facing forwards on the track, whilst meanwhile that beast of an engine sound is giving you a rush. Limit the boost to save the engine, fly into a corner too hot, try to take someone on the outside and up the boost again trying to outdrag them as you fly past and look to the left screen seeing the engine flashing red and them dropping back in your mirrors - you know you are pushing it hard and the engine won't last like that forever!Honest this game is a credit to the developers, and for anyone who thinks it doesn't have enough cars or tracks, this game is all about quality and not quantity.Now they have added the Yellowbird it is a fantastic addition. Such a tailhappy fun beast of a car to drive and drift around in.You've got your sporty production cars, tail-happy beasts such as the mighty Cobra, and limited production cars / race cars. All of the sounds are unique and the charteristics of each car make it a different game with each car you step into.Absolutely spot on, and worth it for anyone who is into their racing sims.It's worth noting that if you want to push the visuals on multi screen setups you do need a fairly hefty system though. I am running an I7 4770k under water and two GTX 780TI AMP's. I can max everything out apart from the hi-res mirror reflections and smoke needs to be turned down. I would imagine for a single screen though that somehting like one 780 would be plenty.			"

								Let me be as frank, and honest as possible, this game is absolutely amazing, but there is a caveat.  So I did not really play racing games/sims and one day I saw Grid Autosport, and it had a really fun look to it so I picked it up and with my XBOX controller, started having fun.  The AI is terrible on that game, but in multiplayer with friends its a great time.  I enjoyed it so much, I thought, have I missed out on one of the best genres of games? So I picked up Assetto Corsa, and tried it out.  It was fun in third person view with the controller, but as I read through forums, and spoke to others I was missing out.  This is a SIMULATOR, a program DESIGNED to mimic real life driving and thus cannot be enjoyed fully with sticks and buttons, and that a wheel, no, a good wheel was going to improve my experience.  Well, for my birthday, my wife got me the G27 wheel, and my goodness, this is where this game absolutely excels.  There is nothing like it, I truly feel as though I am driving the car (to a point) and I LOVE IT!  I tried Grid with the wheel, and its not bad, not bad at all, its the difference between Outrun and getting a day at a real racing track playing AC.  There is also modding support, so if I want to drift one night, I have a some drift cars, want to drive F1, those are there, and the amount of tracks and cars provided by the community, are increasing daily.So....to sum it up, if you are looking for a game, this probably isnt for you, but if you are looking to have a real racing experience, this is where its at!

												There are a few pluses to this game: Laserscanned tracks Semi-elaborate car settings options, although I don't like the handling model (see below) The Force Feedback is nuanced and communicates well what a car is doing through the steering wheelI tried to like this game, but unfortunately it is also very lacking in many areas which severely offset the positives: AI is unaware of players and will continue their set path no matter what. Their ability to fight or defend is mediocre at best. No weather effects (rain) No nighttime racing Lacking career mode Sounds are sometimes accurate, but for the most part it's too flat. Sounds are very digital and lack in reverberation with surroundings.  Handling is not that great, I feel especially the tyre model is lacking. Obviously people will be very sensitive to this because it is supposed to be a great simulator. Unfortunately I must disagree, so I'll try to be elaborate on this one. Front tyres will not respond correctly when trailbraking, and mid-corner they do not bite (i.e. generate lateral force) as much as they should. This is very simple to showcase: try and flick the wheel left and right through the exit barriers of the Nürburgring Tourist exit; even high-downforce racing cars with proper racing tyres will barely change direction in this game, whereas I can make my silly road car on road tyres shift tyre load very easily and rapidly. This phenomenon is also visible in (record) hotlaps from the top guys on the leaderboards: even they have to coast terribly long at corner entry and mid-corner, otherwise any car in this game will just go wide. This can easily be shown by for example looking up real-life time attacks on the Nordschleife and comparing the corner speeds with those in the game. There is just no way to really push without the front tyres giving up, and that is just a shame. I tried my fair share of extreme car setups (minimum spring and damper stiffness in the front and maximum in the rear, maximum rake, etc.) just to get the front end turn, but the physics engine just does not respond accordingly. Again, this is visible in the way even the leaderboard players have to coast so much through turns.Another thing is that drifting in this game does not look natural at all; whenever the cars oversteer they continue to move as a solid body in a given direction and at the same velocity. It's not possible to make the car increase its angular velocity (i.e.: spin out) by abruptly stabbing the throttle or the brake. It is also not possible to power out the cars from corner apexes and gradually straightening the wheel. As a result, there is no chance to do controlled drifts in which cars harmoniously slide from corner to corner as if they are dancing, and certainly not with a lot of tyre smoke from spinning the rear wheels under power. Look up any video of AC drifting to see what I mean; as a result of the non-accurate handling model cars will just go from uncontrolled slide to uncontrolled slide, there is never an actual feeling that the driver is in control of the drift angle at all. What's more, this unacademic and totally disrespectful response of the developer says enough about his lack of knowledge and approach to an iterative process of improving something technical like a physics engine: http://imgur.com/a/NgYYQ This guy can't be a real engineer if he can't even handle some constructive peer reviews...But most of all: I'm especially fond of online racing, but this game has just the worst online system of any recent driving game, and I want to elaborate on this game-breaking experience that makes me regret my purchase of this incomplete game. There simply is next to no variety in online lobbies; it is always the same track and car combinations that appear, and making a custom lobby will result in a lack of players that are able to join, let alone actually join. This is due to two main reasons: Hosting an online lobby is done with a seperate dedicated server tool that imposes unnecessary restrictions on the host. First of all, a single car model with a particular colour has to be manually assigned to every player slot beforehand. There is no way of selecting one or multiple classes that are allowed, but instead there is just a list of all the car models without their specifications. Not only is it very hard to know which cars are evenly matched to each other, but it results in extremely limited choice. In practice, it is either having to deal with one-make races or a fixed varied list in which one or two cars of each model is available; for example, two Ferraris 458, two Mercedes SLS AMG, two Corvettes, etcetera. In the latter case, when a car is taken by another player, it is prohibited to drive it anymore because it belongs to the prior assigned server slot; if the two McLaren P1s are already chosen, you are out of luck and have to choose another model. The host decides which cars are available, both in type and in quantity. A ridiculous decision; this has to be the only car game in recent times that carries over this real-world restriction/scarcity into the digital world. Some people even go afk in the lobby just not to lose their virtual car in that server to another player...Furthermore, the online tool cannot be setup to cycle through multiple tracks, let alone a new set of available cars. Every change has to be done manually and servers have to be restarted with every edit, kicking all the players...The online experience is further worsened with the next point below: DLC system splits up the game into many different sub versions. In other games this is no problem because you can join all lobbies, but are just restricted to use the content that you own. Not in Assetto, where you are just denied into a server when you lack just one car or track from the list that the host setup. In practice, this leads to even less variety, because lobby leaders know that they will not get many players joining if they choose cars from several DLC packs, so it's mostly either 'vanilla game content lobbies' or 'DLC lobbies' that are available.Care for some online GT3 racing? You are forced to buy Dream Pack 2 and 3, as well as the Red Pack and lately the Porsche pack as well for the Porsche GT3 car. Want to have a supercar battle? Same problem, lobbies will probably have at least a Porsche sportscar, so you must buy any of that DLC as well as the Tripl3 Pack DLC for the Ferrari 488 GTB that inevitably is in the lobby list. If you own just the vanilla game, then forget about proper online play altogether. All in all, this game is fun if you want a semi-realistic hotlapping game, or if you are planning to buy all the DLC. Otherwise, I would definitely not recommend it.			"

												Full opinion of Assetto Corsa:PRO:- The Most realistic simulator currently available on Steam.- Great Graphics-Engine.- Good Sounds of Cars.- The tracks are created in Laser-Scan, equal to reality in every details.- The cars interiors are gorgeous.- You can change all the parameters of the machine.- The forum Game is very popular. You can Post mod or exposing problems / bugs to developers.- Multiplayer is Fun, with various features, formed by serious people.CONTRO:-Where is the night and the rain?-Some Bug in Multiplayer.-Unable to play via keyboard.-HDR Unoptimized.-Carreer and events much passable.-There isn't Workshop.What to say? I'm Italian and I'm proud to own a simulator completely Made in Italy so damn beautiful and long-lived.If you have a steering wheel this game MUST be your in ALL THE COSTS!Who played with the keyboard ... stay away from this.One of the best simulators of all time.

												A great example of Early Access done right, Kunos was always communicating what they were working on and delivered updates frequently.As for the game itself, if you want a racing simulator, Assetto Corsa is the title you want. Period. It may not have the same eye-candy as some titles, but it delivers in the physics simulation, force feedback (use of a wheel is highly recommended), and native, FOV-correct triple-monitor support.Kunos has stated plans to continue building on AC with DLC and core updates through 2017, so even if you didn't get in on early access, there's still a great value to be had here.

												I love this game. Assetto Corsa dawns a new era of the racing simulator. Assetto Corsa is a simulator that brings the revered true-to-life racing experience to the casual gamer. This game bridges the two worlds together without losing rigidity as a racing simulator. This is a simulator that will punish you for entering a corner too fast, or giving too much gas in a corner. But at the same time it is so delightfully simplistic and intuitive that it is easily playable by almost anyone. Assetto Corsa is one of the few racing simulators that is fun, and still encourages you to make mistakes and learn from them. If you are coming from console games like Forza, or GT and are looking for something more, then this is the game for you. Assetto Corsa is truly the best racing simulator there is.  However, this game is by no means perfect. One of the biggest problems that I have for this game is the lack of awareness of speed. This leads to the driver entering the corner much too fast, and creates an inorganic driving experience. This problem is mostly notable in the interior driving view. Other reviewers have mentioned this as a flaw and it certainly is one. I found the best way to correct this is to adjust the FOV or go to either the bonnet cam or the bumper cam. If you are someone that can get used to the inside cam (where it occurs the most) then this might not be a problem for you.			"

												I have old i5-3230M GT650M laptop.When I bought AC(ver 1.6?) it is unplayable at 720p, graphic low and more than about 8 AI cars. I mostly played practice or hot lap. But I did not complaint. The driving experience itself is good enough..Now ver 1.9, with same laptop,1080p low, 12 AI cars,  no problem!! 50~60fps!!24 AI cars reach 30~40fps at some tracks. playable!Whta a great job!Some games just want to kill your GPU..Kunos, keep up the good work!

												I am 50 years old and not much of a gamer, but enjoy simulations of all kinds, which Assetto Corsa is. They are a small group of people and do a good job listening to us. They have improved this software so much in the past year that I had to update my review.   One thing I am sure, from hearing about what others are describing about AC, is that each hardware setup (computer/wheel/screen/vr) behaves a little different.     Then of course there is the settings (comuter/wheel/software). So much can be gained or lost here.   Go through (assettocorsa ini) file and set everything to your computer/wheel.    I got Razer Cortex, which shuts down background apps and Malwarebyts, which cleaned hundreds of pups.     Download the (Anti Clipping and Fanaleds) apps for your wheel.     REFLECTIONS set down to low and static reflections set to very low, may help.    I find it harder to drive in game than a real car so be patient and be aware of your speed. 50 mph in-game still feels like 30 mph to me.   I still have to remind myself of the power I have, without any repercussions to the $500 000 car or myself/public property. I had a V8 Vega (300+ horse, curb weight 2500 pounds), could, at times, leave me shaking for the rest of the day. I could only imagine the skid mark a car like the  LeFerrari could cause in your underwear.     Assetto Corsa's physics really are incredible.  This is getting very real. Assetto Corsa is worth all the money and time.  One other thing that has me so addicted is the track and car mods.   Checking to see what is new every day is one of my favorite things to do. Just try searching Google Image ""Assetto Corsa car mod downloads"" and see for yourself.     I can't emphasize this enough. Sim guys are some of the nicest and most helpful people from all over the world.  The guy's at Assetto Corsa must love what they do and it shows.   Have fun. Paul			"

												Assetto Corsa is a realistic racing simulation game developed by Kunos Simulazioni. In Assetto Corsa you get behind the wheel of one of many realistically recreated cars ranging from the little Abarth 500 (upgraded version of the Fiat 500) to the beast that is the Pagani Zonda R. You'll push these cars to their limits as your storm around the tracks this game has to offer including the legendary Nurburgring (part of the Dream DLC Pack 1).Before I get to the main part of my review I want to point a few things out which have had an impact on my opinion of the game. Firstly, I'm not a racing sim expert, far from it in fact, most of my racing experience comes from the arcadey side of the genre so I'm less used to the level of realism found in AC. Secondly, I played using an Xbox 360 Gamepad rather than a wheel and pedals since I don't own a wheel. Thirdly, I own the Dream DLC Pack 1 so my review will include things only available as part of the DLC. Finally, I haven't followed the game through it's development and I've only played the most recent version which is v1.1.6.+Good graphics and visual effects+A good selection of cars which are all well modeled+A good variety of tracks including a laser-scanned Nurburgring +Quite a lot to do, including: drag races, solo track practices, time trial events, race weekends a career mode and much more +Surprisingly good controls for a Gamepad+A fair amount of customisation options for the cars in regards to tuning and paint jobs+Great sound effects for the cars+All of the cars, even different versions of the same car (e.g. a production model and a GT model), feel very different which makes driving each one unique to driving the others+It's very easy to get into for beginners like myself+A huge amount of mods+Lots of info displays which you can choose to use when racing+Despite AC being out of Early Access, Kunos are planning to continue adding more and more content to the game which can never be a bad thing+AC supports Oculus as well as three monitor setups, while I personally don't make use of these I know they're important features for a lot of people+Reasonably quick load times+/-Penalties feel a little too harsh to me but perhaps that's just because I'm not a racing sim buff-The AI are pretty bad, they seem to have a path which they absolutely have to take and don't feel at all like they're actual drivers which is what you would expect from a racing game. On top of this they're also very 'timid' when it comes to overtaking and unless you go off the track chances are they'll just stay behind you for the rest of the race-While you can change the time of DAY that your race takes place at there's no night time in the game which is rather disappointing-Weather effects go no further than clear skies, clouds of fog so there's no rain which is again, rather disappointing-The soft-body physics is really bad, doesn't look at all realistic, for example driving 150mp/h into a solid wall left my bumper with some small dents and scratches-The controls which can be bound to the Gamepad are very limited, for example you can't bind pause to your Gamepad so you have to reach over to the Esc key every time you want to pause which gets frustrating very quickly-The mouse cursor is always visible on screen, one my biggest pet peevsVerdict:For regular gamers - Worth Purchasing (8/10)For Racing sim veterans - A Must Have (8.5/10)A fantastic racing sim which can be enjoyed by those new to racing sims as well as veterans of the genre, though it's far from flawless. If you have any interest in racing games I suggest you pick this one up.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.			"

 Brief Introduction Assetto Corsa is undoubtedly one of the most popular racing simulators out there, despite all the good things and bad things from this game, I feel a bit half-half about this game.But before we get into the review lets go over what the developer had to say about Assetto CorsaOriginally posted by Devoloper of Assetto Corsa: Assetto Corsa features an advanced DirectX 11 graphics engine that recreates an immersive environment, dynamic lighthing and realistic materials and surfaces. The advanced physics engine is being designed to provide a very realistic driving experience, including features and aspects of real cars, never seen on any other racing simulator such as tyre flat spots, heat cycles including graining and blistering, very advanced aerodynamic simulation with active movable aerodynamics parts controlled in real time by telemetry input channels, hybrid systems with KERS (Kinetic energy recovery system) and energy recovery simulation. Extremely detailed with single player and multiplayer options, exclusive licensed cars reproduced with the best accuracy possible, thanks to the official cooperation of Car Manufacturers.  What I think about the Game  Pros… As a proper car simulator, I think you should be able to feel every little bit of the road, and with Assetto Corsa, you’re able to get that. The actual physics of this game is magnificent with a force-feedback wheel, this is achievable. With a decent wheel and pedal system, you are able to feel the understeer, the oversteer, even little bumps in the road – this means that you can feel it build up, and you know when you’re going to lose it. In this whole simulator aspect, I think this beats out its competitors, such as Project Cars. Despite losing out on graphics to Project Cars, it makes up in terms of physics and overall “realism” to the driving experience. The details put into the exterior and interior of cars, even moving parts of cars is phenomenal as well. As of the Japanese car pack, Assetto Corsa dives in and out of different car pop culture, whether you're on the touge tracks of Japan to the sweeping curves of Eau Rouge (Spa). To say the least, most other PC ""simulators"" only offer one or two cars per each region but Assetto Corsa hits the nail in the head in terms of variety. and Cons Being given this great first impression of realism makes me so reluctant to criticize this game, but once I dug deeper into my hundreds of hours of Assetto Corsa, these small missing details of a racing simulator starts to bother me more and more. Weather effects aren’t available in this game, like driving in the rain, and I think that as a racing simulator, it’s a must have. The AI isn’t that good, but neither is the AI in its competitors. Thus flags are a thing, but no marshals? Pit stops too, where are they in single player  is the realism in them?  It’s not like they don’t have it in motorsports. Where the crew changing your tires?  Where are your car jackers?  Where are your post-race celebrations? C’mon and you still call this a racing simulator. I want to see yellow flags going up when there are crashes half way around the circuit, I want marshals to be waving the blue flag so I can go “Hey Dan, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself because you’re♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I want the full enjoyment of your pit-crew working on your car. Developers, wake up, you might as well call them “Need for Speed: On the Track”. All the Assetto boiz are going to dislike this but it’s the truth. Overall Thoughts It’s a great simulator, great handling, great experience, but has way more things to improve on. If you’re going to label your game a “simulator”, don’t give us something half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and something that’s not complete.  Conclussion? Yes, despite all the downsides of the game, I think it's one of the best racing games, let alone racing simulators out there. But developers, get off your asses and do something about it. (If you found the review helpful, giving it a thumbs up would be nice!) If you're looking for more Steam Friends? Look no more - feel free to add me! Thus, hit me up if you want to play Assetto Corsa with meEdit1: A few gramatical errors.Edit2: Thanks @Inbekannt - pitstops are a thing now in Assetto Corsa, adjustments made to the reviewEdit3: Change to the review as of the implementation of the Japanese Car PackEdit4: Thanks @Boogle. silly vocabulary error.

												Having spent 500+ hours in the last 2.5 years, I can say this is easily the best racing game ever and a true successor to the GTR2 category. It is irritatingly realistic, requires a lot of practise and epic patience to get your laps right and comes closest to the real thing. Earlier versions had optimisation issues but now, Assetto Corsa is a charm and is a must-have for all car guys/racing fans. There is a sense of achievement when you get your laps/setups right.Pros-1. Physics are bang-on perfect! If you are looking for realism, this is as real as it can get!It has reached a point where its painfully real. For example- You set your toes and cambers to tune the cornering, it affects the temperatues (inside,outside and mid tread of tyre gets different temp) and the suspension reactions. You then fine tune the suspension which affects your previous toes/cambers. But mid-way you realise your height, spoilers, Anti-roll bars and spring stiffenss need adjustment which you are able to perfect but when you run a lap.... It has all went to waste because the last update (while being brilliant) offsets something else completely ruining your whole life.No corner is as easy as brakes, steer, accelerate out... You've to be aware about the tyre loading, temperatues, current fuel load and age of tyre before deciding on that ever-fluctuating time to brake and to steer.2. A huge array of cars and tracks. Fulfills every guy/girl/helicopter's need in terms of car choice- hatchbacks, small sports cars, japanese sports cars (the only DLC I refuse to buy), sedans, SUVs, vintage cars, vintage legends, supercars, hypercars, GT4, GT3, GT2 and F1. And believe me, each one of it has a completely different character and satisfies when you get it right. Tracks, I agree are just about enough but can seem limited at times. Solution? Download more through various concerned sites.3. Brilliant community support- A lot of fantastic mods are available, which are very welcome by the mod-friendly nature of the game. In addition, there are lots of racing leagues being organised very professionally by players (very much like iRacing).4. Very affordable pricing of the product! Even the DLC are completely affordable for even college students. I feel the 'Value for Money' factor is off the charts for Assetto Corsa.Cons-1. Career mode starts off from the basic hatchbacks races and progresses upto the Formula/GT series in a very slow fashion. Whilst, from a real life career POV is very real, gets really boring in 2-3 hours. I found it boring to establish expertise on FWD hatchbacks but it definitely helps you understand the basics of driving a car fast. This progression gives you the feeling of differences in street vs race cars.2. Engine sounds has always been a weakness of Assetto Corsa, which has improved upto a certain extent, yet still not on par with other racing games in the market. Solution? Mods! Available sound mods are simply brilliant and eradicate this issue completely. (Google ""Fonsecker"" if you want a jump start on sound mods)In competition-Assetto Corsa makes Codemasters' Formula 1 look as real as Mario Kart. Project cars which is 5 times as costly to buy (incl DLC) doesn't come anyway near in terms of realism; and Assetto Corsa doesn't come near PGC in terms of graphics. iRacing is the only real competitor to AC but loses out on pricing, that thing is damn expensive. NFS,drive,forza etc etc aren't in this league so no use comparing.All in all, just buy the game already, if you ready to learn racing from the ground up (even though you have won championships before), and if you have a lot of patience. There is nothing like Assetto Corsa. It is a step ahead of every other game else.			"

												if you want a true to life simulator of car dynamics and car physics then this is your game.if you want a simulator that perfectly captures each car's individual driving and handling feel as well as each car's individual engine note, this is your game.if you want a simulator that accurately models drivetrains, this is your game.AC with the bonus pack and both dream packs is an absolutely brilliant game, and with the 1.3 update brings new improved tyre models and physics along with reworked sound and some more polishing. cars feel incredibly planted with new tyre modeling (as should be the case on semi-slicks and slicks) and gain of grip/loss of grip works perfectly. it will only get better, and better. really the only thing that needs to be added is laserscan sebring and laguna seca along with a polished fully fledge career mode and its a 10/10 game. as of now its 9/10buy with confidence			"

												Went racing in September last year trying to go drifting. Failed miserably.Friend told me about how far racing steering wheels for games had come and how good everything was.Hadnt touched one since Colin McRae Rally on Playstation 1.Googled 'best drifting simulator' found Assetto Corsa. Sold spare set of wheels for race car, bought Logitech G92, game and graphics card for PC in December.Done nothing but sweet sweet Skids until Janurary. Got bored, discovered user created content and online play. Now I tandem with teams on small Japanese racetracks in LSX powered Silvias.Went back out on track in February, Killed it drifting.11/10 havent even tried to drive a normal car.			"

Early Access Review
								Did you ever drive a Ferrari in a racing game before? Of course you did, plenty of games in the past had Ferraris in their repertoire but the FERRARI 458 ITALIA in AC feels for me actually the very first time to drive one of these hot beautys. Easily playable with a thumbstick controller if you don`t have a proper wheel ready in your pocket.At the moment Assetto Corsa is in Beta which means it is a giant Tech Demo without the upcoming career mode, multiplayer and has no AI and physical damage yet but the AAA graphics (laser scanned tracks!), great handling and outstanding  sounds/effects makes me believe that we have here one of the best Driving Simulators coming up for a discount price till it`s release probably in 2014. Here you have Life for Speed, rFactor and iRacing mixed together to an excellent and amazing racing game. This game is simply superb! Not only for sim fans :)			"

Early Access Review
								This is my first Steam review; I hadn't felt much inclined to really write one before now, but after 100+ hours on Assetto Corsa I feel compelled to. I'm definitely a car game enthusiast, and Assetto Corsa is the best racing simulation I have ever played. No other game, in my opinion, comes close to conveying such a sense of how it really must feel to drive these cars. Assetto Corsa has nice graphics and sounds, but it's the laser scanned tracks and an advanced physics model that really set it apart. To provide specific ideas as to what this means, weight transfer is beautifully conveyed, the way the cars behave makes sense, and you are driving on surfaces that virtually exactly match reality. Something I really enjoyed for example was how the same cars handling varies with tyre choice. Take a street tyre for example, you will feel the tyre roll and the car slide relatively easily and quite predictably. Put on a racing compound however and you now feel the car chassis working harder, and when the grip does give out the slide is much more dramatic and less easy to control. There is huge depth and many hours to enjoy exploring such aspects, without it ever becoming frustrating or unintuitive. Assetto Corsa is still 'early access' as I write this, but there is already a promising and welcoming community, and plenty of good content, with more coming in the form of additional manufacturer and track licenses. This is a must have for any driving enthusiasts game library.			"

												It's difficult to write a review for Assetto Corsa as it means you need to think about the game and thinking about the game just makes me want to play it right away. Assetto Corsa. This is a simulation game and the learning curve reflects that, you learn to drive each car as they're all very different.There's a great selection of cars and a good selection of tracks with quite a lot more to come from the Assetto Corsa team.Visually the game is stunning, the level of detail both inside and out of the vehicles is truely wonderful. The tracks look realistic and there's isn't this over exposed lighting or over the top effects that you see in a lot of so called simulation racing games.  The enviroments in Assetto Corsa  look clean, crisp and believable.  There's the option to enter photo mode and mess around with the direction of the sun, field of view, focus levels, light levels and some pre-set filters, it's well executed and gives you the chance to get the perfect screenshot. The tracks are laser scanned for that ever so more realistic driving simulation, this applies to the ""Next Generation"" tracks but not the ""Historic"" ones. The physics engine is great, it acts how you would expect it to and every curb and bump on the track has a direct affect on your car. The force feed back is amazing, it lets you know exactly how your car is handling and it all adds up to an immersive racing simulation that brings a smile to your face. In Assetto Corsa you go from sliding off the track at every corner to setting decent lap times, pushing yourself that bit more each lap and it's a very rewarding experience. There's a ton of game options ranging from practice, challenges, race, online and all with sub categories.With enough driving assist options for any level of player, full traction control, full anti-locking brakes, 100% stability control and all adjustable from full to completely off. As you would expect for a PC game there's enough visual options so you can get the frame rates set to what suits you best.I use a R7 265 2GB graphics card and never dipped below 65FPS, 1080P with a custom settings, anti-aliasing x2, anisotropic filtering x8 and high to maximum details, so I would say this game is very well optimised.There's full key mapping for keyboard, steering wheel, pedals and xbox 360 controllers. I would recommend a steering wheel with force feed back as it's so much better. The main menu system is fast and easy to use. The menu system when you're driving is great, you can a choose a huge amount of options ranging from gear indicator to suspension physics and you have the option to drag them and place them where you would like.I feel overall the sounds in this game are very nice, there are a few cars which sound too digital to me but I've never driven them so it would be unfair to judge. The A.I for me is pretty good, there's been a few tweaks to make them better and with the original Assetto Corsa content (Not mods) the A.I does a great job of doing consistent lap times as well as being smart enough to avoid crashing and give a good challenging driving experience. Even at 80% difficulty which is there lowest setting they are pretty fast. The modding community is on fire with this game, obviously some mods are poorly done but there's also some that are on par with what the Assetto Corsa development team have created and that's saying a lot because they do superb work. Cars, tracks, textures, Ui, there's pretty much a mod out there for everything. There's still a few issues with this game that need to be addressed in order to make it the full on simulation game. Pit stops only work in multi player and still need to be tweaked, there's no flag system yet but there is small mod for it and the penalty system is really awful and needs to be removed and rethought. The option for weather and night time driving would be a great touch but it's not something that's game breaking.9/10. Grazie Kunos Simulazioni, Grande lavoro.			"

												Assetto Corsa is, to me, the shell of a perfect racing game, and with more time and money I can see it being a truly incredible product.The physics, handling, track quality and as such, general racing immersion of AC is a level above other racing titles like Forza, Gran Turismo, or Project Cars. RFactor may offer better physics, I haven't tried it.AC may be behind some of the above on graphics and AI, and is definitely behind Forza and GT on car and track selection, and the depth of the career mode.So you have to figure out what you want in a game, due you want fidelity to real life, with accurate simulation of each car, precise aerodynamic and drivetrain calculations and laser scanned tracks, or do you want to be able to drift around corners without sacrificing lap times? Do you want a false sensation of speed, or an accurate introduction to cornering and car weight distribution? Do you want top level AI and reward intensive career progression, or are you happy endlessly lapping empty tracks, looking for slight improvements in your cornering technique.I much prefer the later, but I don't mean to disparage those who enjoy the former. I've spent my last 30hrs in game lapping one track (Zandvoort in the Netherlands), with one car (the McLaren 650S GT3) and the experience has been hugely enjoyable as I try to approach race car driver speeds (which I'm sure I'm far off, currently only the 5th fastest on RSR for that combination). The feel of laser scanned track through the force feedback is incredible, the handling dynamics superb and the complexity and precision of high-speed racing is endlessly fascinating to me.If you want to genuinely feel the sensation of racing a well modelled 458, or a McLaren P1, or a GT3 or F1 car through Spa, or the Nurnburgring, this is a near perfect way to do it (short of somehow renting one!)If you're a fan of driving, buy AC and invest in developing technique. If you're a fan of arcade style multiplayer, or the quick fun of frantic drifting buy something else.Highly recommended, from someone looking forward to the new car releases in May and June. If they can add some American and Japanese tracks, expand the list of road cars, continue to tinker with the AI, and maybe, eventually, develop a solid career mode, then this will be a perfect racing game.

												DISCLAMER! This review is based on my experience using a Xbox controller. (63 hours so far)Graphics (car): Very detailed.Graphics (environment): Not great but passable and enjoyable. Performance: Runs great on i7 4790k + 970 (80FPS+ on high setting)Sound: Let this speak for itself (youtube) Force feedback (controller): Even with a controller I have sense of control on how my car behaves on the road.""Damage"": The physics isn't great when you bump into things it feels like playing bumper cars. (youtube) and the car damage are mostly scratches.Single player + AI: Single player is great and with many challenging modes. However, when you are racing against AI they will pretend not to see you and hit you.Multiplayer: The community is awesome. Everyone wants to race but every now and then someone will try to ram you on purpose.Multiplayer (server browser/host): Easy to host but no steam integration. Expect a lot of EU servers. DLC: Might seem overpriced at first but completely worth. Tons of high quality cars and tracks.Overall, great sandbox racing simulator.			"

												version 1.0.0 just dropped.  It brings new vehicles, maps and a completely overhauled sound system as well as better vehicle damage, better mechanics and handling, overall the game feels ""miles"" better compared to the previous versions! Well done Kunos. ohh and career mode is now availible to play... this game is honestly a steal, for the price to content ration!TLDR: Everything that could have been improved, was improved......Edit: AC is no longer in ""early access"", more career missions have been released to further the game aswell as tweaked mechanics on some vehicles, and a hint at future licensed vehicles to come.Every corner in the game you take, you always get a shot of adrenaline, you can never know if you are going to fast that you might spin out, or just that perfect speed that would end up giving you a an advantage on your ever soo close opponent that is trailing right behind you.

												After spending 150 hours in Project Cars, I decided to buy this.. so this is more of a comparison than a review.. or both? The first thing I noticed was how much different the FFB feels. It's difficult to explain, but I'll try. It feels much closer to driving a real car. There's a wider ""soft zone"" than in PCars, as PCars tends to feel fairly stiff even with the smallest movements. You can turn down FFB strength on PCars to compensate, but this makes some of the more dramatic turns feel ""off"" or too weak. Assetto Corsa gives a more balanced and dynamic feeling throughout the various turn radiuses. You also feel everything on the road to the slightest detail and the laser scanned tracks add even more detail to this. (Also the grass actually feels like grass, sand like sand, and your car slides appropriately! In PCars the grass is like quick sand.) Overall, it just feels right.The car handling and physics also feel more akin to a real vehicle. Because of this, I found the driving more intuitive and found myself making more consistent laps. The game feels much more stable as well. I haven't encountered any bugs and even in VR it runs silky smooth. PCars can be pretty glitchy and unreliable, both in the physics and sound.. making it pretty frustrating sometimes. Drifting of course is far better in Assetto Corsa, (not even comparable, honestly) which is what I'm going to spend most of my time doing personally. I don't really see much point of going back and playing PCars other than to play with a friend who doesn't own this game. My only gripe is that I can't tune my vehicles to the precision I'd like, this may be a misunderstanding on my part because I've seen videos of people tuning (for example) their toe out to 1. (Maybe an update took this out?) I can only do increments of 5 or 10 with the same vehicle. If there's a way to choose any number, please let me know.			"

												From the outset I would just like to say I do own Project Cars and have at the time of writing 630+ hours but only 16 hours of Assetto Corsa (Just bought it).People say that AC's more accurate physics simulation over pCars features and looks makes it the better purchase but I beleive that some compromise between AC and pCars would make for a more rounded and enjoyable simulation-bPhysicsIMO the physics of Assetto Corsa tend to lean quite heavily on understeer (much like Grand Turismo) and pCars on oversteer. It feels as though every car wants to understeer... but the result of this is that Assetto Corsa rewards you more for precise and smooth driving whereas pCars you can generally chuck the car around and achieve ridiculous lap-times.In terms of braking I managed to get the settings at a somewhat decent level but the fact that you cannot adjust brake pressure (or disk size) is quite debilitating. The braking quite often feels... mushy-mushy-mushy-FULL LOCK and so you are severly punished for not using ABS (which at factory level is simulated quite well). pCars on the other hand better handles progressive braking however it's too rare that you lock your wheels (which is unrealistic). Assetto Corsa though does a better job at simulating the impact of flat-spotting your tires.The default setup on AC seems to be heavily biased towards the front brakes and so you will almost always lock the fronts rather than the rears. But I immediately noticed in AC I felt way more comfortable trail-braking than in pCars.In pCars I felt I had a better idea of what needed to be changed in the setup in order to drive faster or smoother whereas with AC you can't really see or feel the difference in two setups you can only judge them by laptimes. AC doesn't quite have the level of detail when it comes to tuning your cars and the impact seems less emphasised.FFBThis has been constantly praised as far better than pCars but it is hard to describe why because it is based on feeling. As with pCars the default FFB isn't great and so it will take a short while to get it to feel how you want but AC has a great custom app that will adjust the FFB strength on a per car basis on the fly. AC also has the advantage that you can creat a .lut curve to adjust the linearity of your wheels motor. pCars however has a greater range of options for FFB which can be a blessing and a curse. When I first started playing AC I couldn't shake the idea that something was missing in the feel through FFB and it took me a while but I realised it was the body of the car. pCars feels as though you have the road-->tires-->springs/suspension-->steering wheel whereas AC seems to skip the springs part. The result is you feel a disconnect between you and the car and the game ends up feeling clinical. You also don't visually see any roll in the body of the car (more later).UndersteerIn terms of understeer you can add the enhanced understeer option which is a great indicator through the FFB but I feel that it hampers your ability to try and correct and at times the understeer feels like your set in it. You can turn that feature off though and understeer is pretty much the same as pCars. OversteerOversteer on the other hand is completely different. with pCars you can sometimes feel locked into a spin and correcting it is almost impossible whereas AC the oversteer is more progressive and you can feel the different stages of slip and you can correct it far easier and it feels more intuitive getting the car back straightened out.BrakingAC does a better job of brake rumble and you can feel more accurately when the wheels are locking up and so you can adjust your braking. In comparison pCars you only know when you've locked up your wheels when you try to steer and nothing happens (except in an open-wheeler where you can tell by looking .)AccelerationThis might come up again later but I feel as though pCars gives you a better sense through FFB of acceleration effects so even if you weren't looking you could better tell whether you are going quickly or slowly.Track SurfaceIMO the differences aren't that significant but I do feel that pCars has overdone the bumps a little whereas AC is a little more subtle and realistic but then again pCars the feel of the bumps differs based on springs and dampers whereas I haven't yet detected that in AC.VisualsThis one should be quite quick, it is more of a subjective category but I do feel pCars looks so much better and specifically more involving.In terms of the track pCars has AC licked it feels better seeing the trees and waving flags but a pretty track does not a good sim make.The cars in AC from the inside feel fake and a bit two dimensional, they have nothing on pCars and look only slightly better than something Codemasters would do which is a little disappointing because they have Ferrari and Lamborghini. The result of this is you start to feel detached (a word that keeps coming) from the game and more like a casual observer rather than feeling as though you are in the car. [I will say that I do not have VR and that is probably going to render the previous sentence moot]The outside of the  car is really no better, they look arcade-y and again it's not such a big deal but with cool brands in the game it is a little bit of a let down.One thing I find quite important is the camera shake and movement (especially look to apex) I think this is something AC definitely needs to work on as pCars gets it right and AC is too sterile resulting in you not feeling the speed of the car you are driving. In pCars you get a sense of rush and anticipation when trying to spot the braking zone because everything is speeding past you so quickly. In AC you can only really get an idea of your speed by looking at the speedometer.ContentCarsThis one is a little more tough. pCars has many more tracks and Cars by default and so the range is a little more extensive and I imagine when pCars2 comes out this divide will only grow larger. However, AC has those exclusive cars like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Fiat and Alfa Romeo (which Jeremy Clarkson says is the ultimate Petrol head's car maker.) and most importantly I think Lotus road cars.AC tends to lean more on road cars (like Grand Turismo) but I think pCars has a better more vast selection of Race Class Vehicles.TrackspCars has more tracks for sure and has more of the race tracks we all know quite well but I don't think it has more or less variety than AC in terms of the type of tracks. AC does however have a nice drift playground.The most important thing in terms of content though is that AC is far easier to mod and so there is a literal boatload of Cars and Tracks you can download. Again this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt as the quality of the mods are not all that great where as if you get MDMT's modded vehicles for PCars; the quality is absolutely mind-blowing for a mod (but they take a while to make).FeaturesBoth have career modes done differently - AC is more like Grand Turismo the careers are a mix of challenges and races whereas pCars simulates a drivers journey through the ranks with race contracts offered based on performance in your class. I much prefer practice (QRW) on pCars as you can drive a setup and pop into the pits with your tires still warm and grab a bit more fuel and that creates more motivation for longevity during practice mode. AC has a quite disappointing pit system.ConclusionI recommend both this and pCars the choice is up to you, do you need to own both? No. Should you buy both? I say yes.Overall my impression is that AC is more accurate but far less involving and exciting. AC can feel a bit bland in regards to content and overall feel. Buy AC to hone your racing skills but buy pCars to have fun.			"

												I was a GTR, GTR2, GTR 2 Power and Glory mod, rFactor, rFactor 2 kind of guy. After watching the alpha previews of Assetto Corsa back in the day, I was skeptical about the sim. I had my rFactor 2 pride and was proud to be on rF2. After a considerable number of months later, I picked up Assetto Corsa... I kind of got tired of the slow development of rF2 and wanted to try something different. It took many hours of fine tuning my FFB and learning the good mods from the bad mods. The cars at first seemed so much easier to master than in rF2. After many updates later, Assetto Corsa improved the physics, optimized the graphics, and continued to develop new and different class cars; all of which has enhanced my experience with the sim.Assetto Corsa is my go to racing sim. The sound can always use some improvement, but overall, the total experience is very pleasing. Furthermore, the modding community is HUGE, and there is always something new to try or fall in love with. Back in the day, the Lambo Miura was a fantastic mod, and then it became a part of the official car list.  The mods such as  the Mazda 787B continues to impress me, the Virtua Simulazoni cars, the IER cars, the Rally Legend Cars, and all the fantastic tracks make this sim almost priceless.I have uninstalled all other racing games and now focus solely on Assetto Corsa. If I am not racing, then I am most likely cruising on Lake Louise or Nordschleife in the Miura, Countach, GT40, Shelby Cobra, RUF Yellowbird, and when I want to speed around Tokyo city on the c1 Shuto Expressway I drive the JDM pack cars. There is a little bit of heaven for everyone in Assetto Corsa, just my review...			"

Early Access Review
								Although this simulator is still only in its Beta stage (0.6.2 at the time of writing), the body of work that this small Italian game developer, Kunos Simulazioni, has managed to produce is truly breath taking, especially when you consider just how small they are. I'm talking 10 people: small, and with heaps more mouth watering content on the way with bi-weekly updates in the lead up to the full release of v1.0, Assetto Corsa has the potential to become the best racing simulator ever produced. Physics:Kunos have spent countless hours on developing and refining the physics engine to produce the most realistic driving experience that money can buy. Using sensors on various places on real world cars, they can accurately replicate the technical sides of the car. They're also receiving feedback from real professional racing drivers as to how particular cars handle on certain tracks. Which leads me on to tracks. Kunos are using laser scanning technology, so every bump, camber and curb will be near enough identical to their real world counterparts. There are the odd glitch or two with sticky curbs and such, but this is to be expected with this being still a relatively early build, and will thus be ironed out. ... Oh yeah, did I mention that they're releasing a laserscanned version of the Nordschliefe in September? Because they're doing that... Yeah. Anyone who knows anything about motorsport or sim racing should know how big of a deal this is, because it's never been done before by any gaming company... Ever. Graphics:The visuals are pretty decent. There are some situations where it doesn't look that great; with jagged edges and a few poorly textured surfaces, and other times where the game looks absolutely stunning. The game gives great ""bang for your buck"", in that you don't need a $100,000 super computer to play it, and still have a great looking game (**Cough**Project CARS **Cough**).  In fact even when some of the settings are set to ""low"", it still looks good.  For example, the cube map resolution takes a massive chunk of performance if you have it set to ""high"", but on ""medium"" or ""low"" it still looks brilliant and you get a huge boost in FPS. Audio:The sounds, like the graphics are also really good. I'd say they're probably second best behind Race Room: Racing Experience. As with the physics, Kunos have tried to accurately represent how each car sounds with microphones and various other pickups to get each car to sound very distinct. They've also managed to implement backfiring and overrun gurgling, which is a first that I've encountered, and it is joyous. Whether it be the whirring turbo of the KTM X-Bow, or the completely bonkers twin-turbocharged V8 in the Ferrari F40 (which quite frankly is just a scary car to drive), this is some of the best sounding cars I've ever heard in a video game. Although the BMW Z4 GT3 isn't quite right, as it's slightly too high pitched and needs a deeper gargling growl that the BMW cars tend to have. Final Take: Physics: 9/10 Graphics: 7.5/10Audio: 8/10 Kunos have created a beast. And when multiplayer drops, watch out iRacing, these boys are coming for you.			"

												My story:I think one of the first things that people ask about this game is do you need a wheel to play it. I can say that no you dont need one to enjoy the game; however, having one brings a whole new level of depth to playing it. I started out playing this game on a keyboard, that's right a keyboard, and there was not a second that i did not enjoy it. Then i switched to a controller and the game got even better. Faster laps, more precision, the game just became a ton of fun.Recently i was privileged to try the game on a wheel and i can thoroughly say that this game is as authentic as it can get as far as the driving experience in a video game is concerned.Edit: I've now put a couple hundred hours in with my own wheel and I think the most memorable moment from that entire time is when I first plugged in my own wheel and ran my car off a curb. I was in awe, it felt like I had actually just driven off a curb. The force Feedback is insanely accurate.Let's talk about graphics:Sure this game doesnt have amazing graphics where your wheel is gonna go in a different direction than the car, but that isnt something that you need to notice because after about 2 minutes in a car you are immersed in how your car handles and how fast you need to take the next corner. Also when you're going by the trees at lets say 250kmh there really isnt time to look at them :P As far as the tracks are concerned they are phenomenal, lazer scanning is such a huge plus and they're going back to update some of the original tracks.DLC:THEY HAVE A PORSCHE PARTNERSHIP, 12 Years away from any serious racing simulators and this company got it. If that doesn't speak for this country i'm not sure what does. Sure it's a little extra but its so worth it, i mean the DLC is priced incredibly well less than $10 per pack that comes loaded with content.. All three of the dream packs are stunning and they give free content along with the update, and i dont really know of any other company that gives anything away for free. This company has just as much passion as many of the people that play the game. They are currently striving to include some of the most iconic vehicles and tracks out there.Mods:There are countless mods for this game and although not all of them are the best there are some REALLY good ones out there that are on par with Kunos' content.Multiplayer: People complain about the AI a lot, but let's be honest if you're racing the AI you shouldnt even buy this game. This game was built for an online experience and with over 800 servers up 24/7 there is always one that you can find with tons of people, or you can find an empty one for you and your friends to race on. It's also very easy to host your own server from your computer, the game comes with the files to make managing what content you want on it so easy. Theres always a server for whatever mood youre in.THERE ARE SERVERS WITH DRIVER RANKINGS SO YOU DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH TROLLSI say that in caps because a lot of people complain about that, but it really isnt an issue. Those people are just butthurt.I 100% recommend this game, it's a whole lot of fun even if you dont have a wheel. A controller at least is a good point to start with. A keyboard is doable but it takes a lot of time and finger cramping. Hope this was helpful :D			"

												First off, the game is amazing. I got this game when it was in early stages, and purchased all the dream packs that there were; I think the total cost for everything at the time was like 60 bucks. Although now you can get the base game with like 20 cars or something like that included with your 30 bucks. Okay, now let me talk about the pros and cons.  Pros:  Amazing Graphics Amazing Cars (Whether You Get The Dream Packs or Not) Supports The Rift and Vive for VR Supports 4k, Multi Monitors, and Gaming Chairs Amazing Simulation Works Great With G27 Force Feed Back Wheel Car Tweeking And of Course Much More for You to Find Out Cons: Very Expensive With all the Dream Packs Not Many Different Seasons and Forms of Precipitation Single Player is Limited but Still Fun And not Much More     Hope fully you thought my review was helpful, definitely hit the thumbs up on the helpful icon...Thanks:)     Also Im open to Friend requests btw...

Posted: September 10, 2015
												I've taken 2 years to finally write a proper review of Assetto Corsa, to try to like it and write a positive review. But I've been let down, so there goes a thumbs-down review.Assetto Corsa came out almost 3 years ago as an Early Access release for a reasonable price taking into account the amount of bugs, lack of content and everything that an uncompleted game brings. The title got a quick nice response from users for its remarkably detailed physics and the absolutely superb work on cars and tracks modelling, being the tracks laser-scanned. Another positive point well welcomed by the community is the full mod compatibility, which extends the possibilities of the game in terms of content and personalisation to amazement. Kunos though are a very small developing team which has worked so hard to release new tracks and circuits, all of them officially licensed by brands, and refined the game architecture to add capabilities, fix bugs and improve and optimize graphics and performance. All this work is released slowly, drop by drop, long time between, but at least they release it.This year though they decided to get the game out of Early Access, and with a nice full-price tag of double the initial price. The game itself works smoothly, quite well optimised (don't trust the minimum GTX460 required, you can run it with a GT540 easily) and with full compatibility with any wheel or pad. Where's the problem then?As said before, the amount of content is alarmingly low. After some years the number of cars and tracks hasn't increased much and the variety isn't quite wide really. You have the full Lotus catalogue and most Ferraris, and then a few other cars like a McLaren MP4/12C and its GT3 version and some other road cars. Don't misunderstand me, having such fleet of Ferraris and some of the fasterst road cars is rather coool. But the problem is that they end up being all the same. All the Lotus cars are similar, Lotus cars are similar to some other featured cars, Ferraris are similar to the other high performance cars... After all, you have an acceptable amount of models, but you can summarise them in a few. There isn't a car that outstands among the others, or different types of cars like go-karts or more motorsport disciplines. In fact, you can differentiate 4 categories: F1 cars, Supersports cars, Sportscars and Abarth. I've driven every single car released and it's like that. Despite that, with the first non-beta release a DLC came out, which adds the Nordschleife and ten cars, which again you can summarise in 4 new real additions. And for a price of 14,99€, right after having paid 49.99€ for a game that seriously lacks content. Unreasonable. The game is limited to hotlapping. AI is just unraceable because it will just stick to the racing line. Make a move and they'll bump into you as if your car wasn't there. Rival cars will never make a mistake nor get corner-cutting penalties, which you get every time you put a single wheel outside the tarmac and that slows you down to 50kph. Practice and Hotlap sessions are fun though, they feel as if you were actually there driving on a client run. The entire circuit for yourself, just you and your car. Actually it's fun, especially using a wheel. It ends up challenging yourself to beat your lap time, but after some laps it gets boring...Although it's been announced as out of Early Access, the game itself proves it is just the same as before. Only fully playable mode is hotlapping and you can only play on dry track and not at night. The fun part of this game is pushing against the clock to beat your lap times, but if you can only race in the same weather and light conditions the challenging aspect of the game is lost as soon as you have lapped a few times every circuit.Online was released in mid Early Access and it was reasonable and justified that it didn't work at all. Later updates made it more stable and raceable, but nowhere near from easy to use. It worked with a ""booking"" system. There's a server list with the race info (players, ping, track and cars allowed). Those which are post/pre-race are open for around 5 minutes for people to join by ""booking"" an entry on the race. There's not even a matchmaking room, you just click the ""booking"" button and wait 5 minutes to play, although most times when the countdown ended the server would just crash and force you to book again. If you manage to enter a race room, it is most of the times empty.Bad part of this is that despite being claimed ""1.0 version, full release"" the multiplayer keeps just the same.Mods are more or less easy to find. There are portals and forums which have the Mods and Download sections and uploaders generally have a decent knowledge on the matter, so their work is usually nice although don't expect to find everything you're looking for because most of the mods get banned for copyright and licensing. The game though isn't very respectful with mods. After an update you may find that none of the mods you downloaded are compatible, and as they're mods they don't auto-update. Annoying stuff if you have a large collection of mods.In the technical aspect, Assetto Corsa is close to brilliant. It may not have rainy weather, or night racing, or a proper damage system, or headlights that actually work or breathtaking graphics effects, but the attention to physics has no rival. Aero effects, weight balance, force feedback... Absolutely amazing. If we take a look at updates changelogs, most of the updates have to do with these things. Handling then will be completely realistic, tricky as it should be.It is not at all playable with gamepad though, but this game is a simulator so it's rather ""dumb"" to play with anything different from a wheel, which works perfectly once set up. The base is solid and really promising, but the lack of content is a fact to consider. Not only that, the gameplay is limited and lacks basic functions. I don't want to compare this game with another one because it's not fair and every game is different on it's own, but Assetto Corsa isn't the best option for a race simulator right now. I'd say it's better to wait until more content is released, but I've done that for a long time and it's becoming hopeless. It's not fair to double the price of the game when it has almost the same things that you had when it was Early Access. Not to mention the DLC...*PATCH EDIT*2 more DLC...4.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								When I looked at AC, I was unsure if it would be for me. I liked the idea of a racing sim, but I came from the F1 201x, GT5/6 games on the PS3 so was unsure if it would be too technical for my liking....and frankly too hard.Well, I'm so glad I bought it.  I initially got the Technology Preview for buying NetKar Pro for a few quid, but the early access was far more fun than I thought it would be.  The game has constantly been developed by Kunos with regular updates (every 2 weeks) and now multiplayer is out it's made it even better.  I started with a DFGT but purchased the T500RS and TH8 shifter just for AC. It was a good investment in my eyes as it brings the cars to life.  The Lotus 49 around Monza 66 is my favourite, and it's such a beast to handle - but great fun in trying!Handling - This blows any console game out of the water. I bought Race 07 and that doesn't come close to AC.  I haven't been able to try pCars.  The FFB is superb, and I can only hope they continue to improve this. If you have cold tires with a heavy fuel load, you really notice the difference in turn 1 compared to low fuel warm tire runs.Sound - This could be better.....and will be!  AC recently mentioned they will use a new audio method for a better experience.  It's still pretty good as it is, I can't complain as I still think it's good.Cars - Whilst there are a lot less cars to other games out there, it takes so much time to get really good with the cars I just don't care. There are some car's I've hardly driven as other cars get me hooked.Tracks - The bumps in the tracks are something else. You play F1 and it feels like you are driving on a perfectly smooth track. You go around the Nurburgring on AC and you have to work for a decent time and learn where some bumps are to avoid (or use for better traction).Multiplayer - There are tonnes of servers up. It's easy to host a private lobby but you do need to be comfortable playing with config files as there is no GUI yet in the game.  Most tracks allow 20 cars.  Lag isn't too bad either, I regularly play against someone in New Zealand when our server is in the UK. It's not perfect, but it's raceable and far better than other games I've played online.  On the down side the options are pretty limited as MP is in the Alpha phase.What else is in the game:AI RacesTime Challenge (where you have to reach a checkpoint within a time period)HotlapDrag Race (AI only atm)Race WeekendsSpecial EventsDrifting (I've not done this as I'm turd at it)Mods - There are loads of mods out there already. Hotlap leaderboards, car skins, tyres wear/temp mods, nicer GUI's, and tracks!  Whilst they aren't as good as the offical tracks, it makes the future very bright for AC.  Like any MP game, it's better if you have a good community to race with.  I do @ www.acracers.com.Frankly, this is my favourite game period. I enjoy other genres, but this game keeps me coming back for more.			"

  Category Score Notes   Visuals 9 One of the prettiest racing games out there, Assetto Corsa can look nearly lifelike with the right post-processing settings. At dawn or dusk, the amount of detail is nothing short of stunning and the available photo mode makes it easy to capture wallpaper-worthy screenshots. Shortcomings include a lack of weather system and the relatively bare scenery at some tracks.   Sound 7 The quality of the sound varies from car to car. Some delight your ears with crackles and pops and whines while others leave you feeling disappointed, though one has to remember not every car sounds exciting in real life. Developers have stated they are still working on improving sound assetts and the sound engine.   Physics 9 Few racing games can match Assetto Corsa when it comes to physics. Suspension, tires, track surface, and more are all accurately modeled to offer the most realistic driving experience possible, short of the real thing. Naturally, this does mean you'll want to play with a wheel to enjoy the full experience.   Force Feedback 8 Force feedback is always going to be subject to opinion as not everyone agrees on what it should be doing. Assetto Corsa's version does a good job of communicating weight transfer but can fall short when it comes to fine detail. Overall, it's easy to know what the car is doing and anyone who spends a few minutes configuring their settings should have a good time.   Cars 10 Assetto Corsa features 69 cars at the time of this review, with more being added regularly. LaFerrari with a functioning KERS system, working active aerodynamics on the Pagani Huyara, and even McLaren P1 software updates that affect rear wing behavior are just a few examples of the painstaking amount of effort Kunos Simulazioni has put into the details of every car in this game.   Tracks 9 17 tracks are currently featured in the game, all of which are recreated down to the smallest bumps, cracks, and camber changes thanks to laser-scanning technology, including the famed Nürburgring Nordschleife. The total selection is relatively low but that's the price you pay for quality - quality that makes the driving come alive when combined with the excellent physics.   Multiplayer 7 The multiplayer can suffer from trolls and bad drivers like every other simracing title that supports open races. That being said, the netcode is solid and the multiplayer experience can be excellent if you choose to join an organized league. Unless you're willing to shell out lots of money for iRacing, Assetto Corsa is almost as competitive as it gets in this category, though it's a shame the community gets fragmented with each new DLC.   AI 3 The AI in Assetto Corsa can best be described as ""serviceable."" It's there and it can drive pretty fast if you let it, but it combines a tendency to carelessly crash into the player with (oddly) over-caution. It's quite easy to block them while ahead but if you get them off the racing line, they almost always do everything in their power to return to it regardless of the consequences.   Career 3 It's difficult to enjoy the career with the AI in its current state. It can feel quite repetitive without giving you any sense of accomplishment. A handful of races are impossible to win even with world record lap times and others are quite easy to dominate despite being on the same difficulty setting. Some series also advertise ""race weekends"" without actually offering them.   Mods 9 Assetto Corsa is currently the hotbed for simracing mods. If the game doesn't already feature a car or track you want, it's probably on a website somewhere or soon will be. You can mod everything from the cars, tracks, and sounds to the menu, HUD, and career. The downside is that the developers will sometimes update the game in a way that break mods until they too are updated.   Overall 8.5 If you're looking for a hotlap simulator or a platform for league racing, then Assetto Corsa is second to none (or at least it will be when it gets a proper spectator/replay system). Casual pickup multiplayer racing is still entirely worth the money, but you'll probably want to skip the purchase if offline AI racing is the main thing you're interested in.  "

								This game saved me a fortune - for just £29.99, I now know I can't drive that Lotus Evora S I've always wanted. While I limit myself to a Mondeo, anyone else who wants a racing sim will be impressed with the current build state.You can also import your own tracks and cars, and tweak literally everything. It looks and drives great, but needs a Golliath of a PC to run this at the highest physics and graphics detail - as you would expect for a game built to use all that extra PC power available to it over a console.

												Kunos Simulazioni came under a lot of criticism from most sim racers for their previous title NetKar Pro, but they have learned from that experience as Assetto Corsa is an outstanding racing simulation. The early release of Assetto Corsa has satiated the long awaited sim racing community, as the beta and bi-weekly updates kept everyone satisfied. Sim racing fans will argue about who has the best tyre modelling, most accurate tracks, physics and visuals, but Assetto Corsa has managed to take all that and package it up in one great racing sim, with a top-notch physics and sublime tyre modelling, spending time with each car you will appreciate the nuances of the physics each vehicle has to offer. The visuals speak for themselves, crisp, clean and easy on the eye. The tracks are accurately modelled and replicated from laser scan data. The force feedback, even after logging on a solid amount of hours, is appreciable with subtle feeling still surprising me.On top of the regular developer created content, Assetto Corsa already has lively modding scene, making third party tracks and cars, so the future is really bright for this sim and I don't doubt most will still be playing this in years to come.With a great core, Kunos Simulazioni has proven that they have built Assetto Corsa into a successful racing simulator.

												All things come to him who waits. I have this game since it's early access version, 0.4 or so, and always liked AC's physics, because of it's balance. Anybody can drive a car, even the most powerful one, but going on the edge, barely under control, that's something few can master. This is where Assetto Corsa shines. If I had to point out one thing, why you should definitely try it - that would be the pure driving experience. Take a car of your preference, cruise it, push it, race it. You will have fun either way. Furthermore, each update and DLC proves, that Kunos Simulazioni is a very consistent group of people, who are passionate about cars and aim to make Assetto Corsa the best car game in the world. It may sound crazy, yet the sanity of the plan is of no consequence, because they really can do it.			"

								At first glance it's just another racing sim. At the first drive I was cursing I had just done my money on another poorly built sim. I jumped on the Steam forums to voice my displeasure and discovered the ""problem"" was entirely mine. I needed to set it up properly. So I researched, dug around and found all I needed.Some tweaking and testing, fiffling and faffing..... And WOW!!! My first lap in a BMW M3 GT2 at Monza had me in awe. My second lap had me raptures. By my 3rd lap I asked for Assetto Corsa to marry me.I'm fussy. I'm picky. I hate lazy coders and slackware and this, THIS, at alpha (really??) has the potential for AAA from a small team. Plenty to do and lots of cars and tracks already. No issues, fast GFX, absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing amazing physics and awesome sound (inside cockpit GT2 - eargasms!!!!)Goes amazing with FFB on a G27 - as yet I'm voicing opinion as I am waiting for my G27 to arrive. Yep. It made me spend more money - within minutes of playing it. And there's a reason for that.It's a must if you like fast. MUST. No if's, no buts.MUST. Get it. You. Yes......			"

Nikki Lauda's Ferrari 312, Sennas' Lotus 98T? Doesn't impress you still? Ferrari 458 italia on Imola trying to beat Stig's time (yes, theres an achievement for it). How about ""THE PHYSICS ARE GREAT"" then? Forget your arcades like Gran Turismo, Forza, NFS Shifts and GTR evolutions, this is a simulation, and it's a great one at that. If you own a wheel and a PC it's either this or Project Cars... why not both?			"

												* Written a week after the 1.5 update.Assetto Corsa is, to me, the shell of a perfect racing game, and with more time and money I can see it being a truly incredible product.The physics, handling, track quality and as such, general racing immersion of AC is a level above other racing titles like Forza, Gran Turismo, or Project Cars. RFactor may offer better physics, I haven't tried it.AC may be behind some of the above on graphics and AI, and is definitely behind Forza and GT on car and track selection, and the depth of the career mode.So you have to figure out what you want in a game, due you want fidelity to real life, with accurate simulation of each car, precise aerodynamic and drivetrain calculations and laser scanned tracks, or do you want to be able to drift around corners without sacrificing lap times? Do you want a false sensation of speed, or an accurate introduction to cornering and car weight distribution? Do you want top level AI and reward intensive career progression, or are you happy endlessly lapping empty tracks, looking for slight improvements in your cornering technique.I much prefer the later, but I don't mean to disparage those who enjoy the former. I've spent my last 30hrs in game lapping one track (Zandvoort in the Netherlands), with one car (the McLaren 650S GT3) and the experience has been hugely enjoyable as I try to approach race car driver speeds (which I'm sure I'm far off, currently only the 5th fastest on RSR for that combination). The feel of laser scanned track through the force feedback is incredible, the handling dynamics superb and the complexity and precision of high-speed racing is endlessly fascinating to me.If you want to genuinely feel the sensation of racing a well modelled 458, or a McLaren P1, or a GT3 or F1 car through Spa, or the Nurnburgring, this is a near perfect way to do it (short of somehow renting one!)If you're a fan of driving, buy AC and invest in developing technique. If you're a fan of arcade style multiplayer, or the quick fun of frantic drifting buy something else.Highly recommended, from someone looking forward to the new car releases in May and June. If they can add some American and Japanese tracks, expand the list of road cars, continue to tinker with the AI, and maybe, eventually, develop a solid career mode, then this will be a perfect racing game.

												At first glance Assetto Corsa's approach to the racing genre may not appear unique or even new, but once you delve in, racing wheel in hand, it's evident that the developers have focused on translating the sense of driving to a level that may just redefine the racing genre. But will Assettos Corsa’s approach place it among the greatest racing titles ever, or will it be a forgotten name in years to come?

												I have to leave a review for this game. At first I was so frustrated about how tough it is to drive the cars so I decided to get a refund. For about a day, I did a lot of research to see if there is any other racing games out there worth considering, I ended up considering to buy Project cars or to re-buy assetto corsa. After watching a lot of reviews on YouTube comparing these two games I decided to re-buy assetto corsa, due to the positive reviews, and I absolutely don't regret that now. Yes, it takes patience and yes it requires practice but it's worth it all! After take the Pagani Zonda for a spin on the Spa, I finally understood what the experts are talking about when they speak about treating the car with tough love and drive it like you hate it, cause if you don't, the car will ""bite"" and you find yourself of the track within seconds All in all, a very great game, that's absolutely worth recommending!

												Played over 1,700 hours and still not bored.Assetto is all about the thrill of driving. The force feedback together with the sublime physics engine make driving a pleasure. Every car feels unique and has a charm and character of its own.In terms of features there are elements that other titles in the genre have that Assetto does not. What you quickly realise is that when the driving feels this good that everything else is just a bonus. "

								As someone who has spent a decent amount of time on a real race track, I'd say this game is fairly realistic and L337. Great car physics - significantly better than Forza or Gran Turismo. Needs a wheel to be properly enjoyed.9.9/10. Why 9.9? Needs the Porsche license (which I believe is currently being wasted on Need for Speed, or some other garbage-y garbage).			"

Early Access Review
								Where do I start? I looked into this game after a few Google searches on what games I should play once I get hold of my Logitech G25 again and after a few YouTube videos, I decided to go ahead and buy it even though I didn't have my G25 wheel back from my buddy yet. I took a ""risk"" and ended up buying the game for its full price and played a few laps with a Xbox 360 controller. It didn't seem anything special, the tire/handling physics definitely did stand out but I didn't want to judge this game from my experience with a 360 controller so I waited.Finally I got hold of my G25 and set it all up in order to try this game, and WOW, I have tried many driving simulators on PC, PS3, Xbox360 and all with Force Feedback wheels but I have not come across a game as Realistic as Assetto Corsa. After a few practice laps, I made sure my rotation was set to 900 degrees with 100% Force Feedback strength and fully manual setup with no traction control, just 100% Stability (as I was testing the Zonda R).I still cannot get over how good it feels, everything is so realistic, the graphics are way above average when compared with other driving simulators and I'm sure it will only get better as this game is still in Early Access 0.4. I have not yet played a driving simulator that can provide me with the most ACCURATE yet CHALLENGING Force Feedback, which is very rewarding when done right. Force Feedback has never been better on a game in my opinion.From the Early Access 0.4 version, this game is definitely one of the best investments I have made in Driving Simulators. I feel like even with early access, it was worth every penny of my money (which I haven't recently felt even with other games, not just driving simulators) and it will only get better once AI is released, once Career mode is released, and once Multiplayer is released. The Assetto Corsa Development team is heading in the right direction with this game so my expectations are very high and I'm sure myself, and other consumers will not be disappointed. I'm personally most excited for Multiplayer and I can see myself spending countless hours in Drag, Drift and Track modes competing with other enthusiasts.Should you buy this game? YES! But make sure you have a good Force Feedback wheel to go with it, preferably with full pedals, a H shifter etc.Last but not least, I have also recently invested in 3D gaming, and this game was easily the best looking 3D game I have played on my 40"" Samsung (with Nvidia 3DTV Play Software), once all the depth and convergence settings were done right for each camera view, but that's pretty much something you have to do for all 3D games so I wouldn't even consider it a con.Go and buy this game!

												I´ve waited a long time with my review, because I wanted to see what kinds of addition this game gets over time. But well, here it is:Assetto Corsa is a very challenging and rewarding game. It is one of the few titles that truly deserve to be called a ""Racing Simulation"" in a genre where many games proudly boast the moniker, and then severely disappoints in that regard.Pros:- A true Racing Simulation on PC, one of the very few titles to come out in recent years- Good production value, you can really see that the devs know what they´re doing- Extremely good physics engine- Good graphics- Relatively fast AI- It´s stupidly easy to use mods- there are tons of high-quality mods of cars, tracks and UI apps readily availableCons:- 80% of the included tracks are Italian- 40% of the included cars are Lotus (seriously, there are 7 variations of the Lotus Evora and 5-6 for the Exige... Who the hell thought this was a good idea?)- Some other cars are sorely missed instead (No R34, Lancer Evo, RX-7, Challenger, Charger, C63 AMG, SLR, and no Audi´s,  Porsche´s, Toyota´s, Ford´s, e..., at all!)- AI is extremely taxing on the CPU (I have a 4 GHz AMD Octacore, and yet CPU occupancy goes above 95% when I race more than 10 cars, causing the game to stutter on my system)- AI is incapable of actually fighting for positions (they may drive quickly, but once you have caught them, you´ll easily overtake, and they will never undertake even the slightest try to get the position back)- The flag, pit stop, weather, day-night mechanics are NOT available yet. This means no chance for real competitive gameplay yet.Total: 7.5/10. Don´t get me wrong: It still is one of the best racers I have ever played! But i have to admit, I most likely only love it so much because it has no competition. There are a bunch of things that are wrong with this game, that need to be critizised.But when you´re hunting your ghost on the Nordschleife, piloting a (Mod) Mazda 787B on a cold track... you´ll forget about all of the flaws. You won´t notice any flaws, and even if you did: You wouldn´t care.In these moments, the game deserves a straight 10/10, and it will be worth the asking price all of a sudden.recommendation: Hell yes. If you are into non-arcade racing and have a capable rig - you have no excuse to not buy this.			"

												Assetto Corsa makes Grand Turismo feel as if it is purely arcade compared to it. This game is extremely sophisticated with a myriad of optimization options, and Profesional mode in this game is how it should be played! This is the most advanced racing simulator I have ever seen and it seems as if the developers are just getting started! Anyone who is a racing sim fan will love this game but I warn those semi arcadish fans because this game is not for the weak hearted. Be prepared to spend hours upon hours attempting the races if you play it on professional mode because that is what will happen!  "

												So finally this game came out of early access and is finished and there can't be any excuses anymore. The game didn't changed much. Kunos simulazioni are still really bad at communicating and are very arrogant banning you if you criticize the game or ask something. I'm not talking about childish comments like ""your game sucks"".The game has a big potential. The physics are good. It has great force feedback. You feel the car, you feel almost everything through the wheel, the driving feel is really good.Developers keep adding new cars and the game gets better and better in this department, but still i want to see subaru, nissan, ford, audi, peugeut, opel and many more. It‘s a racing game so we need more cars. Of course i don‘t want fake 1000+ cars like in GT series, where you get the same 50 cars in different colors which counts as different cars. But i think ~100 different cars is a must and it's going the right way. Yes there're mods, but i want professionally created cars/tracks, not by some amateurs. There's no auto updates for the mods, so if you have like 50 of them you must update them manually every time. And some mods for this game cost money. I don't approve such behavior and will not support it.The track selection is not very good at the moment. Still there‘s no famous nurgburgring, but it is annouced as DLC. It‘s not like i‘m against DLC, but i think such track must be included in the game from the start. Especially seeing how good the game sells they should have the budget now. I think Kunos did not expect such luck. It would be cool to have some fictional tracks as well.AI. It's bad. AI is not aware of you, they just trying to drive trough you. So racing against AI is not very fun. At least they've sorted the difficulty so it's possible to beat AI now even if you make mistakes.Penalty system is absurd. It punishes you every time you go out of track, no matter if you cut the track or slide off the track. Where's the logic behind this? I'm already punished myself by going off the track and lost time and stupid system makes me go on 50kmh for 5 seconds and lose more time.There‘re challenges too, but they‘re so hard that there‘s no fun playing them, it feels more like a hard work than playing a game so all the challenges are pointless. The best times should be achievable to all players (after some practice of course), even for those which are playing with keyboard/mouse or with a controller, not only for aliens. Online leaderboards should be the place where aliens rule. Oh and forget the game if you're playing with a controller. This game must be played with wheel only. If you're looking for something similar to forza or GT, know that this game is nothing like this.Multiplayer. It's a joke. MP is boring and pointless. There's no leaderboards or player profiles, no statistics. Most of the time there're too little servers, you just can't find a game. You can join the league, but it's not fun for a casual player to compete with pros.After releasing the full game only tools for kicking people were added. Of course now every mod can ban/kick whoever he wants or dislikes without any reason.Community is one of the worst. AC fanboys are the worst, you can't say anything bad about AC or criticize it. The game is perfect for them.What year is it? Almost 2015! And there's still no night racing and no weather conditions. Even GT5 has this and it's some old game made for an old console.Graphics. The cars looks really great, but everything else is just bad. Like from 2006 but enhanced with hdr and bloom.No leaderboards. It is really fun in raceroom experience to see the times from all over the world, find your country and try to beat the time.There are few game modes. Career which consists of races and time attacks, It will take some time for you to complete it and you'll try the cars.Time attack. It's some broken game mode which makes you go slower. The slower you go in the first couple of laps the more points you get.Drift and drag racing which i'm not interested in so i can't say anything about them.Another small annoying things:When in photo mode you can't hide the racing line. Mouse pointer do not disappear while playing. Can't pause the game and check apps.Racing line is completely broken.You can have some fun in career mode and in MP with friends, but besides that i can't see how this game could be fun for a non hardcore sim fan. I'm still trying to like this game. It has some really attractive things and hope Kunos will improve the experience for non hardcore sim fans.Pros:Great physicsGood graphicsGood performanceSetup sharingCons:]Lack of tracksLack of carsNo workshop supportNo leaderboardsShallow career modeChallenges are impossible for a normal human			"

								This game has an amazing atmosphere about it to begin with. I find it hard to play it in less than 4-5 hour stints. I just can't help myself. Odds are, you're checking out this game because you like cars. LOOK NO FURTHER! With everything from the physics engine, to the graphics that look frighteningly realistic, this Racing Sim has it all. Beautiful layouts of tracks, cars, intuitive UI for modding the cars' geometry with various suspension setups; that help to not only enhance your Sim experience but to teach about the way cars work in general. I have only played for <100 hours but thats because I thought I could make Raceroom Racing Experience a little bit more like this game.ITS NOT POSSIBLE! I'VE TRIED! The attention to detail really enhances one's experience. I haven't had a single dull second in this sim. In summation, you should stop reading this and buy the game already!			"

And with a community of moders and the ability to add cars over time, I'm sure this game's garage will develop into something truly comparible. I understand this is PC vs Console but who cares. Graphics aren't as important as the feel of being connected with the car and the speed you're actually going. AC translates the feeling of speed in a way I've never felt with GT6. If you have a wheel and love racing games, get this game, period.			"

												Assetto Corsa under $60 for everything (Not on sale)iRacing over $1000 for everything plus a monthly subscription of $7-$12....Amazing tracks (Lazer scanned)Amazing cars (Scanned and modeled)Amazing FFB (You can really push the limits of the car and yourself)Free cars and tracks now??? ok!Loads of mods avaliable created by the communityNot so good multiplayer (To have a descent online race you must join a league or use SRS)AI Were awful but have improved a bitSF-15T's ERS too basic.Not much else I can say about the negatives other than this sim really needs some kind of multiplayer scoring system with dedicated servers and races, maybe this isn't the sim for it but it certainly would flourish if it had that kind of capability. Just look at iRacing, mediocre FFB, mediocre graphics, insanely expensive and they're doing well because they are soley based on a multiplayer system.In conclusionOne of the best racing simulators out to date right now it just lacks multiplayer capabilitiesEdit: This is not a arcade or even a simcade like PCars. A wheel is a must, playing with a controller or keyboard just doesn't cut it. Please don't buy it then leave a negative review saying it was too difficult, its a sim.			"

												Assetto Corsa has a lot of potential but fell short in some ways. However, at it's current stage, AC is indeed a great racing game for racing fans.First of all, the driving physics is great with excellent suspension and weight transfer physics where the cars tend to sway and bank in corners realistically like what I expected it to behave. The tire physics is also pretty decent with some good amount of simulation in it's tire model, despite it feels a bit too predictable to me. The game's drifting physics is great though as it feels fantastic to throw a car at a corner drifitng in this game. In my honest opinion, the suspension and weight transfer physics in AC blow other racing games out of the water but the tire model fell a bit short in comparison to Race Room or pCARS due to its predictability. Even though AC has one of the best driving physics among racing games on Steam, what made the game standout to me is this game also offer accessibility  to players who does not own a wheel. The game plays great on gamepad with more precise controls offered than other racing games. However, a wheel is still a must for games like AC as AC is known for its amazing force feedback that made having a wheel the optimal way to enjoy this racing game. Still, if you only have a gamepad, the game is perfectly enjoyable to play on gamepad considering the game offers a reasonable amount of assists such as stability slider(0-100%), auto gear change, ABS and traction control. More importantly, I personally find AC's driving physics to be fun to drive with good amount of depth with each car feels decently unique to drive around a track. Isnt it what racing games supposed to be? Racing games should be all about racing on different tracks while driving different cars that handles differently, instead of pointless grinding for upgrades and cars.In terms of content, AC offers a variety of licensed manufacturers from Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes Benz, KTM, Ruf, Lotus(both classic and modern), Fiat, Mclaren, Pagani and Shelby that ranges from humble Fiat 500 to Nikki Lauda's Ferrari 312. At the same time, AC also features super cars Ferrari 458, coupe such as BMW Z4, FIA GT3s like Mercedes Benz SLS GT3 or lastly, fire breathing monsters such as Pagani Zonda R or Ferrari 599XX. There is definitely something for everyone and if thats not enough for you, you could always head to sites like racedepartment.com to download additional cars made by the community where you can get Japan's only Le Mans winner, Mazda 787B, single cup racing cars such as Ginetta G50 GT4 or even the pretigious German DTM cars. The car list can be a bit too Euro centric to some people but the developers had also announced more manufacturers are coming to AC in the future, for example, Audi, Lamborghini, Toyota, Nissan and Corvette. On the other hand, AC's track list is pretty lean to some as they only feature 10 locations that are all based in Europe at the moment that includes Imola, Monza, Silverstone and Spa as examples. AC's tracks are all laser scanned where you can feel every bump and crest when you drive on it's official tracks which does add a lot to the authenticity of the game. In my opinion, AC is still lack of popular tracks such as Brands Hatch, Laguna Seca, Le Mans Circuit and so on. Still, you could always find community made tracks to further enhance the game's track list. Do note that AC's mod community quality varies wildly so you will definitely need time filter through mods to find gems in the modding community. At the same time, Kunos has intentions to support the game for the next 5 years so do expect the game to have quite a few DLCs. So far, the first official post release content pack seemed to be a decent expansion pack where it comes with the 20km long laser scanned track, often nicknamed as Green Hell with 10 additional brand new cars introduced into the game. At the same time, the developers will also patch in free cars and tracks from time to time such as the recently patched in Ruf CTR2.My main criticism with the game so far is, AC is lacking in terms of features if one compared it to some of it's competitors, rFactor and Project CARS. At the time of writing, there are many features that are common in real life racing series such as night driving, rain weather that will affect your car's grip, AI pitstops and flags penalty. The developer had confirmed that Flags and AI pitstops will be added into the game eventually but rain and night driving will probably not included in the game until it's sequel. Another criticism of mine would be, AC's AI is fairly rudimentary as they are completely unaware of player's presence in the field where they might crash into your back occasionally while they have some tendency to over brake at some parts of a track that made them easy to overtake. Since Early Access, the developers had been patching the AI to perform better but it is still a far cry from what rFactor, Raceroom, Grid Autosports or Project CARS can offer. The multiplayer servers are also barebones with confusing UI and lacking of the robust multiplayer feature that iRacing has. However, the worst part of AC would be it's optimisation where the "">95% CPU Occupancy"" issue that will cause stuttering and poor AI performance still persist till now if you race with more than 20 AI cars. This issue is particularly severe if one plays on community made tracks with less optimisation but one could always opt for less cars on grid to eliminate the issue. There are optimisation being fixed with patches but I sincerely hope this issue will be fixed in the future. Still, optimisation issues are expected in racing games such as AC due to it's more computational intensive simulation in comparison to Grid or NFS while some racing simulators in the market, such as rFactor 2 are said to have CTD issues in some cases.  If you just want a great racing game to race with 15 AI or hotlap solo around a track, these optimisation issues are unlikely to occur. Lastly, the career mode in AC is completely forgettable as it is just a few preset championship events that offers barely anything new from what you can do in the race menu. The career mode also does not offer any progression system that is found in Forza or GT6 where you had to buy and upgrade cars. In conclusion, Assetto Corsa is a decent racing game at its current stage with reasonable amount of content. Just like French cheese that tastes better as time goes by, I have no doubt that AC will improve over time with official DLCs, new features and also mod content from it's healthy mod scene being added into the game. At its current stage I do recommend this game if you are a racing fan looking for a more simulation heavy racing game and do not mind some of its flaws as AC is still a competent racing game at its current stage.I had played more than 70 hours so far and I could see that AC will be on my HDD for some time in the future. It is definitely a great time to be a PC gamer as more and more racing games such as Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car and Project CARS are developed independently for PC.			"

 It's really sad to see people simply giving negative review for seeing Stefano's (dev) reaction on forum. The incident has passed on, the professional driver Fredrik Sørlie and Stefano has peacefully ended their conversation on Reddit. They aren't fighting anymore. Also, the game is purchased by a different company now. Things will be different. For now, I will leave this comment just so that people will stop getting the wrong idea. I will revisit and rewrite this review once things have settled, but the current situation with this review section is just outrageous.			"

Early Access Review
								If i'm honest I started to get a little worried that this game would fall into the DayZ trap and be in development forever,with games like Project cars on the way I was starting to lose all interest in Assetto Corsa......until the 1.0 update.The game now looks absolutly STUNNING,yes we need more cars and tracks but the game itself satisfies my racing urges and plays fantastic with the Xbox One controller (which i will be upgrading to a new wheel as soon as possible).The cars handle and move much better than any driving sim i have played in the past and I am a huge Forza and Grand Tourismo fan,and this was keeping me on consoles,the fact PC had no good racing sims,now I can say PC has everything I want in a gaming platform.Sorry Forza and GT........Assetto Corsa has risen the bar for a quality racing sim.

												I've had this game for over a year now and I can say it's by far the most fun and realistic simulator I've ever played. The modding community makes great mods if you get bored of the tracks and cars that the game comes with. My only complaint would be that the speed looks nothing like what you're actually going and that the motion blur just looks like you're losing frames, but other than that, there's no other problems.

												Best racing simulator ever. There are few games that genuinely put a smile on your face, but Assetto Corsa is definitely one of them. Pulling out a huge successful slide or racing with sweaty palms for victory, this game delivers that all with tremendous success.The driving physics are as real as they can be, and that for me is top priority in a racing sim. Pulling slides in a 458 makes you feel the same kind of excitement that I would presume Chris Harris feels when he reviews cars (even though he is from another planet when it comes to driving). After over a year of playing it's just getting better and better with more content to come. Awesome mod community with a lot of potential to add even more content makes this a must have racing sim. If you like cars and driving, you'll love Assetto Corsa. Benchmark for all racing games, for years to come. And referring to Mr. Chris Harris: ""This is MEGA!""			"

												This game is addictingly accurate. Even playing with a controller rather than a wheel you get so much feedback that driving the cars feels to natural. That's not to say easy -- some of these cars and the challenges the game gives you to complete with them will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ But the physics make sense. You can improve your setup and driving because you'll know exactly what you did wrong and you'll feel how the setup changes impact your lap.+Great tracks and cars already with more coming and a great modding community.Never been into racing sims, but I can't stop playing this. Long story short -- get this game.			"

This is a MUST buy for sim racing enthusiasts.			"

								Wow... I have been looking for a game like this for a while. You can play the game two ways: 1. You play it like a simulator sweating your♥♥♥♥♥off. Loads of fun.2. You just kinda chill out and go out for a nice sunday drive, maybe even drift a little. Loads of fun.Any way you like it, you're gonna enjoy it. The game is really well optimized, and it seems to work with nearly any racing wheel. I used a 9-year-old racing wheel, and it worked like a charm! The fact that the game has modding abilities, makes me fall in love with it even more. Wether you want to drift around on Rainbow Road with you BMW M3 or cruise around Paris with your Fiat 500, the mods have got you covered. The realism that Kunos have put into the game, is outstanding. The car sounds, the handling and the looks! The game looks and sounds epic overall. It's astonishing that the game is only in early access, since it sure feels like a complete game. I cannot wait to see how the game turns out on release! Kudos Kunos. Kudos...9.5/10			"

												This game is just amazing. The moment you get on the wheel you know everything feels right. I was impressed by Project Cars, had to buy a steering wheel to play it though, unplayable with gamepad. But Assetto Corsa is ages ahead of any street racing game. The tracks really do feel right, they are laser scanned, the cars feel right, the street feels right and it's totally playable with a gamepad too. The game engine graphics is amazing, you can play with really high grapchics and have a constant of 60 FPS. Congratulations to the dev team of Kunos Simulazioni. 10/10.			"

												What the team @Kunos have done with this is nothing but incredible.I had the chance to follow the development since it's very early stages and seeing this sim grow and evolve into what it has become to date, has been an amazing ride on its own.Let's get a few things straight, right of the bat: Asseto Corsa is NOT a game. This is a HARDCORE DRIVING SIM at its finest. The sooner you understand this, the better. Assetto Corsa is unforgiving, it is frustrating, it is relentless. It will beat you down and eat you every time you make a mistake without mercy. You want to know why? Because that is exactly what happens when you drive a racing car at its limits. You will need to study it, you will need to learn from it. It is a beast that needs to be tamed before you can even dare 'playing' with it. And even then, it will NEVER be your pet. It will always remain as a wild animal, and as such it demands your respect. A fairly decent WHEEL & setup is very much needed, if you wish to enjoy Assetto Corsa the way it was intended to. (You 'can' use your keyboard / joystick to drive but I would consider it blasphemy. Not to mention that you'll never know what you are missing) Setting up your wheel might be confusing and even troubling at first. But the process you need to go through now to get that done is quite simple and easy. You'll just need to read a little. Long story short it basically goes like this: Config wheel drivers. Using the 'LUTgenerator' with the proper .csv file generated by the 'WheelCheck' app is absolutely a MUST. (Google is your friend) Config in-game wheel settings. The most important thing here is getting rid of all the so called 'artificial effects'. Meaning that, ideally,  the only slider you need to leave at 100% is the MAIN FFB. (basically you want the FFB signals to come as RAW as possible from your wheel with nothing extra added, even your 'minimum force' should be at 0, because the LUT takes care of that automatically.) Once everything is setup, you will need the 'FFBClip' app when you hit the road with your favorite car & track. This will help you very easily adjust the FFB on-the-fly for each car & track combo, so your wheel does not clip. (It is important that your wheel does not clip AS LONG AS YOU STAY ON THE ROAD, otherwise it doesn't matter, i.e: when you go through sand/grass terrain in a track it's fine for the wheel to clip, as that is obviously not where you're supposed to go nor staying for too long)That's it. You are now officially free to go to any track with any car and enjoy the ride. (You are welcome.)Now I'll point a few of it's best / worst / missing features:BEST:Laser scanned tracks. As precise as they can get.Real cars with every detail taken into consideration. Coded with real engineering information, data taken directly from each and every manufacturer.Unparalleled level of immersion and realism once setup is rightfully completed.Infinite amount of MODS and love from the community. Cars, tracks, telemetry, liveries, and even complete seasons available for download, you name it, search it, and most likely you will find it.Online works great. The net-code is well optimized and you can play without any issues even with higher pings. (People complaining about the online have absolutely no idea where to get into and find decent people to drive with. They are just entering public servers full of kids crashing each other with keyboards, nonsense. AVOID THAT. YOU NEED TO FIND A LEAGUE, WITH PRIVATE SERVERS and join their community, THERE IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND ALL THE PROs and all the good that racing seriously can be)VR GLORY OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED.Great variety of graphical settings, you can easily play this without any problems with a lower end machine if you set everything to minimum.Performance is GREAT at the higher settings, if you have the right hardware.Last but not least, devs are absolutely great. They have added and fixed almost everything the community asked for. Community feedback played a huge roll in this evolving sim. Not to mention that, their base of operation is actually within one the laser scanned tracks (Vallelunga). So this people are for real, they have direct access to everything, official engineering information, pro drivers opinions... The whole package, literally. Kunos Simulazioni is the real deal.WORST:OVERWHELMING AND UNFRIENDLY FOR NEWCOMERS.The sound engine could be better, although it gets the job done, there is room for improvement, especially with some of the lesser cars. (A good pair of headphones makes this less noticeable)Limited damage models. Damage does occur and cars can be beaten down to the stationary point. It is just that I find it not accurate and have seen far better damage models, even in arcade racing games, sadly.VR SUPPORT for VIVE users arrived late, very late, and you still have to navigate the menus without your headset on. Because menus are not implemented in VR yet. Once on the track though it works wonderfully. FIRST SETUP CAN BE A PAIN IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, even worse, you might even give up this precious gem because of this. I think this could be vastly improved as well.AI is fairly stupid and slow when attacking corners.MISSING: Night time (although there are mods for this)Rain (I love driving in the rain, I think it is the true equalizer in racing. It is what separates good drivers from legends. I would love to see this officially implemented in Assetto Corsa.)VR menus.Overall, I absolutely recommend this amazing SIM to people who love racing and are seriously interested about it. I'm far from a professional driver, but I can hold my own in a real track. Not to brag or anything like that, but I went to driving school when I was just a little kid, and had the chance during my youth to actually drive and train with real racing cars (from karts all the way up to TC2000 here in Argentina, nothing too fancy), so I consider my self experienced enough. Assetto Corsa is second to none, trust me. And I played them all, extensively. (iRacing, rFactor 1, rFactor 2, RBR, Automobilista, you name it...) Even with all its quirks, and everything you have to put in to fully enjoy it... (Mainly hardware money and the time invested setting everything up perfectly). This is for people who do actually understand the physics involved in a true racing scenario and are not afraid to step into the journey of its steep learning curve.The rest of you, wanting a more casual experience, buy Project Cars on PC or go buy Gran Turismo with your PS4. These are far more enjoyable games with a controller/joystick.This ended up being a longer than expected review, but I felt the need to give my honest unbiased opinion after seeing so many ignorant negative reviews recently. I hope this review help you guys in making a more informed decision before buying Assetto Corsa.Cheers from Argentina.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been sim racing for about 6 months now and have tried many sims including iRacing, rFactor and Game Stock Car, as well as many simcade titles as well. I can say without a doubt that Assetto Corsa feels like the best. That's not to say the others are without merit, they have their own strengths and weaknesses. But when it comes to communicating the way the car feels to you through a force feedback wheel, AC is second to none. You can truly feel when your car is riding on the edge of available grip and the car will react accordingly to the inputs you give it. The physics and FFB are something that need to be felt to be believed.The AI needs some work but can be passable, however I feel that online leagues where this game will shine for those looking for strong, clean, competitibe racing. Public lobbies can be ok, however you may find griefers driving the wrong way and trying to wreck others. Ask around forums or check steam groups if you are looking for clean racers.I hesitate to speak too much on controllers as I use a wheel and pedals, but I will say with many aids turned on it's not impossible to keep yourself on track. It may be a fine way to learn the tracks while waiting to purcahse a wheel.I have no doubt Kunos will continue to supply top-notch free and paid content in the coming years which will be finely supplimented by content created by modders. AC will definitely be a hub for great racing from many different fandoms in the motorsports world. I highly recomend it.			"

												This game runs really now on the Vive, courtesy of the latest patch. I have a 1080, so I switched off post processing, ramped up the AA, the detail settings and the super sampling, and it runs very smoothly. The cockpit scale is perhaps a little off, but the overall experience is excellent. Thanks heaps to the Dev's for supporting Open VR and not just hoping Vive owners would rely on reVive.			"

								This is my first review I felt I needed to make on such a great sim. Started playing Assetto Corsa when it was first put on steam. I could not have picked a better simulator. I've played a LOT of racing simulators/games, but this one sticks out the most. With the modding community releasing new cars and tracks every other day. The original cars and tracks in the game are top notch! The handling is awesome. The graphics are beautiful. Overall the atmosphere is pretty sweet. I'm glad 1.0 is here it was definitely worth the wait, and I can't wait for future content I will be supporting the developers for such a great simulator!The only con's is: # 1 The AI they are really buggy, But it does not matter because in a simulator you race against real people for the full effect and it does not bother me one bit!#2 To get the full experience you will need a racing wheel, I have tried it with a controller and it was just a mess, than again it is a Simulator.

								Assetto Corsa is by far one of the most enjoyable racing (simulations) out there. There is already a huge mod community developing content. This game gets the basics dead on: menus, load times, UI, hardware optimization, open platform, etc. It also gets the complex stuff right as well: Game physics, graphics, sound, etc. Physics are the real standout. If you have a racing wheel, you are in for a special experience. Is it perfect? No. Sounds could be better. Graphcis are not going to blow you away. And some nice features like day night cycles and weather are not planned. (keep in mind this is a small team building this game)If you want a fun racing sim with a great mod community that does everything well, then AC is your best bet.			"

I was gonna give a positive review, especially for the effort bringing stunning porsches line-up here. But i have acknowledged by stefano's behaviour towards fredrik sorlie.. i decided to give this title a negative review. Because it is a massive insult and unforgiving bigotic behaviour.

												Assetto Corsa.... One hell of a Racing game! And A Superb Sim! 95/100!Assetto Corsa, A racing game for true enthusiasts and Mild drivers alike. Lets start off with the physics..You have several types of Car game physics ""Arcade/Sim and Simcade"" assetto falls in the category of Sim. It may not have Clutch bite like Rfactor, Or the intense Simulation feel iRacing does, But you get a very close feel of both without costing you a fortune or looking dated. With most sim racers, They either have bad UI, Dated graphics, unsupported games and Awkward to set up Servers..but with AC. None of that, and all the great driving physics you can want! Pros:-It has mods and full mod support.-Still getting updates (Not too old of a game)-Graphics are Nice (Maybe not as visually stunning as PCARS but it has a lot of nice details, And unless you are worried about background details such as trees and houses. it's okay) Some ingame screenshots can look real if done correctly.-Wide Variation of cars (American/Japanese/European) -A Career mode (Some might not be bothered by this, others like a goal in their racing game, always a plus)-Easy to setup and use Server base( Could be better but it isn't hard, especially for a Sim based game) -Wheel support- Multimonitor support-In game apps that allow lots of live data to be shown (tyre temps, fuel, g force, FOV adjuster)-Lazer Scanned tracks The game as a whole is really fun, With both wheel and gamepad, I wouldn't recommend to any keyboard warriors however. The game isn't too demanding but modern ish tech is needed for a decent framerate.(obvs)Now on to the cons:-No clutch bite ( when bringing up the clutch in 1st it should crawl slowly like a real car, however it doesn't do that)-No day/night cycle (no night time)-No Rain The game is superb, if you are after a Good racing game (sim based) Then this is a nice medium, That won't cost you a fortune, has plenty of cars and tracks (lots of mods too, easy to install) And a friendly-ish Comumnity , AC is a good buy! Plenty of drifting,touge,Hillclimb,GT3,BTCC and more! AC>PCARSTl;DR I great Racer for Avid or new sim Racing fans looking for a modern nice looking Racing game. Works nicely on Gamepads and wheels, Needs day/nigh and rain modes. 95/100.I Recommend Assetto Corsa and give it a 95/100. Happy Racing! "

												It's a great way to get a realistic drive experience, you just need a combination of a good FFB Wheel and good settings (matter of taste). The Tracks are laser scanned and there are a lot of available cars (dlc + mods). In my Opinion:Pro:+drive experience +laser scanned tracks+car and track mods+many updates+car sounds+many dlc's~graphics (you can use mods)con:-menu (looks boring to me)I never had an issue till now, so i can't say how the support is.

Posted: December 28, 2016
												This game is my first proper racing simulator, my only previous track racer was shift 2 unleashed,and lets be honest,it wasnt that realistic. I consider myself a somewhat casual gamer, especially when it comes to racing games, burnout paradaise, the crew, and iven GTA , i feel at home when playing those.And yet i felt tempted to buy Assetto Corsa, due to the cars like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche,all in the same game, and my favorite, Mclaren. But mainly because its a simulation, despite the fact im using a controller, and despite i never driven a car in my life, i still wanted to get that actual feel of the car, the thrill, how it moves, how it behaves.I took Mclaren P1 to Brands Hatch, and decided to use 3rd person camera, to hear how the car sounds, and my god it sounds good.From the Top Gear series and some YouTube videos memory, i coud tell it sounds like the real deal.I can feel every bump, apex, and paved over parts of the track, when i lost it, i coud get it back, when i drove off the track, going too quickly into the corner, or going too wide, i coud tell it wasnt due to the game, but me. When i did several laps at Brands Hatch, i was geting faster, taking the corners better, started using the DRS because i ddint iven knew you can use it in the game, and having a blast driving around, and i was doing all that, in 3rd person camera, just to hear the engine of the Mclaren, its amazing, and also the tracks are laser scanned.The game can look beautiful, well from looking at the screenshoots, i have an AMD FX-6350, 8GB of ram and GTX 750 1GB OC,the non TI version, and i can run the game at smooth 60 fps and 1080p, without looking like it came from early 2000s.I did not have enough experience with the AI, as i did only 2 races 2 laps each, with a single opponent, and i used lowest AI difficulty setting 80%.I coud stay in first place, throughout the whole race, the opponent iven overtook me once. The AI was 2 seconds behind when i finnished.When it comes to car selection itself, its very good, its quality over quantity, i dont know how many cars are there exacly, especially with the dlc, i got all Dream packs, japanse pack, trpl3 pack, and Porsche pack 1. But there seem to be plenty enough, there is something here for everyone, from open wheel, to retro rides, coupes, everyday cars, supercars, and GT.You can read on all the cars, about their specs and history, you can also view them in showroom, opening doors, looking inside etc. You can change the colour of the cars, but not sure about the vinyls yet.When it comes to settings, on track and in options, theres plenty, all kinds of  HUD telemetries, and you can iven move them around and set them to your liking, you can set your fov, your siting position in the car, and i belive iven traction control and other '' controls'' on the fly aswell, you can ofcource setup the car itself in the pits. There are penalites and all that jazz, you can turn that off, among other things, in the options menu. There are plenty of assissts in the game to help, and iven presets, from gamer, to proffesional. The controller support in the racing itself is really good, plenty of options to set, but strangely, it doesnt work in the menus, you need to use the mouse.In other options, you can change volume of tire screeching, engine, tarmac, etc. You can also set the virtual wheel rotation as in the ammount of movement the guy behind the wheel in game have to do, and plenty of graphical options aswell, the game is rather well optimized.When it comes to content, there is career mode, practice mode, hot laps, drift, drag, quick race, championship, and challenges, You can iven create your own Championship aswell, and there are options in eariler modes, from time of day, allthough there is no night, or rain in the game....yet, temperature , the surface of the track, the ammount of oppnents,22 is max i belive, laps, and other things.Despite im a complete nub and a somewhat casual player, and this being my first proper racing sim, im having a blast, plenty of cars, somewhat good tracks, tho there coud be more, and im sure there will be in the future, as they are laser scanned, plenty of modes, rather scrub friendly, and well optimized.If you have been wondering to pick this up as your first sim racer, but worried if its ''too hardcore'' or too difficult, dont worry, if i can win with a controller in 3rd person camera against an opponent, anyone can.And most importnantly, the game is being improved all the time aswell.

								This is it, Assetto Corsa is simply put the best racing sim I've ever played. Right out of the box it has the best, most naturally feeling and pleasing physics out there. Do you want to drive slowly? For the first time ever, you can. Do you want to drive over the limit? That works too.It's also the first sim to officially support drifting without adding weird, mode specific physics, and the fact that I had to watch several real life instructional videos to get the hang of it speaks volumes of how good this is.The most important thing though, it just feels good. The force feedback on this thing is simply way ahead of the competition, cars feel real, you can feel every bump and elevation change on the road, you can feel weight shifting (not only lateral but also longitudinal forces too, somehow), it's just bananas.Let's also add the fact that it looks gorgeous and has fantastic performance, plus official mod support (not yet imlemented, but there's plenty of awesome mods already in the works), and great developer support and you got yourself a great sim that's bound to last.The fact alone that I've played this for over 15 hours already and it doesnt even have AI or multiplayer support yet (it's an early access after all) speaks for itself.It's good, if you got a wheel, then get this thing, it's kickass.

												I bought this for two reasons:    1) Project Cars is running like a dog on my AMD 290x graphics card    2) It was 50% off on steam and had good reviewsI am just getting in SimRacing and have bought quite a few pieces of software to go along with my shiny new G27 Wheel. iRacing, DiRT RALLY, Stock Car Extreme, Project Cars, WRC4 to name a few, Assetto Corsa is the best of the bunch, by a considerable margin.The graphics are not the very best, nor the sound and I have seen better presentation, but this is about simulation - not gloss. AC is more natural to me than any other sim I have played. The grip, the traction, the weight transfer - the complete package is just amazing. After playing this for a little while, nothing else feels quite right!There are some mighty contenders - iRacing, Stock Car Extreme and DiRT rally being very high quality Sims - but they all pale in comparison to the mighty Assetto Corsa. Graphics: 8/10    Would have been a 9 if it wasn't for Pcars!Sound: 7/10    Varies quite a bit between different vehicles - some are amazing, others averagePresentation: 8/10    OK menu system and Configuration options - could be a little betterContent: 10/10    Comes with a decent amount of tracks, cars and game modes    LOADS OF FREE QUALITY MODS!!! Tracks, cars - you name it    Paid DLC too...Feel: 10/10    This is where AC shines, it feels amazing - nothing and I mean NOTHING can touch itGrin Factor: 10/10    Absolute Quality - no other racing game comes close to making me smile like this ;)Overall 9/10   Forget the rest, this really is the best!

												This game is best enjoyed if you like to hotlap alone or to play in private servers. The AI is bad (at this moment), the official content is a bit poor (there will be DLCs), career mode is simple (premade themed individual races, no story, no unlocks, no car improvements), and playing online against random people in open servers sucks bad (trolls everywhere, you know), but if you enjoy the pleasure of driving in a very realistic way, even alone, this is one of the best car simulators of the last years. The mod support makes the game even better with tons of community content, as cars, tracks or in-game apps.Steering Wheel very recommended.			"

												Fantastic Racing Simulator, with a very active modding community and some very good external apps - RSR Live Timing for example is a must.Game can still be quite temperamental with unexplained fatal crashing  and the online multi-player is still missing many elements, such as unsatisfying results screen.However the positives far outweigh the negatives and this is a must buy for any race fan and a game I expect to still be enjoying far beyond the 1000 hour mark.Edit:As a little addition - I think it is only fair to say that the game has become considerably more stable and much less likely to crash out in recent updates.Much effort has also been made in streamlining the online multiplayer experience, which ran like a bit of a dog in the earlier releases, but which now holds a good average and perfectly adequate frame rate with 20+ online players participating.

												HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!This is the best physics engine in any racing game hands down. Might not be the absolute best for just racing or serious trackwork for dedicated sim raccers (although it it still amazing for racing), assetto corsa comes into its own for drifitng and being able to hold a slide just if you want to learn how to control a car on the edge of its grip. Assetto corsa is the only game I've ever played where the handeling model will let you dance on the edge of a cars grip with full confidence that it wont bite back. Everything s controlable and smooth and if you stick with this game for even a little while you will learn so much as a driver. The modding support community is also a massive bonus for heaps of extra free conent but the DLC the Kunos provides is amaing as well, they're one of the best devs ive ever  come accross theyre really close to the community and support the game with regularuodates and DLC. In my opinion, dont even wait for a sale, just buy this thing its worth every penny if you like cars and youll never regret it!			"

												Im a pretty keen sim racer, I have a dedicated setup on an obutto with Thrustmaster T500rs, modded pedals, H shifter, sim vibe, triples and recently a Rift CV1. I have been league racing for a few years in games like rfactor2, Assetto Corsa and iRacing.Assetto Corsa is a fun game and if i could make the choice again i would still buy it. But for me it had become somewhat of a hot lap simulator to do a few laps in every now and then. Its a pretty game, it works well with simvibe but the multiplayer matching was crap and the single player events were a bit rubbish as well.  In Comparison:* Assetto wins the gfx competition hands down (until you consider the rift implementation).* The rift implementation in iRacing is much better due to what i believe is the pixel density improving the horrid jaggies. RF2 will never support the rift so although i have loved it dearly its now dead to me. * The mulitplayer implementation of iRacing cant be beaten, its head and shoulders above any other racing game and this is where replayability is born* Physics can be a bit subjective without actually being on the Dev staff of each company but i feel that iRacing and RFactor2 have the slight upper hand. The fact that real GT3 racers use their real life car setups in iRacing says a lot about just how realistic it is.* League racing iRacing and RFactor2 are better by far, in many respects Assetto feels incomplete in comparison* Content.. I dont care for road cars, I like to race in race cars so a lot of whats in Assetto has low appeal for me* Straight up single player fun.. DiRT Rally is the winner of this category for meSummary:If Assetto had a strong multiplayer system including ranking that was even half as good as iRacing and a better menu system + rift implementation it would probably be my goto sim racing game. But as it stands its near the bottom of the pile, one rung up from RF2 but only since RF2 is rift-less			"

								Assetto Corsa. I wasn't one of those guys who hyped it before I played it. Hell I was absolutely skeptical when one of my better friends went absolutely nuts about it on Facebook based on Kunos' reputation alone.Unlike him, i've actually got the PC hardware to actually play the game. When I first loaded the game I was incredibly underwhelmed. Bearing in mind I just spend 33 bucks on an impulse buy, and that I play on a 360 gamepad due to the logistical nightmare of setting up my wheel, I was rather underwhelmed. The framerate was choppy, aliasing was absolutely everywhere, the textures didn't look nice at all, but the worst was that it felt a bit arcady. Cars felt like they were far too reactive and the BMW M3 GT2 felt like it had too much grip.Well, one visit to RaceDepartment.com forums fixed absolutely EVERYTHING wrong with my initial set up. You do have to fiddle around with the Nvidia control panel (if you're team green) and the in game set up to get the best visual quality, but one of the biggest oddities in the game is the way Kunos handles assists and tyre compounds. Its not something that is intuitive, and i had to put some research in to actually understand the UI. I eventually found out that i was running on the SuperSoft compound, which to my knowledge isn't actually used in GT racing.Once I flicked it down to the harder compounds, absolutely everything fit into place. The car felt absolutely divine, playing on a controller was not a problem at all. Never going to be as good as a wheel but those without that option need not worry. One thing this game has changed the way I play race sims is the racing line. In Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsports, F1 2012/13, anything that actually offers a racing line really, I've taken that option. Assetto Corsa has weaned my off that reliance, at least in the game, and has given me the confidence to give it a go in others as well. Playing this game with only the rev counter and gear indicator on the bottom right is truely an experience unlike any other. I booted up the game as of writing, intending to see how the M3 GT2 goes on the harder tyre (I tried out the Zonda R earlier today, it was brilliant). I recorded 10 minutes of it and spent the remaining hour just lapping and learning the track and car.Assetto Corsa is truely astonishing. I had not heard of Kunos' reputation before hand with netKar-Pro, I knew absolutely NOTHING about the title before I plonked down 33 bucks on the recommendation of a friend. I am now absolutely in love with this sim and can't WAIT to see whats Kunos has in store for the future.			"

												I WOULD recommend this game if it hadn't come to light that the lead developer has no clue of how to take criticism on the forums and would rather have a mental breakdown in response to it than calmly look into or at least acknowledge the person's inquiry. Yeah, nice job working PR. How dare someone that has loads of experience in driving cars for multiple manufacturers tell you to try something with your tire model and see how it works? Keep surrounding yourself with yes men until your active players fall to two-digit figures. If I worked on cars that were featured in this, I would be horrified by what you're doing. Either get a grip or find another job. At least see a therapist.Here's an article talking about all of this:https://pretendracecars.net/2017/01/10/another-year-another-stefano-meltdown/As for the game itself, it is pretty good. Just use your own judgement on whether or not it's worth giving money to a company headed by an easily displeased manchild.			"

												Bought an MX-5 and planned to race the nurburg.- Told to myself it might be worth buying AC, nurburg and japanese pack.- Realised I suck and would have crashed if trying to run for <10min- Upgraded probability to finish a lap without crashing from 0% to 50%.Most valuable and money saving game ever !Thx Kunos !

								This Simulator is Solid. In comparison to Race 07, Simraceway, GT6, and forza. This is the most realistic and exciting Sims I've come across. I use a Logitech G27 and its flawless. I've spent a good amount of time on real tracks it the real world and this is it. Can't wait to get my hands on the full version. Assetto Corsa is great. Hope they release a rally version.			"

												Best racing sim in a long time. Get that Ferrari 458 GT2 dialled in around Spa and you'll be grinning from ear to ear. Get a decent racing wheel and you can feel every little slip of the tyres, bump and knock. Now it's not without it's faults, for example there is no Rain or wet tracks, nor are there night events and the graphics aren't as pollished as some other SIM's but once you get used to the AWESOME physics and feel of the cars it's hard going back to any other racing SIM.

												Best Racing/Road Car Simulator out there... Its primary focus is all about realistc driving experience as possible... really cheap, offers great value for the money, cheap DLCs enrich the experience with new cars and tracks. Think of it like ""Microsoft Flight simulator"" type of game... it is really a hardcore simulator here but will also appeal to casual car fans too!  A must have for the most affectionate car lovers though! 10/10			"

								I own almost every driving/ racing title ever made for the PC other than the monthly premium titles with a micro-transaction existence. I am writing this review and the title is still in development and is in Alpha/Beta stage.  The reason that I do not care about if it Alpha or Beta is because it is excellent at whatever stage it is currently.  This title has it all, it allows MODS, it allows private servers, custom skins... the works! The physics model is excellent and the sounds are absolutely spot on. Camera views and the ability to record and save your replays so you can analyze any section of the track at any point in the race is incredible. Sure there are lots of other racing games out there, but you will be hard pressed to find better than Assetto Corsa.I love this title and give it 5 out of 5 Stars. - Hajimoto Approved! ;^) "

												A great driving simultator.I don't do multiplayer but I can say that the single player ""Career Mode"" isn't terribly exciting to me. And random races are kinda frustrating--the AI and the fine-grained, non-adaptive difficulty settings don't make for great racing. You choose 85-100%—which personally I don't find works terribly well since one setting doesn't seem to be perfect for all cars/tracks for me. I'll set it to 88% and blow by everyone in the first lap then do another race at the same setting and never see anything but the AI's taillights. I've had more exciting races from Gran Turismo and that series isn't exactly known for the quality of its AI.But when it comes to having a good physics simulation with ample support for mods, that's where Assetto Corsa shines.And Porsche! Did I mention AC has access to Porsche? (Kunos is the first developer to have access to Porsche since EA got the license in the late '90s.) That alone was enough to sway me toward AC over its competitors. If you're a Porschephile like me, the three Porsche Pack DLCs are definitely worth picking up.If you enjoy hotlapping a good driving simulator, Assetto Corsa is a great game. If you want something that skews toward more ""exciting"" racing against AI competitors or if you want the prettiest racing game on the market, there are probably better choices out there.			"

												This was my first attempt at early access.  I needed a racing game like Forza and GT, not grid 2.  Asseto Corsa has mostly delivered on that. Migrating to racing sims has been tough.  Cars are harder to drive, and there aren't many options for customizing anything other than the setup. Considering that real driving involves that, not upgrading everything whenever you feel slow, I can deal without the modability.  Being early access, there isn't much to do.  There are a few challenges and enough to keep you racing for quite a few hours, but I can't wait until the carer gets implemented.  The physics, the sense of speed, the sound, and the graphics are all top notch. While there is still some optimizing to be done, this game runs beautifully and racing with AI or alone is bliss.  Multiplayer has yet to be implemented.  Another thing I really like is the ability to mod the game and add apps.  Open mod support is huge for games in general, but a racing sim will see some really cool stuff, we already have!  The apps are for the UI and there is source code to encourage the community to develop apps.  Apps are generally used for displaying some data, but its nice being able to customize my UI, and place everything, from lap times, to the odometer in a specifc place, out of my way.  I have logged over one hundred hours in this beta, and I've been smiling the whole time (except when AI bumps you off the track, bt they are getting better with each update, drive cautiously)UPDATE(3/16/15):  The Nord has been unleashed and its epic.  The car pack equally insane.  AI has been greatly improved, although most would argue they arent all that fast or competative.  There are flags now and some other minor tweaks to gameplay features including tire blankets, fog, factory settings, etc, etc.  The only complaint I have for the game is the career.   Everything is unlocked from the start tho, so get out there and get driving.			"

								Well I must admit i did purchase this game in march I really like the handling and the force feedback is awesome , but I was rather put off by what seems to be a over complicated  UI and a mind blowing set ups.I opted to use my time racing F1 2013 , but this week I was  reintroduced to AC by some friends , and wow im hooked , being less than I'm pressed by what I've seen of the F1 2013 DLC .. I mean 2014 , I looked into AC and I'm thinking I will be dropping off the Codies Bandwagon..I'm only going to purchase 2014 if I get good reviews from ppl I know and trust.AC is not perfect by any means , but the best parts of AC and the Best parts of 2013 chopped up and put in a blender could yield some amazing results.id its one thing I really am super happy with about AC its the force feedback its 2nd to none .Anyway to all the people I've took  the♥♥♥♥♥♥of , who played AC ..

								This game was a suprisingly fun experience. As an avid Forza fan for years I have always wanted something I could play on PC. Now, don't let me lead you on this is NOT Forza. It is a very different type of sim-racer ( for those looking for a direct replacement ). It is much less forgiving, but focuses more on the accurate reproduction of racing. It is a gorgeous game, far prettier. The handling is a lot more on the realism side; and as such are pretty difficult to get used to.. but with the right setup even an Xbox 360 controller will be tolerable. The track selection has improved a lot since very old updates of the alpha I had played, and the game has gotten a much larger selection on cars. Even 2ish days experience on the game, I am thoroughly enjoying it. Highly recommend.			"

												It's an excellent hot lap simulator. Unfortunately that's all it is. And It's not worth 60 dollars.Kunos continues to be opaque with development, and throw tantrums during any criticism on the forums, banning people that complain. I'll sum it up.Online:Netcode is garbage. It's extremely difficult to join a race. Server browser sucks and doesn't have enough options. It's not as though that matters, because there's nobody playing.Single Play:The AI is nonexistent, so racing offline is a no. They simply don't recognize the fact that you're there. Smashing in to you in an attempt to stick their pre programmed lines. The penalty system is absurd. Two tires off the track and you'll have your speed cut. Get rammed by the braindead AI? Speed cut. Forced to swerve and cut a corner because the AI doesn't acknowledge you as ""there"". Speed cut. The Career mode is a joke. It never feels like you're doing anything or progressing in anything.There's a time attack mode that is...odd. And pointless, since there's no leaderboards.Simulation: ALMOST peerless. Everything feels super tight and realistic. The only thing that's lacking is the sound design and force feedback. The forcefeedback is absurdly high by default. You can fine tune this pretty easily, it just takes time. But the game doesn't seem to want to save my settings. I come back to the game to find my degrees of rotation back to a full 900 despite what I have set up in the in game profiler, and the stand alone one I have.The UI: Terrible. Everything feels extremely wonky. Once you have everything set up and are ready to drive. I'd say race but again, its a hot lap simulator, it opens it in a SEPARATE INSTANCE. Which makes streaming a nightmare.Even out of early access, and being out for a full year it's worth 30 dollars at best. There's not enough tracks, and not enough cars. There was dlc announced before the game was even released.The cars themselves look superb, but everything else looks last gen at best, ps2 era at theworst. This is mostly a problem with usermade tracks so its excuseable. Because the PC is starved for sims that have the latest roster of cars, this game is basically a must play. But buy it on sale. It's not worth full price. It wasn't when it was in EA, and it's not worth it now. I wouldn't spend more than 20 dollars on it. Almost every aspect of the game besides the driving feels incomplete or lazy.Edit December 2016, hope you like DLC.			"

												Alright guys,after almost 20 hours spent on this game i decided to make a review.This game impressed me pretty much.Game looks stunning and it's moddable.It has huge amount of mods that acctually look pretty good.I know Kunos is small company but they didn't made enough cars.Yes there is DLC but without it game looks poor,thanks God there are modders.And now the biggest issues i heard in reviews about this game:AI!Yes,AI could have more aggressive aproach and similar,but it isn't that bad.When i read reviews i expected game to be like Gran Turismo,but it's far better.If you put AI to 100% it acctually can give you a little real racing experience.So my conclusion is:This game has some issues but overall it's best game i played.I'd like it to be more like Race WTCC game,better AI,races feel more real and similar but it's nice looking.Best thing is that every car feels different.I use this game to practice for real racing because there is mod for Automotodrom Grobnik located in Rijeka,Croatia and looks pretty real because i'm driving on that track next year with my Honda.I would recommend this game for every car fanatic,racing fanatic or just ordinary gamer.Hope i helped!

								I never played any racing simulations before. I was never interested on them. But when this game was on sale, I was eager to buy it. I just wanted to know what simulation was, because I just played arcade racing before.At first, I played it with controller. I played with it for about a month and I enjoyed it. But then I realized that I would get more fun if I used steering wheel, because it was simulation. So I bought G27 wheel. Of course it gave me more fun and I felt like I was driving in real life.The physics is amazing. Each car will give you different experience. Some cars are difficult to drive so you have to practice. The graphics is nice too. The tracks are accurate. But some contents and features are not in the game yet because it is early release.This is a must buy game for any simulation fans.

Whilst I have only played 5 hours so far, I can certainly see myself spending manny more on this game. The Mod Community is fantastic and there are so manny extra tracks and content you can download. This is the first game I have really been able to enjoy the use of my G27.  The feedback and sensation is just like a real car...This is a simulator, not arcade. I have read some reviews refferring to the cars behaving like boats or soap on the floor. The vehicle behaviour is ultra realistic and makes it really more fun. If your are after nitro boosts, arcard fun with bulletproof damage then go play need for speed. If you enjoy realism, Sims and a big modding community (I also enjoy Euro Truck 2) I would suggest you download the game. This game has put more smiles on my face in 5 hours then others have in weeks and months...			"

								This is one of the best games I ever bought. It might not have that many cars and tracks, but you can spend a lot of time even with one car and one track. Every car feels and reacts different. I spent hours upon hours discovering how a car behaves in certain situations, and how to drive it to its max.It is truly a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. I recommend playing this with a good steering wheel. I think this is the only way to really get the full driving experience out of this.I have spent around 150 hours so far, most of the time on track, but also a couple of hours in the replay mode trying to get a good angle for my next screenshot. And don't forget that this is still Early Access. Once it is finally out, with all the content, career- and multiplayer mode released, I think I can play this forever. And all this for only 35€, I have spent a lot more money on games not even half as good as this one. So if you love (sim-) racing or if you consider to try it out for the first time, you should definetely get it. It offers a great experience.			"

												TL;DR: The following review is inaccurate (because it is now a year old) and although the game has goen through huge improvements on the points criticised and other things, I still do not recommend this hotlap-simulator.Update: a year after, it seems like the netcode and AI have been updated and make the game become playable with other cars on the track. They added 4WD support and a few free cars next to the DLCs to show off this new feature of the physics engine. DLC #3 has been released, with some Lamborghinis, nice to see them deliver that promise. One of the Lambos in the game however is community content that has been promoted to be part of the official game (if I remeber correctly). All in all, if you are searching for some fun driving cars around track with great realism and don't care for AI or online multiplayer, you might want to try the game. Beware though, it is a simulator, so it is best played using a steering wheel, preferably a 900degree, so you can use the full lock of the cars.With the announcements of the Dream Pack #1 DLC I felt like I needed to warn potential buyers of this game.So here it goes:After having pre-purchased this game and having early-access being able to play the beta, it was a pretty good experience, the physics are okay most of the time and feel incredibly good with lower power rear wheel drive vehicles (eg: BMW M3 E30, BMW M3 E92, BMW Z4 E89, BMW 1 Series M Coupe, KTM Xbow, Lotus Evora SR, Lotus Elise SC)The front wheel drive cars do not feel that great to me, but as I am not a fan of these I will pass the subject.Now for the gameplay aspect:Menus are reasonably well designed and constructed, the options menus is very big with a lot of options (very nice to see). Just a little side note, menus are a seperate process from the game engine so you can let your PC cool down a bit between two races which is a nice segue to bring you to the graphics engine part of the game...Graphics, well oh boy... The optimisation... the obvious lack of thereof... The graphics look good but it's nothing extremely spectacular and yet I struggle to max out the settings and get a decent framerate (my system: 2-way SLI of GTX 680s, an i7 4770k @4GHz and 16GB of RAM)The in-game UI is very minimal and is not very well optimised for the multiplayer aspect of racing in my honest opinion, but Kunos has THE answer, modding... Yes, like the rest of the game, you can mod, and the UI is coded in Pyhton so you can either make your own or download one from someone else.I will not comment on multiplayer as my experience was sub-par to all the other simulations I've played but it was about 8-9 months ago so it might have changed.The AI is horrible absolutely not aware of you the race on rails they are not braking when you are and thus bump into you and thow you off track, the difficulty of the AI is also something strange... You, well I at least, can't keep up with the race leader, if you don't overtake the AI in the first 3 to 4 corners well the cars in front of you are going to vanish into the distance and you'll never catch up, interrestingly, if you turn the scenario the other way around, if you are the race leader, even if you don't drive that well and don't set lap records they'll never catch up (assuming you don't crash of course).So finally Assetto Corsa becomes a solo player hotlap simulator with... not a lot of content.37 cars of which probably half are just variants of the same car10 tracks where 3 of them have a second shorter variantA drag strip for quarter and full mileA dedicated drifting playground ""track""But this not a lot of content part will change in the same horrible fashion that game developpement has seen fit to go towards... Yes you guessed it, they have at least 1 DLC planned.Regarding the controls also very important to note, if you do not have a steering wheel... well do not try the keyboard and the controllers are a nightmare to use and to make it worse...You have to have a 900 degres steering wheel because the game supports it but also likes to map the 900 degres of rotation to a 270 degre steering wheel making the force feedback way too powerful and the steering way too sensitive and imprecise.Also apparently 45EUR (or your regional equivalent) is not enough... they want to add content but also fill their pockets because yes game devs also want to live they do not work for free, they are planning to release a DLC in the coming weeks... months...? but thanks to its naming scheme we know that it is far from the only DLC that is planned...What the F is wrong with game devs nowadays? Why DLC? Whay not wait to release the game for full price when the game is ready and finished, when there is content that make the game worth buying?At this point I don't know what I should do with it other than poke it with a really really long stick to see when new content is going to be added, and see how much the DLC will cost...As I generally do with any game that does include DLC in its roadmap... look at blizzard people please, they have a roadmap that says:1-dev2-bugfix3-release4-make sure everything is stable5-dev DLC*6-Bugfix DLC*7-release DLC*(8-repeat steps 4 to 7)* In Blizzard terms, DLC means expansion that is downloadable, your game does not tell you all the time ""this content is part of a DLC to unlock it buy the DLC"", no instead it doesn't show anything of it in-game, it does show however a nice thing on the Battle.net Launcher saying that there is an upgrade available for this game. A Blizzard expansion is typically more expansive than a DLC and for a good reason, it add a butt-ton of content and updates and patches and additional balancing and new awesome Pixar-like quality animations for cutscenes...PLEASE EVERYONE STOP BUYING DLC...And here isa little bonus (yay more text). It's the comment I left on the Assetto Corsa facebook page regarding the announcement of the Dream Pack #1 DLC:Not long ago they made something ""very fun and appropriate"". They released a video teaser of the contract deal they signed with Lamborghini in which they show 4 different cars that are not part of the game, and obviously advertises the game as having these cars in it when obviously no one has seen them in game... They're part of the upcomming DLC (not the lambos, these are clearly coming later)The modding aspect is great, allowing and encouraging modding is great. But making an engine adding 10-15 cars plus a racing variant of some of these cars and another engine another racing class (essantially the same model but with 300 HP instead of 350 and weighing 1100kg instead of 1250kg doesn't make it that different), 10 tracks and asking the community for their money and hard-work to make the game worth a damn by making mods, and asking to please not upload poor quality mods because it's an elite game, we want to have good content... (The please do not port is a genuine thing on the modding part of the assetto corsa forum, feel free to go and check it ot yourself)I am not happy about the money I spent on the game, it was too much for the content provided...I would prefer for them to remove their branding for the game, because frankly ""Your racing simulator""... Well it bloody hell isn't mine...Thanks for making it this far :)			"

												Fun driving game for a lap or 2. I was going to give it a bash again and see if I could get into it, however, I have just seen a certain 'Stefano Castillo' abuse a fan (who is a professional driver) on the Assetto Corsa forum, who fairly and respectfully asked a question and pointed out a few things within the Sim.Stefano is apparently the 'KS (Kunos Studios) Dev. Programmer' and his reaction to someone who has no doubt spent some money on the base game and DLC's is absolutely ridiculous. Full off expletives it went on and on and on. This guy needs some help.If this response had been given by a BIG and professional developer, all hell would break loose in the marketing department. I have a feeling, with attitudes like that, AC is going the way of Project Cars.Sooooooooo promising but not quite finished in noticeable area's backed up by a bunch of rude, arrogant, vile people who do not care about who buys the game.Grand Prix 2 by Microprose is better.

												This game refuses to let me play a race, and the developer refuses to offer any support. Whenever I start a game it asks me to install Steam, which is rather odd because I launched the game from Steam. If I click install, it makes me quit Steam which makes me quit Assetto Corsa, and it reinstalls Steam; but will do the same thing if I try to start another race. If I click cancel and dont install Steam, it just takes me back to the main menu in Assetto Corsa.I emailed the developer about this, and their response was to post my question to their forum, and hope that another person who paid money for this game will tell me why this game refuses to acknowledge I have Steam installed. I sent a response saying this was unacceptable, and the developer refuses to respond to that. Are you serious? You're charging $50 for a game, you refuse to fix bugs which are worse than game breaking (i can't even start a game for it to break), and you refuse to offer any support at all. Dont waste your money on this, the developer has essentially abandoned the product, and is simply defrauding Steam users purporting that this game works and is actively supported.			"

												A must-have for anybody interested in motorsport. The game runs well even on my current budget rig (AMD Athlon X4 760k, AMD R9 270, 8GB DDR3) and is easy to pick up and play with a controller. The game allows you to pick from a wide array of cars and tracks, and gives you the option to change each car's setup to your liking. Mod support means that you'll have plenty of community content to mess around with as well. DLCs also add more cars and tracks if you're serious about the game. The only negative I can think of is that people report a lot of ""rubber-banding"" and other latency issues during online play.			"

												Apart from being not a fully finished game, having trouble with wanky AI Drivers, Server Connections and so on it's quite a good racing simulator. And it is a Simulator, which needs some practice and consistence. The amount of cars and tracks off-the-box isn't that high, but the quality of them is. Having a look at Spa for example, it's a great detailed and laser-scanned track, which is a sheer pleasure to drive at. Same thing with the stock driving vehicles - it's a reward if you learn to handle them. Of course, there is no rain like in pCARS, no night or weather at all, not that much eye candy stuff in Assetto Corsa. Kunos SImulazioni focused on the driving and the physics of the vehicles and with that it delivers excellent force feedback on many supported wheels. Probably the most outstanding thing is the modding community, as it's really active and gets sometimes even featured by KS, which is great. The driving community on the other side is like in almost every other game full of nerds, midskillers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s alike. Don't expect the best experience, when you join a server with random people in it. ...oh and better wait at Spa and look how they manage to get the first corner after the start ;) Seriously, it's fun and if you're into cars anyway, check it out! Thumbs up here!			"

												I have never ever enjoyed so much hot lapping in a racing game.I know it's a racing game but much of my time has been spent hot lapping because there is no racing game that has made it so enjoyable just taking in the car solo, one at a time. I'm beginning to start racing only after passing the 100 hours.Every track and car needs to be learned, just like in RL. If you don't know the track well you're not going to be competitive. The AI races with realistic aggressiveness, meaning they don't use you as a brake in corners. To me this is THE best racing game/simulation. I wished they had weather and night racing though. But as is, it's a perfect racing game/simulation that's friendly on the hardware.If you have some interest in racing game, whether you already own a wheel or otherwise, get this game. Enough said.

												Assetto Corsa is a half finished game and I cannot recommend it.  AC works fine as a hotlapping sim.  You'll ohh and ahh at the graphics but that's largely all there is here.  For something to be called ""your racing simulator"", there actually has to be racing involved.  It should be called ""Your Hotlapping Simulator"".- No Single Player Pit stops- No Rolling starts- No weather- No Night racing-The Single player portion is largely worthless.  The AI is not worth running against.  They run off track, run over each other, and run into the back and sides of the player.  -Each time Kunos ""improves"" their game, it breaks some other part (sound for modded cars, graphics, etc- The force feedback is far over exxagerated- The tire model is laughable compared to other sims and thus the reason it is changed with each patch.- you'll cringe at the CPU Occupancy errors stating your CPU is at 99 percent when while running a CPU monitor, it shows 60 percent usage-If you have Windows 10, forget about running this sim.  Devs on the official forums response is to reinstall windows or DDU your graphics drivers (in other words, they can't fix it).Wretched game In my opinion.  Had the refund option been in place when I purchased it, this turd would have gone back to Kunos.			"

								if you're into racing simulators, it appears this is going to be the one to beat. Graphically it utterly trounces Gran Turismo and Forza, and as far as physics behavior, even in its very early pre-release stage, it ties or beats the latest iteration of Gran Turismo and leaves Forza far behind. Best of all, it's on the PC, not a console. If you're looking for an arcade racer like NFS, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a simulator, I can already tell this is going to be an incredible addition to the racing sim genre.			"

												Jacko Rating 9.5/10Assetto Corsa is a brilliant simulation racer with especially good attention to detail and controller/Force Feedback.Let's breakdown the review into sections;General - This game provides a dozen different tracks with variations to these as extra tracks along with approx 60 cars depending on what DLC you have bought.  Its a real racer with many different settings in order to create the perfect simulation experience for you.  Hardcore racers can adjust things so its very difficult and beginers can tweak things down and turn on assists, a plethera of settings here.  You have various styles of racing from flag to flag or time trials and a campaign for single players as well as mutli player options and online leaderboards to keep you occupied.Graphics - Pretty slick but not as polished as perhaps Forza or Project Cars.  The details are there it is just not as eye poppoing as some other titles.  The tracks are to my knowledge a true to life depiction of the real ones and the cars are faithfully represented here.Audio - I found the audio to be very good with respect to the engine noises as well as the ambient sounds such as tyre squeels and exhaust backfires etc.  Music if you have it on is not bad but who cares when you are racing.Gameplay - Here is where the game excells and this is the best and the closest thing to real life racing I have ever played.  You will feel every bump, indent and parts of the tracks and the cars handle uniquely which means each one is a pleasure to master.  The feedback you get is amazing and this game begs for a proper racing wheel although you can still play and win with a controller.If you like real racing sims and prefer a detailed difficult racing game to a simcade then this game is for you.Superb, addictive and realistic sums up this pearl of a game.Race On!

Early Access Review
								Possibly the most promising racing simulator available on the market today.You can make a long list of comparison points between different racing sims. More content, better graphics, et cetera, but at the core every racing sim should be compared by the one thing they all share in common, the driving model.And this is where AC shines. The feel of the cars on the road are probably the closest any sim has come to replicating real life while importantly staying fun. Cars don't feel overly slippery and lack grip to add extra challenge and frustrate players. On the other hand they aren't glued to the track like arcade racers and can be difficult to control when pushing to the limit. It's a driving model that hooks you in and wants you to get better no matter the car you're in. Assists like traction control, stability control, ABS and driving lines also feature to help newcomers to racing sims get up to speed.While it might be a tad lacking in content in it's current early access state, the commitment to future content is evident and the quality of said content is fantastic. Highly detailed cars, authentic sounds and laser-scanned circuits meaning each official circuit in this game is as close as we'll likely get to actually racing the circuits ourselves. While Project CARS hogs the limelight with it's graphical quality and amount of official content, no car there truly feels as fun to drive there as they do in AC. And AC isn't a bad looking game at all might I add, check the screens and videos for yourself.To top it off, this game is also 100% moddable. The amount of custom cars and tracks already available in early access state is staggering and the quality of some of these is incredible. While PCARS might have more base content, it's lack of mod support limits it's future in the community, whereas AC could last for years with new content being released all the time by Kunos and it's playerbase respectively.Single player right now is limited to single race weekends and hotlapping, but a career mode of some fashion will appear when the game is fully released. Multiplayer is also constantly improving and already provides for excellent races that can only get better as the netcode is refined and more features are added.If you have a wheel, buy this now and you'll have no regrets. If you have a controller and want a racing game that's more challenging than any other racing game, buy this now and you'll have no regrets.			"

								Updated!Old conclusion:In the end there is no need to hesitate if you want a real race sim but didnt know which one to choose or if you want to take a break or step up from race ""games"" and want the real deal. You found it right here - Assetto Corsa!**Update**Ok, now i've clocked 500+ hours in Assetto Corsa, and what is my view now? It has changed - for the better.Content:We got more content since last time. A couple of cars and i think a track (Nurnburg GP). The latest of cars was the 98T - a mechanical monster! Raced in the 80's using carbon fiber and around 1300BHP with a weight of only 540Kg its fair to say its a scary beast, and beautiful modeling and execution regarding physics and FFB. Just as good as the other cars in this sim. The car is a thrill ride. Content wise we have a good range from street, super cars, GT and formula. And a good amount of laser scanned tracks that got character thanks to the collision layer which adds the bumps/dips/noise that our wheels go over which also translates awesomely to the wheel through FFB. Also worth mentioning is that Kunos landed more licenses and will give us more free content that wasnt promised at start. For one we will get the Corvette C7 included in the price! And a GT version will come in the much anticipated Nordschleife DLC. More about that further down!Multiplayer:Last time i wrote the review there was no multi player - there is now. And although lacking a bit its amazing fun. Funnier than any sim or race game ive done because of the excellent true to life physics and FFB. The new netcode that was just coded in the fluidity is great. Even driving against people across the planet they look smooth and you can have tight races - which is super. Very happy with the netcode upgrade to say the least. We also now have ""slipstream"" activated in MP which means you can go up behind someone and then get a boost from that cars ""air pocket"". This changes MP racing a lot!We also got FREEJOIN which means you can join in progress and even exit when you feel like it and change car if available (not during race). This is also a huge step up from earlier MP where you chose your car and that was it.Third good thing is that the admins are getting more and more power to force assists off. This came in the last patches and we can now force damage, fuel and tyre wear so the races get more equal. We are still waiting to be able to force Stability Control, ABS and TC, but im sure its coming very soon. This is where AC is lacking a little atm. Not being able to force all assists off and no real penality system yet. There will be however so its nothing to get hanged up on. Kunos even testing their own build with simple pitstops which was not announced for the 1.0 version. Maybe it wont come, but at least we know they are testing it. Good enough for me. So far they added things that were not scheduled for 1.0 so... :)Graphics:Kunos have upgraded the graphics by adding more effects and post processing. You can now make your own filter profiles and switch them while on track! So you tweak a lot of effects such as color, exposure, blur, vignette and a whole range of effects giving amazing results. You can make as many filters as you like and even share them with others. This way you can get great looking graphics without doing yourself but instead download a filter (or more) from someone else. Do you like realistic looking? More saturated with cool effect? Its up to you - you choose. No forcing by the developers. Just like it should be - freedom.Sounds:Nothing has happened in the sound engine since before, but(!) something IS happening as i write this. Luca, the sound master of Kunos is working hard to implement FMOD into Assetto Corsa! This is basically technology to have lots of effects on each sound. Reverb, occlusion etc. Trust me when i say that the cars will sound amazing when this gets implemented. Because FMOD has a good track record in other games like Forza 5 for example plus a whole range of other games. It will make a huge difference. Looking forward to this big time because sounds are one of the greatest immersion creators in games/sims. Hell, in any entertainment!Mods:Kunos (the developers) already released the tools for track/cars finalizing, and we already seen lots of tracks and a bunch of cars already. Some of the cars are top notch quality with amazing modeling, phyics and sounds. Some scratch made tracks have been made as well and they are equally amazing. These things take time to create and perfect so we also got a ton of track conversions from other sims/games (with permission) and i dont lie when i say that the track number have exploded! And from here and forward there will be more and more and more. Kunos endorse modding and help any way they can so this title will have a large library of tracks, cars and apps to enjoy.DLC (or further development of AC):So far the first DLC will be the grand track Nordschleife, and of course its being laser scanned with the latest techniques. Every little dip/bump will be there and every object around the track is in its correct place. This DLC will also feature 10 GT cars. Some of them includes Corvette, RUF and Nissan. There might be more to this DLC, but we have to wait and see. Me and everyone i know is looking forward to it big time. I hope Kunos will be able to sustain themselves by making juicy, meaty DLC's with content we racers want. There is a classic DLC as well i think with SPA and a lot of old powerful cars. Lots to look forward to since Kunos have stated they will improve and build on Assetto Corsa for 5 years!Final word:As you can imagine, as a simmer and race fan i cant get enough of AC. Mainly because of the physics and FFB which is at top class. Any sim/race game i try i cant stay long because its miles away from the feeling of AC. This sim feels like driving a real car, and its challening and tons of fun. Races are very intense thanks to that, and its easy to get addicted to the feeling. Kunos goes the extra mile making sure Assetto Corsa will be in the top which we see when they keep adding things that was never on the agenda from start. They keep improving the sim beyond what i thought they would which is amazing. And its taking its time because they are but a few very talented developers, but its worth its wait because the sim is already a meaty excellent driving experience, and i cant wait to see and play it in a couple of months time. Its almost so i want to freeze myself to see how excellent it is in the near future, but at the same time i cant stop playing it so thats a no go. I will just have to continue enjoying myself and take it as it comes. :)Long review. Im not good at writing them, sorry for that. But i still stand by what i wrote at first. If you want to feel that you drive a REAL car then AC is for you. The driving experience is already there and the details around it is being built up patch by patch. Kunos have impressed me, and im not easy to impress since i require depth and authenticity. Also a big plus is developers who stay close to their customers and listen, and they do. So, im totally sold on this experience and i hope to see you too on the track soon! ;)PS. the price they ask is low, very low, for a high end product as this one. This is the same type of simulator real car companies use!			"

								I've been playing driving sims for a few years now and this is without doubt the best ever. It's not just the beautiful graphics/artwork, the handling physics are by far the most advanced too. I'm usually a multi-player junkie but at the time of writing this (early access), the MP hasn't been released yet but I've already clocked up more than 115 hours just hot lapping. Not something I've done with any other game.If you like driving games, whether sims or arcade, this is a must buy for you!The developers, Kunos Simulazioni, are a small team of 12 Italian guys with a passion for cars, fast cars. They have out done the competition not only with their product but also with their support in forum, ironing out bugs and issues that have to be expected at beta stage, but also listening to suggestions from the community to make the game better for everyone.  All of the cars have been meticulously reproduced to an exacting standard. Telemetry data has been gathered directly from the manufacturers of every single car and applied to the unique physics engine to give the most accurate driving/racing experience possible to date on a PC or console.They have also laser scanned every inch of every track, including Silverstone, Imola, Monza and many more. And thanks to a community vote, laser scanning of Nordschleife is due to start soon for release in Sept 2014!Anyway, enough typing from me. It's time to get back to the Ferrari F40 at Imola!			"

												This simulator is, with its excellent performance easily hitting the hundreds of frames per second in some cases, a gift to the virtual reality community. With such a steady and high framerate, unlike its competitors, Assetto Corsa does NOT constantly rely on framerate smoothing mechanisms like Asynchronous Timewarp, rather delivering VR's required 75 or 90 frames per second without problem.I've had the honor of trying AC in both the Oculus DK2 and the consumer model. It's quite a treat as it rivals iRacing in terms of fluidity and smoothness, while not being a massive hit on the bank. An excellent choice for your first VR simulator pick!I must stress the fact that SteamVR/HTC VIVE owners would rave over this title if it had support implemented for it. Given SteamVR doesn't make use of Asynchronous Timewarp, it's software like this that'll benefit SteamVR because the game can simply keep up the headset's required framerate without a single hitch. I highly encourage the devs of AC to continue this awesome VR support and consider doing with SteamVR as well! VIVE owners will love you for it!Video first impressions with the Oculus Rift CV1

												As a simulator this game is absolutely incredible. The physics are a bit unforgiving if you drive beyond your limits, as it should be. Furthermore, the graphics look wonderful (Use the Glide filter to prevent brightness adjustment, by the way) and the selection of cars both mod and official are pretty decent.As a racing game in today's market, it's not that great. Single-player AI is pants-on-head stupid, the track selection is incredibly small, and multiplayer is almost entirely unplayable at 200+ ping. Official leagues don't exist, public lobbies are filled with idiots, and you'll rarely ever find a good room of people using any of the more interesting disciplines, like the Lotus Eleven.If you are a racing simulation enthusiast, this is a decent choice for you. I love driving the Mercedes 190E DTM around the Nordschleife, right where it belongs. The tracks are all very well done, and some of the mod tracks and cars are unbelievably fun and/or to AC's laser-scanned standards. Lake Louise is a fun loop around the Canadian Rockies, and Bridgehampton is just as bumpy as you'd expect a race track situated in Long Island to be. You can drive a Supercharged Cobra 427, but you can grab the mod with the Competition and Street versions as well. There's also a very good NA Miata mod.If you are anything but an enthusiast, maybe hold off until there is a bigger selection of cars and tracks, or find a different sim to play. I can't recommend this game because SPR is almost broken and MPR is unplayable, if not frustrating.			"

												EDIT: Ok, so i have lightened up a little since last time. Since the 1.5 update i have been playing it sporadic, with so much love that i almost cant explain it. But it still misses out on rain wich i think it's a disgrace to the Ayrton Senna legacy, if they continue to let it out. Monaco too.... So my thumb stays down until further notice. No rain no gain.  ""The waaaiting is the hardest part"" Tom Petty once sang. I think it describes this sim perfectly since there are lots of promises but no will of doing them justice.  Green hell with DLC cars was kinda expected september this year but we still havent seen it. It's a good racing game but the waiting is the hardest part as said before.  I will certainly never buy an early access game ever again.			"

								For shear driving pleasure out on the track, Assetto Corsa is where it's at. I'm yet to find a game that does my G27 justice in the way that Assetto Corsa has - On the limit of grip the feedback is superb and the physics/handling seem bang on to me. Whilst this is still an early build of the game and the content/features are a little light, what is there is fantastic. I have high hopes for future development of this game. In particular, a few Japanese cars wouldn't go a-miss. To summarise: if you're a motorsport fan, BUY IT! 9/10 for what's currently present.			"

												In the old days of PC racing games - and by old I don't mean too old but think mid 2000s, there weren't many choices. Sure, there are plenty of arcade racers, but many of them unfortunately were forgotten and relegated to the proverbial dustbin of history (though there are ones that still thrive, like TrackMania and Whiplash). As for more realistic games, there were a few titles PC players could choose from; Simbin with their GTR2 and Race 07 titles, ISI with rFactor, Papyrus (RIP) with Nascar Racing 2003 and even though they were incredibly arcadey, EA's Need for Speed, among others. However, two franchises never came to PC and stayed console only - those being Gran Turismo (for PlayStation), and Forza (for xBox). And PC players, myself included, yearned for a great racing game that had the graphics of those games whilst the level of realism offered by more hardcore games like the SimBin games or rFactor. This isn't to say PC didn't have good games, but what the consoles got was something else altogether. Fast-forward a few years and here we have a game developed by a small Italian firm named Kunos Simulazioni. Their goal was to produce a realistic racing game that has the intricate graphics offered by console games (at least, that's what I gather with this game; I assume that's what the devs were going for). It was given a fancy Italian name because what is more Italian than race cars? I digress, but anway, Assetto Corsa, when it was first released, was eye opening. Who would've thought that a game of this caliper would come to PC? Granted, Kunos aren't exactly a new firm; they did produce NetKar Pro, but I've never played that game, so I cannot say what it is like. However, what I can say about Assetto Corsa is this: it's a really good game, but it does have some issues.The first thing I noticed about this game after setting up my race wheel was the force feedback. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the force feedback is incredibly well done. The fact that you can actually feel the road while driving is astounding, and because of this gives me confidence in what the car is doing. Every kerb, every crack in the road is felt but not exaggerated, making playing fun and exciting. It makes rFactor's limited force feedback feel like mushy peas in comparison. I will say this; you might've noticed I said ""race wheel."" Yes, this is a game that benifits incredibly from a game wheel with force feedback, or at the very least, a controller with force feedback. Keyboard control is possible, but it detracts from the game and using a keyboard removes one of the most highly praised parts of the game. The game is more than just force feedback though. What I really like about this game is how easy to drive a good number of cars are. I know a lot of people are going to say ""but the GT3 cars should be incredibly twitchy and nervous and blah blah blah"" but hear this: GT3 cars are meant for regional racing series (like Blancpain, Super GT GT300, or Dutch Supercar Challenge) and also meant for ""gentleman drivers."" What is a gentleman driver? Simply put, someone with limited (or in some cases, no) race experience that wants to race. It's no wonder these cars are going to be easier to drive than say, the Lotus 98T or the Ferrari 312T or even the new McLaren F1-GTR. Sure, there are some hard to drive cars in the game; the 3 I mentioned earlier are good examples of that. However, not everything requires superhuman skill to drive. And for that, I give Assetto Corsa high marks. I also love the tracks; they are incredibly well done and I love the atmosphere that surrounds them. Whether it is something as primitive or ""organic"" as the Nordschelife or as high tech as the Nurburgring GP circuit, you get a good idea on how the track feels. And finally, no more awkward versions of Spa! The one in this game is one of the most realistic versions out there.Onto graphics; what can I say? They're great. Just take a look at some screenshots. Kunos has easily matched the graphics level of the console games, with highly detailed car models and tracks. The UI is unobtrusive, though can get a bit clunky trying to select cars and skins. Sounds are for the most part good, though there are some better third party sounds available. I guess that is a good thing since they can be replaced, but by the same token you'd think Kunos would've done good sounds themselves; I guess it was a cost issue. Oh well.Now the things this game needs fixed, and there are a bunch of them.First is netcode in multiplayer. Quite frankly, it needs reworking. A small tap from one car could send another car flying off like some sort of Newton's Cradle. It's hilarious at first, but there needs something to be done about that. Sure, at high speed having cars bounce off each other in two different directions makes sense but not while the cars are going 20 or so mph. Multiplayer racing, while good for the most part, does need improvement because of that. Second is optimization and stability, which this game needs. I know piling on mod after mod can make the game more unstable, but ever since the game started using FMOD for sounds I have been having more and more sound crashes, making playing a sort of ticking time bomb. It especially sucks when you're on a great hotlap and suddenly the game goes six feet under. Optimization is sorely needed as well. I understand with the Dream Pack update there were CPU optimizations brought in, which is great, but there need to be graphic ones as well. Third is the general state of the game. And I don't mean ""Is this game going to die out or not"" because right now I feel that Kunos is doing its best to keep the game ship shape. However, what direction does Kunos want to take this game in? As a hotlap game, it's great, but put any sort of AI racing and it's quite frankly subpar. Multiplayer has its own issues to deal with, and on top of that the game has probably one of the most insipid penalty systems in any racing game. Going off track - even if there is no advantage gained - grants you either a 10 second penalty OR you have to slow down to 30MPH. This is incredibly dumb and in multiplayer situations it can lead to some stupid crashes. I know the first thing people will say is ""well don't go off track"" but let's face it; you are bound to go off track sooner or later. But back to what this game wants to be; does it want to become the next rFactor? the next Gran Turismo/Forza? Or both? It is hard to say, and maybe Kunos doesn't know either. In all, this is a great racing game, and is a breath of fresh air that PC players desperately needed. The collection of cars and tracks is great, and the modding community is thriving, producing some content that rivals the stock content. Would I recommend buying it? Yes, but if it's on sale with the DLC as well. And when Kunos does fix the issues and takes the game in whatever direction they choose, the game will be on every PC racer's bucket list to play.			"

												I'm a real life driver. No I don't mean professional driver or track day'er. I drive to work, Tescos and so forth like the typical player. I was looking for a game that gave me a ""realistic"" feel in terms of acceleration, braking, turning, road feel etc. Asseto Corsa delivered with flying colours or shall I say my Thrustmaster TX did? Actually no, I've played a few ""arcade"" / semi simulated games and this by far gives you the best force feedback as if you were driving on a real road surface (I haven’t Project Cars but i read the reviews for both before choosing Asseto Corsa.. the consensus was that AC had a more realistic feel).Interestingly I decided to use my real life car around the track but had opportunity to coach with an amateur rally driver. He gave my some tips when cornering/braking for turns. That worked well on the real life track so I thought I would apply the exact same concept to Asseto Corsa... Before my ""real life"" lesson, the Nürburgring (Tourist)I was hitting around 7.30ish with the 599 XX (admittedly that was slow in general)... When I applied real life track day tips, my time reduced to around 6.58. Let that be the testament of translating real-life driving to their in-game physics engine are phenomenal. Whenever I play AC, it DOES feel like I'm driving a real car.That said it does just feel like when you play online, you are just competing to show off lap-times so it can get very tiresome if you encounter some of the “professional drivers in Asseto Corsa who take the game extremely seriously..” "

												After enjoying racing sims for the past seven years AC will hopefully keep the enjoyment coming.I'm very keen on seeing how the multi-player turns out and how strong the league scene will be.I much prefer league racing over pick up racing ( iRacing official series / open servers ) as league racing tends to be a lot cleaner.As i can only really do one night a week for league racing ( work reasons ) I am also hoping for a good single player experiece.From the few hours I've spent on AC I'm very impressed with how the cars handle, especially at low speed corners where some sims behave very enexpectedly.Any mishap is clearly a ""oh I did this or that wrong"" not a ""WTF"" moment.Graphics wise i have no problems getting 90FPS running triple monitors with a GTX680 at moderate settings.Hopefully AC will still do more optimizing so when we have multiple cars on track the frames won't take a nose dive.All in all I'm impressed with what I've seen so far and infact have gifted AC to one of my sim racing friends.edit: In fact make that gifted to two friends.

												So as far as realism goes, Very good. Looks over all, Very good. Online mutiplayer, garbage. Carreer mode, meh at best. PROS: Looks very nice while playing. The driving aspect is good through controller and a wheel is best! (DUH)  Tracks are fun, and the variety of cars is great.CONS: I started out with Career mode. Let me tell ya. Borin as hell. No realistic feel what so ever. They are dumb AI. Single line race and easy to predict. Easy to get first place. Dont even have to finish the race. Get in first place and just stop in front of the other cars and watch them retire. Then you can retire and walla.Mutiplayer: (sigh) This is where it all goes wrong! I was hoping for a very fast pace join in and race game. This is not it. Join in and watch peeps screw off is more like it. Trying to get the feel for the track/qualifying is a problem simply due to the other people. There are always people crashing into you for fun.  Starting  a race can take up to 20 mins before any magic starts to happen, and when it finally does start, you got those peeps that are not serious and want to crash. I thought thats what GTA is for. Over all It doesnt take long before I sign into a another game and have a dissapointed view of this game. THE FIX: Dont play this game, Play a different one. (For me at least). My friend who convinced me to get this game say's otherwise.			"

												I love this game. I really do. But I can not recommend this game at all. I bought this game when it was in early access for about $35.00. I have watched this game grow into what it is today and now you can just see greed taking over the developers, I have spent 120+ hours waiting for new cars with every update but now they have DLC. It would be even worse for the people who bought this game now for $55.00.  So on top of the original price tag of $55.00 people still need to pay $17.00 for the dream pack. What an utter display of corporate greed. (They also say that it is their first dream pack that came out and implying that there are going to be more. I'm sorry but no. I just can't recommend it.)

												This game feels just great. It looks good as well. You get plenty of cars and tracks and probably more in the future. You get the option to modify your car exactly to the way you like it.Is it all great then? No. the penalty system is idiotic. You get your braking wrong and slide of the track and get a 5 second penalty and you must slow down to 50 km/h or lose your throttle for 5 seconds. It also gives you the penalty if some maniac pushes you off the track which is frustrating.Overall I'd say this game is good fun, and if the devs remove the current penalty system it might be the best racing game in the history of the universe ( and whatever was before that ).

								This is the most realistic racecar simulator at this date. The real next generation in simracing. I've tried every other software possible in my quest to learn driving fast and this comes closest to reality. Even at it's early stage without multiplayer or AI it's a joy to drive around on the beautiful, laser scanned tracks. If you don't like snap oversteering, unexplainable spins and strange car behaviour, give this title a chance. You'll not be disappointed.			"

Runs very smooth on my moderate system with graphics maxed out, sounds great, driving model is incredible.  I have had more fun just driving cars around the track in this title than I have had in many, many other sims.  Buy it now.			"

												As a man who never really played racing sims before, I've got to admit that this is the game that convinced me that sims can be as fun as an arcade but much more demanding which gives some sort of satisfaction after winning the race. Graphically it also looks stunning, although it would be cool if the trees looked a bit better. But that's really the only concern I have :D..			"

								It might lack the 'shiney' of a certain near to release driving game/sim but this has BUCKETLOADS of playability.  The handling of each vehicle so far is amazing.  I have played a lot of driving games, barring full sim games like RFactor, and you really can feel each wheel through the steering wheel.  You can instantly feel which rear wheel is stepping out and can react accordingly before it is to late.  The in cab camera view is spot on.  The way it tilts into the corners is sublime.  It is so well done you don't even notice it, which to me means it is just right.I play this with my G27 with a brake modification and everything just works perfectly.  It is one of the very few driving games I haven't had to spend hours calibrating.I have one very minor gripe, which I add is a personal thing, I find the menu system quite clunky and a little unclear in what you are setting up.  Having said that this game is still in early development and i wouldn't be surprised if this is revised at some point.Absolutely love it.  If you are a fan of driving games this is a MUST.Remember gameplay over shiney is always king. "

												All right I've just redone this review 8/9/2015 at 1:00A.M. Okay so let me put it this way in level of realism from lowest to highest  Project Cars> Assetto Corsa > Iracing. Iracing is in fact the MOST realistic sim out there in terms of physics, handling, and car behaviour in general due to its laser  scanning and ultra realistic tire models so thats what you would get if you were 100% serious about sim racing (I have all 3 of these sims). Unfortunately its not budget having to pay for cars tracks and subscriptions so the next best thing for simmers is this. The physics arent as good as Iracing but they are waaayyy more realistic than Pcars. The graphics also being pretty decent with being slightly better than Iracing (Iracing has AMAZING reflections on the cars). If your just starting out this is good game for you to get into sim racing (YOU NEED A WHEEL TO SIM RACE) if you have something like a G27. I'm not rich so when I upgrade I can't get any direct drive wheels ($2000 each) so I'm getting a fanatec after being in the sim racing community for a while. So I'm going to kinda do a comparison for all of you here of all three games to see what best suits you. I have been playing sim games since GT Legends (thats where I started) so I'm pretty aquainted with racing games by now and you can trust my info on this though this is not my most playes sim racer.   Pcars                              -Best Graphics              -Arcade physics            -Decent Tracks            -Large track variety         -Most Cars (no mods)        -Well modeled cars          -No Mod support                 -Controler recomended   -Offline play              -Decent Price -Good for fun   Assetto Corsa  -Middle Graphics-Semi Sim physics-Decent tracks-Decent track Variety-2nd most cars (no mods) -Well modeled cars-Mod support-Controler not recomended-Offline Play -Decent Price-Good for begining simmers   Iracing-Worst graphics (of the three)-Full blown sim physics-Laser scanned tracks (realistic)-Decent Track Variety- Least cars (No mods)-Extremely detailed cars-No mod support-Controler Not recomended-No offline play-Expensive-Good for experienced simmersI hope this helped all who read have a better grasp on these games to make a wise decision on what they shoudl buy based on what they need and what these three sims have to offer. If you found this helpful please give me a thumbs up so others can see. Thank you for reading and I hope all of you have fun out there racing!			"

												This review is more for controller users:Assetto Corsa is nothing short of fantastic. Physics are phenomenal, even at an alpha state. Graphics are very good, and the gameplay customisibility(modding support) are just great bonuses to the game. I have tried this out on a G27 on my friends account and the steering wheel is obviously the preferred way to play this game. Nothing will match that in terms of preciseness and accuracy to actually driving the real thing.Now for controllers. I have an Xbox One controller. When I first played the game, it gave me the CPU occupency level of over 95%. I can tell that it's just a bug and the work around for it, while it is tedious, is completely fine. Just set the Xbox One Controller as a steering wheel and manually map out the commands. Xbox 360 Controllers already have a profile so it's good to go, but if you have an Xbox One controller, it's best to manually set it up, until the future patches come in enabling full support of the XOne. Gameplay with the controller : This game is just straight up difficult with the controller unless you sink in a lot of hours, fiddle with the setup and find a good setup. I am about 3-6 seconds slower than a wheel time that I see on YouTube on Monza, depending on the car. Keep in mind this should get better once I understand the corners, braking points, and set ups to how the cars work as I move forth with the game. Is the game playable with the controller? Simple answer: Yes. There are people who say it isn't but it is playable. You just need to have patience and fiddle with the settings ALOT to find your ""cup of tea."" After that, you will get better. I assure you. If you buy this game and you have a controller, be patient. Don't give up. Stay focused on your driving and be ready to troubleshoot your errors like no other. This is an amazing driving simulator. It is not an arcade game. Give feedback to the developers about your controller settings and just keep on at it. You will learn to love this game. I know itWheel users, do yourself a favor and buy this game. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this review. You shouldn't have been reading it. You have a wheel. This is a simulator. It's like PB and J, Cookies and Cream, Cheese and Pizza. If you're not into that stuff, just know this. Your wheel will love the game more than you do.9/10 (Due to controller support but it should be fixed in the upcoming patches).Happy Driving :)***Edit as of 12/23/2014*** The game is out as a 1.00 release, and while to some, it doesn't feel like a complete release, it is definitely WAYYY better than it was when I did this review. The controller issue got fixed for me so the game is a beauty to play. This is a must have for driving enthusiasts.			"

								This is becoming the benchmark simulation racer, and the force feedback is one of the very best already in this early stage. The bi weekly updates introduces new cars, tracks and game modes all up until the final release in Q1 2014. It's a bargain to buy this with 22% off. It's amazing to just drive hot laps for hours due to the fantastic physics engine in Assetto Corsa!Just buy it; if you're the least interested in sim racing this is a safe bet. Simple as that.			"

Beautiful modelling and handling, coupled with modding, this game has a bright future. Still a long way from where it could be in respects to UI and Race Rules, but that will come in time. I would like to see safety cars, flags, etc. Option for rolling starts etc. Oh and of course 24 hour racing with rain :)			"

												A great all around package, boasting some of the best road cars around, flashy yet crisp graphics, and a very good looking UI compared to the competitors. It's not the top simulation on the market, but it is a great stepping stone for those looking to move beyond simcade games into something  more realistic. While playable with a contrroller, you definitely want a full force feedback wheel to get the most out of this one. Below I will go over the pros and cons in a bit more detail:Pros    -the graphics look fantastic, and it isn't too demanding on your PC to get a beautiful looking race environment            - the physics, while not mind blowing, are more than sufficient to provide decent racing, and fun driving, particularly the road cars. Definitely leaps and bounds above what gran Turismo, Forza and PCars are doing in this department             -the car selection is great. While other games have done race cars to death, Assetto Corsa has the best selection of road cars around, from Ferraris to Mustangs and everything in between. It also has race cars, but the road cars really stand out, and with the above average physics and great graphics, it really makes for a truly immersive experience              -the laser scanned tracks are extremely detailed and stunning to look at, really bringing the experience together-BEST.DRIFTING.ANYWHERE......yes, you can drift here. Yes, it is awesome               -Force feedback isn't the best on the market by any means, but it gives you a good idea of what your car is doing and will help you master the art of controlling it. Still, above average and better than most everything other than GSCE and RFactor 2                -Updates. Kunos is always updating and improving Assetto Corsa, along with releasing more content. We are on Tire Model 7, and have had 3 dlc packs, free content, and have more being relesed all the time. Japan pack today!!!               -The mods. This title has a great modding community behind it, many modders carried over from RFactor, who put out tons of quality content. The mods work great here, and much of the time are indistinguishable from stock content Cons     -The sounds are far from perfect, and a greater range is needed (a bit bland, need to work on the highs and lows for the growls and whines of real cars). UPDATE: The Japan pack is a step in the right direction, and with a high quality set of headphones, they actually have quite decent range             -The AI started off as some of the worst anywhere, slow and stupid. They have since greatly improved, but they still need a good bit of work. Sometimes they are randomly aggressive, but can end up in a train, ""racing"" single file if your unlucky. It's hard to find a good match for your skill level, 98% I beat them on most tracks, 100% and I rarely see them beyond lap 3             -The online competition. I can't really fault Kunos for this, but while better than the Gran Turismo/Forza crowd, you still do get a lot of noobs and wreckers. I think it's mostly because, as I mentioned before, Assetto Corsa is used as a stepping stone from racing games to true simulations. Maybe I am just spoiled  from iRacing and RFactor 2 Leagues, but I am yet to have a race where half the field is still racing by lap 5. It could really do with a skill matching/ranked racing system.As you see, the pros far outweigh the cons, and Assetto Corsa is a worthy purchase for any sim racer or car afficianado. With a sense of realism foreign to most gamers, it will have you kicking the backend around corners and fighting to gain each second. It still is far from perfect, and I still prefer RFactor 2 physics, and iRacing's competitive racing, but to just hop in a dream car like a Ferrari 458 or Corvette Stingray and tear up the track, Assetto Corsa reigns supreme. And with the constant inprovements, updates and new content being released all the times, who knows what the future of this title holds.  A solid 8/10 from me.			"

												I'm not a big gamer, I only ever play the Nurburgring, I use a Logitech G25 with separate shifter and pedals. I'm in my mid 40's with a family so can't spend day in day out practicing. I've driven the real Nordschleife 'tourist' circuit in a Jaguar XF Sport with other real cars on track too. (I'd like to see complete random cars on track, that start in random positions of the circuit when you do a free practice for added realism!) I got this game on early access (and spent most of my time on Monza until the Nurburgring made it's glorious appearance.) So this review is ONLY based on a comparison for aforementioned track. I run a Crossfire R290 reference setup on a 32GB Asus ROG Tytan (i7-4970)  so graphically, my setup should handle anything and everything I throw at it. Assetto Corsa looks great, Project CARS looks a bit greater however the ForceFeedback on PCars is awful. AC on the other hand gets it spot on. Touch a rumble strip in AC, you rumble. Touch a rumble strip in PCars, nothing. (most of the time.) PCars offers more in the way of variety and content (a lot more to be honest) but if I'm after a quick(ish) lap of my favourite track, I come back to AC. It's not quite as pretty but plays much better with a heightened sense of reality that I look for in a Sim.  "

												I have change my mind about this game for several reasons. This game is NOT complete, if you have brought it wanting and expecting a £35.00 (At the time of writing) game, then you are going to be dissapointed. Don't let them fool you this IS still in early acsess.A list of things that are broken:Most conserningly for a 'complete' game, the A.I is the worst I have seen in a racing game in along time. They do not know where you are on the track, and will in effect ram you off the road by overtaking in the worst points. This also means that the career is only possible if you are on easy and some kind of God. Also it makes any race very annoying. I may not be the greatest driver, but getting more than third in most races in impossible.The down-shifting is broken. It will wait untill the car is at 3000 RPM untill it changes down.You need a wheel, otherwise it is unplayable, meaning it in NOT a relaxing game to sit down and play.There are some, good things, one major thing is that the handling physics ARE good, but you will only get 20 hours gameplay max from hot-lapping.My outcome is that this game is to damn expencive.(P.S I do relise that the dev's put alot of hard word into this game, and I think that this game, whilst in my OPINION is not the greatest at the moment this COULD be an exquisit game. It just not worth £35.00 yet. I will continue following this game and I will change this Review when the next big update comes out)Also my wheel's rotation sensor is broken, but this is the ONLY game in my Steam game list that does not fix this temporarly, meaning on this game, 90% of the time I have to go through long lists to get force feedback working properly, taking sometimes upto 30 mins to fix this, EVEN GTA 5 DOES THIS!

Especially if you like simulators !This game has all the quality I was hoping for a simulator, a few points I raised :Sound : Awesome, I liked the sound of cars, environments , incredible detail .Graphics: Still needs to be polished, the game is heavy yet, the image is blurred and the track is missing more texture detail.Cars and tracks Laser scanned !Many cars are coming, we have cars from lower classes or supercars for all tastes, even F1 cars and antique cars ! Very detailed , each with its unique driveability !Dirigibility ( turning point ) : I loved the simulator , I can feel the cars perfectly in my hands ( G27 ) , something that I was waiting for is the H gear with clutch(like real life) and this game has!We now have career mode in a simulator on PC ! Always wanted a game with career mode on PC and now we have !Uncomplicated : You can increase the complexity of the game by setting the car the way you prefer , but if you simply enjoy running without spending hours and hours configuring every car on every track you can too!It is amazing , love it! I am doing this review because he really liked this game and want to support this development .I made this review based on experience in the following games :GT Legends , GT , GTR , GTR 2 , GTR Evolution , RACE 07 and all expansions , RaceRoom Racing Experience, Gran Turismo 5 , Richard Burn Rally with RSRBR 2013 FIA WRC 4 WRC 3 , Project CARS , F1 2013 Game Stock Car 2012 GRID 1 , 2 , DIRT 1,2,3 , Euro Truck Simulator 2 , rFactor 1 ( very little )			"

								Without doubt the best and most accurate simulator to date, athough with a joypad you may stuggle, getting a wheel makes the game very drivable and very addictive.			"

												Profile says ~150 hours on record but believe me with Steam offline, it's well over 2000.I'll attempt to explain what I like and dislike about the game.Great WIP game for $30. Once it's polished up & bugs ironed out(which will take a considerable amount of time), it will be worthy of $60 even if you're not that into sim racing. Just cruising on the roads, keeping the car straight,  heel-and-toe downshifting to keep the rear in-check and pull out with speed is believeable and exhilarating. If you can drive. The sensation of speed is amazing. But if you are into sim racing what are you waiting for? pick this up and start hotlapping like your life depends on it!I must however note, regarding the price: Be prepared to pay even more if you want to race online with more people because of DLC limitations. Yes, most people race with the DLC so if you want to race them, you'll need to buy the official DLC just to be in the same lobby. Alternatively, if people are racing with only base content and modded content, you'll have to guess where to download it from...most cases...Racedepartment website...otherwise (rarely) I have no clue.I must also note as far as AC as a ""game"" is concerned, isn't stellar. If you're one to play racing games for the Career you might want to look elsewhere, you might. Bit boring in presentation, & lacks any sort of narrative(currently) that said, it does have a few modes: Career, Drag Race, Drift, Special Events, Race Weekend, Time attack, Hotlap, Quick Race, Practice. I find myself racing and qualifying online exclusively and when there isn't a lobby I like with 2 or 3 others I head back and play Quick Race exclusively, sharpening my driving technique and playing around because modded tracks and cars was a huge selling point for me. For the other modes I do use: Drift needs work with the points system and Special Events is actually fun, and there are many many events to challenge you and keep you racing. Drag is pretty good too; The AI is a challenge and there is a working tree! I'd like for there to be a Drags mode online with special drag slicks. That would be something brilliant.Pros:Excellent graphics-Cars are highly detailed with full interior detail and tracks are fantastic also. Doesn't require as good a computer as most thought this is because it is a well optimised game. Medium Gaming Rig can run at 40FPS solid. You can tweak/turn off many things to gain performance.Great physics & getting better. Arguably BEST driving physics on the market.  There is however almost no external damage to the cars in Assetto Corsa. BeamNG takes the cake for crash physics(yes you should pick up that game if you're a die-hard crasher with a top PC. Shoutout to crashers: stay away from Assetto Corsa pls and if you need online crashing pickup Wreckfest, second-best crash physics with online. You won't regret it I promise.).Good selection of cars, around 40 cars come with the base game. Most the phsyics for these are solid aswell.You can tweak the usual things for a car before racing including tyre type, PSI pressure(all 4 tyres), dampers (compression, extension and fast), springs, ARB, packer rate, travel range, camber, toe, height, power & turbo power limit, brake bias, downforce, gear ratios & final, etc.FULL support of mods including modable UI, sounds, vehicles, tracks...the list goes on...Big selling point. And there are plenty of mods being pushed out by the community. I can imagine this game reaching RFactor levels of modding in 2 or 3 years.(only issue is some mods can be broken with new updates...with some creators updating their mods..others abandoning them)Great offline replay mode, with extensive photomode built-in. You can also view various telemetry data in realtime including tyre heat levels and driver inputs.Lots of customising in the options, view angle, FOV, supports VR devices, audio levels: master, engine, opponents, wind, surfaces, tyre skid, UI etc etc You can even download some theme mods that change the whole look of the menu with new icons and menu design for AC!Good FFB as of now.Supports multiple Steering Wheels with tweakingSupports Xbox360 controller, keyboards and mouse racing (None of these should be used for this sim)Great selection of tracks. Most are even Laser-scanned. No complaints in this department. Everything is STUNNING and true-to-life. Exceptions being the 5 or so fictional tracks, which are still well made. My favourite fictional is Black Cat County Long. Blast to cruise on and race.AI drivers are much improved and only getting better. They now make offline races a blast.The sounds of most cars are rich and lively but you have to use the cockpit view to get the best experience. Room for improvement.The assettocorsa.net forum is generally helpful in sorting out issues, with some users even helping you find problems when Kunos staff are busy.You can tweak your race lots: Time, AI strength (80% to 110 I think), laps, track grip, track temperature, time cycle, penalties, in addition to selecting the opponents' cars and how many of them. You can also choose your placement in the grid, and electronic aids on/off: ABS, TC, Stability control. Online servers have exclusive options to server admins: setting tyre/fuel/damage wear rate and track grip by percent as well as forcing the electronic aids on or off.Cons:Online still needs work, but it's looking good so far. It does need polishThere is no replay save button in online.Very limited, annoyingly, almost non-existent spectator mode in onlineCars pinging off others even at small contactsNot many American cars. 90% European with some Japanese(most is DLC). Not exactly a con but the only American cars we have is the Corvette C7, C7R, Shelby Cobra 427 and the new Mustang. Please add at least two more american cars for variety and competiton. A Viper, Saleen S281 SC and the sexy new Ford GT are my suggestions. Though it won't hurt to add race-spec versions of some these cars too.Criticisms:FFB still needs work but so far it's great. Few more sliders should make it top 5 in sim racing. Almost as good as LFS if you setup everything just right.Updates only adding/fixing new content rather than fixing online bugs and improving online for the players.Not allowing non-DLC players to play against DLC players. I get that you disable the DLC cars for offline but as is it's dividing the community and forcing people to play on only the newest content when they're online. The number of people racing on the base content is declining very quiclky and nearly phased out, much to my dissapointment. Some cars have very little tweaking options, whereas others have a plethora of options to setup. I get the SLS doesn't have adjustable gears, brake balance and Ride height IRL but it would be nice to just check a box and suddenly all tuning options are avaliable across all cars. Would be neat for online racing different setups. Needs built-in leaderboards for time trials, best laps, replays, ghosts and races etc.  You can download an app for this but it should be in the menus with the base game.Could do with some more server options in multiplayer. Like seamless weather transitions and ballast positioning(front to rear percent) to a car, rather than BAM 200kg to the whole car.Could do with a quick manual on how to get started with KsEditor(track importing & editing, AI and replay camera editing tool required to get a new, upcoming mod car/track working in game) and other programs, rather than throwing it out there and expecting the community to figure it all out, help each other and document everything.Would like the ability to select a different tyre compound for the front or rear tyres.

												Oh I have been searching for a simulator like this a long time.It has great Force Feedback support. So i can finally drift properly because this game has also one of the best driving models i have ever seen. It feels so good to drive Lotus 49 on Monza from '66. And try to beat that unbeatable time record. If you love driving for fun go for it. If you want awesome multiplayer experience... This is where the game is not that good. Penalty system is really bad. You just get for a bit of track and you get 5 seconds penalty. In wich you are unable to accelerate or you can drop down to 50km/h and then go on full throttle again. The race as itself in multiplayer doesn't look even like a normal race. Yes, everyone starts from grid. But the race itself is based on time. I think that on one side it's nice idea. But they should atleast give us a feature to make that normal race in wich depends your position. Because that makes your choices limited. In that case you cant just do in one lap stupidities. Then man up. Just teleport back to pits. and then go the fastest lap and simply win. I want that exciting moment in wich I fight for first place.Another problem, drivers... I mean in online. The AI are still a bit dull because they ram you same like normal players. ""Oh, gotta brake a little, this turn is sharp."" And at this moment some jackass bounces from your side to go as fast as he can and you end up in a haystack... And in the end they kick you for staying in way... So, one thing. If you are not gonna play online with your friends. I suppose don't play online. Of course I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy this game. If you are only thinking about it... Go for it! Now! You can customize cars suspension, aerodynamics. Brake bias. Engine limiter, so you can take it to insane RPM's and the engine will hate itself during shifts. Oh, I love this game. Even though i got just 20.4 hours right now. But It's mostly because I'm bored of taking my wheel on table and back to the side. I'd have like 50 hours right know. (And it's also because I play a lot of games, not just one. I'll get bored other way)+ I love to hear that the game is still being furthermore developed. The new dream pack sounds really like dream. In the trailer you can see McLaren P1, Lamborghini, but for me, there is Alfa Romeo 4C. I love that car. The flag system is finally coming, no more crashers/rammers! :D The weather/winter is coming (not sure if winter is gonna be available but I had to do that)AI are getting an updateJust get this game if you LOVE sims. Come on, it is truly awesome.			"

												If I'm being totally honest......*suspense*Assetto Corsa is an absolutely incredible racing simulator - not an arcade game, simulator.First off, the physics (if you are playing with a wheel) are just insane. While racing on the Nurburgring (or any other track for that matter), it's almost as if you can feel the suspension movement of the car through your wheel. 10/10 from me.Secondly, the graphics... oh, the graphics. They are so good. Now I may be slightly biased because I play in 4k, but my god, are they good. The reflections, the detail of the exterior and interior, the mirrors, lights, etc. are just inches away from being the same as real life. I can't even imagine how good this game is with VR. Another 10/10 from me.Thirdly, the customization. Once you load into a server, whether it is private or online, you can change everything from the tire pressure to the fuel in your tank to the camber to the ride height... there is just so much. Granted, you cannot customize your car with upgrades and ultimately personalize it, but hey, this isn't Forza guys. This game is focused on simulation, not arcade. Also allow me to mention the fact that all of the gauges inside the vehicle work, like the coolant temperature, fuel, and so on and so forth. Another 10/10 from me (in terms of realism, not arcade).Next, allow me to mention the price. 30 dollars?!?! 30 dollars?!?!?!?! You'd think Kunos is going mad for releasing such a good game for such a steal.Also, Kunos has been killin' it with the dlc. Every dlc pack is of the highest quality, and they will keep releasing content for much, much longer. I mean this game is far from being complete.The only downside about this game is the singleplayer, which could be better but I'm sure they will fix that in the future.Overall, I think Assetto Corsa is a very good simulator, and beats the pants off Project: Cars. I would certainly recommend it to anybody with a wheel who is looking for a great racing game on PC. "

								I really thought twice to buy this game, but then I watched videos reviewing this game and I decided to give it a chance. One of the best decisions I took this year. The game is awesome, so far the closer real ""feeling"" of driving I've experienced. All cars, including the slower ones, are so damn nice to drive. Even being alone in the track I can keep playing with the same car in the same road for hours. Feels better and better every lap. Great game, I'm pretty sure this game will kick♥♥♥♥♥when it comes out.			"

												After almost five months of should I buy this & after spending hrs reading people coments on half  dozen forums.The problem being is it a sim or arcade  do the cars handle correctly is the sound any good & so on.Now one thing I do understand about the sim people is the age old debate on what is sim or not , its been like that from day one.So simply asking around led to the same mixed bag of  pros & cons.So in the end I decided to do my own research instead of the endless real sim debate.In the end I pick this over the like of RF2 / Race Room & I-Racing.Not that I dislike any of the others , however that said I can not agree with both I-racing & RaceRooms use of Micro sale DLC system.I also know of both sims before AC so I understand how long & how much work it as taken to get to this point from one person to todays still small team.You can feel the passion that as gone into making this Simulation & it offer a lot more in the future without need to buy a state of the hart PC to run it.People have pointed out the sounds are not that good , & for the most part I think they are wrong , I mean ok some bits need to be worked on.But that can be said of lots of little bits , however AC as kept things simple I find the menus system very good & clear , there is all the setting & tweaks to keep any hard core simmer busy , while at the same time you can just jump in & play out of the box so to speak.I did  however find a lack of manuel a bit of a oversite , but they have a very good forum where you can find most stuff out.There are also  mods & apps of all sorts that can be added to improve game play.The sim feature the now standard challenges & events along with pratice & a racing & online mode.Ok one of the biggest issue I can see is the AI its not the worst ever but not the best to & makes racing intresting if not frustrating.But like all those issues listed by others here they will be fixed or added given time.Given the scale of the jump made here by the develope by moving into a crowded market as the PC Sim racing market is & producing  very high quality sim that cn hold its own with at least three of the above.Having tested Rfactor 2  & Raceroom  they are a little different but not by much in my eyes anyhow.I lie the fact that AC's Developers have not gone for Flashy menus & stupid voice overs & kept it simply above driving.If they just keep adding Cars & improving the core & not start wasting time adding pointless flashy cut screens  & new mneus interfaces.What they have made so far I find fantastic its plays well it looks good & it runs well & even mods seem to work very well.I think the Future is looking very good for AC & its evolutions . Its was so nice to have a sim that tooks with dowloading to first drive about 1 hr very much plug and play not some thing I am use to with Sims of the past.I have not problems recomending this one to any one that enjoys having fun in cars of all types.But please understand that it is an ongoing development very much like Euro trucks 2 & a few other game out their that go along this type of constant development fase.So to those who say its no finished or this and that is missing . So what I have faith that all these things will come given time & that sometimes its better to wait & get  better overall product than some thing that says its as everything from days one & then falls way sort of the mark.For me a must haave product that will grow in a time scale that allows both the developers & the end user to get several years enjoyment from it with out braking the bank for new hardware .Very much a 9 from me & not at all over hyped as some would say.

												Update now that it's out of early access:-Damage now added but it's too sensitive (bumpdraft to your rear breaks your windscreen)-Pitstops are in but only in multiplayer-Still lacking any sort of flag rules-Weather and night time doesn't seem to be on the roadmap nor do the devs seem interested in doing so-Multiplayer netcode seems to have imrpoved quite a bit. -Still a fairly limited amount of cars and tracks, though lots of new content coming out and metric ton of mods available-Even though FMOD is now in, sounds are still lackluster and fairly poor-AI still dumber than a sack of rocks-FFB feels muddy compared to other simsFor a 1.0 release it feels slightly underwhelming with all the hype surrounding it. The lack of penalites/flag rules make it unsuitable for league racing. It's fantastic for pick up races and cruising however.As much as I like it, there's not much reason to choose AC over any other racing sim out there currently.-Multiplayer? iRacing-Offline racing? Game Stock Car or RaceRoom-Physics & FFB? Game Stock Car or rFactor 2-Fantastic audio, and immersion? RaceRoom-Graphics? pCars or Assetto Corsa (though I think AC wins this one)It has a lot of potential going for it and the devs seem dedicated so I would still recommend it. tl;dr CORNETTO CORSA 8/10 IT'S OKAY---EA REVIEW BELOWStill early in development and missing some features you'd see in other sims (pitstops + limiters, working headlights, damage, etc) but extremely promising. Physics are top notch and FFB feels amazing. With more content and fixes (I'M LOOKING AT YOU MULTIPLAYER NETCODE), this could be very well the much needed spiritual successor to man kinds greatest GT racer, GTR2. Oh and the modability of this game is stupidly amazing.tl;drCornetto Corsa 9/10 BRETTY GUD			"

								Assetto Corsa is a Simulation racing game where reality is being taken seriously. The great graphics, suspension of the car, feedback in the wheel and diversity so far make Assetto Corsa one of the best simulation racing games for me at this very moment.I've been searching for a ""fun"" simulation racing game at this moment. And what i can say is that most of the realistic simulation racing games don't care about the user experience and only care about the realism and handling of the car. Assetto corsa does both. I love the way that the game looks and how the menu works so far, even tho it's still in beta I already know this game is going to be great. Instead of playing other simulation racing games i only play Assetto Corsa now. It's quite more addicting than the others because of the user experience.I can't say alot more about this game now, because there are some things that still need some work, and since it's still in development i can't say too much about the bad parts.If you like sim racing make sure you buy this title, I highly recommend it!

								It is early access but at this moment Assetto Corsa is better than 90% of PC race games! Close to real car feeling, quick responsivenes of controller (I'm using xbox360 conroller), good graphics. Main lacks are: AI, damage model and multiplayer. But hey!, it's 0.4 version. If you want to test your skills, fight with yourself trying to beat best time - this early build is for you.Car handling in my opinion is better than in SHIFT2 and SimBin games (Race 07, RaceRoom). You can feel every angle of a track. Every car is different and it takes time to learn how to drive it. Also you have to learn every single track or you will spend more time on the roadside. At this moment AC shows its all pros. You just want to learn. Sit in one car on one track and drive for several hours until reach perfect lap.Xbox game pad gives much joy (I don't have race wheel) even with almost all aids off. Force feedback effect works perfectly. Also responsiveness of analog stick and sensivity of LT RT are very good.Graphics and sound depends on taste but I like them.Assetto Corsa is closer to Race 07 than SHIFT2 but I think it defeats them both.I have no comparision to Project C.A.R.S. so I can't tell which game is better. Definitely Assetto is one of the best despite of early stage.			"

												Top of the line Racing Sim. First class development team. No tricks, gimmicks or confusing paywalls, just pure driving with the most desired exotics, racing and street class cars available. Plenty of challenge scenarios including Drag racing, hotlapping and drifting etc. Or just create your own race with the AI.PROS:- Realism / Graphics / Modding community / Brand licensing / Multiplayer / Gameplay / Controller support / VR support / Triple monitor support / Reliability / ValueCONS:- Lack of dynamic weather, but unless you want to pick apart details such as personal preferences in regards to UI or what it might not have in regards to content vs some arcade game, then I would really be hard pressed to find any cons.  In fact, Assetto Corsa is extremely optimized and runs smooth. It doesn't require a constant internet connection, subscriptions, or overpriced content. The game has been advancing since launch, always improving with every update whether it's adding textures to tracks, or improving physics, or adding quality content. Heck, they even give you free content....  Kunos Simulazioni has raised the bar.  All other sims should take notes.* Also worth mentioning is the fact that you can pretty much tailor this game to how you wish via the modding possibilities, as they are endless.10/10  I will drive the F1's, Ferrari's, Lamborghini's, Audi's, Chevy's, Ford's, Mazerati's, Porsche's, Toyota's, etc, etc, etc. AGAIN!

								i regularly visit the nürburgring and hockenheimring for trackdays and played many racing games like gtr2, race 07, Gran turismo, forza, project cas... but assetto corsa is the best simulation in terms of handling and realism.If you have a wheel for the game you don´t need time to adept because it instantly feels familiar.It makes a lot of fun even if you are just trying to beat your laptime. You can clearly feel a difference between the handling of the cars.It has mod support and even it is in early access stage you can download tracks like the famous nordschleife.Drifting is a lot of fun too but i think the fly off handbrake needs an update because it is very hard to initiate the drift long ahead of a corner. The game may not have the variety of forza or GT but if you love realistic handling this simracer is the best you can get "

												This is the ultimate Racing Sim on PC right now, hands down. The physics are superb, graphics are surprisingly great, the mod support is overwhelming and the community is awesome! It doesn't matter what kind of racing you like, whether it's Formula 1, GT3, Rally, Drifting (like me) or just normal track days, AC has it all! The track selection is on the smaller side but with mods you can easily triple the amount of tracks in the game!The game has all the settings you'd ever want, support for almost every steering wheel under the sun and car setups that even beginner drivers can understand and tweak to their liking.Overall this is my favourite game of all time, I play this game almost every single day and I've never NOT enjoyed myself!10/10 from me :)			"

												Second to none tire wear and track grip simulation, good selection of cars and tracks. Outstanding quality for a game made by 12 people. Server browser is in severe need of some polish but that is a lesser priority right now. Porsche license is the first one for a true racing sim in decades. Community is a good one. The modding scene is fairly large. Good things are on the horizon for Assetto Corsa, with the addition of the Porsche 919 Hybrid 2015 and 2016 LMP1 cars, as well as the Audi R18 LMP1 car, and the Toyota TS040 LMP1 car. Many different types of racing to be had, from 90's DTM to modern F1. Assetto Corsa blows the competition away, especially from a price standpoint. 9.5/10			"

												Amazing racing simulator. The cars, physics, graphics, and sound are stunning. Setting up a multiplayer server is a bit difficult and unintuitive, but that's about the only problem I have with Assetto Corsa. It works perfectly with my Logitech Driving Force GT. I highly recommend this game, just make sure your computer can handle it, as it is quite demanding.			"

								After playing around with a few racing arcade/sim games I came accross Asseto Corsa. At first I found It really challenging, not because its hard to play it just takes a little getting used to. I bought the game early in it's release and have seen it grow from strength to strength.  You have to drive the vehicles as you woul in real life, with care. If you are not careful the game will punish you and you will not enjoy it.I highly reccomend this to anyone who has patience to learn to race properly. It's not a game for you if all you want to do is put your foot flat to the floor and hope for the best. It takes time and a lot of effort to become any good.10/10 for me love it!Edited 15/02/2015.After putting many more hours into both single player and muliplayer i thought i would add a few more thoughts.I was playing a lot of GRID AUTOSPORT and was really enjoying it, then a friend put me onto F1 racing and I then spent many hours with F12013/14. I found my self suckered into the thrill of ""getting it right"". I would occasionally jump into ASSETTO and race a few single player events and challenges, then i thought I would look at the multiplayer. I was blown away bu what i found.The multiplayer community was much more attentive to the ""Don't go flat out and crash at the first corner rule"". People seemd to me on the whole to be taking the races with an attitude that would mirror real life events, don't get me wrong there were still those who were flogging it however there were much less of them. When and if you get onto the right server (MARTY CERVIN servers come to mind) the people that flogged it were warned and if they didn't change were banned. It made a much more enjoyable experience.I managed to work out how to run my own server so now i also have control over everything. As well I looked into the modding community and found that to be very alive and kicking. Have even found the V8 Supercars and Australian racing tracks. Bathurst is a much harder track in ASSETTO compared to the GRID AUSTOSPORT version.This has now become my go to racing game and I am looking forward to updating my tech to include the oculas rift purley for this game. lately they have released more updates and fixes which continue to improve the already wonderful game it is.

								This game...  where do I start with this game. Well, the easiest place to start would be to stop calling it a game, because it's not. It's a simulation, and a very good one at that. What's the difference, you might ask? Well, lets think of a racing ""game"", Forza seems to be a good choice. In Forza, you have hundreds of cars to choose from, but they all feel relativly the same when you drive them. Assetto Corsa's car list is absolutley miniscule by comparison, but each of those very few cars handles and feels differently than any other car. Because of this, you can spend hours getting one car to go around a track perfectly, then switch cars and have to do it all over again. If you find that fun, go ahead and pick this up. If you don't find re-learning each individual car fun, just pick one you like and stick with it, because in all honesty, you probably aren't going to own a Pagani Huyra in your life or a Ferrari F40, and even if you do get to own one of those cars, you still won't be able to take it to tracks around the world and race it to your heart's content.What else... car tuning. If you like tuning cars to try and get every possible horsepower out of them, go ahead and pick this game up. For each car, you can change the tire pressure, tire compound, brake bias, wheel camber, the gearbox settings, the list just keeps going on. And each of the things you change can have a profound effect on how well the car goes around the track.  It's absolutley incredible.Another thing are the challenges:There are pre-defined races, hotlaps, a drift mode,  two drag strips, and if you get bored with those, you can just make up your own races with whatever cars you feel like. There's enough content included in this pre-release version of the game for almost infinite playability, and more stuff is being added with each update, ranging from more cars, to new tracks, to new challenges. Again, it's incredible.Now for some bad things:This is an early access game, and some things still need to be worked on. The AI on opponents can be a little rough around the edges, some tracks have weird physics errors attached to them, multiplayer has yet to be implemented, and weather has not yet been included. If you have a problem with any of those things, wait a little while for the game to be updated, and have all those things worked out, and then spend your money. Secondly, you basically need a steering wheel. Although it's possible, playing with a keyboard just won't give you the same feeling as using a wheel, and it just won't be as fun. If you're in a pinch money-wise or otherwise, an xbox 360 controller can be used, and it's still better than a keyboard, but a wheel truiumphs over all.In conclusion, unless you're the type of person who absolutley hates racing games in general, you will probably find something fun in this game that will keep you coming back. If you can get past the fact it's an early access and somethings haven't been included yet, it's very easy to have fun playing this.			"

								BRAVO guys, very well done. It seems like you've struck a perfect balance between playability and realism. Physics are beautifully fluid and rewarding, unlike iRacing which seems a bit over the top with their signature death wiggle. Sound effects are amazing and comparing with iRacing AC cars sound alive. Graphics, I prefer iRacing style, AC seems somewhat sterile and artificial a bit like Grand Turismo. BTW on that note, I hope that once AC introduce multiplayer it won't turn into a console type of racing. Please make it more like iRacing where idiots have no chance of surviving.			"

												This is a simulator, if you've played Forza 4 and want something more on PC this is the right place to come for the racing and drifting. Car clubs will be on separate forums and designing livery will we on separate software. There is little to no car upgrades and no rims to change, unless that comes in the future. But if you focus on more racing, own a Logitech g27 or better wheel, yep, you've come to the right place. Things will be a bit new and unfamiliar at first before the grip, handling and tuning menus start shining through and you immerse your self in mastering the cars.The modding community alone could make this game gigantic in the future. Gigantic in the sense that you could focus on one little area of racing and find hundreds if not thousands that enjoy the same class, tracks, time period and mode of competition. Promising is just the tip of the iceberg.			"

								Even though this game is still in its early stages it is completely worth getting.  The game is absolutely gorgeous.  Best looking racing game I have ever seen by far but that is coming from a consol background of every GT game and Forza game.  I can't wait to play the full game.  Pros: Most realistic driving simulator I have played.  The contorls are fluid and I just recently got a steering wheel just for playing games like this.  It is a great challenge and I have learned alot.  The steering wheel feel is heavy and feels real.  Cons:At the moment the only one that I have any problem with is the AI.  I physically cannot finish a race without an AI wrecking me most of the time in the first or second turn.  They are working on this diligently and have made some progress since I got the game.  As for getting it while its in early access, I would recomend this to everyone to get a good feel of what a racing game should feel like.			"

It is still developed on and is getting better. You can race it without a wheel but beware if you get it you will want to get a wheel because you will know how much more fun it will be.Ac is just amazing at what it does, absoloutly a must buy!Highlights of whats coming this year:-4x4 wheel drive-torque vectoring-Nordschleife laserscanned and 3 other tracks-Mclaren P1 and loads of other cars			"

Assetto Corsa is my pick without a doubt the physics/tire model/handling, graphics, and amazing content makes it best simulator on the open market. The 1.5 update show's how beautiful the game is going further and further. The only aspect which is drastic problem for the game and would change it 360 degree is online racing system, things like better flags, more realistic/playable penalties and also small staff like rolling start and let say pit-stop drive penaltie for crash, this would make Assetto Corsa online experience as close to perfectness as possible which is my dream.

												PRO'S- probably the best hotlapping simulator out there- accurate car physics and tire model- laser scanned tracks- detailed cars- accurate car sounds- moddability- amount of mods (tracks, cars & apps); some mods equal or best official content (some even get bought by the developers)- ability to set password and blacklist for your own serverCONS- racing AI; bad awareness and won't overtake each other, don't show any human behaviour (alternatives: rFactor2)- worthless career mode because of it's crappy AI- small car selection (alternatives: console racers like Forza and GT)- small track selection (solved by going to racedepartment and/or official forums and downloading all the mod tracks that interest you, installing mods is as easy as copying a folder into the tracks or cars folder)- barely any visual damage; body parts don't fly off after heavy contact- dissapointing damage model overall; sometimes small contact causes just too much damage to be believable- interface is confusing at first- lack of official servers, dedicated servers require knowledge and suitable hardware or you'd have to rent one- small development team, which reflects in the lack of communication about updates (there's no community manager) and slow improvements- no track rotation in a server without booking, online racing either requires you to rejoin the server after a restart for a different track or to join a different server- skinning (designing liveries) requires Photoshop (or equivalent), skill in that software and patience- no weatherRECOMMENDED- get a wheel to enjoy the Force Feedback (FFB) and physics at its finest- join a league or community (example: our community etcc.ridedomain.com), or dive into actively moderated servers you can find at the official forums (Marty's Aussie server/ALOOG/Minolin/etc)- download track and car mods (and apps if you need 'm)- set up your frame of view using frame of view calculators (search for them on the web)- a decent internet connection if you're planning to race online (check your ping and most of all, package loss)I'm recommending this because the pro's vastly outweigh the cons for me.

								Since this is one of the rare moments Simracing reaches the general public, let me tell a bit about the setting around the game before actually reviewing it.I consider myself a pretty serious simracer. That comes with it's perks: I have a great group of friends who share my passion. So, I had to buy this game (Peer pressure, yay!) and when I fired it up, I wasn't dissapointed.To those wh don't know: The last proper simracing game (Not counting Iracing since it's subscription based and therefore has no real release date) is from 2007 (CARS is too arcadey), which is Race 07 and costs 3 euro's on Steam.The game is easy to get used to for a simracer who knows what he's doing. In the controls menu, you'll find the regular settings, and a configuration tool to help the clueless.So far, there's no AI (The makers hope to release that in the next update partially) and no multiplayer, which leaves you to do special events, drag race, drift, practice, and hot lap around several tracks, including Monza and Imola. The tracks look lovely and feel realistic. The same goes for the cars; The cars feel real, which is exactly what simracers as myself want.I could see this becoming an E-sports game if the multiplayer is well executed, and it's great to see the attention this game has gotten.People who like features like rewinding are probably going to end up dissapointed, because this is pure simracing. 1 big mistake, and you're out. There's not a respawn option like FPS games have.			"

All in all a Very Good Simulator versus the rest with new updates incoming. Improvement on this Gem is hard to fathom but impresses everytime.			"

								Hands down the most fun and true racing sim and I've tried many of them. The physics is phenomenal, the car control is very predictable. Very driftable. It's best with a racing wheel.  It's in early access, so no full races, career mode, multiplayer.			"

												I'm not sure why I bought this game... maybe it was that little shinning hope that when it does come out of early access it would be a brand new amazing game. Every time I play this game I remind myself how bare bones and awful it is. I honestly don't know why the community holds this game up in such high regards.Not all is bad I mean there's plenty of things to like the number one thing being the physics model it's fun amazing and engaging. There's tonnes of graphics and user options to mess around with which is great, there's also plenty of support for controllers and wheels. There's a decent single player campaign and a fun multiplayer but that's as far as  it goes for me when it comes to the good stuff.Now the bad considering I paid around $40 back when it was in early access and it now has only like 16 tracks and about 40-50 cars... an embarrassing line up of cars at that too, not to mention half the cars are just the same damn♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways and the rest of the good stuff is behind paid DLC. The menus are clunky and more often than not you run into bugs. There is still only 3 good modes more like 2 good modes hot lap, time attack and *cough* ""shitdriftmode"" *cough* and to top it off this game doesn't even try to add Steam Workshop considering its only saving grace is ♥♥♥♥ing mods.I'm honestly shocked how people actually want this... is this what the community wants? Just a nice physics driven game with a huge lack of content? I'm honestly ashamed to even own this game, if the only thing this game has going for it is the physics than I rather look elsewhere for a game with actual content.			"

												Assetto Corsa has made waves, as of late, for its hyper realistic handling physics along with its track accuracy. The developer, Kunos Simulazioni, has laser scanned each featured track for ultra-precision. In my opinion the addition of better Ai and added depth to multiplayer would make this game perfect, still its my personal top choice for a PC racing sim.			"

												Could/should have a better multiplayer implementation (and I have faith that Kunos will continue improving it), but as it stands it's the greatest racing simulator ever made.  Great cars, great tracks, incredible physics and graphics.  Sounds of some cars are weak but gradually getting improved with each patch.  To be honest, driving it solo without sound would be a better experience than any other racing sim to date.			"

												Thought this game was too hard when I first started playing it because the cars didn't seem very responsive. The only way I could get round a corner without crashing would be to take it slow, and everyone would overtake me, so I' ended up coming in last. But I realised that actually selecting Pro driver setup, as opposed to Gamer or Racer, actually made it easier. The car is more responsive. I think it's because it turns off things like traction conrol and ABS, which are designed to stablise the car and end up making it too rigid to drive fast. Just thought I'd share my experience, select Pro and this game is awesome. Love the detail and accuracy that's gone into the cars, inside and out. (Now) love the realistic handling. Love the tracks. And love the community. Looking forward to driving all the cars on all the tracks and seeing it develop over time.Update: This game deserves the ""Whoa, Dude"" award because it teleports you (with VR HMD) to a vast array of different cars recreated with precision accuracy and detail. With the right set up this has got to be the closest you will get to the real thing. The tracks are ultra-realistic as well and I'm looking forward to driving one of these cars round one of these tracks in real life to see if I can get the same, or better, lap times.			"

												I really want to like this game, great driving, good mod support, good graphics, just lots of good. But the game is yet to feel finished, they realised the first DLC recently, and I was thinking to myself, ""what? That's absurd! You can't release DLC for an Early Access game!"" So I went to the store page and found that the game wasn't in Early Access anymore.And this is the meat of my issues with this game, it's contentless. There's a miniscule number of cars, and a tiny number of tracks, and this would be ok, if the game was $30 dollars, but it's $50, almost full price, yet, there isn't enough to warrant the price.I feel jipped when I play this game, yeah, there are mods, but when a game's best feature is something someone else has done, then there is a problem.This asking price is also annoying for those of us (like myself) who have a limited budget, when I first purchased this game for $30 dollars, I felt a little ripped off, but I thought to myself, ""don't worry, they'll add more content."" Yet they haven't, and I still feel like I've been had. Despite me paying almost half then the current asking price, I still don't feel like I've got a good deal. If I'd purchased this game for $50, I'd probably be ripping my hair out currently. Yes, this game has a lot of good points, but due to the fact that there is a laughably low amount of content in this game, I simply can't recommend this game to anyone who has respect for their money. If you have money coming out of your eye balls, then go ahead, buy it, enjoy a very good simulation of driving, but if you don't, then move on, because this is simply a waste. "

												Before you read the rest of my review please understand i would love to give this a recommendation but at the current time just dont feel i can.Since i purchased this in the early access stage i have tried repeatedly to enjoy this game, yes i believe there should be some enjoyment in playing a simulation and not just tedium. Unfortunately i cant recommend this game except to the most hardened driving simulation fans and even they will suffer at some point from the absolute perfect driving of the A I . This isnt even mentioning when the AI wish to pass you on a corner etc the answer seems to be quite simple - rear end you , this leaves you ( not them at any point i noticed ) careening onto the grass / track edge for a penalty or slow down to 50kmh ( something you would expect to find in an arcade game with catch up enabled! .Unfortunately this games just feels like an exercise in stress. I will commend the team for improving the overall driving experience since the early access but the A I simply hasnt been well adjusted. Another unusual presence in this game is the career mode choices , a time trial just for ""the fun of it"" seems to be thrown into career mode, whilst i can understand this gives you chance to practice the track before engaging in a race so does practice ( thats kind of what its there for ) .I think ultimately the developers need to understand that whilst there are many hardened sim racers out there who will thoroughly enjoy most of this experience they have ultimately sold themselves short by not creating a particularly enjoyable experience.  If you are willing to invest a lot of time of the steep difficulty curve and love racing sims then get it. If you like racing games in general this probably wont be your cup of tea.			"

								First of all, I'm not into recommending games.This game showed up out of nowhere a couple of months ago.As a 1+ year user of Project Cars, I didn't want ""another project cars"".But on this sale, at this version (0.7), I decided to give it a try. It took me just a couple of cars and a couple of tracks to realize how wonderful this game is.I use steering wheels and shifters, so I can compare it with a real car. It is as real as it gets.I never felt this with other games that claim to be sims: GTA5-6, Shift, Project Cars, etc.Project Cars, you should stop making visual effects for snapshots!			"

The car becomes so unstable that if anyone so much as hits a patch of wet leaves, they are as good as dead in reality.This is the most realistic racing simulator that I have ever played and Gran Turismo has nothing on it...But it is still in much development and I love the online mode of this game as it allows you to compare times with other players.  I haven't had the guts to use the bigger cars in this game.  The Lotus Exige is PLENTY power for me!   I haven't hit a wall with it yet; there is vehicle damage in this game BTW...			"

												Assetto Corsa is one of the best Racing Simulation Games out there.I bought it in sale for 50% of the price and I can tell it is remarkably authentic and realistic, considering that you do not really sit in front of the rim of an M3 GT2. I purchased it to function with my Logitech G27, which by the way works perfectly fine since it comes with full Racing Wheel-Support.Thumbs up!!!			"

The VR is still in Beta but I find it very immersive and absolutely playable, even though I have to remove my Oculus Rift to change cars or track.Most realistic sim so far and it is constantly getting new updates and features. The modding community is also superb with lots and lots of content for free. "

								As an inexperienced newcomer to sim-racing, there is not much that can compare to a pulling off an unassisted balls to the wall lap of Imola in a Ferrari F40 without going off-track. In games like GRID or Forza, excitement comes from winning races and the drive to keep playing derives from the carrot on a stick that is the credits you need to earn to buy more cars.AC doesn't even have a carrot on a stick for winning races yet (career mode is not yet done), and I still regularly start it up just to do hotlapping sessions of various car/track combinations. The driving is just that much fun in and of itself, and incredibly challening at that.Online racing is also remarkably fun to do, and once you escape inevitable turn 1 malarky, most racers will happily battle you for position turn after turn with courtesy and giving you your space while you give them theirs. It seems most people enjoy a having great and tense battle more than winning it, and that allows for them to take place cleanly. Most people rather see their opponent win it and have another chance to be a hero in the next few turns, than risk hitting them and ending up in the gravel together.There are a few glaring omissions such as pit stops and better ways of getting in a public race (the booking system makes sense, but it could use some more options to allow e.g. joining in practice mode),  but even if they stop development entirely I feel as though I've gotten more than my money's worth already. And so far, they've done the contrary and maintained a fairly strong update/patch schedule every other Friday.			"

												So now I have 600+ hours in this game I think I have put in more than enough hours to review this game in a fair light, kunos games calls assetto corsa (your racing simulator) and they aren’t wrong there, This is the best racing sim I have ever owned the gameplay is solid the feel of the cars and the FFB on the wheel is amazing.Now I am a BIG drifting head to be honest most of the hours I have put in the game have been me drifting in the DriftJunkie servers =D so if you want this game for drifting I 1000% think you should get this game. And maybe we can tandem someday, The graphic are nice & sharp in all the right places for a sim… sure the graphics aren’t forza standard but then again we don’t own this game for the graphics we own it for the realism it brings to the table.Let’s talk content as this is one place where kunos skimped out, assetto corsa has a small number of cars & tracks and even the career is small when you look at most other racing games. There are no leader-boards which feel is a MUST on any racing game. It’s almost like kunos sat down one day at a board meeting and said let’s forget about content we will just let the community build the game for us & they have. All you are is a couple of clicks away for endless tracks, cars & apps, even the community has made its own leader-boards (RSR LiveTiming) in my mind this is the only con this game has. But the endless pros far out way this one con.Overall I give this game a SOLID 9.5/10 (FULLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME)			"

												THE WHEELHOP IS REAL!!!!I'm using the Fanatec Porsche 911 GT3 RS V2 Wheel, and let me tell you. I hopped in the Fiat 500, revved up to 6k rpm and let out the clutch and it was real life. Instant uncontrollable shutter from the steering wheel until i managed to find traction when i let out the accelerator. I paused the game and group texted my friends, ""You guys need to come over and try this!"" The realism in this game is outstanding. Ive owned an SRT-4 neon, Subaru Legacy GT Spec.b, and a LS2 6 speed GTO. All VERY different cars. Every car in this game feels insanely different, and they've captured the very essence of pure racing around the track trying various cars. If you are into cars in general, and have a racing wheel, YOU NEED THIS GAME!			"

												Where to start. 350+ hours into this game. Not a moment of boredem. Bought this game earlier in the year. Started to get into it mainly for the drifting side of things. Got about 10 hours in using my xbox microsoft controller. In which i decided to purchase a Logitech G27. Best decision ever. At current i play the game daily. Gonna chuck pros and cons below to my opinion and of me using a wheel.Pro's- Large amount of mods and easy to installGraphics are good and game runs smooth on my Custom budget PC (3 years old now)Standard cars/tracks give enough to keep you entertainedPhysics are not 100% realistic. But very easy to pick up.Con's - Would be nice for the game to detect between H shifter and paddles so you didnt have to change everytime in the menus The cockpit view could do with a slight motion blur to give a concept of speed. go flying into some corners way to fast if you arent concerntrating. As the game is used a lot by people wanting to drift. A points system would be nice.Aside that. I couldnt recommend anyone enough to buy this game. If you have a wheel or your budget means you can buy one. Then do it.			"

								A very good example of a racing game and the father in spirit of Race 07(modding terms and realism terms)as of patch 0.22 things could get better or worsePostives:Great graphicsExtremely easy to mod cars and tracks into the gameGreat ui which is responesivePretty niceOk so to be honest in its state before modding there is a decent amount of content, not a lot and you might be a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as the price is pretty high but the level of quality is crazy high right now which I love about it. The game shines when it comes to modding, its not even out yet and ive modded in about 40-50 cars into the thing, lots of people that porting the mods they made from rfactor or race 07 and gtr evo which is also nice. This game also has a two level system, the menu gui is seperate from the in game racing and stuff so if i alt+F4 it takes me to the menu, do that again the game closes completly, i think i like this as its quicker then clicking esc, end race etc.Engine sounds is pretty good, I think project cars might be better but they have better bass and slightly lack on the highs.Interior detail is unbelievable, I got my father to drive an E30 M3 which he owns as well and he said they drive pretty much the same, they oversteer, loose control all the same.I was a little dissappointed with the standard content considering how much I paid but there are many high quality mods out there.The site I used to get majority of my mods for this game are from here: http://thesimreview.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/Assetto%20CorsaAlso the assetto corsa forums have a few mods which are usable.But a massive con for new guys out there, the driving line is broken as hell, dont brake when it tells you or you will end up at a standstill way before the corners.

								Very very nice game, i am comparing this to forza 4, the graphics are fantastic the level of detail is superb. The driving simulation makes forza feel like an arcade game. And for this reason it doesd take a while getting used to, and playing with the settings. The extent of tuning that you can do to the car is spectacular, form tires and cabmer to amount of fuel and aerodynamics tuning. I really recomend you get this game, if you like racing games, there are not many good ones on pc, but this is the best of what ive seen.Only problem i can see, is that the traction control need altering, but understanably this is an alpha, so imsure this will be worked on. But i tend not to use assists, only using it untill i get used to the game, having been used to forza.			"

								More than a game, a simulator. Assetto Corsa is still in alpha/beta and it's already setting standards in the racing fanatics' community. Having a wheel with this game is a must, as is having a screen as large as possible if a correct and accurate FOV is desired. A triple monitor setup is highly recommended.The physics are absolutely amazing; they set the bar for other racing games for sure.Cons so far: relatively few tracks, but more are in the way. Please add classic tracks like Laguna Seca, Eastern Creek, and Nurburgring Long, Kunos!Also, the car roster needs to be expanded. But Kunos is hard at work licensing more cars, as far as I'm aware.Finally, a ""con"" for many people would be the very fact that this is a simulator. It is very unforgiving to arcade racing ""technique,"" like flooring the gas pedal during curves or overshooting curves. That is, of course, if your pride makes you turn off the in-game assists, since this game is really easy for casual/newbies if you turn on assists.Thanks for reading, and yes, I highly recommend this game to racing fans.

								I feel compelled to write this having just attempted to play GRID...Assetto Corsa is the next best thing to actually owning a Ferrari 458, BMW Z4 GT3 or a Lotus Exos. Now, I haven't actually driven any of the cars included in the game in reality, but the fact is the feel right. I play this with a Logitech Driving Force GT and I used a simple gamepad before that, and even then it felt like driving, plain and simple.The handling, sounds and feel of the game are fantastic. You can really feel the difference with the laser scanned tracks and every little bump is noticable. Cars behave and sound like cars, and the interiors are gorgeously detailed. There are a few issues with it at the moment since it's currently in beta (I had my car once do a forward flip after I braked heavily and the nose went into the road) but things are improved every patch.I can't say enough good things about this. It's a true driving simulator and it's hours and hours of fun, though I would strongly reccomend using a wheel with this.Note: If you're after a ""game"" this probably won't enjoy you. Try the aforementioned GRID or Need for Speed or something.			"

												i still remember the first day i bought assetto corsa, it was a tough times sincei'm really struggling to drive in this game, either the car is understeer or oversteerbut after i look up on some guide and tips, i finally can enjoy driving in this game.it takes a while since i'm using a controller to get used to it,while also i learned how to tune cars. i almost regret buying this game but,that feeling change as i play through the gamePros:+Awesome physics+Variety of car,track and app mods+Great Optimization+Beautiful engine sound (especially mazda rx7 engine)+Simple Graphics Cons:-Online experience is not good enough-Menu Interface kinda look boring-Not a lot of cars to choose (can be fixed with mods)i also heard a lot of people said that this game is unplayable with a controllerand you have to get a wheel set up, howeveri wouldn't say its unplayable,i would say if you wanted to enhanced your experiencein this game , buy a wheel setup and it is playable with a controller, its just you haveto get used to it, if you are willing to give time to practice with a controlleri'm really sure you can do it, if you still didnt trust me you can see the video below of me driving in NÜRBURGRING with a controller (i know i'm not the best driverbut just to give you some proof)

Conclusion: i really recommend it you to buy this game if you really wanted to learnabout cars and willing to give sometime especiallly the ones with controller, its not easy but it is possible. if you dont, i think you will be bored in a shortperiod of time, as for those people that have steering wheel, i highly recommended itto you. i'm still in 100+ hours, planning to keep continue playing this game andhad a plan buying a wheel setup one day.

												Assetto Corsa is by far the best driving simulator I've ever played, and as far as I can tell, is _the_ killer app for VR. I can't entirely explain why, but driving in this game is an exhilarating, gratifying, relaxing, wonderful immersive experience. Pair it with good hardware, and you won't regret this purchase at all. Caveat: Oculus support is still marked as beta, and it _has_ frozen up on me a couple times, so it's not perfect (yet).			"

												Being a fan of racing sims and having years of real driving experience, I've always been looking for a game that allows me to feel the car and the road as close to genuine driving as possible. Assetto Corsa absolutely delivers the real thrill of being behind the wheel of a car. There aren't so many vehicles and tracks to choose from yet, but the ones that are available at the moment - are recreated with maximum detail and with true passion. And more downloadable content is on the way! As to the physics, only iRacing can compete with this game in my opinion - the driving is simply phenomenal. The fact that the development team uses real performance data from car manufacturers puts the experience to a higher level, you can easily lose yourself in this simulation for hours straight. And the graphics are gorgeous, especially if you have pc-horsepower to crank up all the video settings. Cockpit cam is superb, the quality of the interiors is second to none. I recommend playing it in 3D with a good FFB wheel. In a word, this is a must have for all racing fans. And if you are not a racing fan - play Assetto Corsa and you will undoubtedly become one ;)			"

												This is a game, like many, constantly encouraging me to get a computer upgrade (This game is the only one where I've gotten zero frames without the game crashing). But, to be honest if you have the specs, BUY THIS GAME! It's amazing, and as a racer I know exceptionally well about realism. This may be the most realistic racing game ever made. There's always those driving sims that claim they're the best, but none will ever beat this. The graphics and gameplay are amazing too. Bottom line, BUT THIS GAME!			"

								good road feedback, excellent force feedback support, awesomely detailed cars and tracks.Can't wait for more tracks and some AI thrown into the mix;for now it's a driving simulator with very high standards!------------------update: AI has been added, more cars and tracks; excellent sim, was well worth the early purchase, we're not at release candidate status, meaning it's just bugfixing now.they added DK2 support (Oculus) which makes this the best racing sim on the planet (for now?), immersion is top notch, the details on the cars is insane, you can walk around the car, explore the cockpit and you really have the impression you are there!Even with the modest resolution of the DK2 (1920x1080) seeing the road and apex of the corners is very much doable, although a step up in resolution would really make this a killer software title for the Oculus Rift.can't wait for the official nurburgring nordschleife to be added, for now I'm using a converted track and just copied into the AC tracks folder, works wonders and very enjoyable!the AI can be tweaked with a simple 0-100% slider, they are clean racers and overall offer a good challenge for slower pilots like me, I'm pretty sure seasoned race veterans will leave the AI in the dust, but they offer enough challenge... much better than the AI in GT5 and Forza :)best sim/racer out on the PC? Yes sir!------------Update May 2015. Assetto Corsa is now past 1.0 release and it's still going strong; Career option has been added, giving it a good single player experience, although I still miss the ""garage"" of GT5 where miles are tracked and cars need maintenance (even minimal is fine) for top performance. Further more the Nurburgring is now completely inside the game, 20+km of glorious roads, although this update (and some nice extra cars) costs extra (DLC), worth the money? if you're invested in the game: sure; A must buy to enjoy AC? Not really.VR integration hasn't changed since release, still the same menu troubles and absent UI elements; a few hotkeys can be mapped to restart race, reset car. and since latest patch you need to tweak .ini files to get exposure working correctly (otherwise it's too bright); with DK2 using SweetFX to increase sharpness does a lot to get better immersion. Overall in combination with Virtual Deskop, AC with DK2 is very much playable			"

								This is incredible! The bmw is a blast to drive, the ai is a tad bullish but nothing like (shift or project cars) they actually have a bit of survival instinct. The feel of each car is of its own and the gas pedal does bite on the high enders. But can be brought back into control under some light feathering. Finally something besides iracing that doesn't feel like plain ol line between slip and grip sims. you can go from slip back to grip with some refined pedal and wheel work! Just feels great! worth every penny. One early access you know will give back versus some developers that get their money and done. anticipated 10/10 if the community is their to support the multiplayer side of the game.			"

								This game is so realistic and so satisfying that achieving your first clean flying lap will be a fist-pumping accomplishment. It's so good that it convinced me to buy a full wheel/pedal/shifter controller set, *for this game alone*.The track selection, despite being somewhat limited in early-release, lets you get a real taste of different racing styles. Classic 60's Monza, for white-knuckle high-speed straightaways. Tight, technical Magione will feel familiar to autocrossers. The drift circuit, for all the drift pigs to play on. And the sweeping curves and elevation changes at Vallelunga for the sheer joy of motoring.			"

								Assetto Corsa attempts to strike a balance between simulation and casual racer. The team at Kunos Simulazioni have a passion for all things automotive, and it shows with AC's eclectic mix of road vehicles, lightweight sports cars, open wheelers and full on track machines.This is a beta release, so much of the content and features are still to come. But the cars, tracks and challenges available at this point in the development of Assetto Corsa should keep armchair racers happy for a while. The game feels like a gentleman's racer, a laid back title with a subtlety not usually associated with a racing sim. Think Chris Harris rather than Clarkson. When you start the game, no one is shouting at you to drive this and race that with a soundtrack pounding you steadily into submission. You choose what you want to drive, where to race and whom to race against. Menu design is intuitive and is easily navigable. It's a welcome return to when interfaces had function to them with icons and text used to great effect.Pick your car. Choose your track. Go Race. The fun is learning the nuances of each vehicle and trying to exploit them trackside. The Ferrari 599XX EVO is a vastly different beast from the Abarth 500 EsseEsse for example, but each offer their own challenges and provide their own rewards. Take your time to appreciate each car in its own right and you'll begin to enjoy racing for fun again. Driving a lightweight Lotus around a tight, twisting track is as much fun as fun as piloting a GT3 racer around Monza, possibly more so.To get the most out of this title, you will need a wheel but the game supports other inputs and is easily playable using a 360 controller. I use a battle worn and rather creaky logitech G25 and the default force feedback settings work really well, with only some minor adjustment made to the gain. You can of course make many adjustments to your chosen method of control, but I was happy with the out of the box settings.Cars are a joy to drive. I always feel in control and that I can correct any minor mistakes without the rear swapping ends, but I know if I push too hard I'll be barrier bound. AC never let's you feel complacent, it just challenges you to drive as fast as you think you can and lets you feel fantastic when you hook up that record lap. The recently introduced AI is decent but not perfect, especially in large fields. Every update brings improvements and thankfully the days of backflipping BMWs and pirouetting Paganis are thankfully now gone. Small fields of cars with similar performance on appropriate tracks will bring the greatest challenge, with more believable behaviour from your computer opponents. Those wanting multiplayer will have to wait a bit longer for that update though.If you wish for a grown up racer then Assetto Corsa may just be for you, but remember that it's effectively a work in progress and many features are not available at this point. But what there is is at the time of this review is a great indication of what is to come when Assetto Corsa goes final.			"

												As far as PC gaming gets, I've yet to encounter anything that commands my focus and pulls me in as much as this game. The visuals are just stunning, the physics are spot-on, the controller support is just fantastic... I sometimes have to remind myself it's just a game. Singleplayer is very open for mods, so there's no chance it'll ever get boring (Reliant Robin on a Mario Kart track, etc..) Multiplayer is great, but you'll need quick reflexes to avoid aggressive or inexperienced drivers, as they're pretty common. This game is not as much for people who like casual driving games, and I highly doubt this game would be playable without a proper racing wheel. So if you love hardcore simulation, this is your game. My only realy gripes are the often-lackluster AI (losing control in drag races, getting stuck on walls) and shaky connections online, but those are just minor. tl;dr great driving game, very realistic.

												So now that version 1.1 is out, i'm going to do a new (updated) review of this game.First of all. You need to buy the ""Dream Pack DLC 1"" its only 15€ and definitively worth the money. Why? Because you get 10 new cars and 3 variants of the nordschleife. (Only the track would cost around 25$ in iRacing.)This sim is made by Kunos Simulazioni. They are known for netKar Pro a game that had amazing physics, one of the most authentic acutally. Their new title ""Assetto Corsa"" has inherited the physics aspect and they've even improved it. So physics-wise this game is pretty much tied with rFactor 2 its main rival, in having the most realistic physics. Force Feedback wasn't the best since version 1.1 they've improved the FFB (Force Feedback) quite alot. Until now you couldn't really feel every bumb on the track, now you can. It still lacks in letting you know when the car is in a slide, which can be slightly annoying and you can't really feel whether you have countersteered enough or not. The graphics in this game have improved quite alot. If you have a high-end system you can enjoy the stunning graphics. If you have a relatively weak pc you don't have to worry, just make sure you are at minimum requirements level. You can tweak all sorts of things e.g turn post proccessing  completely off, smoke effects can be turned off as well as reflections, you can lower the texture, mirror resolution. Basically you can tweak everything your heart desires. The sounds needs improvement, they are ""not good and not bad"". [The Dream Pack DLC has awesome car sounds BTW.]  The dopplereffect is way too strong and you can tell when the game starts to play the different sound file. There is also only the interior car sound, when you go 3rd person you'll still hear the same sound.The A.I was terrible. I'm glad that Kunos has fixed the A.I in 1.1, they are definitively way more consistent, before the patch you had 1 or 2 cars that were 2-3 sec. a lap faster than the rest of the field, they rammed into you under breaking and in the corners, they had terrible starts. Now that most of this has been fixed (they still may ram you) its really enjoyable to play AC in singleplayer.1.1 Added a passive weather system. You can select, what type of weather you want to have ingame. You can choose between sunny, cloudy, heavy clouds, light fog and heavy fog, thats about it. Trust me if you're going to race on the ""Nordschleife"" you have to play with fog, it adds a lot of atmosphere. I hope that kunos is going to add night time and rain sometime soon.Now to the UI. The main menu isn't the greatest, but you can still find anything you want. (If you install UI mods make sure you enable them in the ""settings"", otherwise they won't work ingame.) Assetto Corsa is compatible with almost all wheels and gamepads and most of them have a default profile. I'd recommend you calibrate the wheel via the calibration tool, its super simple. When you're ingame you can open the ""app menu"" by moving your mouse to the right. You can select many apps from that menu e.g tyre temperature, pedals, seat adjustmen, post proccess filters etc. You can adjust their position and lock most of them if you want them to stay in that postionFInal thoughts.I think that Assetto Corsa is one of the best racing sims out there. It has amazing physics, great graphics, powerfull force feedback and a solid AI. It still doesn't have a proper dynamic weather system, but I'm sure we're gonna see one someday. I hope you found this review helpful, if you did please like this review to let more ppl know. See you on the track!			"

								Assetto Corsa is one of those games that make you stand back and marvel at its brilliance. Well, it is almost there at least. I have wanted to get into sim racers for some time and when I saw this on the Steam Store I brought it. The selection of cars in the game is a good as there are several types of vehicles to choose from, these include open wheel, street and track cars. There is a small selection of tracks with some tracks just be variations but each track suits different cars. You can play this game with a Xbox 360 controller but to get that immersive feeling like you are in the car and driving it you would have to invest in a wheel and pedals. The graphics are actually very good, they could do with a polish but they are great for now. A few little tweaks with the car sounds can make it feel a bit more realistic.As for the current state of the game it is absolutly brilliant. Hopefully AI will be introduced soon and it can make the game one of the best racing games I have played (to be honest, it already is). This is a must for any boy (or girl) racer out there that wants a solid sim racer.			"

												So that i don't write a wall of text I will just point you to video that was made by Assetto Corsa devs. And it is explaining what you get in the game.


YouTube™ Video: Assetto Corsa - Built For Racers Trailer 

			Views: 29,368		

			Built by racing enthusiasts, for racing enthusiasts... Assetto Corsa will be released on August 26th (EU) and August 30th (NA) on PlayStation® 4 & Xbox One. Pre-order NOW!		

But if you want my opinion. I can only say its realistic physics,laser scanned tracks,every car is different handling. And All in all enjoyable feeling.I was driving Lamborghini,and when I got used to it I was like I will go drive Ferrari and loaded up in Ferrari first corner i was off the track :D then I saw you really need to learn each car and master your skills.When you play multiplayer opponents are respectful they are some who still don't know how to drive and they are ramming etc. but it is a game just try to win :)			"

								This is a game I was waiting for a long time and its finally out and better than I hoped. If you are looking for a lifelike handling car sim with up to date graphics and have a fairly up to date and powerful PC. This will blow your mind if you have reached that point where arcade-like games just aren't fulfiling.I recommend that you buy yourself a racing wheel to enjoy this game properly. It is very easy to drive with an XBOX360 controller asuming you have the right settings first.I would rate this game in the following aspects:Current Content  26/11/2013   : 4/10Full Release Content                 : 8/10/Future use (mods)                    : 8/10Graphics                                   : 8+/10Handling                                   : 9+/10My hardware :CPU : Intel ivy-bridge i5 3570K@3.4GHzRAM: 8GB DDR3GPU: nVidia GTX 660 Ti - Driver : 331.82Rez : Full HD 1080p@60HzOS  : MS Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit""My racing simulator""			"

												Assetto Corsa does a lot of things brilliantly, but does fall short in a couple of aspects:Beautiful & Laser scanned tracks 10/10. Track atmosphere should feel more alive i.e. added crowds, cheering etc on race day.Accurately detailed cars 9/10. Sounds 7/10.Visuals 9/10. Good content and vast selection of both cars (street & race) and tracks 8/10. Ever expanding with well priced & free DLC's.Good FFP, physics & simulation aspect 7/10. Still missing some key elements such as simulated pits, car systems such as brake temps etc.AI still needs improvement, and the team is always fine tuning & updating their behaviour 6/10.Massive modding community, and lots of quality content to be had 8/10.Over all, and as a package, this is one of the most complete Sims on the market and it will consistently reward you for your driving efforts. If you are racing fan, and have a racing wheel, Assetto Corsa is a must.9/10.			"

												Game is okay - controls and response from my controller seem sluggish and delayed, which makes it hard to play. My biggest complaint? The fact they just released a $15 DLC pack, and the main game itself has such a tiny collection of cars. on top of that, there is no menu music, the buttons don't clearly state what they are so you're kind of left guessing in some parts, and the controller support only works during a race and not for any of the menus! Why would I want to put my controller down and grab my mouse/keyboard for navigating the menu? In conclusion - game has a lot of potential, but come on AC team. Get your prirorities straight, and deliver us a good complete game before you go fishing for more DLC money...			"

												I'm more a rally person. Ok I've grinded Gran Turismos on Playstations.. But on PC and sim racing, rally has been my no.1, thanks to Richard Burns Rally.Now I see myself enjoying more and more of driving on tarmac tracks. Driving Assetto Corsa. I've tried iRacing and pCARS etc. iRacing was good but I don't like monthly subscription system.. I guess it is worth it, but still, my gaming is seasonal. Back to AC. One reason for it is Ferrari F40. 90% of my playtime so far is trying to handle that beast. Really handle. Not to drive like my grandma. No more comments on that atm :DPS. This review is for players with decent wheel controller. I'm going to buy pedals with clutch soon.. Thanks F40 & AC.10/10			"

												I love driving in this game. The physics are difficult but once you get over the learning curve it's very rewarding. The graphics are outstanding, as is the sound. But that's all this game has going for it.The career mode could not be more dull. It's a very simple, linear game. And since there are hardly any cars or tracks it gets repetitive. There is nothing to work for. No currency to buy cars, no ""tournaments"" that you can only enter by meeting certain qualifications, no licences. I'm not even sure why they call it a career mode. The experience of being a carrer racing driver is not there.Coming from console gaming, and in particular playing the Gran Turismo series, this game is a huge letdown. I am hoping somebody comes out with a decent sim eventually because there's not much to offer on PC right now.			"

												Honestly i had so much hope for this Sim... the Problem is that its nothing more than a hot lap sim .... the Career mode sucks, no pit stops, no quali, the damage model is a joke, no night racing, no endurance (nothing more than 30 lap race), NO WEATHER and news that the game is going to be ported to console. The game isn't even ready on PC let alone porting it over to a console. Get a grip Such a shame because as i say it has got a lot of hope going for it. Why on earth they made DLC is madness in my eyes. Also there hasn't been a patch since April.... we are in July now. I pray to god they get there act together. At least the game isn't as bad as Project Cars. Its nowhere near as good as ISI or Reiza Studio games.			"

												Il explain my experience here. And a few absolutes. After switching on most games you get to play them However that was not thecase with  AC. I havent managed to play it yet. The General User Interface (GUI) is in one word... Diabolical. It is set up like a website and not very clear what you have to actually do to get it to work. I set the screen at 800x600 because that is the only way I could get it to display the whole thing. (its usually 1280x900/720).Then when I get on the actual track its not clear how to get the car to actually move... Then when it eventually does move, its undrivable with massivve oversteer (not very realistic at all). But if that was the only problem I wouldnt have commented here. I would have sorted it but to be frank this game will never get played. The whole experience of it is as mentioned Diabolical. I like to pick up my controller and press the buttons and play. This requires constant use of a mouse which to me makes it unplayable. If I could get my money back I would. Its terrible. And will never play it.  "

												The best Racing Sim/Hard+software engineer RPG ever made.Want to race beautifully rendered high powered cars around outstanding laser scanned tracks from around the world? Hells yeah! Want a really excellent car set-up ability that really feels like it makes a difference? This game really does have all that in spades. Okay the career is a bit boring, but online racing is good. The cars really handle very differently to each other and the laser scanned Nurburging Nordschleife is an absolute joy to drive.Then a couple of times a year a patch comes along +/- DLC. This is where the game suddenly becomes RPG. You've proved your metal on the track, you've fine tuned those racing machines to your perfection...now have you got what it takes to do the same to your PC and the software? Before you can get back out on to the track you must cut your way through another field of hopefuls, all floundering in the sand trap cos the FPS drop sent them there, desperately trying to find the fix to get them out of the techno babble hell they've been sent to. My fellow hopeful asked a simple question on a forum (the guy had about as much knowledge as me...not a lot) and got this reply....'26% total core load, yes but what are your individual core loads? You might have one core being hammered to the point that it affects the proceeding cores causing a bottleneck.' FANTASTIC! Possibly the worst good point I ever saw on a gaming forum. I've been stuck in this RPG phase of the game over a week. Sure I've learnt some stuff about hardware and software, but really I just want to drive a racing car in a video game. I don't want to be going into game files and changing numbers or spending 20hrs in forums after every patch.If I was to score out of ten, 5 for the drive sim, 0 for the RPG. 5/10.			"

												Do you enjoy Forza? Looking for something similar, but that you can play on PC? Hoping to use an Xbox 360 controller or something similar because you don't have $300-$1000 of disposable income to buy on a racing wheel? Look elsewhere. I bought this because I have played all kinds of racing games over the years, but hadn't really found a good PC racing game. This looked like the answer, but after a little over a half an hour of skidding into walls while trying frantically to saw at the wheel in a vain attempt to regain control of my vehicle, I realized that this is not the game for me.Realistically, in the ""Requirements"" section, a racing wheel should be listed. If you're going to say that you support the Xbox 360 controller, then I shouldn't have to futz with the settings just to finally get it to a point where the most minute of movements doesn't have the driver spinning the wheel frantically from side to side. Honestly, this problem has been SOLVED. Turn 10 obviously is aiming almost exclusively for the 360 controller, but these developers basically just shoved in some nonsensical presets and called it a day. It appears to respond as it would to the analog input of a wheel, which is ridiculous. A wheel has wildly different affordances than a 360 controller, yet the default presets make the game unplayable with said controller.Not to mention the fact that the game crashed multiple times on me in various settings menus. I'm very disappointed with Assetto Corsa. As a racing fan, I was hoping that this would be the answer for my craving for a solid racing game to replace Forza. What I received was a buggy game that only appears to be enjoyable if you've got a racing wheel. Which is fine, but I wish I had known that *before* I dropped $60 on the game. Now, because there is no refund policy for games that you instantly regret buying, I get to look at this game resentfully in my library every time I open Steam.If you've got a pro racing setup already in your home and you're a racing sim veteran, then this review really isn't for you. However, if you, like I was previously, are looking for something to fill a Forza-sized hole in your PC library, look elsewhere.			"

The feeling of the sim is pretty much right on point (using G27 wheel) being smooth and not overdriving is key or you'll end up scrubbing speed and losing time, once you get the feeling and get accustomed you'll start to see the rewards this sim will give you for respecting it. This is no arcade type sim, so don't buy this if you plan on driving it like you would on forza or need for speed.  Can't wait to see what they come up with once it's fully released with online, this will give iRacing a run for its money especially when Nurburgring Nordschleife is on this service.			"

								My computer is under the minimun requirements (AMD Athlon II X2 255, 4Gb RAM and an Asus HD 5450 1Gb) and I've got a 90º wheel from Trust.After getting and testing the non-steam version of the 0.2 pre release and seeing that I can run the game at playable FPS (~30 @1280x720) I couln'd wait to play the 0.3 version. The release day for the 0.3 passed and I was checking so many times a day to see if there was a non-steam version of the 0.3 alvailable.After 3 or 4 days I couldn't wait anymore and bought the game on steam. 11/10 would buy again. My next move is going to be a Driving Force GT.Can't wait for what is to come - AI, Multiplayer, Asian and American Cars and new tracks. Keep it up Kunos!			"

												Hands down my favourite racing sim on the market. The only bad thing I can think of about this game is that the sounds are not up there with the likes of Raceroom Racing Experience. But then again not a lot is. The physics are really good imo however some people do not seem to think so. Also the FFB is really nice and gives you a good sense of how the car behaves and where the limit is. It is a highly moddable game with hundreds of mods already available from early access. I would highly reccomend this game to any with a keen eye on racing. You do not have to have a racing wheel to play this game but I would strongly suggest you invest as it is a comepletely different experince and one that is worth the money that it costs. So overall, go purchase this game right now.			"

												I'm starting to love this game, though you need to put some work into it (both in terms of driving and setup). Here is a 4 step guide to get you started:1. Run the LUT Generator to (vastly) improve force feedback and then check for clipping.2. Set pre-rendered frames to 1 in nvidia's profile inspector to get rid of the steering lag (if you have any). Tweak some settings while you're there.3. Install Bridgehampton and Caterham Academy.4. Lean back and enjoy. Wait, I mean, DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE!			"

EDIT 5/3/2017Review has turned negative. As a guy who mainly plays offline, I'm still disappointed on how the devs ignore AI problems that I've addressed countless times and how they've generally programmed it in a bad way (a few good examples here). As someone in the comments section says: ""This championship mode is totally useless. Not just because of the bad AI, but also because it's lacking many essential race rules, and you can't save your progress between sessions. So you are forced to do a whole race event (generally weekend) within one sitting."".

Obviously, if you play online then go for it. Pros and cons in this review remain the same.The GameAssetto Corsa is a decent (but not the best) simulator racing game, developed by a small devteam, Kunos Simulazioni, who previously developed Netkar Pro which is also a racing sim.The best parts of this sim are the immersion, feeling and extremely accurate tracks and cars.

Sadly, the worst part is the AI and the general offline experience.PROS+ Simulative car driving and tuning, highly enjoyable with a good steering wheel+ Laser-scanned tracks+ Good graphics and sound effects+ Customizable, user-friendly and VR support+ The apps systemCONS- Bad and robotic AI- Career mode is uninteresting and avoidable- No night racing and rain- http://www.racedepartment.com/threads/the-physics-discussion-thread.127125/page-7#post-2328232------------------Quick AI statusThe AI in AC is programmed to only recognize TWO racing lines. The ideal racing line, and the overtaking line (yes, even in very wide roads, like that fictional American track). It's a system that is not flexible at all. When both lines are occupied by two AI drivers, the other AI drivers behind act like ""what do I do"" and end up switching lines awkwardly until one of the lines clears out.This is also an issue in multi-class races where Lamborghinis don't even know how to overtake a freakin' Fiat Abarth, even when there's a lot of space on track. Also, single-class race is the only recommended approach, this is why I only tend to race with all AI having the exact same car as mine. AI isn't much variable nor have different skills, timing, reactions etc. for each driver.Even single-class AI cars have a bit of a problem trying to overtake, though. AI drivers behind you tend to brake and slow down much more.The AI has also got supernatural strenght. If you crash into AI, only you -the player - lose control. AI car just keeps going without even sliding one inch or something.There are also some serious game-breaking bugs. AI can't manage fuel well, in fact I've done a race in Nordschleife and during the second/third lap, literally every AI driver ran out of fuel mid-track. Also, restarting a couple of times results in AI retiring on race start because their fuel or car reliability don't get restored.I've also heard the AI also has stability assists on but that was long ago. I don't know if the devs have switched them off.Last but not least, the ""racing on rails"" and ""not making any mistakes"" clichès.The offline championship mode was a nice surprise, didn't expect the devs to include it, mind you. Assetto Corsa has PLENTY of potential, but it's not a game I would recommend to offline players... YET. The fact that the last couple of updates have done nothing to the AI kinda makes me worried, so I like to think major improvements are under development.﻿ "

I had 3 year break from simracing which ended with me buying AC. It gave me same thrill and fun as rF back in the days. If you want to have fun from driving racing cars, as I do, this game is for you. It has flavs that everyone complaining about, but every game has some. I'ts getting better in some areas where it was the weakest, so we will see if it will satisfy majority of racers. Bottom line, If you can have fun from and racing, worth. If you are gonna complain about not perfect online community, not ideal league tools, w8 some more time.			"

												A great sim with a deep understanding of the underlying physics that effect handling and weight transfer of anything with four wheels. Perhaps its slightly too clinical in its approach - a consquence of which makes some of the slower road cars lose their sense of speed a little, but overall a this is a minor critisism to what is an overall a finely balanced racing sim that is a joy to drive, even with the track to yourself.9/10			"

								Great and soon to be better. Could use some sound improvements. (Some sound updates already) Love the way you can feel every dip, bump,twist, or even the torque of the motor as you drive with your FFB wheel.Make sure you are aware that this is a sim not a simcade. Please don t judge it till you have tried with a wheel. This is not a joypad or keyboard sim, they can be used thou. Really hard to write a review on a early acess title. Just remember you also get to play as the sim grows. Also the advantage to improve your setups and learn the tracks. I can see this as a $60 sim at full release. If your a console gamer not use to a sim racer your probally not goin to like it. This is not your hold the gas to the floor and ride the rail around the track racing.Also, a nice rig and a decent video card helps a lot.(DX11)  1920x1080 or better also helps make this even more real along side a FFB Wheel.

Early Access Review
								I read the review from Gamer Muscle and it made me laugh and because of the detail of the review tempted me to purchase it. So I bought it and I am not disappointed at all. It's a brilliant game especially concidering the fact it's in BETA mode. There are only a few cars available and there are also only a few tracks, but it's still good fun. To play it I have a Thrustmaster Ferrari Edition Racing wheel which is not listed in the pre-configurations, but that's okay! You can easily configure the controls easily. It took me about 1 minute to set it up correctly. I did have to invert the throttle and brakes because they were the wrong way around but that's also fine.The gearbox is impossible to change to manual. I want manual and you cannot change it; although you are allowed to interfere with the gearbox in-game and change up/down at will, but if the game detects it's too early then it changes back to what it thinks it should be. Hopefully this will be fixed at some point...Another problem I have found when using my racing wheel is that the steering is really poor. I turn about 2 degrees and the wheels lock up and I jjust spear straight off. This is with all of the cars I use and it's really annoying because it's ruining the game for me. I have tried adjusting the sensetivity of the steering but so far, no luck... If anyone can help me with this then that's great, I'll test it out and let you know. Otherwise I would like to see it fixed. The game for me is set of maximum settings and it runs perfectly... Very well optimised. This is my setup and it works great on maximum everything.CPU: Intel Core i5 3570KGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680RAM: 8GB Corsairetc.The game overall is extremely good and I can't wait for the finished product! Despite the fact it's in BETA mode and it will have regular updates I fully 100% recommend this game to everyone! It's brilliant and in the short time that I have played I haven't found any bugs whilst in the game... Just a few setup issues as mentioned before.If you're looking at my recorded play time and thinking ""why should I listen, you've barely played it!""; well, if I'm writing a review without having even played an hour and I'm extremely impressed with it then you can imagine that I'll be playing a lot more in my spare time!EDIT: Since the review I have found how to adjust the gearbox to manual! It was right in front of me all the time in the realism settings! I have also adjusted the steering sensetivity and deadzones etc. for ages and it's still awful. And no, I'm not trying to enter a corner at 500 MPH. I'm doing it at a range between 60 MPH (100 KPH) down to ~37 MPH (60 KPH) and at both speeds, it's awful!			"

Graphics and engine sounds are good as well.Only thing is that this game has few cars and tracks at the moment. Cant wait to play the complete ver of this game.			"

This review contains spoilers!Kunos Simulazioni has put in very hard work to create something like this especially in early access or alpha version. I think the game will advance after every single version developers will made so that Assetto Corsa will become a perfect PC simulator game. I also love that the developers have included 114 Steam achievements in the game so far.Overall driving physics and especially drifting is amazing, I have not enjoyed something like that before. Sound also is mind-blowing. I recommend it to everyone who loves sports, simulation and racing games.By akuustik from Latvia. "

												Superb racing simulation.  Playing the first 4 hours of the newly released career I was unable to put this game down.  I feel as if I have just driven 4 hours on a real track.  The steering feel and weight are perfect, the feeback through the wheel means you can push the cars to find the limit just as you would in real life.  There is no need to use the 'dotted racing line' on screen as you can feel the cars through the corners.  In the front wheel drive cars understeer is telegraphed and easy to feel as you reach the limit of grip.  More impressively oversteer in cars like the E90 M3 starts with a slight pull on the wheel in opposite to the direction of travel - an excellent simulation of the yaw effect which gives you plenty of warning to react and correct.  A simulation as close to reality as I've experienced, the cars feel properly hooked up to the track.  Well worth the money.Updated for the Steam Awards, Assetto Corsa deserves a shot in the Test of Time category because here is a game from 2014 that even today gets plenty of play time.  They've continued to improve the game and it remains a gem on the pc.VR support is also superb in this game, try the latest Porsche 919 for the full effect, incredible.			"

Early Access Review
								Brilliant sim. Its only getting better in my opinion, with more tracks and cars being released all the time.There are a few flaws though, like the Career mode, Force feedback and the online multiplayer (Although that is still in beta.) There is no 'Host' multiplayer button in game on assetto corsa, you have to run your own dedicated server which can be a pain with some routers. Dedicated servers are really good, but i would like to be able to play in private servers with my friends so we dont have to race against people who are likely to hit you off etc. The career mode is in my opinion pretty poor. Its just like a challenge mode, there is no type of series or championships like you would get on other games. There are just time trails, 5 lap races on different tracks with different cars but its really boring and i dont get any sense of achievement even when i do get the gold medal. Im hoping for an improvement so i can play single player, and actually enjoy it! The FFB is okay, its improving but there can be some dodgy moments where you feel like the car is stepping out on you, but it is not and when you go to correct the car, it simply spins the other way. I dont know if thats just with the DFGT Wheel but it certainly can be annoying. However, driving on this game is brilliant. The cars all feel different to eachother, the graphics in the cockpits look real, you can even change your on board settings to fit the 1st person view to where you are comfertable. When you get your wheel settings right, there is literally 0 input lag, so when you move your wheel, it moves in sync with the onscreen wheel perfectly giving you more precise controls with the car.It has a selection of amazing tracks, like Silverstone, Spa, Nurburgring, Imola and you can also add mods to your game which expands the variety even more. The more i play the game, the more i like it and with future DLCs and more mods i can only see the game going forwards. "

If you are like me and have a vested intrest in cars or wish to get into sim racing AC is the perfect game for you and now is an exellent time to start as 2016 loooks to be the game's biggest year development and content wise and with support like that I'm bound to enjoy this game for years to come.

												Playing this with an Oculus Rift DK2 and a Thrustmaster TX wheel.This is a really thoughtful, polished, restrained car sim. No, there aren't a ton of tracks. But the ones I've tried so far are fantastic. There aren't a billion cars, but every one I've tried feels exactly right, looks great, and they're extremely diverse. You can drive Niki Lauda's Ferrari 312T around the Nurburgring. And it'll feel like it.They're still making major improvements, too. Like, brand new race AI? Brand new tire model? Sure! Makes an excellent tarmac companion to Dirt Rally. Much, much, much more enjoyable and of consistently high quality than Project CARS.			"

								Outstanding driving simulator. Easily the most realistic physics and car feedback through the wheel I have ever felt outside of a real car. I own a BMW E30 with sports suspension, and handling of the ingame E30 M3 is absolutely spot on. The FFB effects using a G27 wheel are accurate, subtle, and give the feeling of being connected to a real car.Even at Beta 0.2, with loads more content and improvements yet to come, I can happily say this is the driving simulator we have been waiting for. Here is a formula proving how good is: Live for Speed x 10 + real cars and laser scanned tracks + nice graphics = Assetto Corsa = Driving Sim Nirvana			"

Early Access Review
								I owned and played nkPro (the developer's last racing game) - so I watched the flurry of broken promises and other chicanery which evolved around it and I was VERY skeptical about this.Even if we avoidthe ""unfinishedness"" issues - and this is an Early Access title so that's a risk - would the game be 'too hardcore' (as nkPro was) or simply not that great?I'm a pad player too - no room/cash for a wheel - so I was also worried by people saying the pad controls weren't really that good - overall I wasn't keen but I had my arm twisted and...Let me absolve any of you who have those worries by saying the following1 - it's a really good driving game but it's not super-hardcore - it feels realistic without being hard to drive (e.g. nkPro) but it's a bit deeper than Forza/GT etc,2 - it's fine with a pad - you will want to ignore the stock 360 controller option but once you're setup - it's fine.To expand on the pad thing - I've chosen to map the pad as-if it were a wheel - gamma 1.00, Filter 0.01, Speed Sens is 0.20 - it's not perfect (no deadzone means a somewhat vague idea of 'dead ahead') but it's quite playable/you can be reasonably competitive.The tracks/cars in there already offer a huge range of stuff to-do too - so overall I'm a happy bunny and I recommend you take a peek!

												First off, the necessities:1) You WILL need a proper wheel. Think Logitech G25/ G27/ G920, Thrustmaster T300rs/ T500rs, Fanatec CSR etc. FORGET about using the keyboard or even a controller.2) You WILL need to learn the very basics of going fast. Wide in, tight through, wide out; Do most of your braking before entering the turn; Learn the braking zones.3) You WILL, most likely (depending on your previous experience with racing sims or real racing), experience a very hard learning curve before you're going to be able to compete for 1st place. And this is only the AI, I haven't experienced online racing yet so can't comment there.4) You WILL, eventually, start fiddling with car settings to gain a fraction of a second in your laptimes.Now then, with that out the way, here's the rundown on the game itself: It is, in my experience, probably the most fun racing sim you can get as of right now. There is a satisfying selection of cars to choose from, with more being released in the form of reasonably priced DLC.This is a racing simulator, pure and simple. Do NOT expect this to allow you to customize cars in-game a la Gran Turismo or Forza. Again, this is a racing sim. You get in your car, you practice until your arms are numb, and then you practice some more.If you like racing, whether you're an actual racing driver, a weekend racer, or just always had aspirations of becoming a racing driver, get this game right now. You will likely love it to bits.If you're more into picking up a controller and just be able to compete straight away, this may not be the game for you. Even if you happen to fall into this category though, I would still recommend getting this, borrowing a wheel if you can, and just trying it... It's that fun and that addictive.			"

								The purest sim on the market.  I'll really know when Project Cars goes live but damn, you can tweak EVERYTHING on these cars!  And the cars.....!  Excuse me, had to wipe the drool off my chin.  Did mention the cars?  And they continue to add more.  The tracks and beautiful.  But beware, arcade is a dirty word around Kunos.  This game is gorgeous and the teaser trailer does not due it justice, it is even more graphically beautiful then any other game I have ever owned.  This game is demanding, it demands your respect, it demands your TIME (  you have to invest a considerable amount of time in this, tweaking, tweaking and then you must tweak )  The publishers set out to make the ultimate driving and racing sim and they  suceeded, boy did they suceed.There are many, many pros for this game, maybe too many to mention but a few are:a)  The beauty of the gameb)  The close attention to details in both cars and tracks.  The weather options work as weather works IRL.  The sky acts like the sky IRL.  The cars act as they are supposed to but I really can't stand behind that statement because in all of my 65 years I have never driven any of these vehicles, lol but I trust Kunos on that.c)  Blah, blahba blab blah blabThe only con I can mention is this:This game is an accurate simulation of racing.  If you don't know what your doing (like for instance...me) it does not hold your hand.  Learn or never successfully race again.  When driving the powerful cars ( and AC lets you drive them all) you rarely recover from the condition known as Leadeus Footites.  You won't advance very far in the career mode if you do not put in the time to learn the intricaces of the game.  This game is tough with a capital What The Hell Did I Do Wrong This Time?, T. The AC community are very friendly and helpful, that is until you race them.  Those that know what they are doing will K I l l you everytime.  As I mentioned earlier, you have to invest your time, you have no choice if you want to fully enjoy this game.  Fortunately,  I got this on sale (which made my friend in the British Isles, Skymarshall_uk very irked) but I don't regret a dime I have invested in it.All in all I rate game on  a couple of levels:    Beauty and Asthetics:  I can only go to 10 so I give it 11+                                                                          Difficulty:  Again, I can on go to 10 but it's much harder than that                                                                          Playability and Replayability:  10, if you invest the time                                                                          Controller Accessibilty:  Supports all wheels that I can see                                                                          Final rating:  10  I recomend this to ALL gearheads and wannabees (like me)Thanx for reading and hopefully this helps you in your selection.  The Managment.Oh, and by the way, you had better have some heft in your video graphics card and speed in your CPU.  It may run for you if you don't but I don't think you will enjoy the beauty of the game if you don't.			"

												This is the best sim out right now!  I'm having a blast with it!  The physics of the game feel very natural, and so do the graphics.  So many mods to play around with, super easy to mod, and I have even created a number of tracks for it using Race Track Builder.  I mostly use this sim for rally play (with mods of course), because AI is average at best.  I prefer RF2 for curcuit racing, because their AI is far far ahead of anyone.  I can't speak much about multiplay, as I generally don't play it.  My Fanatac gear works great!  If you like sim racing games this is a must have!			"

												An absolutely excellent simulation game, with full support for a range of racing wheels and pedals. The DLC is perhaps the best model I've seen for any game, you pay a fair price for different cars, each with fully modelled interiors and variants, and one huge track per pack which is always highly detailed and includes every little road curve and bump. The modding scene is alive and very easy as you simply drag and drop cars and tracks into the content game folder, and they appear in-game straight away with no hassle. Gameplay-enhancing mods are also available if you prefer having some different changes to your game.If you're looking for a great simulation racer and other games just aren't doing the trick, then look no futher than Assetto Corsa. Highly recommended. This is one of my favourites games on PC at the moment.			"

								Assetto Corsa is a visually stunning racing simulator. With graphics backed by solid physics and a fully customizable UI, this has the chance to revive PC racing sims. The contiually increasing selection of cars and tracks provide a variety of racing experiences. From normal curcit racing, to drifting, to drag racing, Assetto Corsa offers huge replayability. However, this game does have some things wrong with it. The AI are both too aggresive and not aggresive enough. Often, AI will come speeding down a straight into the back of anyone who happened to brake too early. Other times, they will refuse to pass someone they could easily overtake. The AI are racing on a two-lane road. If two cars are taking up the lanes ahead, the AI won't try and find a gap, but will instead follow angrily behind. Overall, Asseto Corsa is looking like it will be the game that revives PC racing sims. But it has quite a few things that need to be worked out before this can become a full game. I would recomend this game to die-hard racing fans, but wait for a full release for casual gamers.			"

								Finally, a decent race game with a cockpit view!   Despite, some shaggy trees and other enviroments, graphics look great.  Still, it would be great to see much more details in cockpit view.    Other than that, Controls are good. I don't have a wheel but I play this game with Logitech F710 and it makes you feel you really have control of the car.   My only concern is when you hit another car nothing happens! You don't feel the impact of crash. Neither You see any visual damage nor you feel any gameplay differences when you hit.It is as if you hit a cardbox instead of a  	elephantine cars.Still, as an early acces game, Assetto Corsa doesn't fail to impress and I guess it is must buy for any racing fan out there.

								Assetto Corsa offers an outstanding and unforgettable experience in the Oculus Rift DK2.  VR is the future of sim racing and if you have a VR+wheel+pedals setup you'd be crazy to not own AC.  Aside from its VR support, it's still quite solid in other areas.  Graphics, physics, sound, and UI are all good.  Multiplayer support is fair but improving.  Car modeling is very good on all fronts, especially the interior modeling.  Support for third-party content is excellent.  Even just one of the best third-party tracks is worth the (quite modest) purchase price of AC alone.  Seek out those tracks and you will be handsomely rewarded!			"

								To really find enjoyment in this game, you have to like racing games, and preferably own a wheel. I, unfortuantly, do not own a wheel, so this review comes from a gamepad standpoint. Overall, this game is brilliant. There isn't a better way to put it, and to get it for $20 was even better. I really appreciate the level of detail in each car, and each track. Driving them though can be annoying and not too entertaining. Get everything right though, and it's a memorable experience.The controls are the biggest drawback here. Like I said above, unless you own a wheel, you are not going to have a great time. I spent quite a bit of time just tweaking settings trying to get everything to an acceptable level. Even now I am not thrilled with the control layout and feel I currently have. Back to the cars, and the game. The menu can be a bit confusing at start, and the depht of cars isn't great. Tracks suffer the same thing too. The cars though are models very well, although I cannot comment on the accuracy of the physics models behind each one. If you are looking for a good racing game, Assetto Corsa is one that has a lot of potential, but don't expect to be immediatlly thrilled by it. It takes time, and a lot of tweaking, to really make the most out of this game. Once you get past that though, there is a lot of fun to be had.			"

								This is an okay game. It could use a better SDK and the ability for players to modify already released cars so that they can drive them with different specs from the default, but otherwise, this is an okay racing game. It needs some music, and has some twitchy controls with steering wheels, but supports practically all steering wheels even the driving force GT steering wheel.-- Content Creation --If you are like me and into content creation. You can make your own tracks using the Assetto Corsa track, make car retextures, create a custom car based on the Formula K car that Assetto Corsa comes with and more. I've only done the car retextures and gotten tracks that other modders have made. This helps to make this among the best racing games out there in my opinion. Especially since there are a lot of modders out there trying to make content for this game.-- Steering wheel controller --Works mostly with the Logitech G27 steering wheel, but the steering wheel's shift indicator doesn't work... (( Look below for solution to this )) It's okay, though kind of takes away from the feel of the game for me. The game with this steering wheel will shift in such a way that allows you to use the manual shifter (H-pattern) when in a car that has an H-pattern shifter, otherwise you're restricted to the paddle shifters for those cars that have that. I prefer the H-Pattern shifter, but there many cars in the game that don't use that shifter. -- Other issues --Currently no career mode, and when its added hopefully it won't force people to drive all manner of cars... Currently some cars are very twitchy if you accelerate oddly quick. This is mostly something from the high horsepower cars.-- Solutions to problems above --* Steering wheel issue with G27 and no LEDs use. Download FanaLEDs program, In FanaLEDs program do File - Open Settings, open Global, change revledtype to 1, then save, close FanaLEDs and reopen it. Now you can set up the RPM percentage you want to start counting at, for me this is 60%. And it will count up each LED on the steering wheel until about 500 RPMs before red line and at red line it will start flashing the LEDs to indicate that you need to shift up. I love Assetto Corsa now that this feature works, maybe they will make it so we don't need to use FanaLEDs to get this to work in the future.*** UPDATE as of Release Candidate 1.0.1 ***The game's cars don't act like the real world cars anymore. In particular, the production car ones. They feel too twitchy and act more like what you'd expect on an arcade game instead of being something like you'd get on a driving simulator game like GT5. Hopefully, they'll fix this for the actual release.			"

								This game is wildly fun and has levels of fun and complexity for virtually any player. The physics in the game are unbelievable, and it's a blast to play. Game is playable with a controller, (not very well in my opinion, I just don't like using my xbox controller) but I use a g27 with the pedals and the H-Shifter. Wildly fun, and still being updated regularly! Patches come quickly and the game developers actually seem to care about their product. If you can get it during the next steam sale (or now if you really want to), PICK THIS UP. There are tons of cars to choose from, many different tracks, and you can tackle the game with any skill level. As of right now, the developers are working on making the AI in the game more suited to race people, as sometimes there are tiny problems in the code causing a few cars to immediately pit and stay there, something or other--don't let this stop you though. The game is still in late alpha and this is to be expectedTl;dr - Game is still in late alpha, 100% playable. Can be played with a controller, I prefer a wheel. Cars, tracks, general improvements and rebalancing of cars as well as AI are still in progress. Physics are incredible, I've never played something more realistic on steam. PICK UP THIS GAME ASAP IF YOU'RE INTO DRIVING SIMULATORS THAT HAVE REALISTIC PHYSICS AND CAN BE PLAYED BY ANYONE!!! "

								I'm new to actual racing sims, having only played Forza 4 and F1 2012. I don't have a steering wheel and pedal set. I play Assetto Corsa with a PS3 gamepad. The game is early access and is, right now, a very good time trial simulator. The way I played it, being new to racing sims, was to pick a car and a track, and play the hell out of it (I picked the E92 M3 and Silverstone GP). I also tried the other cars a bit but my main focus was this car/track combo.If you are also new to racing sims, this is the right way to play, because you want to find out quickly if you can't enjoy racing sims. That is, if you can't enjoy playing the same car and track over and over, slowly eking out an extra second or fraction of a second through gradually better perception of the car's handling and of the track's quirks (because even simulated driving of cool cars on awesome tracks is always enjoyable). I found out I do enjoy racing sims. By now, I've played it well over a day of real time, have considered buying a wheel and pedals setup, and regularly read up on the cars' and tracks' real-life counterparts along with articles on how to drive faster and tune cars for racing. I consider myself obsessed with motorsport now, and I'm sure that when I get the wheel and pedals it's only going to get worse (better?). NB: I also went back and tried Forza 4 and F1 2012 for comparison. It is much easier to drive fast in Forza but I'm pretty sure that's the more forgiving physics model. Assetto Corsa is less forgiving but I feel it is more realistic and therefore I get into it more; it seems like I can make some rather serious mistakes in Forza and they won't matter. To me, F1 2012 actually doesn't seem that bad compared to Forza; it seems like the cars act like they do on TV. There is a fair amount of skill transfer to the Formula Abarth in Assetto Corsa, and F1 2012's video run-through's of tracks also help.			"

								Considering its half built this an awesome game for the motor racing fan, its got a lot more compelling now you can race the cpu. I thoroughly recommend it for the sim fan, and if your an arcade racer, give it a try as its cutting edge in terms of graphice and sounds plus it allows you to choose your difficulty level.			"

								very good sim but still has its flaws  such as braking on non-ABS cars is just plain stupid  and needs refinement especially for ppl using 360 controller. loading up suspension to cut back another direction  in an S-bend will not work and actually causes you to lose grip. another ""BS"" moment. Also, really the level of car's grip on slow turns in this game is  just plain pathetic and almost laughably wrong even if following a race line.my truck handles better in real life than the M3 on this game so that should say something. i also believe the ""feeling of acceleration,speed, and decelleration is basically non existant. and makes me equate this game to driving as a i would assume a blowup doll might be to sex .  you may also care that all units of measurements in this game are metric so no MPH for us USA guys or girls. but overall a great game and possibly the best SIM on PC or console ,but Id really like to see it improved .

								This game is EPIC. You want a real simulator game with epic graphics? You got it right here! This game is simple magnificent! The graphics are sublime and the cars seemed passed on a scanner so much they are real! The handling are realistic so are the assist in the game. You can turn on and off ABS, and Traction contrl (and on some car have different settings) while racing, making you have tail happy fun without quitting your session. The photo mode is Spectacular!!!! You can change everything in it!, change the daylight and sun position, making it perfect for simulating morning pictures, This game is spectacular, i have only a very short time on it for now, but ill make a new review as i go along. This game is worth every dollar. I paly with a gamepad, so my experiences isnt the best but its drivable. best would be a G27 wheel.10/10!			"

								I've been playing for a little while now and the driving mechanics are awesome. The only reason I bought this game was because of the support for Oculus Rift Dk2 and then came to LOVE AC. I drive the lotus 98T without any driver assists except ABS and it gets my heart pumping and hands start to sweat when racing with others online. In the rift you can really ""Feel"" the G's as the car goes into a corner or when doing an inertia drift. I play this over Project Cars because of how the cars feel. The lotus 98t is much more manuverable in Assetto Corsa and even sounds awesome with the turbo spooling up and down. If you buy it you wont regret it.			"

The GUI on this is just awesome and I can't wait for the multiplayer and for more cars to be released. I am really looking forward for this, by far the best racing game on PC whatsoever.-Fatal1ty.

well, before you read this review, let me ask you a question: Assetto Corsa or rFactor 2? i say Assetto Corsa, here's why:Pros:-Very active devs-Mods-Great graphics (not best tho.)-Pretty good cars that come with the game-The Dream Packs and the Japanese Car Pack just add to the fun, notably Dream Pack 1, which adds the Nurburgring.-Mods.-Incredibly fun with a wheel, but it can be fun with a controller too, since its actually well optimized [at least i think it is.]-Did i mention mods enough? yes? alright. because i can't stress enough how much you need to get mods if you buy the game, the vast majority of them adds to the experience so much.-Runs smoothly on my current setup (GT 730 with a 2.40GHz CPU, 32-bit OS. able to run almost max graphic settings w/o PP)Neutral (consider these pros or cons for yourself)-May get boring quick you if you just do hotlaps. there are challenges though-Sound quality on some of the stock cars sound par despite them sounding like they do in real life.Cons:-Dead multiplayer to a degree.-AI that leaves much to be desired (e.g pass in front of a car. the AI hits the brakes full-on, not always though),-the price for this and all the DLC is $81 (plus tax), and rising somewhat slowly, so buy 'em now before it gets way too expensive-Career that has lots of potential for improvement, but ignored.\Notes:-DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH A KEYBOARD! it's terrible. don't.-I recommend using a steering wheel. you will not regret it,			"

So still can't say much about some parts of the game.One of the best things about this game is that it loads up extremely fast on even my older computer, I'm astounded by how well it's been coded, compared to other games which take an age and aren't graphically comparable at all.

												I love the level of detail in this game. The LaFerrari for example has a drainable battery. drive too long without braking and the battery will be drained. When this happens the engine becomes much less powerful and less responsive with less instantaneous torque. If you brake too hard and lock up the tires too much you can feel the flat spot with force feedback if you have a wheel. This game is great. the tracks and cars all feel great. The Nurburgring especially feels great. the high definition laser scanning really makes the track feel awesome. it's insane how bumpy the track is. it really adds to the thrill of racing there.  "

												So i tested another car game.PROS.First of all, i have a gamepad (no room for a wheel, no room for a F1 seat, no room for pedals, no room for 3 screens).After 2 hours of configuration and testing, it is playable for powerfull RWD with stability controls at 80% and very tuned gamepad stuff. Playable means you can exit turns in full counter steering, metal to the pedal.Amazing, this is the first game i achieve that on gamepad. Very good, a must have.PC Graphic engine is fine, run fast, do the job.Sounds are ok and do the job too.GUI is ok too, you can customize some stuff, good.Configurations are ok.Well done indeed.BALANCEDAfter that, the game is DLC land (cars and tracks). Ok, acceptable, i was aware.The front train grip seems to be poor and understeer a lot (i am not sure you can avoid understeering even with car tuning)CONSAnd, as usual, we finish by the ultimate failure at this stage (after half a day of testing).The multiplayer.Ok servers seems to have Minorating (good good)But the game online server screen is totally broken.As said, i play game pad, stability control at 80% (otherwise i cannot play with pleasure and will blast other people doing donuts).So how do you select servers with stability control ON ? By connecting to the server....How can you fail so easily after making 95% of the work fine?Ok may be there is tools / mods to achieve this somewhere, but guys, are you really serious?  You can filter compatible DLC but not assists?I should find a league, but i assume i will only found integrists playing wheels in a F1 cockpit + 12 pedals with assists OFF for everything (so i can't play)...Whatever i recommand, it's playable on gamepad.

Best sim out there in regards of many things. Few bugs that are not game braking, loooots of good things.Enjoy :)			"

												There is not much to add to all what is written here about the game.Very nice hotlap-simulator and pretty good online racing.Not a real ""game""-mode with a real career and so on, but there are challenges to do (some outdated). If you don't buy this game for AI racing i highly recommend it. If you want AI racing it's still nice, but there are better options.Can be expensive with all the dlc, but they are fairly priced imho and you can wait for a sale.			"

												Great racing sim. Even better is the game is constantly being developed further. (new cars, tracks, optimising the vehicle dynamics and etc) Thanks for the good work developers. Tip for new comers to tame oversteering cars, make the front more reactive and rear more stable by: 1) reduce the rear tyre pressures and increase the fronts by a couple of psi. 2) Increase the toe angles for both rear and front (go towards positive). 3) In case the car has dampers, springs and anti roll bar settings increase the fronts and reduce the backs.

												I cannot recommend this game any more.- dev releases a horrible modding API with bugs- refuses to support it and doesn't even correct HUGE errors in their awful 'documentation' Some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ typo'd google docs thing that's not going to be updated, ever.- they let some audio guy respond to my damn programming question?- sound isn't that good on the Ferrari 312T, you can audibly hear the engine change pitch at 20 Hz updates or something.- obnoxious car selection UI designed to increase conversion rates get you to buy stuffI don't see a reason to buy any more of their god damn software. I regret that someone bought this for me.0/10, this is one of the worst devs I've ever interacted with.No joke.Buy Factorio (20 euro, 350 MB) and go play that while your Assetto Corsa or rFactor, if that's any better? torrent downloads, those guys actually deserve money.

												I love the level of detail in this game. The LaFerrari for example has a drainable battery. drive too long without braking and the battery will be drained. When this happens the engine becomes much less powerful and less responsive with less instantaneous torque. If you brake too hard and lock up the tires too much you can feel the flat spot with force feedback if you have a wheel. This game is great. the tracks and cars all feel great. The Nurburgring especially feels great. the high definition laser scanning really makes the track feel awesome. it's insane how bumpy the track is. it really adds to the thrill of racing there.  "

												This game made great improvements from the release,Kunos team literally took care of Assetto Corsa untill today,and they are keeping it updated with new contents,fixes and various improvements.About the game: yeah it is the best simulator that i ever played,tracks based on real lenght,cars have an optimal physics and the graphics it's pretty good. If you have a good steering wheel (that's a ""must have"" for a game like that in my opinion) you can feel a perfect sim racing/driving experience without any problems. The game also allows free mods,like tracks,cars,sweetfx and stuff like these.That's so.Enjoy your ride			"

												This game is difficult for me. I never was a fan of racing sims, I play with a controller and I can keep the car on road but it is still really difficult to abide all the rules and actually finish the race. I recommend it to people who like sims but for me it just slightly difficult. And I realised soon enough that this is not a game I'd like to play when I get time, So I got a refund. Go Ahead and try it. The Car handling, graphics and audio are really good. A Good ""Racing Sim"" not meant for casual players like me. The 1.3 Hours I played were frustrating and maybe a little bit fun.I got the game+Dream packs because I was really thinking that this game is a good game for me and I might end up playing it more than other games but that didn't turned out to be true. Get the porsche packs too, Just too many awesome cars in it and World's best racing tracks. :(			"

												Thought it time to write this.One of the best sims out there (yes, it is a sim). Some may criticize that fact that Assetto Corsa is a fully paid game and has still been in development, but to me that is a good thing to have in a game. It allows well-educated and thought through opinions to be shared amongst a larger community, rather than have a length of secret development and a short Beta that gives no full look at issues. Meaning that there is no shock-horror when a game is released swiming in glitches and bugs up to it's eye lids. I love how open the developers are about changes they make, and when updates and patches are set to be released. It helps.Great visuals with good performance (fps, etc) even on my semi-gaming machine that struggles with most new gaming titles. Physics are always going to be debated, but I don't race all kinds of cars in real life to have that knowledge of true car physics. For me the FFB and handling works and feels perfect on my CSWv2 wheel.Mods! Although mods aren't really a review of this game, the ablity to add mods has made Assetto Corsa even more fun to race in as the original list of tracks and cars does leave something to be desired.Downsides are that the online can feel a little hollow without any goal to work towards e.g. rank / license (good that there are so many private servers and events). Also, the fact that the game is so popular on Steam can attract some frustratingly incompetent drivers and some deliberately annoying..uh..people ('let's use that word, yeah'). I guess that's all part of the package in any online game you get.All in all, the most open and available sim out there that you can buy. "

								This game has amazing force feedback and physics working in tandem.  If you have a force feedback capable wheel I highly recommend this game.  It is an early access title at the time of this review (03/2014) so do not expect a full product yet.  What is available is worth trying and provides some amazing challenges if you like simulation racing.  During my first play through I initially thought I'd have to check back on this game.  It just lacked the polish I expected.  I very quickly found myself immersed in driving realism that puts popular console simulation racers to shame.  Next thing I knew I had spent an hour just doing test laps and experiencing what the engine had to officer.One thing of note is that the AI is a bit iffy at this time.  I read that they do not get into accidents or collide with each other unless they're close to the player.  This makes things a little unfair if you fall behind the pack because you're likely to stay in last.  When you're in the pack the AI cycles between brutal cut throat driving and wonky over corrections that can cause hilarious outcomes.  After the first crazy crashes it can also be very frustrating.  It is a challenge in and of itself to keep from being the target of an AI pit manuver.  Even with the quirks of an early access game this is still totally worth the money.  I can very easily see this game as being THE PC racing sim for the forseable future once the game is completed.  As I understand it there are updates every couple weeks so there is a lot to look forward to between now and full release.  At this point I can't get enough of this game and play it every chance I get.I had to work a bit to get my graphics to look ""nextgen"".  Once I did the game looks great.

								I have never played a Racing Sim before, at least none of the hardcore ones.  I already thought games like F1 2012 and the Dirt games were hard already. GT always looked boring thus why i never tried it.  However, Car games in general interested me to some point.I found Assetto Corsa one day.  Played it for a few hours and absolutely fell in love with it.  I knew I had to wait for a few more updates before buying it.  The wait was worth it.  When 0.6.2 released, i bought the game to support the developers.Assetto Corsa is an incredible SIM, with great mechanics, graphics and gameplay.  The menu is a pc gamers heaven.  I am waiting anxiously for the next updates and for it to hit MP.  However, I am absolutely glad i bought the game to support it because its potential is infinite.  Its already better than any other racing game ive played and i know a lot of people agree with this sentiment.  Kudos to Kunos for creating this marvel.  Lets hope they continue hard at work with it.  Good luck, and if in doubt, trust me.  It is an investment worth making.			"

								If you are looking to experience the finest in European GT, supercar, and tuner car performance, look no further than Assetto Corsa. Though still in beta, the comparability of accurately modelled autos and laser scanned tracks endlessly rewards the driver. I haven't played a sim until this one where the single player mode was as intense as the MP. The reward is the driving experience, not graphics or gimmicky features like massive careers, money, or upgrades. YOU control the only upgrade the game has to offer: your developing skill as a race driver. If you've enjoyed watching the European series like Blancpain, WEC, etc. this game will not disappoint.

												If you're looking for a racing simulator that offers a ""true to real life experience"" - look no further. Assetto Corsa offers top notch car handling and force feedback - truly the best one out there yet!The selection of cars is wide and won't dissappoint, although there is a clear focus on Italian brands.. I wonder why (Kunos Simulazioni - Italian developers) :DAs for the racing tracks, fear not; all the classics are available - Nürnbergring Nordschleife, SPA and so forth..Aesthetically speaking, the car models are stunning and the audio mindblowing!A HUGE variety of cameras ensures diversity and possibilities for every player out there.The sole drawback I can come to think of is the visual damage model.Don't misunderstand me - there is everything from tyre wear to component damage in Assetto Corsa.Coming from Racedriver: GRID - almost anything is disappointing, but adding a more realisticvisual damage model in this simulator would truly add up to the immersion and experienceinstead of just having a broken windshield after a 200 km/h crash..Pairing this simulator up with the Logitech G27 is a dream - 10/10 - I highly recommend!

								Written after RC 1.0.0Kudos to Kunos > This is the best racing sim I have ever played and I'm into this genre since MGPRS2. Amazing physics, tracks, graphics, playability (playing with an x1 controller), simply outclasses every other wannabe-sim, GJ guys, I would gladly pay the double for such a gem !I cant even describe how I feel about the game. You cant ""feel"" it from the screenshots or the videos. You have to play it by yourself to understand what rarity this game is. If you are into racing and like simulations, this is the best one to get, there's no doubt about it.What I love most about the game is to drive competitive on RSR, which is a mod for this game and is just ideal for hotlaping. The car handling is very rewarding and there is a thin line between ideal breaking and pushing and locking your brakes or slowing down too early and loosing a TON of time. I actually never played a more rewarding game then this one, the Delta function lets you know how fast you currently are compared to your best time and there is always room for improvement. To really master a corner (yea, believe me there's much more to it to be able to say that you've mastered a course :D ) it takes a lot of practice and every car acts differently.That's the other thing, the cars. Believe me, THIS game doesn't need 100+ cars. Every car feels different and you can really tell the difference between an F40 and any other car (of course with all the assists off). Some of the memorable experiences driving the cars in this game definitely include the F40, 458 GT2, Lotus 98T, La Ferrari, Mercedes SLS AMG, Pagani Huayra, KTM Xbow R and many more.The tracks, they are laser-scanned, what else is there to say? There's not much you could do any better, since they are like 1:1 copies to real life. Bumps and every uneven part, its there ... If you add the superb physics of this game (track conditions, tyres, tyre wear and temperature) you get the closest 1:1 experience currently available.Many moan about the graphics. I'm not much into this discussion because I still think that this game has way better graphics then pCars (in pCarsthe cars are just too shiny and the model is made brighter on purpose just to be ""shiny"", just have a close look in comparisons).My favorite comparison, you'd be the judge, just look at the corner drive through at 1mins03secs and watch the lightning and reflections:


YouTube™ Video: Project CARS vs Assetto Corsa 1.0 - Mercedes SLS AMG GT3 @ Spa-Francorchamps 

			Views: 174,373		

			Comparativa de gráficos y sonido entre Assetto Corsa 1.0 RC y Project CARS. Es una vuelta al atardecer en el circuito de Spa-Francorchamps con el Mercedes SLS AMG GT3 en ambos.		

After 1.0.0 a lot changed and its really an eyecandy now, ofc. with the correct filter and on full graphics. I play it in 2K with DSR on and I can tell you I could do screenshots of this game till I'd run out of HDD space ...I'm giving this game 10/10 cause its the best in its class (simulation) and I haven't found another game which would give me such a feeling from driving a car. I'm simply amazed :)			"

								Damn right i recommend this game ! Besides waiting several years not only for Assetto corsa but for me what has been a lull of several years in advancement with racing technology. Finally Kunos has delivered. And the package whilst not quite complete Screams importance to the racing simulation community in more ways than you can imagine,""Have you head that Pagani Zonda?"". A trully tremendous attention to detail in what has become a niche genre. Never the less the streamlined approach and delivery of the simulation is most certainly open to the more casual of player too. Quite remarkable and Thanks Kunos.			"

								This game is awesome! I had serious doubts about the physics. Having recently tried Raceroom Racing Experience (and seriously disliked the physics), I had little faith in Assetto Corsa, but decided to try it anyways due to the good reviews. All I can say is WOW. The physics are nearly spot on! I have played Live for Speed for a long time, and have revered it as the best game in term of physics. This game is a close second for me currently, and before long, it will probably overtake LFS in terms of physics. In the graphics department, it has already surpassed, as well as in the car selection. The little details make me happy as well, such as changing gear ratios. Instead of being able to pick any number for the ratio, you can only use realistic ratios that would exist on a real car. Pretty neat. Definately worth the money I paid, especially when we will have content releases up until 2018!			"

								Now because Assetto Corsa isn't a fully finished product, I won't be too critical about any problems it has... But I think it's good to mention what the developers have done well... So;Let's start with the sounds, and oh boy they're great! So great that you just want to keep turning the volume up on your speakers until they hit 11! I really like the work they've done with it. The graphics are also very good, it's really nice to see the refulections of your dashboard on the Windscreen which obscures your visability (just like in real life). As well as that, the physics are very good, much better than a lot of SimRacers out there!I think the Multiplayer will become something really great, even if it is a tiny bit unreliable and hard to navigate currently in Beta Form. I also look forward to the larger variety of cars that the developers have planned! This was money well spent!			"

								Being a huge racing sim lover and seeing this on steam i was like OMG! .... Comming from playing games mostly developed by SimBin i didnt know what to expect from this title with Kunos Simulazioni being a pretty small dev team but damn! This simulator /game is insane, Amazing graphics(if your system can handle the game at max settings) Laser scanned tracks, The car sounds are like ear porn & the car handling is just fantastic.There is also three different settings of driving realism to cater for everybody, From novice right through to pro settings.Im playing with a Logitech Driving Force GT wheel, Its really responsive, The force feed back feels as good as anything ive ever played.There aint alot of cars and tracks too choose from ATM but theres definitely enough too keep you intested and the game is being updated regularly.If your looking for a good driving simulator then this is for you!

												I'd be happy paying a max of 25-30 dollars for this game but no where near what I paid for it.Pros: -fast load times make it easier to quit the game-An idea to bring a ""simulation"" racer to the PCCons: -Limited cars, can't believe it's been out this long and theres only that many to choose from-Sound effects are great on some cars and absolutly terrible on others-Every windscreen in the game is dirty apparently, funny this because it's based on tarmac, they're all dirty, so enjoy when you're driving towards the sun, over done linear glare that makes it impossible to see anything, this is NOT a simulation feature, this is just poor practice-Lousy textures on scenary, seriously terrible-Game play feels far to linearIt just doesn't feel exciting enough, it feels so boring (Is it lacking atmosphere?) and I'm basing this off the price I paid for it which was $75AUD I think perhaps if they stick with this and knuckle down it'll be a decent game in a couple years time, however by then we'll have alot more out hopefully, so I'd probably skip on this if you enjoy the forza series and GT series. It's nothing like them, it feels less than one quater of what those games offer.			"

												I can't play any other racing game after this one. Problem is car handling feels dull and boring. So i assume this is the best car game i played so far.Some other stuff: there are not many tracks and garage could be a little bigger, but current amount of cars is enough. You can install track or car mods though. Devs also update the game with new cars and tracks(for free and as DLC)There are lot's of settings for a car or game itself. I'm sure you can configure it as you want.Graphics ain't something special, but it gets the job done. There are also ways to configure post process filters so you can make colors brighter, add some contrast, saturation, etc. I did that and game looks like an eyecandy for me.Multiplayer lacks custom lobby host -> you always gotta find a server to play with your friend.Well... What can i say? A good racing game that pretends to be simulator. I never played sim racing games so i can't tell you if it's realistic enough or not, but it's definetely more challanging than Grid, Crew, TDU, any NFS game.So as long as Project Cars never coming out and being delayed every month... Better get this game, because you can actually get it and play.			"

Posted: February 13, 2015
												Update November 2015:=======================As of the newest version 1.34 the game still has the most annoying flaws I mentioned in my original review. These are jaggy shadows, really bad anti aliasing, moiré effects on the guard-rails, flickering polygon edges, only basic skin variations for some cars and so on. So I still can't recommend the game until you can grap it for 10 bucks.Original Review:=======================Missing content that is normally standard for a racing game, incomplete features, bugs and texture as well as shadow flickering are the reasons why prolonged fun is difficult to come by in this game and why I can't recommend it as of now (v1.04). By my mind this game is as of v1.04 in in a beta state and should not have been released like this.In Detail:I expect from a racing game that advertises fully featured single player modes at least one thing and that is that I will be able to race against AI opponents with a field of at least 20 cars that are of the same racing league and where every single car has its own livery. However, this is as of v1.04 not the case in Assetto Corsa!Further, some of the skins that come with the game are very basic like the ones for the RUF Porsche or the Fiat 500 Abarth. They do not have any numbers on them or stickers, nothing, just plain single- or bi- colored paintjobs. Makes it difficult to drive in a pack of say 20 and differentiate who is who without turning on hovering driver names over the cars.Besides those missing basic features this game has other serious problems with flickering shadows and moiré effects on the guard-rails. Unfortunately no configuration settings so far could fix it and the devs do seem to ignore the issue on the official forums so there is no help for it there either. By the way I am playing on a GTX 970.Other problems are related to performance issues specifically the game displaying a warning about the CPU occupation above 95% but when I check the performance records in the Windows 7 Resource Monitor I can see that my CPU shows just 50% usage. Again no help in the official forums could be found even though several threads for the issue exist.On top of that a lot of small bugs are very annoying like brake bias that sometimes will not adjust when I press the button for it or the game crashing when I try to assign a function to the ^-key on my keyboard and so on.So as of now the fun, even so it sometimes is there when the game works for some time as one would expect, goes away very fast because of the small anoyances that in the sum are just to much to keep it going.

								Only clocked up 12 hrs so far, but I must say I'm really loving this sim. I'm using a Thrustmaster F430, 2 x HD6850 in Crossfire with 3 x monitors and would definitely recommend this or a similar setup as it's just so much more immersive than playing on one screen. There are loads of options for configuring the cars and the controller although not all  the options for the cars are active yet. I've struggled a bit wth the configuration of my wheel (mainly thorough ignorance of what all the different options do) but have now reached a setup that I'm quite happy with. There's a huge difference between the handling of the different cars available and you soon see this as you swap between cars on the same track. Control of the cars with the F430 also gets quite hairy as you accelerate hard or get up to speed of 250kph and above. This is certainly the most fun I've had driving!			"

								I just wanted to leave a little note on my early experience with Assetto Corsa, for all of my racing friends. I am someone who wishes Grant Turismo 6 was on PS4, and hate that I can't play Forza 5 on my 360. When I started looking itno this game, I was very concerned with how Assetto Corsa would perform on my computer. I am running on a barebones rig I built about a year ago. I still have my 560 TI 2gb, i5-2500k, and 8 gb of ram. I am able to run the game very well, with 8x AA + 4x flash AA, motion blur, so on; so forth. Assetto Corsa just feels great. I use a PS4 controller, through a Xinput mapper which translates the controls to that of a 360 controller. If you are looking for a fun driving game, and can't wait for something like Project C.A.R.S., this game is for you. The physics, graphics, and upcoming features will make this purchase worth so much more than the money I had spent. I hope you take my word for it, and look forward to seeing some of you on.			"

								One more lap...One more lap...One more lap...I began my journey in the Fiat 500 to learn the tracks, how to -really- control my G27 wheelset, and push my new gaming rig to it's limit on this new racing simulator. The sounds, control, and looks of the game had me captivated within my first session. After several laps, I needed to get myself out of the Fiat and onto something faster and harder to tame. I jumped into the next available gas guzzler and quickly noticed how difficult driving a rear-wheel drive car was, when you're under pressure by time. So, I decided to switch into drift mode and start purposely penduluming my car to get the feel of my wheel and the sensation of the weight of the car shifting side to side, in hopes that it would help me handle corners better. After several sessions/hours of playing this way, I noticed how superb AC's physics were meanwhile considerably improving my skill in drifting!While Assetto Corsa is in it's early stage of development, it certainly begins to feel like it's triumphing over other sims and definitely, the simcades. Despite there not being any AI at this time (except in drag mode), I didn't feel bored or unchallenged in any of the game modes or special races. It's a race against yourself right now and AC has a spell on you to consistantly push yourself lap after lap in hopes of cutting down your time by another tenth of a second. This simulator is by far one of the best in my lifetime.My only gripe with the game right now is the sensation of speed on some tracks, as I lock up my brakes not realizing how fast I'm going into a turn. Also, how easy it is to lose traction on grass under 40km/h, not accelerating, driving into a forever feeling spinout (feels like you're on ice at times). This could be my skill right now that's also a large factor (considering that I end-up in the grass at times!).			"

												I bought this yesterday after many months of wondering if it would be any good after some of the other car racing games I have purchase. Well I havent been disappointed at all. This is the best car simullation game I have ever tried. Worth every penny. I have massive grin after I have played and dont realsie how quick the time goes. Highly recommend. Just buy it and drive it. :-)Dream Pack - In a word a massive wow. Its absolutely fantastic and well worth the money. This sim continues to grow and get better all the time. If you havent bought it I really do recomend it and dont forget to buy a steering wheel as this really makes the experience even better. Thanks to the Assetto corsa team.

												I've been waiting for a decent simulator for PC since I had my first computer.After so many years, the simulator I've been waiting for is here.And guess what?! Just yesterday they announced a ton of Lamborghini cars for 2015... I'm a big fan of Lambos.All I can say for now is that this game IS worth the money: the graphics, the lighting, the sound, the cars, the details and the freedom to set up nearly anything in your car before racing, freedom to set up your camera positions and HUD components, everything is amazing.The photo mode is awesome and lets you take unbelievably beautiful screenshots, same for replays.Also, the modding community is huuuuge and active, installing them is unbelievably easy and modders like to gather at the official Assetto Corsa forums.So far, it just needs more official content (more cars, tracks, game modes) because I believe they were trying to achieve the best simulation experience before the official 1.0 release this month, and now they should be focusing on content and some minor more simulation stuff (AWD for an example).The team behind this project is absolutely competent to push it to the top, they keep new stuff coming all the time.Tired of reading? Buy it and play it!			"

												Assetto Corsa is the second PC sim I have tried out, I am no stanger to car racing games with a history of GT and Forza. This sim feels the best for car control and predictability, if you are a fellow sim racer like me, it is well worth the money.One of the best features of the sim is the ability to add mods, or create mods yourself and play them. In the last month and a half I have obtained over 100 additional cars and about 50-75 tracks that were not included in the game, all at zero cost!You are not forced to grind in career mode to buy cars, simply pick a car and a track, and you are ready to rock and roll.Again the cars feel great, the tracks look great, and with a wheel the experience is amazing.

												The selection of cars are very good. One can start learning the basics by racing the career mode. Those stock/street cars really teach weight transition, gradual braking and driving smoothly. Tracks are wonderful. It looks and feels as if I am there. If you thought maybe this too hardcore, not to worry. There are players with xbox controllers out there only 1 second off my pace. For beginners theres quite a few driving aids that really helps. For controller/keyboard users you guys just need time to fine tune the controller set up(Yes for better experience please do get a wheel if one can afford).Things to be sorted out, imo. 1. Real penalties e.g. Drive through, stop&go and grip position drop when offense is committed repeatedly.2. More reaslistic race start instead of arcade style bullcrap(Pls allow us to drop in a gear and room for jump start errors).3. Race Laps.4. Weather.5. Day-night transition.6. Multiplayer.But dont get me wrong. This is still a very good sim.Other than that this game blast! Do not tell me that its too grippy/too easy blah blah.(Especially ice-racers) If you thought that ice-racing has the best physics, you can start by trying this game. Anyway in terms of physics, I have a list of games that owns iracing.-GTR2-Rfactor2-Game Stock Car Extreme-Assetto Corsa-Project Cars			"

												This game, compared to Rfactor 2, iRacing, GSCE and the like, in my opinion, is superior. The sounds are better than all, using Fmod. The graphics are very good, definitely better than the rest, and even comparable to Project Cars, which isnt a sim. The driving and tire physics are well on par and even surpass the rest of the sims, while collisions are sub-par, but will probably get fixed in the future. While AI are slow, they may provide a challenge to novice drivers, and train them to drive more carefuly.Overall, this game is a good 9/10.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Car physics 10/10Tire physics 9.5/10Collision physics 7/10Modding ability 10/10Dev support 10/10			"

								I've always been interested in racing games ever since my first racing wheel with the N64. I never really was compelled to get into simulation racing until I heard about Iracing. But after subscribing to that service and realizing how much you have to pay, I unsubscribed from that simulation service. My racing wheel has been in the closet ever since then. I have heard many positive things about Assetto Corsa, so as soon as I saw that it was available, I bought it. Although it is still in beta, my socks are blown off right now. This game takes the cake over all other racing simulators with regard to the amount of flexibility you can adjust your monitor setup to match reality. In this game, I know for sure I am seeing a 1 to 1 relationship with perspective/FOF/Monitor Angles/Monitor Size/Seating Position/ Head Height/Tilt...... This makes the game, in my opinion, because I don't have to second guess reality.			"

								Bought this game as soon as i acquired myself the Logitech G27.This is not a game for whimps, the AI is ruthless, flooring it like you would do in Gran Turismo and Forza is stupid in most cases.The cars veer of the road and tires squeel constantly as you furiously give full throttle like an imbecile, you just have to think realistic.The modelling, graphics, physics and relentless AI makes this the best driving game i have ever played. The AI profiles does not end up in the same position every single race, they crash, spin out and compete like you the player does!This being an ""indie"" game is completely beyond me, as everything with it screams great, and beats every AAA ""racing sim"" back to the stone age.I would recommend this game if you have some racing wheel and pedals. Do also bear in mind that this game is early access and features in the game will be tweaked, refined or removed\added !			"

								I literally built a simulator in anticipation of the release of this title. With that being said, I am both completely in love with it, and disgusted by it at the same time. Why?When you get the game running the way it should (for a little while at least) It's freaking amazing. I own practically every racing game there is to date, and the handling, physics, and graphics are awe inspiring. Coming from iRacing, it feels far more real. You don't just lose traction randomly. It feels very realistic. You can counter steer, downshift, or drift to recover from a little too much meat in the sandwich coming to a turn, which is awesome, and it feels like it should. I drove patrol cars at high speeds for many years, and I can tell you the induced skid feels genuine. The recovery, depending on the particular car is there too. Bottom line, amazing, outstanding game, and when it gets close to release I am sure it will put a lot of other titles to bed.Now for why I hate it.I run an AMD 8 core 4.2ghz machine, with 16gb of ram, and 2 ATI HD7870's in Crossfire.. Logitech G27, triple Asus 1080p Monitors, and so on.. My system is pretty outstanding. When you load up to play, the video options are sort of useless. There are options you've never seen in any game before, that you won't understand. I still don't. The most common options aren't there. What the problem is, in case you have it, is HDR. Apparently, with the AMD drivers that are currently available, (Including the new Beta drivers I got last night) They simply can't use the in-game HDR. What happens? This absolutely disgusting flickering, not only accross the entire screen, but also on all shaded objects. It took me forever to figure out that it was the HDR doing it. Turning off HDR and turning the faces thing to an even number fixed it for me, but I feel like I am missing a lot by not being able to use those options. With 2 $500 video cards, you'd think you'd be able to beef everything up.. Not in this case. I'm sure they'll fix it eventually, so don't let that issue stop you from picking it up. The gameplay is fantastic, and well worth the money if you are a sim racer. Also, the selection of cars currently available is pretty outstanding as well. Keep in mind, this is a euro based game, though they will offer us a C7 Corvette soon, which is pretty awesome. I give the game a 9 out of 10, and it's not a 10 solely for the reason that it is still in development, and has a lot of bugs. It crashes often for me, sometimes completely locking my system up, but again, I get it. It's in development. It's the price you pay for getting in early. I've done a ton of alpha and beta testing since 1999, so I am used to it, but for someone that is freaked out by that stuff, or gets angry easily, maybe you should wait until the full release. Whether you choose to get it today, or down the road when it's complete, get it. It's awesome. Even with it's bugs, having to reset my PC 12x a day, I still play it, and I still enjoy the hell out of it. It's awesome. Get it.			"

I had a couple of races where my car refused to come out of neutral on the line and the racing line/brake distance indicator doesn't change according to your speed or the capability of your brakes but you expect a lack of polish during early access.Not sure if it's worthy of £30 at this point but I expect once this game is released you'll see that as a great investment.

								Best racing simulation at the moment.I've played and enjoyed throughout the years most of the simulators  available in the market (rfactor, GTR2,  gsc, iracing, race07 series, etc.)  and also the new titles. Truth is, I cannot go back to any of them because they simply feel... lacking. The sense of immersion is incredible (physics-wise), I have never driven anything that feels so close to the real thing (or at the very least that gives me the illusion that I am driving a real sports car). Ever since I started playing Asseto, I can't drive anything else because I feel disconnected. The feel of the road, the sensation when you are beginning to lose traction, the possibility to regain control... it's difficult to explain, but if not perfect (what is?), they have managed to certainly go in the right direction with this title.The graphics, etc are also pretty convincing, but in this area I would say it has more competition (Project cars or RRRE just to name a few. The sounds are correct but at the time of this writing not final, and they just announced that they are going to change them so they are more  accurate and immersive.Of course, bear in mind that this is early access so that means that there are still things missing (proper race weekends, pit stops, polish multiplayer and AI, etc.) Some of these things are important, others not so much, but at the end of the day, having seen what they have managed to do so far, I am convinced that the result will appeal to a lot of people that love simulations and motor sports.

												Got this on Early Access. WOW so glad i did i saw from the start the race sim was going to be AMAZING!!! . This is 1 of the best race sims around. The car detail & sound seems so real , If you use a steering wheel like me the logitech G27 the way the car feels different from car to car. You can do so much with setting up your car before the race from tyres ,tyre pressure all the way up to gears , surpension. The tracks are also very good, If like me you drive from inside the car you have to learn what spot to hit the brakes or ya off spinning BUT all fun learning the tracks & once that is done then how much faster each lap & every corner how fast you can take car to the limit of spinning out. Would say that if you are a driving sim fan then you will not go wrong buying this.... I do love the Zonda car in this & even managed to blow engine up trying to slow down on a sharp corner using brakes & gears let up the brake & the revs was still high for 2nd gear & BANG no more engine :( .Have fun driving & maybe you will see me in a race up against you :) ALL FUN 10/10			"

												Coming from Gran Turismo & FORZA, this is feels so much better in many ways. Here are pros & cons I can think of.PROS: Physics, Force Feedback, Sound, Overal Realism.CONS: No cars...compared to GT & Forza, this feels naked...in terms of number of cars available.I hope the developers will include more cars before they are selling them as DLCAt lease include about 50 cars and then start selling as DLC. Please~ :)			"

												I've owned this game since it's mid-stages during the early access period and I only have good things to say. The game offers everything a true racing simulator needs, it has great physics, a good selection of cars and tracks and an extraordinary amount of customization available, ranging from HUD modifications to modded track and car support. On top of that, devs continue to work on the game after it's release to get rid of bugs, increase performance, improve existing codes and additional content. They also do a great job of keeping their customers informed. If there's one thing I miss and hope to see in the future updates is adjustable weather conditions, other than that - no complaints whatsoever, racing game of the year :)			"

												this is an excellent simulator, cars handle really well. i use the g27 with this with great sucess and have a lot of fun, i really struggled with the controller. the graphics are alright, the rendering of the stock cars is just good enough, when you are looking for racing line late apexes, concerntrating on your trail braking you dont notice the graphics so much. tyre profile is a lovely edition. the online gaming is alright, i dont find that many people to play with.  after 800+hours on forza 5 the online is surely lacking but makes up for it with the physics and handling. the community is great too, loads of user designed tracks and cars to use. and hillclimbs!!!!! my god i love hill climbs, such an underrated element to motorsport.

								When a PC game says simulates, the developers  try to live up to it.This game will take practice, that doesn't mean someone cannot just jump in and feel good. yet once you start this and give your senses time to adjust from the arcade like driving you may have tried before, driving becomes a skill again and a pleasure. No two of your  laps are the same, each car has to be handled differently. Turn your graphics up, and enjoy, immerse yourself.I currently only play with a X360 controller, I am saving for a steering wheel. Why? (I have had steering wheels in the past, enjoyed using them, and yet when my last broke I looked and thought why do I need one nothing out there remotely tries to be real any more) this game may not need it, but deserves one. If the team in Italy made a steering wheel and full chasis and wrap around screens, I would be saving for a while, but I would trust they would deliver as they are doing with this game.If you want quick thrills, feel like your a racing god without effort, haven't driven a real car yet, I suggest you do not let yourself down and go else where.What gets many purring like an engine is in the detail, you may not see it, but believe me it's there. Check out some youtube footage, these cars and curcuits aren't copied and pasted, they are constructed and laser scanned.Just remember this isn't a juggernaut company, trying to please everyone and get your money. It's a team of passionate people, who love cars, love racing, and they have a vision and dare to share. They already have some famous and well respected car makers on board, and more are coming.  They have laser scanned tracks, and have more permissions to do so. Just join and learn with us all, and encourage it to be even better.			"

								If you have a decent gaming rig and a WHEEL this is a great game. Yes, it is in development, still in early stages.Quite playable and seems a lot more realistic than typical arcade type car games.  I would not buy this if all I had was a keyboard, mouse , or stick/xbox controller. You need a wheel set up.  A G27 Logitech is a sensible choice. Works great with TrackIR5 but needs improvement in that area but is serviceable with that device.  Getting controls set up was a bear but not too bad, as I managed to figure it out. Setup guides on the net for various wheel types.  No default (at present) Logitech MoMo pre-setup support but the MoMo does work with it , tested by me with my old Momo.  If you want a decent experience use recommended minimum PC specs.  Looks great, plays good.

								It's still in early access, but what you get so far is a rather good simulation of racing. It has a very realistic physics model, the force feedback systems (if you have a FFB wheel) are amazing, and each car feels massively different, as well as many assists that can be turned off or on depending on how good you are and how much control you want.For race game enthusiasts like myself, it's worth the price easily, especially considering how much content is yet to be released.HOWEVER.There are some things I hope they improve in the future - for example:1. The engine sounds on the cars are nowhere near as good as they could be, or as I would expect from a game as graphically detailed and realistic as this is. Sound effects as a whole sound a decade old, sometimes more depending on the car, and sometimes less as well. Compared to games such as, say, Shift 2 Unleashed which has extremely well made sound effects, it's a bit lackluster - but a small complaint.2. The cars don't seem to be able to simulate physical damage nor stallouts, outside of a full engine blowout by deliberately shifting into a gear that's too low. However, as I understand this should be coming in the future.Other than these, however, so far the game has come across very nicely and is probably the most realistic simulation out there for racing. I highly recommend it.			"

												Well..... if you want the best Racing Sim for the pc just pick it up! The community is great and it is constantly getting biger with more and more mods added. The developers themselves are awesome, they hear what the community wants and do it. Finally, as the game evolves more features are being added making the game even better! However, the only thing a have problems with is the multiplayer. There are not so many servers and most of them are empty or there is a connection problem. I think these issues will be adressed as the multiplayer is a new feature added to the game.			"

												This is simply the best racing game I've every tried. The graphics are excellent, the sound design perfect, the car-feeling and response is realistic. There are many awesome car to ride. It's beautifully optimized, on a 4790k with a 770 GTX it runs about 160 FPS on maximum settings. The game modes are varied, if you don't feel like pursuing the career mode there's both online, time trials, drifting and just practicing, competing against your own laptimes, which is a lot more fun than one should think. Cons are the menus that seem a bit weird, the ""start race""-button that you need to click with a mouse and not some dedicated button, this means that the cursor stays on the screen, unless you move it (well, it does on mine, I have two screens). But nothing that takes away from the fact that this game is great.You need a wheel and pedals so bad that I actually went out and purchased a logitech G27, with the force feedback tearing round the nurnburg-ring it's a white knuckle ride.

												This game has the best driving physics out there. Period. You really need to try it to believe it.I first became interested in this game way back when I saw an in-game video showing a player doing some very aggressive driving with high oversteer / drifting. It all looked so believable and unlike anything that games like Project Cars / Forza / Gran Turismo can deliver.Having bought the game and played almost 100h, I must say, the driving physics is something else. There is a tangible sense of tire grip, weight shift (under braking and in corners) as well as detailed camber and suspension modelling that is felt when cornering and attacking curbs. The most notable difference to games like Project Cars / Gran Turismo is how well the game simulates loss of grip on tarmac (drifting). Somehow they have managed to simulate this very convincingly, which makes it natural for the player to catch mid-corner oversteer. It somehow feels more natural to drive and correct slides (compared to similar realistic games) when driving over the limit or applying too much throttle, all this without being ""arcady"".All cars in the game have a distinctive feel to them (and they keep adding new ones through DLC). As an example, older race cars generally tend to understeer into the corner and you have to enter the corner in such a way that you can apply throttle before the apex and oversteer throughout the corner to be competitive. Epic. Modern cars have clearly better handling and either understeers or oversteers. The great physics of Assetto Corsa is best experienced with older cars and soft suspension.Needless to say, this game should not be played with gamepad/keyboard. I use a Thrustmaster 300RS wheel fitted to a Playseats GT seat.The weak points of the game relates to the career mode (non-existent, although they did add custome championships) and the AI that could and should be better (I don't have a problem with them after the first corner, but they keep braking in weird places and changing driving lines erratically prior to the first corner -> often leading to several restarts).I play mainly the ""Special Events"" included in the game, which revolve around either Racing (5 laps starting last) / Timetrial / Drifting / Drag. Most cars have their own special event, so this way you have to familiarize yourself with all of them. To win a race at Alien difficulty or to achieve Gold in timetrial (in pro mode) really requires skill and a decent car setup. Sometimes when driving flat out with the default setup, you find out that you should still improve 2 sec a lap to be competitive, which means that you need to make major improvements to your setup as well as rethink braking points and where to attack curbs. When you do win, there is a tremendeous sense of achievement and you get one ore more steam achievements.Verdict: The physics in the game is very believable and this game sets a new standard for realistic driving simulators. Howerver, the ""game side"" is seriously lacking and in its current state the game is a bit of a hotlap / short race simulation, which is a shame. I would've really liked to have a career mode in it like Project Cars and the ingredients are ther for a nice BMW Cup or Porsche Cup. But... having driven Assetto Corsa for a while now, there is really no going back to the likes of Project Cars / Gran Turismo (my favourite games before) "

												I'm impressed with the way this sim gives you a sense of the car's limits, making it much easier to manage the car if you brake a little late or accelerate too quickly. It requires you drive well to achieve a decent lap time, but you can feel your way out of sticky situations that other games would have you already giving up to your fate of a meeting with the wall. The force feedback feels great and commuicates tons of info about the car, more so than any other driving sim i've played.All that said, so far at least, I've found another sim ""Raceroom Racing Experience"" has a speed quality that gets my adrenaline pumping a bit more and somehow feels more realistic, while simultaneously lacking some feel for the car compared to AC (both games played without assists on a FF wheel). I may need to keep adjusting on AC to find the sweet spot with the view. So far AC is very nice and superlative in many ways, but not every way.EDIT: At this point, this is the main racing game i play. The overall experience is excellent, especially the feel of the car. I can spend an hour easily just hot lapping the Nordschleife (user mod at that) and love it.			"

												Was previously a downvote for poor VR support. Latest patch adds very good VR support with full game functionality. An excellent driving sim with a great selection of cars, superb physics and plenty of mods available. If you're into driving games/sims, you need this in your library.			"

												The physics on this game are pretty spot on, but not close to real life. Thankfully modding is allowed so you can tweak and fine tune the steering settings even more. Although, lacks in content compared to Forza and GT. (Again you can mod Tracks,Cars,sounds) (Not really the same as having it already) If you have a steering wheel and a gaming PC I recommand this game over Pcars.			"

								I hope the developers see this:So far, i think the game is coming along well, but i feel it still has a while to go before it's ready for the final launch.Here are some things I would like to see changed or improved:I am using a Thrustmaster RGT Force Feedback Clutch wheel. It shakes left and right on straight aways, i would like to see that addressed. I heard someone else had the same problem, but I'm not sure what wheel they had.Being that I am a tight budget gamer, I have not been able to buy an H-Shifter. However, I found a program that lets me use my joystick to associate keys on a keyboard with certain positions. My problem here is that I cannot assign keys to shifter positions. I feel that I should be able to assign any key, button or axis to any control in the game. SimBin's GT Legends was very flexible with assigning controls. I think flexibility is key for racers who have unique setups.I am not sure if this is just my graphics card or not, but I notice a slight delay between when I do something and when the game actually does it. I am using an AMD Radeon HD 5670 card. I plan on upgrading very soon, but I hope that delay will go away at some point. I have also noticed that my wheel seems very sensitive. My wheel turns 270 degrees, but on the tracks with the sharpest turns, I find that I barely use 180 degrees of the 270  I have.Again, I hope the developers see this. I am very optimistic that this game will turn out to be the best racing sim, but as of update 0.4, it is not to my expectations. I hope that it soon will be. Great job so far Kunos Simulation team. I hope you find this helpful.This is now on the discussions page in hope the developers respond to it with some fixes.			"

With this the cars feel alive and ready to bite back at you at any time.With the I've spent hours chasing down the Stig's time on Imola and really got a deeper respect for that man. :)Just wish I had more time to plough into this.

												This is that special game in my library that I usually download first after a clean Steam install, is always on my hard-drive without exception, and is the first thing I reach for most nights after work when I'm coming home to unwind.On the arcade/simulation spectrum, Assetto Corsa is almost exclusively simulation. There are almost no arcade elements, so your enjoyment of this title is likely to depend on what you are looking for specifically. I feel like AC is really best suited to the time trial driver, rather than competitive racer, though competitive racing online or in career mode are options too. Still, I would say that this is best for OCD maniac who is trying to lose 500ms off his or her best time, on a course that's been driven a thousand times with the same car.    The attention to detail in the cars and tracks is extraordinary, as are the physics. Turning the settings to 'Pro' will probably create the most authentic experience that you can get shy of the real thing, especially if you have a force-feedback racing wheel and VR setup (I don't personally but only because I don't want 100 cables strewn across my living room floor). For those who have a setup like that, the only thing you would be missing are the G-forces, but otherwise your mind will make it real in the Matrix. There aren't enough good things to say about this game, and the Devs who make it.			"

								Bought this game as soon as i acquired myself the Logitech G27.This is not a game for whimps, the AI is ruthless, flooring it like you would do in Gran Turismo and Forza is stupid in most cases.The cars veer of the road and tires squeel constantly as you furiously give full throttle like an imbecile, you just have to think realistic.The modelling, graphics, physics and relentless AI makes this the best driving game i have ever played. The AI profiles does not end up in the same position every single race, they crash, spin out and compete like you the player does!This being an ""indie"" game is completely beyond me, as everything with it screams great, and beats every AAA ""racing sim"" back to the stone age.I would recommend this game if you have some racing wheel and pedals. Do also bear in mind that this game is early access and features in the game will be tweaked, refined or removed\added !			"

Early Access Review
								I literally built a simulator in anticipation of the release of this title. With that being said, I am both completely in love with it, and disgusted by it at the same time. Why?When you get the game running the way it should (for a little while at least) It's freaking amazing. I own practically every racing game there is to date, and the handling, physics, and graphics are awe inspiring. Coming from iRacing, it feels far more real. You don't just lose traction randomly. It feels very realistic. You can counter steer, downshift, or drift to recover from a little too much meat in the sandwich coming to a turn, which is awesome, and it feels like it should. I drove patrol cars at high speeds for many years, and I can tell you the induced skid feels genuine. The recovery, depending on the particular car is there too. Bottom line, amazing, outstanding game, and when it gets close to release I am sure it will put a lot of other titles to bed.Now for why I hate it.I run an AMD 8 core 4.2ghz machine, with 16gb of ram, and 2 ATI HD7870's in Crossfire.. Logitech G27, triple Asus 1080p Monitors, and so on.. My system is pretty outstanding. When you load up to play, the video options are sort of useless. There are options you've never seen in any game before, that you won't understand. I still don't. The most common options aren't there. What the problem is, in case you have it, is HDR. Apparently, with the AMD drivers that are currently available, (Including the new Beta drivers I got last night) They simply can't use the in-game HDR. What happens? This absolutely disgusting flickering, not only accross the entire screen, but also on all shaded objects. It took me forever to figure out that it was the HDR doing it. Turning off HDR and turning the faces thing to an even number fixed it for me, but I feel like I am missing a lot by not being able to use those options. With 2 $500 video cards, you'd think you'd be able to beef everything up.. Not in this case. I'm sure they'll fix it eventually, so don't let that issue stop you from picking it up. The gameplay is fantastic, and well worth the money if you are a sim racer. Also, the selection of cars currently available is pretty outstanding as well. Keep in mind, this is a euro based game, though they will offer us a C7 Corvette soon, which is pretty awesome. I give the game a 9 out of 10, and it's not a 10 solely for the reason that it is still in development, and has a lot of bugs. It crashes often for me, sometimes completely locking my system up, but again, I get it. It's in development. It's the price you pay for getting in early. I've done a ton of alpha and beta testing since 1999, so I am used to it, but for someone that is freaked out by that stuff, or gets angry easily, maybe you should wait until the full release. Whether you choose to get it today, or down the road when it's complete, get it. It's awesome. Even with it's bugs, having to reset my PC 12x a day, I still play it, and I still enjoy the hell out of it. It's awesome. Get it.			"

								Really looking forward to the career mode update. The mechanics are all there and it feels ridiculously realistic.There's still some polish required. I had a couple of races where my car refused to come out of neutral on the line and the racing line/brake distance indicator doesn't change according to your speed or the capability of your brakes but you expect a lack of polish during early access.Not sure if it's worthy of £30 at this point but I expect once this game is released you'll see that as a great investment.

								Best racing simulation at the moment.I've played and enjoyed throughout the years most of the simulators  available in the market (rfactor, GTR2,  gsc, iracing, race07 series, etc.)  and also the new titles. Truth is, I cannot go back to any of them because they simply feel... lacking. The sense of immersion is incredible (physics-wise), I have never driven anything that feels so close to the real thing (or at the very least that gives me the illusion that I am driving a real sports car). Ever since I started playing Asseto, I can't drive anything else because I feel disconnected. The feel of the road, the sensation when you are beginning to lose traction, the possibility to regain control... it's difficult to explain, but if not perfect (what is?), they have managed to certainly go in the right direction with this title.The graphics, etc are also pretty convincing, but in this area I would say it has more competition (Project cars or RRRE just to name a few. The sounds are correct but at the time of this writing not final, and they just announced that they are going to change them so they are more  accurate and immersive.Of course, bear in mind that this is early access so that means that there are still things missing (proper race weekends, pit stops, polish multiplayer and AI, etc.) Some of these things are important, others not so much, but at the end of the day, having seen what they have managed to do so far, I am convinced that the result will appeal to a lot of people that love simulations and motor sports.

It's going to be awesome and I'm very happy to be part of the process. I would like to see ""more"" F1, legend, and classic cars in the game. They have a lot of sweet cars, but I'm really hooked on the whole Formula gig. This thing is on sale now, I'm considering buying it for a few friends due to the reduction, but I would pay full price for the game again.

												I'm impressed with the way this sim gives you a sense of the car's limits, making it much easier to manage the car if you brake a little late or accelerate too quickly. It requires you drive well to achieve a decent lap time, but you can feel your way out of sticky situations that other games would have you already giving up to your fate of a meeting with the wall. The force feedback feels great and commuicates tons of info about the car, more so than any other driving sim i've played.All that said, so far at least, I've found another sim ""Raceroom Racing Experience"" has a speed quality that gets my adrenaline pumping a bit more and somehow feels more realistic, while simultaneously lacking some feel for the car compared to AC (both games played without assists on a FF wheel). I may need to keep adjusting on AC to find the sweet spot with the view. So far AC is very nice and superlative in many ways, but not every way.EDIT: At this point, this is the main racing game i play. The overall experience is excellent, especially the feel of the car. I can spend an hour easily just hot lapping the Nordschleife (user mod at that) and love it.			"

								I really should not do this but the first comparision that comes to mind for me is pitting this game against Forza and Gran Turismo. Relative to both games the career mode is sparse, but the upside is the driving physics are far more realistic in this game. Getting your tires off the road is an unforgiving experience (as it should be). You feel the car buck and lose a subtantial amount of speed and control, so cutting courses is not worth it. I wish it had some more tracks, but this is an extremely promising racing game that I would buy again in a heartbeat. If you are not a fan of waiting for kinks to be worked out, I would reccomend you wait a while longer until this game is smoothed out. My main real complaint is the Eurocentric car lineup, I wouldnt mind seeing some American muscle in here.			"

								An early access game as of yet, but development and content seems very speedy. It's quickly shaping up to be one of the best feeling, playing, and looking race sim ever. The physics feel very, very good, lots of input device support and customization, and the game is promised to be very supportive of mods. The UI is awesome, especially in-car/race where you can customize it however you'd like, and do it very simply.Definitely keep an eye on this sim if you choose not to buy into the early access model.

								Asetto Corsa is still in pre-release state, but it's still hours of fun! What really makes this simulator great is the realism that the fantastic physics, force feedback and graphics this game provides. You really get the feel of the laser-scanned tracks driving some fantastic cars. I really can't recommend this game enough. Kunos Studios release new content for it every other friday, which is kind of nice, because it's like christmas every time. Should you buy this game? Yes. I would have bought it twice.			"

												This is simply the best racing game I've every tried. The graphics are excellent, the sound design perfect, the car-feeling and response is realistic. There are many awesome car to ride. It's beautifully optimized, on a 4790k with a 770 GTX it runs about 160 FPS on maximum settings. The game modes are varied, if you don't feel like pursuing the career mode there's both online, time trials, drifting and just practicing, competing against your own laptimes, which is a lot more fun than one should think. Cons are the menus that seem a bit weird, the ""start race""-button that you need to click with a mouse and not some dedicated button, this means that the cursor stays on the screen, unless you move it (well, it does on mine, I have two screens). But nothing that takes away from the fact that this game is great.You need a wheel and pedals so bad that I actually went out and purchased a logitech G27, with the force feedback tearing round the nurnburg-ring it's a white knuckle ride.

								Is it worth it? YES !!!My experience with racinggames: I started with NFS in 1995, play with a wheel since NFS HP 1998 and like both arcade and simulation. My most enjoyed game is DTM3 as it offered the best competitive online challange to me.At this moment the game is still in Early Access and does not include a multiplayersection yet. It however does offer quite a number of well detailed cars and laserprecise tracks. I'm looking forward to what is coming as the game keeps bonding me even when it is only singleplayer at this moment.Assetto Corsa, the good things:- There is a well detailed custom controller setup- You can tweak your car as expected when getting a racingsimulator- The carhandling is very good. Only Richard Burns Rally offered me a better experience.- You can tweak your videodetails as desired between various steps. The game even runs smooth on my tablet on medium/high quality, without AI. My tablet's CPU and GPU are below the minimum specs as described in the steamstore.- You can turn on/off and position heads up display as you want (and probably add more by installing mods)- The game is mod friendly, user created cars and tracks to be expected.- The game offers extreme detailed functioning HUD's.- The game is a good simulator. For people loving arcade games, the assist functions have the potential to make it a great game aswell, but these functions still need working on.Assetto Corsa, the bad things (alphaa fase):- There is a number of 'holes' in some tracks which penalise you by wrecking your car.- New in this alphaa stage are AI cars, but they tend to use 100% of the CPU on a full grid... (I have 24 cores)- There is no damage model (yet).- Damage does not influence carbehavior (yet).- Assist functions for both wheel and keyboard/gamepad don't allow you to drift when desired, also having difficulties with launching cars and the brakinglines are incorrect.- All cars best launch is full throttle in this game, like you don't lose grip... even with launchcontrol turned off.- Some achievements are too easy, some too difficult. Time Attack, start extreme slow means gold achievement, dragracing full throttle launch is win all, drifting goldcoins are doable, but you need to go sideways all the way instead of driving the tracks which is kind of pointless and you can't achieve it by just driving and drifting in the corners, you need to drift on the straights.I give the game for it's current state a 7/10. A multiplayersection, extra content, damagemodels, fixed assist functions and fixed bugs can seartenly raise that number.			"

								I've always been interested in racing games ever since my first racing wheel with the N64. I never really was compelled to get into simulation racing until I heard about Iracing. But after subscribing to that service and realizing how much you have to pay, I unsubscribed from that simulation service. My racing wheel has been in the closet ever since then. I have heard many positive things about Assetto Corsa, so as soon as I saw that it was available, I bought it. Although it is still in beta, my socks are blown off right now. This game takes the cake over all other racing simulators with regard to the amount of flexibility you can adjust your monitor setup to match reality. In this game, I know for sure I am seeing a 1 to 1 relationship with perspective/FOF/Monitor Angles/Monitor Size/Seating Position/ Head Height/Tilt...... This makes the game, in my opinion, because I don't have to second guess reality.			"

								Without doubt, the finest home simulator available to date, and I suspect it will be stay at the top for a good few years.  The closest rivals are lagging behind, and whilst a few have features that Assetto Corsa does not (AI, Multiplayer, Pitstops, Damage...) that's because this is still an Early Access piece of software. Fortnightly updates add a tonne of new features/cars/tracks (although a few too many Lotuses, all of which are basically the same car - a bit like Gran Turismo and the 1300 different types of Skyline), plus small intermediate updates to sort any bugs. The graphics are top notch, the sound is the best simulated sound yet, but it's the handling and physics that blow your mind - it makes iRacing, rFactor, GTR etc feel like they were programmed by a child in a couple of days.It genuinely is amazing. If you like driving realistically, then you won't regret it. And for this price you get the full game AND save money on the RRP. Hurrah!			"

								I hope the developers see this:So far, i think the game is coming along well, but i feel it still has a while to go before it's ready for the final launch.Here are some things I would like to see changed or improved:I am using a Thrustmaster RGT Force Feedback Clutch wheel. It shakes left and right on straight aways, i would like to see that addressed. I heard someone else had the same problem, but I'm not sure what wheel they had.Being that I am a tight budget gamer, I have not been able to buy an H-Shifter. However, I found a program that lets me use my joystick to associate keys on a keyboard with certain positions. My problem here is that I cannot assign keys to shifter positions. I feel that I should be able to assign any key, button or axis to any control in the game. SimBin's GT Legends was very flexible with assigning controls. I think flexibility is key for racers who have unique setups.I am not sure if this is just my graphics card or not, but I notice a slight delay between when I do something and when the game actually does it. I am using an AMD Radeon HD 5670 card. I plan on upgrading very soon, but I hope that delay will go away at some point. I have also noticed that my wheel seems very sensitive. My wheel turns 270 degrees, but on the tracks with the sharpest turns, I find that I barely use 180 degrees of the 270  I have.Again, I hope the developers see this. I am very optimistic that this game will turn out to be the best racing sim, but as of update 0.4, it is not to my expectations. I hope that it soon will be. Great job so far Kunos Simulation team. I hope you find this helpful.This is now on the discussions page in hope the developers respond to it with some fixes.			"

												Was previously a downvote for poor VR support. Latest patch adds very good VR support with full game functionality. An excellent driving sim with a great selection of cars, superb physics and plenty of mods available. If you're into driving games/sims, you need this in your library.			"

												Assetto Corsa is a very fun racing simulator. With the DLC coming in and many patches i think the game is just going to get better and better. You can cuztomoize which cars you want to race and how many cars you want to race so you could put 6 f1 cars racing eachother and like another 5 fiat 500's racing as backmarkers I would reccomend buying this game if your into racing or cars in general.Update: Been a long time since that review and since then the game has got better, many more cars and tracks, great dlc for a good price and major bugs are gone. Going onto console has been a great step as well.			"

												This is easily the best racing simulator I've played. The FFB is awesome, the feel of each car is unique, the sounds are awesome, the graphics are beautiful, and the modding available for the game just tops it off.I own 2 real drift cars, and have drifted both in Australia and in Japan. After the Japanese pack came out I got straight into drifting in Assetto Corsa. This lead me on a path to find some more tracks, and more cars, I've trawled the internet for what seems like days and downloaded everything I can find including many famous tracks in Japan including some of the Ebisu tracks (Minami, Kita, Higashi, and Nishi), Nikko Circuit, Meihan, Bihoku, and many many more.After this I decided to suss out the online community and have found places to do judged virtual drift competitons, plenty of lads to run trains with, and usually a server close enough with a low ping.I can't put the game down now and I'm looking into new steering setups, the current old Fanatec wheel is a bottleneck to the experience.The low price point and consistent updates from Kunos are awesome, the physics in this game have improved a number of times over it's lifetime.I can't fault this game 11/10.

												I play allot of driving simulators of different areas, ETS, ATS, F1 series, Project Cars to name a few. I was unsure about AC and put it of for a long time before buying it eventualy. I was deeply dissapointed....in myself for not buying it sooner. I play with a G27 and 3x 27"" Monitors in Eyefinity and it is absolutely briliant. One of..if not the best and most realistic simulator I have played to date. With this said, I do have to say that buying the game alone is pointless, you have to get all DLC to give you flexibility in car choice so keep that in mind. One more thing is that VW is not in the game which I find disapointing, I know its a racing sim but sometimes the smaller cheaper cars can be more fun than an all out race car. Where is Merc AMG 45, VW Golf GTI, VW Golf R, Opel Corsa, Opel Astra, where are all the hot hatches? Come on AC, give us the hatches and also Aston Martin would be nice. I have all DLC packs and would definately buy more if I can get Aston Martin, and hot hatches. On the other hand...bloody good work on geting Porche. Not many games have them, very nice to see.All in all its a beautiful and fun well designed game, physics are fantastic, sounds are amazing and you have to know what you are doing to go fast without ending up backwards in a cloud of smoke when all assists like ABS and TC is turned off.If you like realistic racing sims then buy it now. If you are a casual racer and want to get better also buy it now, if you just want to have fun...buy it now.			"

												I used to think Need for Speed Shift 1 and 2 were real simulators (I was just a teen at that time)... until I got Assetto Corsa. At the time, this was the first game I purchased on Steam that cost more than €20.This was a really tough game when I first started. But I thought then this game was the most accurate racing simulator I had ever played (some users will argue that's not the case though). So I bought a Logitech G27 so I could stop sucking. And now I do pretty good! I suggest you buy a steering wheel too!I enjoy every second of the game: getting the feel of the different cars and beating my personal records on Nordschleife is what brings me back to Assetto Corsa again and again.On the other hand, the graphics aren't that great compared to Project Cars (which I also own), the AI isn't perfect at all and the selection of cars is not huge. But the DLCs really do make up for it! My favorite DLC is definitely the Japanese Pack.In conclusion: I really do recommend this game for those who want to try out racing simulators!			"

												Ive been simracing for quite a few years untill the F1 & event league i was racing at finally closed. In that time ive came across multiple sims and major mods that had made their impact on the specific sim.The genre evolved with time and became much more bigger and more popular in eSports.AC for me is the perfect base for everyone who wants to get a bit more into racing games.The available Cars & Tracks are making AC a good game to pick up for a car enthusiast, while the in deepth setup possibilities, simulations & physics are making it a full sim.Its also one of the best looking Sims out there while still beeing less performance eating than pCars.The Leagues are still growing since a lot of the big and known leagues are still counting on rF1 or their iRacing series.But i honestly think that AC will become one of the must have Sims for league or eSports SimRacing.

								what a racing simulator.This is why I game on pc.Realism is great,feel everything through my g27 most importantly you can tell when you are losing the back end or understeering through weight and subtle vibration so you can control it.When driving the x-bow I can feel every bump of the track that makes the visible suspension go up and down fantastic.I have done some track days in various cars and a lot of go-karting and this is the nearest I have got to the feeling of reality in a game.I have also got gt5 for ps3,race room pc,all the simbin games in fact,r-factor etc.. none of them are as good as this,can't wait for the whole game to be complete.code seems very good so far,no glitches and consistent frames way above 60fps although my tv wont do any higher.engine sounds are very realistic for example the  f40,458 and x-bow are all I have driven so far but all sound spot on.was watching chris harris driving the f40 on youtube and straight after was driving the game and sounded spot on!!!

												pros: the best road car and the best drift simulation on the market, but it doesn't end with road cars and drift cars (you've got GT, Prototype, Formula etc.), laser scanned tracks, tons of mods and plugins, regular updates, simple user interface, great community, both casual and serious multiplayer (booking possibility), car tuning and much much morecons: audiovisuals could be better, you need real head motion plugin othervise camera is awful, lot of missing details like when playing with gamepad when you press handbrake clutch should automatically be pressed as well, missing clutch button option, but not a big deal since you should play it with steering wheel:) transmission model could be better, low speed physics etc.conclusion: if you want simulation with road cars, or drift, AC is for you, if not, maybe look for iracing, if iracing is too hardcore or you don't have money to pay for licence AC is for you regardless :D if even AC is hardcore for you, go with Forza or Gran Turismo, just don't buy Project CARS that's piece of sh*t :D			"

												I personally find that Assetto Corsa's biggest strength is the broad range of modded content available, offering more content than any single team of developers could provide. This can keep the attention of even add sim racers as there is always something new to try. The base cars included with the game are moreso street/'normal' cars, which at the very least provides refreshing and unique experiences not found in other simulators. However there are also a strong collection of race cars to satisfy racing needs. Great feedback and vehical dynamics make the driving experience very addictive!It is important to note that although this game is very playable with a controller and some practice, it comes to life with a force feedback wheel.

Once you get the controls set up (ps3 controller in my case) and go for a few laps you sort of get the feel for it. Two things that really stood out for me: the sounds sound very nice and the UI is just.. perfect. I can't express how much I love it, so well thought out and easy to use/navigate, unlike a lot of other games. I've always liked racing games, or the idea of them, but AC is the first one that I really enjoy playing!			"

												I'm a huge racing sim fan. I've played every single Simbin game, Live for Speed, rFactor, NFS Shift 1+2, Project Cars beta, etc. As much as I'm hype for the release of Project Cars, Assetto Corsa is far better from my own experience. I have a Logitech G27 setup which I use for every game, and I have to say the realism in Assetto Corsa feels ridiculously nice. It's the closest thing I've felt to real life in any video game. Temperature and tarmac conditions affect the handling of the vehicle, it's not too forgiving if you horribly miss-shift a gear or improperly rev match, the sunlight can mess you up real good, tires wear pretty realistically in the sense that if you use a non-abs car and slam on the brakes, one section of your tires will flatten out and you will feel that in the wheel as youre driving, which will also affect your handling. The only thing this game can use that PCars has, is the collision physics. They're way too forgiving and not so damaging to the vehicles, and it'd be nice to have some good menu music. I HIGHLY recommend this game, and I cannot wait to see what else they're going to release for it. Between PCars and ACorsa, I feel Corsa is the better game, but lets find out when theyre both in their final stages!			"

												I'd like to start off by saying that it is first autosim that i played that much (above 100hrs). I've never played in autosims more than like 10hrs. And this is why I love this game. I think no other game have physics engige like this one does (except i-racing maybe, but it costs a lot more than AC, especially in my region, so I won't compare them). You can feel every moment in driving with this physics and also great feedback for steering wheels. And as much as I love drift I do love this game, cause drifting with physics like, damn, that's just can't be written on the review. You have to feel it yourself. All this torque moment, that push you forward in sideways and tries to turn you around, such a good countersteering part, when steering wheel resists your movements (if you have good feedback settings), and a lot stuff like that. And you have to control it all to do a real good drifting. So, if you like races, drifts and etc., you will probably love it, and spend alot more time with this game than i did. P.S. Apologize for mistakes I've made in this review. I don't know english good enough, and I'm trying to learn it by writing stuff like that.			"

								The perfect car simulator, I have never driven a racing game this good, the sounds, the roads, graphics... can't stop loving the game, the Steering support is more than perfect!, I use my G27 for almost every racing game, and this game is as close as it gets to real life!			"

												Insanely good. It isn't just an perfect simulator, it is actually nice to play. Cars handle perfect, it looks great, it has some famous tracks (which are perfectly rendered), there are a lot of different cars with different color scemes and a hell of a lot of options to cutomize the crap out of this game. Almost anything you can wish for is in there and so far it is the best racing""game"" I have ever seen.The only thing that whould make it perfect is the option to crash realistically. Nothing beats crashing a car in GRID2. The experience of driving on the edge and going over it is the only thing that misses. And let's be honest, crashing is the only thing why you buy a simulator. Because you can crash as many times as you want whithout hurting yourself or paying a lot of money to repair a car.Edit:A year after my review I am a bit disappointed. It is still the best racing game/simulator there is, but the fenomenal steering feel is gone. I think they went a bit to far in simulating a wheel. The wheel communicates a lot, but you can only feel what the front tires are doing. Before it was like you could feel the whole car through the wheel! Now, only the frontwheels. Not bad, but not realistic because I need the feeling of the whole car in my fingers like in real life. It's sterile now, not nice to drive anymore. Still way better than Project Cars or Raceroom though. Disappointing non the less :(Edit2:The team behind Assetto Corsa is fenomenal. They keeped working on it, improved al the flaws, upgraded the tire model and the simulation is now even better than before. A lot of cars, they drive perfect, even more features than before... Perfect! Still by far the best simulator I ever tried.			"

								I was going to wright a really long review about all the reasons this game is worth the coin, but look im not into racing games that much, let alone driving simulations, but in my opinion this game is f-in awesome.I now have to buy a logitech steering wheel and another two monitors because its that good. dont get me wrong its not bad on my 360 cotroller if you change to the settings given on the forum, I like the way that sometimes you have to bring the steering wheel back if you overturn it feels quite realistic even though its on the controller, although it takes a little getting used to.I just hope that these guys finish this game off, as aparently they have tendency to leave things incomplete, but this seriously has the potential to be the best racing game across all platforms, please just make the suspention feel a bit harder as you would'nt see a zonda bouncin down the road like a tractor (slight exageration). I see there is some people that have reviewed the game saying that its terrible and unplayable, but in my opinion these are people that dont have the hardware to run it well or that dont have the patience to get the settings to there personal preference.Oh Look it was a pretty long review anyway haha :)			"

												Assetto Corsa is probably the best racing simulator on the market. It features a wide range of cars including brands such as Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche (yes, many are in DLC packs but they are extremely well priced and are well worth the money) and some great tracks like Spa and the Nurburgring (although still no official Bathurst, but the huge modding community have created it and much much more). The physics are great, and many of the high performance cars can be extremely difficult to tame, but as you drive them more, it is truly satisfying to watch the lap times come down. You'll want a good steering wheel to really get the most out of Assetto Corsa. For anyone interested in racing games, I put Assetto Corsa at the top of the list.			"

								This is such a great game, highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality racing game/simulator. Physics & graphics are great.Game as a whole runs well/smooth.Nice selection of cars (with more on the way).Perfect amount of customization.Handling is good (and challenging).I found, and still do, AC very challenging, but it has a good learning curve. Once you get the controls set up (ps3 controller in my case) and go for a few laps you sort of get the feel for it. Two things that really stood out for me: the sounds sound very nice and the UI is just.. perfect. I can't express how much I love it, so well thought out and easy to use/navigate, unlike a lot of other games. I've always liked racing games, or the idea of them, but AC is the first one that I really enjoy playing!			"

												Wow. The makers of this game have really captured the feel of the cars. Working trhrough the career starting with a little low powered saloon and then moving on you really have to get to grips with the way they handle and feel. I'm a novice driving game user so was glad of all the helping options. I used it with my old thrustmaster wheel and pedals and it worked a treat. I also gave it a  go with the oculus rift. That was interesting but I think I will let that get out of ""beta"" stage before I give it a go again. The graphics are top notch and the sounds of the cars are lovely :) For me this game is a lot more fun and has a lot more depth than the F1 series.			"

After the Japanese pack came out I got straight into drifting in Assetto Corsa.

												Ive been simracing for quite a few years untill the F1 & event league i was racing at finally closed. In that time ive came across multiple sims and major mods that had made their impact on the specific sim.The genre evolved with time and became much more bigger and more popular in eSports.AC for me is the perfect base for everyone who wants to get a bit more into racing games.The available Cars & Tracks are making AC a good game to pick up for a car enthusiast, while the in deepth setup possibilities, simulations & physics are making it a full sim.Its also one of the best looking Sims out there while still beeing less performance eating than pCars.The Leagues are still growing since a lot of the big and known leagues are still counting on rF1 or their iRacing series.But i honestly think that AC will become one of the must have Sims for league or eSports SimRacing.

												I used to think Need for Speed Shift 1 and 2 were real simulators (I was just a teen at that time)... until I got Assetto Corsa. At the time, this was the first game I purchased on Steam that cost more than €20.This was a really tough game when I first started. But I thought then this game was the most accurate racing simulator I had ever played (some users will argue that's not the case though). So I bought a Logitech G27 so I could stop sucking. And now I do pretty good! I suggest you buy a steering wheel too!I enjoy every second of the game: getting the feel of the different cars and beating my personal records on Nordschleife is what brings me back to Assetto Corsa again and again.On the other hand, the graphics aren't that great compared to Project Cars (which I also own), the AI isn't perfect at all and the selection of cars is not huge. But the DLCs really do make up for it! My favorite DLC is definitely the Japanese Pack.In conclusion: I really do recommend this game for those who want to try out racing simulators!			"

												I personally find that Assetto Corsa's biggest strength is the broad range of modded content available, offering more content than any single team of developers could provide. This can keep the attention of even add sim racers as there is always something new to try. The base cars included with the game are moreso street/'normal' cars, which at the very least provides refreshing and unique experiences not found in other simulators. However there are also a strong collection of race cars to satisfy racing needs. Great feedback and vehical dynamics make the driving experience very addictive!It is important to note that although this game is very playable with a controller and some practice, it comes to life with a force feedback wheel.

												pros: the best road car and the best drift simulation on the market, but it doesn't end with road cars and drift cars (you've got GT, Prototype, Formula etc.), laser scanned tracks, tons of mods and plugins, regular updates, simple user interface, great community, both casual and serious multiplayer (booking possibility), car tuning and much much morecons: audiovisuals could be better, you need real head motion plugin othervise camera is awful, lot of missing details like when playing with gamepad when you press handbrake clutch should automatically be pressed as well, missing clutch button option, but not a big deal since you should play it with steering wheel:) transmission model could be better, low speed physics etc.conclusion: if you want simulation with road cars, or drift, AC is for you, if not, maybe look for iracing, if iracing is too hardcore or you don't have money to pay for licence AC is for you regardless :D if even AC is hardcore for you, go with Forza or Gran Turismo, just don't buy Project CARS that's piece of sh*t :D			"

												This is one of those games, where time flies by. It would seem that a few hours ago, sat behind the wheel, but ♥♥♥♥ you! 10 hours! Carl! You're in the chair 10 Hours!!! It's morning, and you never went to bed. Again and again, you're restless, try to beat your time on the Green Hell. Kunos rolled out the next DLC or update? Everything went to hell! And here again a sleepless night for a game...Burn in hell!!! I hate you!!!			"

												Holy guacamole.Nothing quite gives you the excitement, sweaty palms and pounding heart like racing cars from the early 80s with screaming turbos, well over 1000 horsepower, rubbish brakes and ZERO traction control or anti-lock braking, side by side online with other players at WAY over 350km/h, both trying desperately not to crash, yet aggressively pushing as hard as possible to take that checkered flag.Assetto Corsa nails it. World class simulation, if you're a wimp, I'd like to say look elsewhere.But I can't.You can also have a great time cruising with beatifully modelled and simulated modern road vehicles on laser scanned tracks  with your friends.The VR support is incredible. Assetto Corsa is my go-to app to show off what VR can do.Nothing beats it.Buckle up 0.0			"

												My goto racing sim. Feels and looks amazing. It has a ""Career"" but it seems like a shell of something that could be great. It's just event after event with no feeling of accomplishment after beating it.Special events are a lot of fun and offer a huge challenge if you are into beating lap times.Online can get very messy, it would be best to find a league and race with them. Many can be found on Reddit or race department.Hot lapping seems to be the main focus for many people. (Some even call it a hot lap simulator, they really aren't that far off) You can find ""apps"" that add more to hot lapping turning it into a ""rivals"" type hot lap from Forza.Mods Mods Mods... Some are free some are paid. You can find pretty much any track for the game online. Cars are hit and miss, some can be amazingly bad and some can be great. You can find a lot of rips of cars from other games and 99% of them are trash.Updated a few times a year adding free and paid content, and charging great prices for paid content.FFB feels the best out of all the Sims I have played and it supports many wheels and controllers.Controllers like the Xbox one\360 are easily setup and can be tweaked to any driving style. (with different settings that can be found all over steam and the internet)			"

Early Access Review
								I bought Assetto Corsa for $39 at a time, it was three tracks and 5 cars... and I can already say that this is an amazing game. i7 4770k GTX 570 playing everything max but shadow detail low (more than this and it stutters) and no motion blur, reflection medium. I play 1920x1080.  You made it this far:_I play a pad steelseries 3GC, I had to install a xbox 360 emulator controller to refine the custom mapping and steering, very tedious, but rewarding. My settings are Gamma + 1.2, steering speed 0.05. You can play with those settings on the pad, anything too far, and it makes the car unstable on the straight or impossible to turn in corners. Best car to to get a ""feel"" for the control is the E30 of course. Please get a wheel, fanatec, G27, anything. To make a review with no racing wheel but a gamepad is really stupid. Guess What, I am really stupid (or really broke)._the graphics are decent (computer wise) and will definitely show you what xbone / PS4 will be able to do next year or so once the dev will master the SDKs, however, sometimes the aliasing seems, really, forced? what is the word, weird. Not correct.  Textures in high are really sharp, I like it. However, nothing groundbreaking. Overall, decent (maybe my card is not good enough? I don't really care, I bought the game for the feel not the look).However, I tried at 720p resolution with motion blur (low) and shadow high, and the game gets a very very different feel. It feels right. It feels ""next gen"". Whatever this expression means. A little motion blur changes a lot of the feel! My bet is that by the time the multiplayer will kick in, I will have to even lower the shadow and reflection. Arg!the very bad:_you have to be patient to get more content, after the nov release, a lot more tracks and car got release, it is very encouraging. Still no multiplayerNow for the good part:_ Remember when you first played Rfactor, and you were like, wait, wait, wait, Forza, GT 3 / 4 / 5, all of this is a lie!!! Well, you can tell that Assetto Corsa forte is the grip / tire setup. My god, it feels, right, it feels correct, it feels subtle. It feels a good solid notch higher than Rfactor. So far, I only driven the Lotus Elise, and the old BMW M3 E30, and a little bit of KTM. The feel of the grip is the most subtle of all racing game I played, you will be rewarded very generously after a few lap, you will be able to feel the tire like nowhere else. When you pass the point of friction on apex, force feedback is really good, it is as close as what a traditional simulator can be. Nothing can come close to AC concerning tires. 300 HOURS LATER. Well. Words can't do it justice. I need a wheel. _suspension feel / setup. No words can accurately tell how I feel about it, you got to tinker with it to believe it. Weight transfer during braking is hilariously good. It took us this long to get it this right?_car model, drive inside view, drive outside view, replay, it is gorgeous. Feel the leather, feel the double stitches, look at what the dev is trying to tell you. I don't mind not having 100 cars. 30 cars at this level? Hell yeah! So far content is still very poor. _the sound. I play with a 2.1 setup behind a sony receiver and ESS series speakers. hmm. Is it really that hard to model this sort of sound coming out of cars? It is just beautiful, drive the Pagani, you will have some sort of epiphany once you will hear the tires. If the wife is looking at you silly, Grado Sr-80 behind a DAC will do. Shame on you (yes I am pointing at you Gran Turismo). What I want:_Laguna Seca Mazda speed raceway? Nurbuuuuuuuubuuuuubuuuuuurgriiiiiiiiing?_Cobra, daytona and Corvette? _Toyota Camry / Nissan Sentra, just for the fun of it, to trully appreciate the Japanese engineering and what they represent in a daily driver context (and yeah, I will drive them like I stole them), give me something that I can relate to, an accord, a civic, anything!In conclusion Assetto Corsa is a game that needs some love, from the small community to the media (believe it or not, autoblog / jalopnik did not cover this game yet, while covering the release of the xbone and the ps4 to no end that tells you of their cluelessness). Assetto Corsa is a deep game, it is Rfactor on steroíd. The modeling of the car is a work of art. Assetto Corsa reminds me of the feels when I was a kid the first time I played GT Legend, 95% of the game feels right. At some point, the mod will come out of the closet, some DLC will get released and AC will be full bodied. From now, they got my $40 bucks and I have to say that this game exceeded my expectations.From the CPU utilization, I would say that a decent setup to play with would be haswell core i5 and a minimum of a GTX 650ti to have fun with it.What else? Oh yeah, get a wheel, G27, anything, I am not doing it justice I feel so stupid for not playing this game with a wheel right now.Well, this was my first review of a game on steam, that tells you something right?Long live, AC, it deserves more credits for what the dev achieved. Forza and GT player will love this game, anyone can get their guilty pleasure getting the curve right with the E30 and or lotus elise, it is not about going fast, it is about getting it right. Asseto Corsa has achieved a lot of right, grip, modelling, sound and now the drift track allows you to have cheap fun.If you want to peek at what next generation racing sim can do, you got to pass this door. Rfactor 2, Project Car, so much excitement for 2014.Conclusion:4770K is somewhat overkillGTX570 can play max settings AA filter everything at 1920x1080, but you got to remove shadow (low) and motion blur (zero). You can keep reflection to medium. Sometimes it stutters still, I would say it is acceptable, I get 60FPSGrip feel and friction loss point at apex feels, really super good. My favorite car is the lotus elise SC, because of its relatively low power (I am a terrible driver) I run the Magione Track in 1:27:960 (And I am sure I can shave another 2 seconds on this one) to give you an idea. To setup your controler get the lower power car possible and play with gamma (+1.2) and steering speed (+.05) as a base an play with all three filter gama and steering speed before going to the garage and play with the setup. Google xbox 360 controller emulator if you need assistance in the remapping of your gamepad. Make sure that you are running your pad in analog mod so you have two axis to play with, one for steering, one for throttle, braking.Turn off all car assistance and listen to your car!Have fun!It has now been 400+ hours I have been playing the game: no other car game will bring you these sort of emotions playing a virtual car, play it, you ought it to yourself.

								So much attention to detail. I was a little dissapointed I could not open the glove compartments in the car. It felt that real. Best forcefeedback feeling in any game. I am an iRacing fanatic, and have no problem admitting this. The physics are the best since Live for Speed in terms of actually being able to feel the car and not having it randomly go uncontrollable. Hopefully there are driver swaps when the MP comes. Haters, you should probably note this game cannot be run on a microwave oven.			"

								I've been doing the race thing for some time now and can say very frankly that Assetto Corsa wil be THE Premere racing sim out there.

Having said that, I believe that we gamers owe it to them and the racing community to do our best to suggest improvements where it really matters. One thing that comes to mind is the whole concept of racing and that has to do with ""Passion"", the love of it. So if we want Assetto Corsa to be the best then we must do our part and race with the same passion, like proper respect and just have fun. This game is awesome and more than rivals sims like F1 2013. I think we have the opportunity to be a part of a great company, a ""Band of Racers"", if you will.

								I haven't played that many racing sims before, the only ones I've been playing are GT5, GT6 and this(Assetto Corsa). it might also be good to add that i've been playing this game with a PS3 controller. Anyway, from my experience, this game have a good potential to become a better racing sim. The things I like with this game is the vehicle physics, and the AI. I think the AI is more competitive in this game than in GT, it makes the races more thrilling and fun!The things I don't like with this game yet is the low amount of cars available, but it's still in early access and more cars are coming, so that will change. Another thing that I don't like with this game is that it's a little bit glitchy some times after some updates.. But you have to keep in mind that this game is still in early access.Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do! Well, this game might not be a game for everyone, but if you know you got some petrol in your blood, then this is a game you should buy.			"

								Let me tell you something.Do you know what it's like to be at the helm of a nearly untamable Ferrari and hear the engine roar and pop? I'll wait.Okay, time's up. I'll answer that for you. No. You probably don't know. And I haven't done that in real life, so I guess I don't either, but Assetto Corsa brings you as close to that as possible. For me, the sound is the best part of this game thus far. Every single car sounds different than the last and every one is just as satisfying to hear. From the screech of tires to gravel and especially the unique sound of each engine (and those sounds change depending on your view. Different sounds in the cockpit than an ""over the shoulder"" arcade-style view), every one of those sounds seem incredibly authentic and immersive. First time I got behind the wheel of a Ferrari was exhilarating. First time behind a Formula 1 car was empowering. And so on.Now, my computer is incredibly low-spec. We're talking 2011 MacBook Pro (running Windows via bootcamp) with integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics low. But with a bit of graphics tweaking, I was able to get this game to run at about a cool 30 fps. Which isn't terrible, but it's certainly not the best. It's enough for the casual racer to get a good lap or 60 in. No biggie. So if you have a super crazy maxed out rig, you should be able to get this to run at 60 fps no problemo. In any case, the cars look great.Even though this game is accessible hardware-wise, skill-wise it is certainly not. It does not hold your hand. But don't let that scare you. There are a few cars in here that are slow enough that you can take for a spin and get at least a decent handle on things before trying to tame a supercar. I mean, you could try and go for a few laps in a McLaren but you'll get your butt kicked if you don't know what you're doing. Suffice to say your 6-year-old sister couldn't pick this up on a whim and start beating you like Mario Kart.I don't have a racing wheel (yet), but I managed to get a Dualshock 3 controller from my old PS3 connected and working, and honestly, it's working out much better than I thought it would. Driving simulators with controllers tend to not go well with me since I usually oversteer and give the car waaaay too much throttle. Yay, spinning out! But with a few configuration adjustments, I've been able to take corners smoother than I ever have in any other game. If you don't have a wheel or controller (I'd recommend you pick one up. It makes the game better. And other games too.), there is a nice option where you can steer with your mouse, making much smoother turns than your A and D keys ever could.So, the real question is, should you pick this game up?Weeeeeeell......maybe. Personally, I think you should wait either for it to be on sale for at least 50% off (at the time of this review Assetto Corsa is in early access and it's on sale for half off: $20). Otherwise, a full $40 isn't quite worth it yet. Apparently the full release is going to be a nasty $50 but with steam sales, that'll be alright. There's no career mode yet, and multiplayer isn't for me yet since I'm not good enough, plus it's in alpha right now. Career mode is where I'll be spending the majority of my time when it's available.TL;DR: Buy this game only if it's on sale if you want to know what it's like to sit behind the wheel of a Ferrari and hear its engines roar. Good stuff.			"

But newbies can also jump straight into the track and ""feel"" the realism as they handle fast cars provided in this release.

You can set up the difficulty level from ""drive this car for me oh google bot"" all the way to ""Hurt me plenty for I am Niki Lauda"". The car selection is a bit sparse with mostly Lotus, Ferrari and BMW so hopefully that will change the comming months.TLDR; if you like realistic vroomvroom get this game, even if its in early access "

								Even at the early stage, it is still an excellent game. Just taking any of the cars around track puts a simle on one's face. Don't be mistaken though when purchasing. If you are looking for a realistic challenge, you are right at home, but if you prefer more arcade (Grid 2 style, NFS slide around) kind of racing this might not be good for you. I have been playing on an xbox360 controller and the cars respond very well. I have actually just ordered a Logitech G27, so i will update the review with information about the game than. The updates come out as announced so far on biweekly schedule. If you are hesitating on the purchase, go ahead and get it. If we show support to the developers, they will be able to deliver better product, and it's the early stage where your voice does matter and make a diffference to improve the final product.--------------------------------------------------------Post Wheel Purchase Update: The game is astounding in my opinion. The physics, the feel in the wheel of the weight shifting during corners or braking, it's simply mind blowing. To put it to you this way, I thought I was decent at racing games, but when I plugged in the wheel and set the settings on PRO with no help (aside from using ABS) I realized how much I stil have left to learn. This game will challenege you, it will excite you and when you finally start feeling confident behidn the wheel, chew you out on a corner and spit you out in the grass. Few things to note, there has not been car updates for past few times we had updates, I'm sure they will be coming out soon. The multi works smoothly from experience, although not that many people are online. Lastly, (could be just my computer), but I have significant performance issues when racing around Mugello track. The FPS drops significantly, sometimes getting choppy even. That is the only track it happens on, so I'm guessing after some smoothing out it will be okSo my bottom line, would I purchase the game again, now that I know everything about it, ABSOLUTELY YES			"

												This game is a worthy heir to the dedicated simbin/rfactor community. It plays like a sim and is presented like Forza for the PC.Multiplayer is already implemented and campaign mode is coming. It's not a motorsports game like Race 07 or the codemasters f1 series it's more of a world of cars experience.This one is very rewarding if you have a good steering wheel setup, standard transmission cars will teach you to liftoff when shifting even if you are playing with an automatic clutch while double clutch paddle shifting cars will not need liftoff. The game automatically adjusts settings so that road cars have 900 degrees of wheel rotation but race cars have suitably less.Tracks and cars so far have a heavy italian flavor which is good because it offers some old favorotes like monza and also fresh new circuits. This is the game for Lotus and Ferrari fans. Pagani, Fiat, and Bmw are also well represented.Has a very annoying penalty system which can, thankfully, be disabled.			"

								I have been playing car games on and off for the last 25 years.  I can say, without a doubt, that this is up there with the best of them.  IMHO, you need a wheel and pedals to get the best experience, I have a DFGT that I use with Gran Turismo on the PS3 and it works great with Assetto Corsa.  The only difference being that AC, although it has less cars and tracks, is much more realistic than any of the GT series.  Having done a few track days in real life I can tell you that the feel, and grip level in AC is more more realistic than any of the GT series.   Also the mod community is great, with a lot of talented people who have already built cars and tracks from scratch and made them available for download on the forums.			"

								Been meaning to pick this up for a while now and some of the reviews said the handeling for the cars was not so good...I can only wonder what game they were playing. The feel of the cars is utterly FANTASTIC using a wheel. Granted, I have only drove about an hours worth so far, on Monza and Mugello, two tracks that I know very well from Forza and the handeling is literally spot on. Once this game goes into full release and has all it's content, it is definately going to be the game to measure other racing games against. Game doesn't have Thrustmaster TX in the list of wheel, but supports it just fine.My only complaint is it took me a while to find where to adjust the driver aids, nothing sucks worse than wanting to be in 3rd gear to leave the apex of a turn under full power than when the game suddenly decides to shift to 4th and then back to 3rd halfway out of the turn.  :)If you are at all on the fence about getting the game, I'd urge you to do so during the summer sale, get a good deal and a great game.

								Superb game until the absolute disapointment that is the AI opponents that were released with the latest update. I have never in my whole life seen anyone race in that manner, and find racing against AI in Assetto Corsa a wholly frustrating and severly disapointing experience that I would rather not repeat. I expected far more of the Intelligence and a lot less of the Artificial from Kunos, who apparently have some pedigree in producing some of the better racing sims. It seems from here that they rushed into releasing some content that people were screaming for, and in rushing have completely screwed it up. Other than that, class game.			"

								Assetto Corsa is a racing simulator with huge potential. I cannot wait to see what Kunos does with this game. The physics feel realistic and you can have great fun with a force feedback wheel. Right now you can only do time trials and stuff like that by yourself but even so I have had tons of fun just exploring the tracks and the vehicles. There isn't a huge amount of either right now but more is being added fairly frequently.Good:Graphics are good, not the best, but not at all bad.There is a nice variety of different cars: road cars, track day cars, open-wheelers and racing cars.Impressive and realistic physics, as well as excellent force feedback that's highly customizable.Different types of assists that can be turned on or off, so this game fits both the racing simulator enthusiast and the casual player.A variety of mods available on the forum.Bad:Not a whole lot of content, but it is in Alpha, so that's acceptable. :PMost likely the game is very difficult to play with a keyboard. I haven't tried but I assume it is. You can use a game pad though which is probably a bit easier, but of course, a racing wheel is best.			"

								There are a few ways at looking at a simulation / racing game, is it for instance designed to work with a steering wheel, stick and H shifter off the shelf, how do the cars handle, how lazy is the grip and how realistic is the driving.The short answer is no matter your skill level, you will be both rewarded and punished at the same time in your first couple of drives.This game is still in alpha yet it fails to disappoint even thus far with a lot of content being not available, yet.So after crashing fantastically with all the driving assist aides turned off and learning to tame the beast of the fantastic physics engine, I can hold my hand up and say this is the most challenging sim I've played thus far, Live for speed and console + wheel included... this is harder and somewhat more rewarding.When you clip a kerb the car bounces and your vision simulates in-car circumstances and when you hit the gravel trap a tinkering of gravel exiting the body panels and spoilers of your car reminds you of your mistake along with a dusty and dirty windscreen.Sure I'd like the ability to feather the traction control and ABS interference rather than on / off because at a choice, gun to my head assists off give me much more 'fun' but fustration at the same time since I don't have the option for a tiny little bit of TC for an overpowered car with limited grip, however this is surely to come in the future releases so it's minor gripes to say the least.Laser scanning of the Nordschleife have begun.Buckle up for the most crash tastic or rewarding driving experience you can muster, are you man enough to turn all the assists off ? your patience will tell.

								Review as of 8/11:This game is tons of fun. I've spent a few hours in it now, trying out various things, races, drifting, time trials, and tons and tons of practice laps. You know a game is good when even it's most basic aspect, taking laps around a track in different cars, is a blast. As you get better and slowly add in time trials, then racing, then some trickier manuevers like drifting, this game has great playability and I expect a very long shelf-life. The Graphics as they stand now are lovely, although at times unoptimized (anyone else getting massive FPS drops in the sand?) but even still, with my Dual 660's I'm able to play at 5750x1080 at around 50 FPS, very nice. It's equally as fun to pick up an putz around for 10 minutes as it is to sit in, and really dig into those corners for a multi hour session. I look forward to more cars and tracks in the future, and will update this with my thoughts on Rift support once I get my DK2.9/10 Would Recommend			"

								Let me tell you something.Do you know what it's like to be at the helm of a nearly untamable Ferrari and hear the engine roar and pop? I'll wait.Okay, time's up. I'll answer that for you. No. You probably don't know. And I haven't done that in real life, so I guess I don't either, but Assetto Corsa brings you as close to that as possible. For me, the sound is the best part of this game thus far. Every single car sounds different than the last and every one is just as satisfying to hear. From the screech of tires to gravel and especially the unique sound of each engine (and those sounds change depending on your view. Different sounds in the cockpit than an ""over the shoulder"" arcade-style view), every one of those sounds seem incredibly authentic and immersive. First time I got behind the wheel of a Ferrari was exhilarating. First time behind a Formula 1 car was empowering. And so on.Now, my computer is incredibly low-spec. We're talking 2011 MacBook Pro (running Windows via bootcamp) with integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics low. But with a bit of graphics tweaking, I was able to get this game to run at about a cool 30 fps. Which isn't terrible, but it's certainly not the best. It's enough for the casual racer to get a good lap or 60 in. No biggie. So if you have a super crazy maxed out rig, you should be able to get this to run at 60 fps no problemo. In any case, the cars look great.Even though this game is accessible hardware-wise, skill-wise it is certainly not. It does not hold your hand. But don't let that scare you. There are a few cars in here that are slow enough that you can take for a spin and get at least a decent handle on things before trying to tame a supercar. I mean, you could try and go for a few laps in a McLaren but you'll get your butt kicked if you don't know what you're doing. Suffice to say your 6-year-old sister couldn't pick this up on a whim and start beating you like Mario Kart.I don't have a racing wheel (yet), but I managed to get a Dualshock 3 controller from my old PS3 connected and working, and honestly, it's working out much better than I thought it would. Driving simulators with controllers tend to not go well with me since I usually oversteer and give the car waaaay too much throttle. Yay, spinning out! But with a few configuration adjustments, I've been able to take corners smoother than I ever have in any other game. If you don't have a wheel or controller (I'd recommend you pick one up. It makes the game better. And other games too.), there is a nice option where you can steer with your mouse, making much smoother turns than your A and D keys ever could.So, the real question is, should you pick this game up?Weeeeeeell......maybe. Personally, I think you should wait either for it to be on sale for at least 50% off (at the time of this review Assetto Corsa is in early access and it's on sale for half off: $20). Otherwise, a full $40 isn't quite worth it yet. Apparently the full release is going to be a nasty $50 but with steam sales, that'll be alright. There's no career mode yet, and multiplayer isn't for me yet since I'm not good enough, plus it's in alpha right now. Career mode is where I'll be spending the majority of my time when it's available.TL;DR: Buy this game only if it's on sale if you want to know what it's like to sit behind the wheel of a Ferrari and hear its engines roar. Good stuff.			"

												An incredible driving/racing simulator.  The standard content of Assetto Corsa is decent.  I would highly recommend adding the Dream Packs as well.  In addition, there is an amazing community of modders who produce professional quality tracks and cars that can be downloaded and added to Assetto Corsa, the vast majority are free of charge.  The community is very welcoming (the official support forums) and you'll get help for ANY issue as long as you are polite and respectful.The driving physics of Assetto Corsa are second to none.  Sure, some people will say that's a subjective statement.  Others may say that they prefer another sim's physics.  That's fair, but no one can say that Assetto Corsa's physics aren't great, even if they think another sim is better.  I personally think AC has the best physics in the biz.  To me, physics matter the most.  After all, we're talking about ""simulation"".  I'm looking for the most realistic experience possible behind the wheel of a virtual car.Graphics and sounds are excellent.  Again, thanks to the amazing community of modders, if you aren't 100% happy with the sounds of a particular car, the odds are great that you could download a substitute set of sounds for just about any car.  Heck, you could make your own if you want to learn how to use FMod.  Likewise, you can download or create your own PP Filters which change the graphical properties of the sim.Again, if you're really into realism you must own Assetto Corsa.  If you're more interested in just logging onto public servers and smashing into others all in the name of fun, stick to console titles like Gran Turismo  or Forza.  Of course there are people who take those games seriously, but there are also people who just want to look at fancy cars and go fast.  Assetto Corsa players, like most Sim drivers, are looking for realism and don't mind a steeper learning curve in setting impressive lap times.There is no car modding, like adding turbos and upgraded LSD's or suspensions like in the console games.  There is no grinding for in-game cash/credits so you can purchase more cars and more parts.  You get every single car right out of the box and can download many, many more.  You can ""tune"" the cars, however, to suit your driving style or correct any issues you might be having with a particular car.  Usually for street cars it's just simple things like Toe In or Out.  Adding or reduce Camber.  Adjusting Tire Pressure.  Maybe slight Aero adjustments if the car has a rear wing or active aero components.  Race cars, however, usually have much more that can be adjusted, like Ride Height, Spring Rate, Bump Stop Rate, Gear Ratios, etc.Assetto Corsa can be played with a gamepad, but you really want to get yourself a steering wheel and pedals to fully take advantage of the driving experience.  Many people run triple monitor setups for racing sims.  I'm running a single 46"" LCD TV as my sole display and the game is beautiful.  With all the graphical settings maxed out I really can say that Assetto Corsa is a gorgeous game, for the most part.  I would recommend this game to anyone who's even vaguely interested in experiencing the ""serious side"" of driving and racing cars via computer.			"

								Wow.  What an amazing game.  I was probably one of the biggest GT fans ever.  I purchased both PS2 and PS3 just because of GT games.  This game (when finished) will blow any console raching game out of the water.  Just the UI is an immense improvement because it's so smooth and quick.  The game is very realistic and probably better than GT5 (have not played GT6).  I'm a hard core race gamer performance means everything to me.  I will probably add more graphics cards once the mods start coming out and improving the textures.  Iceenhancer anyone?Nerd heaven.  I can't believe the amount of customizations allowed in visual display.  Finally it feels like a game publisher has decided to listen to the feedback.  It's kind of odd that when I turn on a few of the Anti Alias settings, my FPS drops to 20, but when I turn them off they go back up to 150fps.This is a great game!			"

												I normally dont really bother with reviews and stuff, but this game deserves one. I have been playing racing sim games since first gran turismo on ps one, also very first F1 games on very first PCs and rally as well! I have played with some of the best wheels you can get and I have played with keyboard and gamepad as well, so I have been around for some time to try it all and play pretty much every racing/rally sim there is, so I will tell you that this game is breathtaking and it is only getting better and better, I own this game from very early access when it wasnt so great but I knew that they will nail it. And they did just that! The attention to detail on each car is immaculate! The physics are incredible! Sound is stunning! Graphics are beautiful! So far a king of racing sim and a real driving simulator!			"

												Edit: The 1.7 patch fixed a lot of the AI issues. It's still not great, but it's a LOT better than it was.The good: - good, reliable multiplayer with dedicated servers - a wide range of moddability - laser-scanned tracks for good accuracy - about as good a physics model you can get without getting into full on sims like iRacing - regular updates with physics & gameplay improvements, and new free content - reasonably priced DLC with actual contentThe bad: - single player content is poor - the AI isn't fun to drive against - a relatively small number of tracks and cars (but this is improving with DLC and newer content patches)Overall - this is a good fun game especially in multiplayer that's about as good for physics as you get without getting to the point where it becomes frustrating.

								I grew up playing the Gran Turismo games on Playstations 1&2. I have long since moved away from the horrible world of console gaming, but unfortunately no racing sim seemed to follow me. Well it seems like one finally caught up. Now that it's here I have very few complaints and it's still very much a beta. The level of detail put into the vehicles, both inside and out, is top notch. The environment leaves a lot to be desired, but that's easily forgiven by the true meat of any racing sim... Physics, lots and lots of physics. This is by far the most realistic racing sim I've played, and I can't seem to ever be satisfied with just a couple of laps. Never before have I been able to seamlessly go from keeping a proper racing line through one corner and then powersliding through the next without first exiting the track and making unrealistic suspension adjustments. I have one final word on the positives of this game before I start to mention some of the negatives. The audio (engines) is simply sublime.If you look at any of the big racing sim giants from the console world, you'll see something called selection. A very vast selection of some amazing and some not so amazing cars. I don't particulary care for the not so amazing cars and I genuinely appreciate Assetto Corsa's current roster of cars barring the Abarth 500, but as far as I know they don't plan on including many more before releasing the finished product. I think another dozen would really make this game worth every penny. When I say another dozen, I don't mean another dozen Lotuses or BMWs which this game already has too many of. I mean a dozen truly different cars. Driving a 1959 Ferrari Testarossa on the soon to be included Nurburgring would put this game into legendary status for me personally. Well I guess beggars can't be choosers, but here's to hoping.			"

												Nordschleife laser scanned in AC is the best, has the most surface detail of all sims. Its the only track I drive atm because its just so addictive. Other tracks are also the best of all sims, Spa or Silverstone for example. The FFB is very easy to setup (unlike Project Cars) and feels brilliant on the OSW. The physics is excellent, all the cars drive and feels realistic, traction loss, oversteer understeer all very very good. Mechanical details of specific cars, are very accurate. Damage is pretty good, both visual and physical. Interior and exterior of all the cars in AC have great details which suits VR extremely well. Although the VR support in AC is still beta it is still very good, I am sure the Kunos team will do a great job in the final release. I would like to see improvements - More weather conditionsMore car packs DLCs (Honda?)More laser scanned tracksBroadcasting/spectating modeBetter online lounge would be nice actuallyLess predicable AI (not as good of iteration as Project Cars AI, but still entertaining)Final VR support asapVR SLI and DX12 engineFYI - I am running wtih MiGE/Simucube Oculus CV1 setupSUMMARY -  Why waste your time driving on non laser scanned tracks?

												The best racing sim.  The wheel feels fairly natural and the game constantly gets better.  The community is perpetually adding car and track mods and with Automation, one can design an engine there, and upload it to modded cars here.  That is amazing.  There is not another game that matches its presence of style.  While unfinished, there isn't another racing game that seems as flawless as this. Recent improvements are programming for the Occulus Rift, (and probably other Virtual Reality gear, {there is a nice selection of pre-programmed wheel arrangements already}), not to mention the artificial intelligence of the cpu opponents that has evolved to seem more like a real race experience.  More camera angles to fit to your gaming setup than before, and in-game apps to improve the gameplay that until utilized, you'd hardly even notice was needed.  There is much more done and in the works that I'm surely not remembering.The only addition I'd want is to have an option to tweak cars like forza or project cars where there are more options to alter the vehicle to suite ones' wishes.  That stuff feels a little like fluff though, (other game versions.)  Assetto Corsa cars feel more authentic from the start, and some can be modified more than others.  The cars seem so distinct from each other by how they drive alone, it makes perfect sence why some cars have been chosen to be in the line-up.  More variety is almost always welcome, as long as it doesn't take away from the quality, which isn't lacking here.			"

												Edit: The 1.7 patch fixed a lot of the AI issues. It's still not great, but it's a LOT better than it was.The good: - good, reliable multiplayer with dedicated servers - a wide range of moddability - laser-scanned tracks for good accuracy - about as good a physics model you can get without getting into full on sims like iRacing - regular updates with physics & gameplay improvements, and new free content - reasonably priced DLC with actual contentThe bad: - single player content is poor - the AI isn't fun to drive against - a relatively small number of tracks and cars (but this is improving with DLC and newer content patches)Overall - this is a good fun game especially in multiplayer that's about as good for physics as you get without getting to the point where it becomes frustrating.

								Wow.  What an amazing game.  I was probably one of the biggest GT fans ever.  I purchased both PS2 and PS3 just because of GT games.  This game (when finished) will blow any console raching game out of the water.  Just the UI is an immense improvement because it's so smooth and quick.  The game is very realistic and probably better than GT5 (have not played GT6).  I'm a hard core race gamer performance means everything to me.  I will probably add more graphics cards once the mods start coming out and improving the textures.  Iceenhancer anyone?Nerd heaven.  I can't believe the amount of customizations allowed in visual display.  Finally it feels like a game publisher has decided to listen to the feedback.  It's kind of odd that when I turn on a few of the Anti Alias settings, my FPS drops to 20, but when I turn them off they go back up to 150fps.This is a great game!			"

								One thing that Assetto Corsa nails - absolutely NAILS - is the gamepad interpolation. They've really put a lot of thought into how analog gamepads control these cars, and what they've come up with is a system that feels better than anything else out there, by a long mile. That, coupled with the great physics, makes this a very fun and satisfying simulator for those of us who can't use a wheel for whatever reason.It's one of the best simulators I've ever used, and in my opinion, second only to iRacing, and that's saying a LOT.

												If your looking for a true racing simulator look no further than this. Every attempt has been made to make it as realistic as possible in the car handling and there visual representation[ not as graphical as project cars but its close enough and the car physics/handling far surpasses project cars.]Feels fantastic with a racing wheel , the force feed back is brilliant [ using a logitech g27 ] and even though it isnt official using revive to play it on a htc vive produces the closest to real racing you will get without climbing in the real car.My only con of this game is ai dont have enough time to play it and master the high skill level required [does have lower settings for a more arcade experience but really you would be doing yourself a miss service			"

												Not just one of the greatest simulators I have ever tried... It is THE greatest simulator out there. Gorgeous graphics that are optimised, beautiful sounds, and the best physics I have ever witnessed in a simulator. It's got great FFB for those using a wheel. I have a G27 and every bump you hit on the road, the wheel will simulate. It's absolutely amazing. This game completely stomps on PCars in every way possible except graphical capabilitys. But with the way this game looks and feels when you're on the road, it really doesn't matter. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game. They even have a laser scanned Nurburgring... Buy the game. Buy the DLC. Stop reading this right now and just freaking do it. You're still reading huh? Well there's nothing left for you to read after this sentence, so PLEASE support the developers of this game and BUY IT RIGHT NOW!			"

												Out of all the racing games I have played over the years (GT1-6, Forza 6, Project Cars, rFactor 2, GTR, etc), I really like how each car drives, handles, and sounds. My favorite being the GTR 34! What a beast, just give me 600 bhp, not 375 bhp… come on man! Cars like Ferrari and McLaren are actually drivable and stable - I had a difficult time getting these cars stable in other games with tons of tweaking; whereas, in AC, stock settings have been okay thus far. Having never driven the cars on the list in real life (really who can afford these beauties?), I have no comparison, but it ""feels"" more realistic and less arcade to how I believe the cars should handle. I feel this game is the “most realistic” and grounded to the road compared to other games.  My biggest gripe to date is the poor MP on PC. All PC players want from AC is: private lobbies, easy MP setup, realistic gameplay, and fun racing with friends. FIX THIS, please. Content - Not a lot, even with all the DLC. AC does have some of the staples of racing tracks - Nürburgring, Spa, Brands Hatch, Monza, etc. I would like some classic tracks like Laguna Seca, Bathurst, Sarthe, Fuji (these are added mods - though mods are fairly good, the sound and track intricacies are not quite the same as the AC tracks). For all those modders, thank you! The modding community does a great job for both vehicles and tracks!			"

												Absolutely spectacular. Very real feel to driving the cars. I've driven a Lamborghini Gallardo around a race track in real life and they really nailed the feel, the acceleration, the handling of the Gallardo when they threw it into this game, so I think it's safe to say they probably nailed the rest of the cars as well. Graphics look great and the game is easy to run at 60 FPS across all three monitors. The content that is already in the game is enough for several hundred hours worth of playing time, let alone all the rest of the content they are going to release for it. This is the best racing simulation game. Period.			"

Once you learn to drive Assetto Corsa you'll never be able to drive Forza or Grid again because you can't handle the drift-a-round handling in those games.All in all, AC is a great simulator but it is definitely unfinished in the current (1.1) state. There is so much small ""irrelevant"" stuff that feels broken, unifinished and badly working that it makes your gaming experience a lot less enjoyable even if the core game and the engine is good. I won't be listing stuff here because you can easily find these things in many reviews here.Another unpleasant thing that people may find out is that the hardcore community of this game is ♥♥♥♥ing hostile towards everyone who hasn't dedicated his life to racing simulators and doesn't possess at least 300€ racing wheel and other equipment. Asking a simple question about keyboard control mapping does pretty much always end into people telling you to kill yourself and your actual question will be forgotten. And by the way, you can't remap most of the original keyboard controls, they're hardcoded or bugged or something but as an example you can't change your camera switch button.Is there anything good to say then?Yes.If you're a hardcore sim driver you'll enjoy this game and probably enjoy being around the community because they do know their stuff. If you just enjoy driving games you'll still most likely like AC because the driving mechanics are good.If you enjoy great graphics in your racing games you'll like this game even more.The AI in this game is pretty non-existent. It drives but it doesn't race. If you set the difficulty to max they will drive perfectly in a huge queue trough the track and do crazy laptimes but they still won't do anything to overtake anyone. Dropping the difficulty makes them brake a lot earlier and thus makes them slower but still they just drive the track without giving a crap about you or eachother.Pitstops don't work in single player which is really a shame.Wrapping it all together, as much as I've been dissappointed in this game at times I still recommend it to everyone who likes a good racing game. Just grab a few friends and go shoot a few laptimes in Monza with LaFerraris or McLarens and it will be amazing!			"

												Wow, so what can I say about Assetto Corsa, how does it stack up to Project Cars?Well, having come from Project Cars first, I don't think I'll look back. The physics engine on this game is far better and less temperamental. Many have praised the game on how true to life the handling is. I can't attest to that as I don't own a driving license lol!I also find the sounds a lot more immersive, whether they're better or not is really a matter of taste, but I prefer the sounds here also. Visually Project Cars takes the crown, however, this is by no means an ugly game and it runs so smooth. The career is fun and more reminisent of Forza Motorsport, this for me is a good thing as I found Project Cars a bit long in the tooth. The car selection is much better here too, such examples as Ferrari, Lamborghini, Nissan etc. The track selection leaves a bit to be desired, though they have been adding more with the DLC packs.If you are a fan of sim racers this is a must for you.

												Take F1, Grid and Forza, put them together to form one massive racing orgy and this is something similar to that.Update-I'm not sure what Kunos have done to the game engine, but the new sounds are dismal.Further Update- I have since changed my mind regarding the above...			"

												Let me first of go by saying , that i have played every sim racing game out there , including the Iracing .Having said that i can easily say that ""Assetto Corsa"" is by far one of the most realistic driving experiences on PC .But in order to trully appreciate this game and it's realisam , you are gonna need to invest some money and time into it . Meaning , that you will need to get a Thrustmaster Wheel  458 italia  & Oculus Rift DK2 , and i promise you that you are going to get the real immerssive racing experience available on PC format .This is only for those who are a hardcore racing enthusiats and wanna experience the best of the best . But for a casual PC sim fan a Xbox Controller or any kind of wheel will be enough. I'm not gonna bore with details on why ""Assetto Corsa"" is the most accurate and realistic racing sim , all you need to know that it is , and don't take my word for it ,  do your research online and you will see what others mostly Professional Real Life Race Drivers have to say about this game .

								It's honestly great. I know project cars is coming soon, but this looks so much better. Honestly, it's phenomenal, and if you're into sim racing, you should definitely get it. Best sim racer I've ever played. It's that damn good. If you're into racing, driving, whatever, definitely get it.It's still in early access, and it has so much potential.			"

								Cannot say enough good things about this simulator.Whether you are from a driving ""game"" background, or already an avid driving sim fan, you can get into Asseto Corsa very easily. While this is a serious driving sim, you are not thrown in at the deep end, of course if you want to dive in the deep end, that is also available (you can find the diving board and speedo's over there --->  8-)If you want to start by trying a small engine car around an easier race track with all the assists turned on, by all means do that, if you want to jump into a hyper car and fly around  a challenging circuit with out any on as your first try, have at it my son!The driving physics are tip top, absolutely spot on, the cars behave exactly as they should...The graphics are also amazing... The cars are perfect recreations of their real world counterparts, down to the tiniest details (you gotta see the cockpit for the Formular Arbarth, its drool worthy) The racing tracks are recreated from laser scans of the real locations, which means the layout is 100% accurate. If the real track has a 5mm kink somewhere in the main straight, this version of the track will also have the same 5mm kink in it.While it is not required, i do highly recommend you use a quality force feedback wheel and pedals set to play. You can use tiptronic paddle shifters, a sequencial shifter or a full H-Gate gear shifter. If you have a controller with both H-Gate and paddles (such as a G25) you can set both. So if you jump into a hyper car that has paddles, you can use the paddles, if you then change to a car with a shifter, you can then use the shifter, without having to go back into the options and changing anything, you can even manually over ride the auto gearbox. Clutch pedals are also supported (i did say its worth using a good wheel set, hehe)While this driving sim is still in the infant stages at the moment, you can easily see it will become a great contender in the league of top driving sims. it will keep pace with any of the other well known driving sims (on pc and console a like) I cannot wait to see what the final product will be like.If i had to score this game out of 10.. I would have to give it 9.5-10. It loses half a point simply because its so damn addictive,  you can start playing and suddenly a few hours have passed. Well worth the money, even now and the game will only get bigger and better as time goes on.Over all verdict... Two thumbs up!			"

Definitively THE best drifting simulator.One of the best DRIVING or HOT LAPPING simulator/simcade on the market.On Assetto Corsa I mostly enjoy drifting, hotlapping and cruising; not full on racing so this review is based from this perspective. Review updated from negative to positive. Overall I would recommend buying this game on special. Keep in mind that AC2 is coming out probably around 2019. CONGRATULATIONS to the main devs for becoming millionaire, they deserve it.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥IC drifting physics - if you enjoy drifting, BUY THIS!- Car physics are mostly good. rFactor 2/Pro has BETTER physics (if you care about ""the most realistic"") but overall, Assetto Corsa is better as a package from my point of view and for my needs (better graphics, quality official content, etc).- Racing against the AI is so-so. Multiplayer racing is OK: great if you race against your level or people you know but pretty average most of the time in a public server. - Official content is VERY satisfying for both cars & tracks.- Extensive mod support. (RaceDepartment)- Forum support.- Keep in mind that day/night cycle as well as rain will NEVER happen in this game due to engine limitations.- A lot of DLCs to buy. IMPORTANT  to keep in mind that KUNOS has recently been sold to another company (Digital Bros) . Although there has been no ""dramatic"" change in staff/management, it could still affect the future direction of this simulator.Also keep in mind that KUNOS as a game company has never finished any of their games.

												This game is an absolute stunner. I've driven in many racing sims, over several platforms, and I have to say this is the best yet. Granted, the car and track choice may not be as extensive as other racing sims - for example GT6 on Playstation - but goodness me, the actual driving experience far surpasses anything else.Let's look at the breakdown:Pros - + Graphics - I mean really, this has epic graphics, shadows, reflections, the lot!+ Sounds - True to life, a big plus for this sim.+ Physics - Again, very true to life.+ Force-feedback - applies only to wheel users - I use a G27 and it's great, you get a very fine feel from the road.+ Detail - Tracks and Cars - the level of detail here is simply sublime.+ Price of DLCs - very economical - only £7-ish quid per pack, for a big selection of new content.+ Multiplayer - fun, and fairly lag-less.+ Stability and performance - I can pull 115 FPS at total max settings; your mileage may vary but it gives you an idea of what can be achieved.Cons - - Choice - There aren't that many cars and tracks to choose from.- Price - £40 (at time of my purchase) is a tad steep, although worth it.TL;DR:""Buy this now.""

												Not really much content in the base game, AI is horrid, campaign is nonexistent, and you have to go out of your way and find a community to get a somewhat decent multiplayer experience. However just chillin and doin hotlaps and shaving off seconds of your time is really satisfying, plus there is an insane amount of community tracks and vehicles that can reach surprisingly high levels of quality.

												Bought a G27 Steering Wheel recently and this game is just brilliant with it. With the Logitech Profiler and the ingame pre-configs the game just works perfectly. Laser-scanned tracks, detailed physics for every car. The amount of mods is amazing, and the DLC's aren't too expensive with a decent amount of content. The only big con I can think of is that the Nurburgring is a DLC. Also a decent PC is needed together with practice and dedication. Not your typical racing-game. 9/10 You like realistic racing/drifting, you'll like this game.			"

												Great sim with huge potential+ Nice looking game+ Physics are really good. almost spot on, maybe RFactor 2 is better for now. That would be the only rival for realism besides iRacing but both of these surpass iRacing.+ Human input from the modding community is fantastic. means loads of track, cars, weather mods, rally tracks, I even saw a bus and a truck etc.+ plenty of options+ when you tune your car it makes a huge difference unlike Grid+ Still a young game so it should have plenty of development to come. I'm looking for improvements on my negative points+ Simple layout.+ Good standard content- No rain etc bad weather dynamics. Project cars looks to be better for this.- No night time (Le mans?)- AI is not agressive enough and not all that smart. stock car racing still has the best- setting up multiplayer is not easy plus alot of messing around to change tracks. Grid autosport is good at this.~ Humans. With access to a large variety of cars and tracks straight away plus a lot of people coming from arcade racing you get crashed into alot. but thats ok as long as you cosider this. The fresh/new community will improve I'm glad there are no restrictions like iRacing. maybe ranked races could sort this.So a great game. beats the rest in my view although they have other positives I think the realism and looks together do it for me...plus the modding community.

Sound is great on some cars and so-so on others. They recently adapted the game to use the  FMOD sound engine. FMOD is very powerful and allows for great mixing options and a variety of characterful noises.Modding community: 12/10Some of the highest quality mods of any game (sim or not) I've ever seen and the community is huge.

												Superb. It's a testament to how different this game feels when you see how many negative reviews and forum gripes call it glitched, unbalanced and BORING. These are people who have never thought to move their *analog* sticks any less then 100% to the left or the right, let alone finessing their triggers!(keyboard users move on, this game is a matter of pure finesse{saving up for wheel}) The game's career has a perfectly crafted progression that layers your understanding of true driving mechanics and like a good teacher will punish you until you learn the obvious geometric elegencies of manipulating 4 wheels like dark souls, monster hunter or quake did with your thumbs themselves. I have played many driving games for years and have only now found myself learning to appreciate camber adjustments and brake bias in a new light of truthful motoring simulation. Even drifting requires a more precise execution that feels easier to understand based on the fluid feedback of the game. At first glance you might find yourself feeling shorted by the 20 something cars and 10ish tracks but once your realize the genius of the game engine you are given to learn in and the many UNIQUE combinations it becomes a joy to bend around every apex put in front of you in any car. And O wait, never ending mods! :DEXTRA POINTS:Yes! Even you can race! The game will let you decide your difficulty in head to head races based on 80-100% efficency in your opponents. I keep my dudes at 90 or a little above for a fair pace that still leaves human openings, while flat 80 is still ""real"" but leaves them acting like trackday newbies tapping their brakes in fear. The only other challenge type than a standard race is time attack which smartly rewards consistency instead of pushing the limit. Just keep all 4 wheel on track to learn and you can make it through, but honing in and going like a pro will be exponentially rewarded!As stated YOU WILL NEED A CONTROLLER of some sort to appreciate the subtle tendencies of the motoring physics portrayed in this game (go play Trackmania if you want the best keyboard driving in the world). 360 controllers are excellent but his game was designed for a wheel and you will always be reminded of that by feeling your controller rumble to the rythm of what you know should be force feedback on a wheel.The game runs great but has a few subtle quirks in the code like the great independant performance engineering the game attempts to depict. Nothing broken but nothing super optimized either outside of the framerate itself which is VERY GOOD . But the thing as a whole has a good feel like an Alpha Romeo or a Lincoln where damn you just can't find a fault with it.			"

												Game was great in Early Access. The bugs and poorly developed features were understandable at that point.Then they decided to release the game, while it still is inconplete...In terms of feel I would give a 9/10. Best feel I get from any racing game.Globably I can't give more than a 4/10.Severall features are too incomplete for this to be a released game.Hope they improve in the future, instead of focusing on DLC'sEDIT as of 15/10/2015:As I feared, game is still looks like an incomplete mess. Still not worth the full price if you want a solid experience.			"

												First of all, i sould say i've never played a Racing Sim. I was hoping for a PC Gran Turismo, but it's a lot more hardcore. I can't seem to even corner properly, i just go straight most of the time. I need more practice :)UpdateWith a bit more practice right now, i can corner a bit. It doesn't do me much good at the moment, i'm stuck on the second career challege (the Fiat 500 Abarth SS race). Now, here's something i've noticed in most racing games: the fixed pattern your opponents will follow and can't be moved from.I crashed into another car, which left me spinning, but the other car just kept driving in his fixed pattern.Normally this isn't much of a deal, but here a wrong corner will make you lose the race. Assetto Corsa  is that kind of game. One mistake, you lose the race and hit the reset button. Which is what i have been doing for the past hour; hitting the reset button. I'm beginning to fear that this game is not for me.			"

Posted: February 26, 2016
												Sadly i love this game... But i can't recommend it to anyone...The main reasons are as follows.-Horrible AI (The AI drive like you don't exist... You will get pushed off at every opportunity.. I race mostly offline and when a car is right behind me i can't race the track anymore i just have to push beyond all my braking points just so that i avoid the AI ramming into me or taking an inside turn when one doesn't exist. I don't understand why this is such a problem for assetto when there are games out there that do pretty good with AI i mean.... atleast the AI is aware that you exist... As for AI vs AI it's non-existent. They just drive the line and that is it... )-Kunos doesn't listen to their customers as to what they want in this game and consistently release DLC's that no one really asked for and are priced terribly high. -I tried a g27 a TS500 and a Fanatec. Sadly they controls are just too senstive. I've tried everything to reduce them from within the game or outside and it doesn't reduce sensitivity. Other games easily have this problem solved by allowing you to change sensitivity of your pedals and wheels but this doesn't exist in Assetto. The closest thing they have to sensitivity is brake gamma which really has a set curve that you can move along and with nothing for steering or for accelerator settings... I do not drive any car with TC or ABS even if it comes as factory. For me that kills all the fun in braking with the right pressure and actually preventing your car from spinning out when coming out of turns or braking hard. Some people like just pushing down on the brakes and letting the abs do the work for them.. To me that isn't racing if all you have to do is accelerate to full and brake to full... It makes no sense to me and i don't see any challenge or fun in that.. I've asked Kunos many times to simply add settings for sensitivity but alas as you can see they just ignore everything even though Kunos well knows it will help alot of people out. You can go and type in sensitivity with assetto corsa in google and see for yourself.-Very bad multiplayer setup. If you want to host a server for a simple race with some friends be prepared to do your homework since it isn't anywhere near as easy as other games where you just click on setup server or custom server or start an internet game. Kunos has almost willingly made it very tedious to run a server of your own.-No crash damage... You do see a diagram of your car come up and turn different colours as you damage certain parts but as for visually don't expect to see anything apart from perfect cars... Makes no sense to me....- Nothing to do with weather or nighttime racing.- No pit stops....- Basically this game simulates a car i guess really well... That is where it stops. This isn't a racing game its just a car simulator. Please don't get mistaken before or if you buy this game.The only reason i love this game.- The physics are great. - FFB is great and you can feel the car really nicely..I'm sorry to anyone that wants this game so badly. I just find it so upsetting when Kunos has such a great game and there are very clear suggestions put to them from many people as to how they can really help change this game. But it is beyond me and this doens't go for Kunos only but it is beyond me why devs don't listen to their customers and tailor the game to what they want or need just like any other seller of any goods. It's usually a demand or a niche that people try to provide to which Kunos fails to do everytime. I mean simple things like allowing additional settings has nothing to do with whether most people will like it or not. Just give people the options to race anywhere with any opponents to have all steering and pedal options available... I really don't see this as hard or challenging in anyway...Lastly and sadly... Assetto Corsa is the only game i know of where i had to do so much research and reading just to even find information that is important. I've got this game during Early Access and i've seen it grow but i'm sorry that Kunos decided to go this way because it saddens me that they really have a rough diamond in their hands... I just wish they would cut and polish it the correct way and the way it's customers want... I still get confused till today as to why devs don't do what their customers ask...			"

												 There are loads of fine simulators out there, they all drive well and look stunning. So if you can afford them try them all and pick which you want to drive at your leisure. I have tried most and have to say Assetto Corsa shines through, even with all of its faults.   Multiplayer not really suitable for leagues. AI too easy to beat  (sometimes) Career a bit lack lustre. No day/weather cycle. Tyres/brakes/Engine/Water/Oil temps missing or lacking in detail. Mods break every update (modders should keep on top of their own work right enough). Low speed spins/curbs of death are annoying. Tyres never leave the road in a crash (Peculiar thing to see) and I am sure there are a few other annoyances. But the good things so out weigh all of the negatives. The feel of the cars, every car feels and acts differently. Tracks are beautifully rendered and you can feel every bump and imperfection. The sounds of the engines and tyres, so different between road and sports cars. The total immersion, sometimes you can fall into the screen and forget it is a sim. Online racing is spectacular, wheel to wheel, out braking in corners etc etc Modded content available, so much so it could become an addiction.  Developers that listen and even take over modded content with full licenses.  So much more to say but that is AC, the more you play the more you want to play. I have over 1100 hours of game time and just cannot stop loving this sim. There are things I want implemented, there are bugs I want fixing, there are cars and tracks I want in it, but most of all I want to thank Team Kunos for keeping going and developing a sim that really will become better and better with time. Kudos to Kunos.			"

												This game is buggy, poorly optimized and most importantly, boring.There's all kinds of weird physics that makes you wonder what the hell just happened and why. Sometimes your car will just fly into the air. Some cars are so far detached from the real world counterparts I don't know how the team got the figures they use. Certain drivetrain types (Namely AWD, which was slightly improved some months ago) just don't really work properly.I'm running a frankly underpowered 2 gb 960 running triple screens, and this game drops frames and has stuttering issues like nobodies business. Anytime there's any amount of alpha effects (Smoke, trees[Which are all 2d sprites], grass, dust) the game drops frames. I have to run the game at medium to low to try and maintain a somewhat stutter and tear free framerate, and anytime the car touches dirt it drops around 20 FPS. This game is not a looker by any means. I can run Dirt Rally (With MASSIVE amounts of alpha effects being huge plumes of dust [not AC's 6 visible ""Smoke"" sprites]) near max at ~80fps and PCars at medium high at 60, on triples. Hell, even The Witcher 3 gets better performance than this game.There's little to no customization of anything in this game. Every car gives the option to change tire pressure, alignment and a small amount of suspension. Anything further is a crapshoot and typically reserved for the teams more favorite cars. The car list isn't even that impressive, with numbers being bloated by a crap ton of Lotus's no one uses and ""performance"" packages. Once on the track... well you better like hotlapping around bland scenery because the AI are awful and online doesn't give you the freedom you want.With a lack of any real good official content, the game relies on mods, most of which are half baked and never completed. The ones that are any good get outdated quickly as Assetto Corsa moves on to different methods, meaning the mod owners have to either update all their mods or just drop them entirely (which many do.)On another point, the ""community"" for this game are some of the most toxic I've seen, if not the most. Anyone who has valid criticism or questions gets♥♥♥♥♥♥on and typically banned after being insulted from the devs. The official forums used to be a great place to find mods and work together, but the devs got rid of that because apparently it was just a place where people were inflating their ego? I think it's because the most prominent modders making quality content constantly♥♥♥♥♥♥on the dev's for being incompetent and made better mods.I got banned on the forum for saying that Forza looks better (Which it does) and saying one of the tire model revisions seemed to add a smidge of understeer. The community and ""Lord Kunos"" (The main dev) called me an idiot and a conspiracy theorist.You can't access the forums without linking it to your steam profile page, which means I can't even access the forums to see what's being worked on or other basic things. I paid $40 for a product I can't even read about because I ""insulted"" the devs.			"

												I wouldn't of believed it unless I experienced it...and I did. The AC forum, I was attacked and called names simply because I was critical or asked questions, and reported bugs that made the developers look bad?? They decided to attack using name calling tactics and the first thing that came to my mind was Bell from Pcars, attacking name calling and banning those who didn't speak positive or were critical of them. Fanboy favorites would then act like a pack of dogs, hunt for and surround their intended victim and attack! Which was fine, and really was holding my own until one of the actual ""staff"" members started in, started with insults, but when I responded back...with a rather fresh comeback...they banned me. So they attack call you inappropriate names but when you defend yourself they ""AC"" ban you...Sounds familiar!??I really hoped, though I heard from others about similar gross behaviors of banning for not being a fanboy but didn't want to beleive it. I report good when I see it...report bad or problems when I see it hear about them.So I am giving a thumbs down, this is their official support forum, and without it...makes it hard to report bugs or get ANY support if you're banned from that entire site!, unless of course you make another account with different ip etc 😎...which I could do but a pain in the butt....I guess what bothers me the most here is...these guys are supposed to be and act like ""Professionals"" and should be able to take a little critism/questions without being triggered, verbally attacking their customers..and not ban them when they respond in kind. For the record my response, there was no profanity, and I was merely in a defensive position with my reply that was clearly in tandem with the insults directed at me, I had responses like...don't like don't read...get out of mom's basement for some fresh air....stupid, and referred to them using their postion of power acting like bullies....as again this was after being attack and called names...buy a ""staff member"" no less.I am not saying my response was perfect but agian it was after being attacked. These individuals should be acting in a professional manner and have a higher level of standard applied...Instead of taking the opportunity to address me privately, that the AC staff were taking issues with of my comments or questions they publicly berated me...so I responded...for that, there was no warning, I was banned! This in my opinion, childish and controlling behavior of AC...they desperately want to control the narrative..and if it's negative then they will attack, provoke to you respond..then ban you as if giving them some sorta self accepting ok from their indecent acts.Maybe AC numbers are slipping...support or fan base is slipping because of all their problems taking on console and are feeling pressured because the console market is failing?? I dont know...but as a customer..The way AC staff handled this matter was totally inappropriate, publicly berating, rather than private co conversation and banning someone one when they defend themselves...to me is just bad business and shouldn't be the norm but the exception to the rule. I give them a thumbs down...a fail for the dictator, Stalin type of running of their forum.The actual game itself is ok...there are issues both PC and Console however not able to address them as I am banned 😀I would also add that with competition out their, no day night, or weather transition is unacceptable. Litterly no crash damage, and the DLC is crazy over priced imho (another reason why In was attacked as I said as much on their forum..was quickly giving comparison to ""Rocket League"" lmao by a Staff member...what a stupid comparison and shows you how far they were reaching for something intelligent to say...fail!) and the most unforgiving of all to come into the console market and have NO private servers for their console customers! I have this game now unfortunately on two platforms with no official support.			"

												I think Assetto Corsa has very realistic physics, good simulation, good graphics, but the game its a bit dull, its missing content. Its bad when you have to get mods to make the game enjoyable, and now I have to pay for the dlc to get a few more cars and Nurburgring. This game was a disappointment :(			"

								The best racing game I have ever played. I play this game with a keyboard and mouse yet it still beats all other racing games. My friend has a full racing set with the steering wheel, pedals, shifter all of it, so i tried it on there and I may have Came in my pants a little bit, thats how amazing it is. The graphics are great the physics and everything are great and the driving is the most realisic I have ever seen. If you have racing gear like my friend you should buy this game right away, but for those who dont like myself I want you to know it is still 100% worth buying.			"

YouTube™ Video: Assetto Corsa 0.6 Gameplay AI Race lotus type 49 

			Views: 174		

			I earn the achievement 300kmh by falling the through the map! Scrub to 7:06 to the start of the death jump run.		

I hope I have the right URL.  This game is just great, Beautiful graphics, real physics and a slew of cars and tracks to choose from.  I found the menu system slightly convoluted and a bit tedious at times.  Setting up my wheel was simple enough to play but as a new sim-racer I've alot to learn.  My wheel is a DFGT and it's not in the best condition for some reason.  The video above shows a slight oops in the game map as I fall through the map at around 7 minutes and then proceed to earn a trophy for reaching 300kmh...as I'm falling through rmember.  At any rate I've alot to learn as a newb Sim racer and this game makes me want to learn more.			"

								Yes yes yes yes yes...Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ Coming from a lot of GTR, Race07 (with every possible pack and mod) there was a lot I had to get used to..BUT... Giving it a chance, spend a lot of time tweaking my ""feel"" I came out on something that feels way different from the Simbin titles that I used to play. Used to, because AC has become my goto race-sim and after spending more that 1000 hours in Race 07 that does say something! AC just feels way way better, different (you'll have to get used to it if you spend a lot of time in Simbin games) but better.. The visuals are a lot nicer too.. (haven't really played R3E, so I don't really know about the visuals in that) I have to add though: Visuals especially look nicer if you have an awesome rig (which I don't) and up until a few patches ago I had a lot of trouble getting a halfway decent fps... since the latest few patches there was so much improvement.. I actually have an 80-110 fps on an i3 with a gt630 in a 1920x1080 Resolution.. (before the game used to run fine for a bit then drop to the 14-ish fps, that's fixed now)So now it's playable (fps wise) all the time the game starts to put a big BIG grin on my face.Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ The mod-ding community is great and it's awesome that you can make your own mods. The best content in Rfactor 1 came from the community... so bring it on..Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ There is already quite some tracks made by mod-ers out there.. not all ""as good"" but all reasonable and most, if not all, still being developed (so you can actually give input, and they're being fixed if a patch might break them).. And there are some absolute jewels.. One I'd like to mention by name.. Nordschleife 1.1 from Snoopy... OK one more then.... Joux Plane (by Kegetys?),  But there is more really good mods  out there and the game isn't even final yet.Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞The physics are good both ffb-wise (they have a somewhat different approach from simbin titles or Rfactor, but give it a real chance, you'll see that it actually feels more like driving a car) as world physics-wise ie. how a car reacts to driving over a curb/bump.. This is the first sim that actually made me scout tracks for bumps etc.. because hitting a bump wrong is a problem, your car gets instable and the next corner might not go as anticipated, because there is still an unbalance in the car. The suspension is worked out in a lot of detail. A lot of things have been done with a refreshing new approach..Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ Also there is a lot of talk about the feeling of speed in the game being off.. Its actually spot on (It's most probably the first sim-race-game that does not exaggerate the sense of speed.. (also FOV settings are important))... (run the back-straight (yeah the curvy one) on the NS with close to 300 kph in a Zonda and you'll know what I mean, you feel you are going fast because you are.. 160 kph doesn't feel that fast IRL (sorta depends on where you do it, granted.... and maybe ""in what"" even more so.. but you know what I mean)It's the circumstances that make it feel fast and AC does exactly that. If you're driving 160 or even 200 on the German Autobahn while it's otherwise empty, it doesn't feel fast at all. The excitement in racing isn't in the excessive sense of speed.. but in going head to head and being faster then someone else within the confines of the same set of rules (physics). That is what it feels like on a track IRL and also in AC. The excitement lies in either driving on your own limits, and trying to improve on yourself, trying to scrape another 10th of a second of your time, hoping not to screw up that 3rd corner before the finish, and throwing away the progress you made on the rest of the track..  or in going head to head with someone or multiple ppl, having to move out of your comfortable line and overtake other ppl safely, just to find out on this particular corner the camber is bad and you're going to run out off grip a little sooner then you expected. Those are the real thrills of racing, not the speed. IRL you don't notice the speed after a few good laps. You know how fast you're going (Awareness) but it doesn't feel fast (Perception).. Also the fastest laps, the ones in which everything goes ""right"", usually don't ""feel"" fast at all.Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ Dev's do understand the meaning of the words challenge and achievement...... A challenge is really a challenge so an achievement actually feels like an achievement, which is refreshing in racegames (Never been so happy finally getting Silver.. and yeah I know there is still gold... maybe in a lot of time with a lot of practice who knows LOL) I don't always get a gold medal.. but when I do I'm gonna be sooooo happyDev's listen to the community... There is still a lot of noticeable development/improvement still going on. It IS still an early access game. BUT In a lot of ways it already feels completely mature.. there some things that are not finished yet.. but they don't stand in the way of enjoying the game as is...  AI for instance is still being improved, that doesn't mean they are not fun to ride with right now, just that they are made even better still. The way the shifter works is great.. you can by miss-coordination actually miss a gear which will slot back in at the right rpm. The engine stall on the other hand is not working as expected yet.. namely it doesn't.. even with auto-clutch off. but that doesn't matter once you're away anyway.. I suppose they didn't think that was important right now, but I do hope they integrate that later.Cars actually feel different from each-other.. more then in most racegames, power-steering actually feels like power-steering (light with less feedback, you still feels what the car is doing but it's watered down somewhat.. like.. eh .. power-steering)The more this game develops the bigger my grin gets.. Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞Also Japanese mountainroads (Akagi Mountain pass) and BMW E90 Drift is a seriously big grin-factorBut seriously it's a good game, and it only gets better (I hope, but they're on the right track IMO)			"

												It's a driving sim, and a damn good one. Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and even though Kunos want it to be playable with a controller if you want to get the most out of this you really need a wheel of some sort. There's a career mode, but only in the sense that there's a series of races you can progress through via a menu. Races you can set up manually at any time in a different menu, since the game gives you access to all cars from the start. So yeah, you can pretty much ignore the career mode.There are 3 DLCs, and at the very least you should get the 1st one as it comes with one of the best renditions ever of the famous nordschliefe. The other 2 DLCs are both arguably worth the money, as in each there are at least a few cars worth having.Mods are supported, and the possibilities are vast. As time goes on, more and more content will be created as there is already a decent modding scene for this sim. Kunos is still updating everything as well, particularly in preparation for console release. Also notable is how all of the real life tracks except for 1 are laser scanned for that extra bit of realism.The online racing is slightly spotty, but that's par for the course for everything outside of iRacing pretty much. The AI only recently got to the point where they're consistently good drivers, whch is still good practice before online racing with other actual people.Truth be told, right now this game is best at being a hotlapping simulator. The other elements are improving all the time, and if you truly want proper online racing your best bet is to join a league of some sort in order to get into their private servers with people who know racing etiquette. I still have fun on public nordschliefe tourist servers, where you see every sort of car.One of the best early access games, and one that has delivered a huge amount from a formerly tiny studio. All cars in the game have painstakingly taken real data (wherever possible) into account, and with some of them it's hard to find a more authentic simulator experience anywhere else. Those looking for a forza-like game on the PC, this isn't it. There's no upgrading of the cars, just setups. The driving is unforgiving, and if you've never played a racing sim before and you go into this game blind you're going to have a rough time.Know what you're buying, but I'd say the game is well worth it for any fan of sim racing.

								By far best racing game i've played. It still being in early acces doesn't mean it's totally broken like e.g. DayZ Standalone. O, god no, this game is very playable with steering wheel support and awesome FFB effect's on my G27 racing wheel.My favorite car a.t.m. is the Lotus 98T, it's a old '80's Formula 1 car with 1400+ HP. The traction and effects are awesome at this car. Let's not forget all the awesome BMW's and Ferrari's, but the Lotus cars don't attract me a single bit, what I would love to see are more ""normal use"" cars like the VW Golf GTi (preferably the Mk5, best handling and torque) or a Seat Leon ST, Ford Focus RS, Golf R(32).What is even better, is that the track I visit alot of time's, The Nordschleife, is going to be in this game as a DLC. This DLC contains the Nordschleife and 10 cars but considering this track is really 100% precise laser scanned this is well worth the price.Performance is good on my system, almost always 60FPS with a AMD FX8320 @4.8Ghz, 16GB 1866Mhz RAM, a 250GB Samsung EVO SSD, and last but not least: Asus R9 280X DCII GPU. Great value for money!			"

This is by far the best sim racer that I have ever played. The sounds, the graphics, even the tracks are all nailed down perfectly to the final pixel.			"

								Damn what a game. And for now it's even not finished and still in beta.If you love driving and own a wheel and if you want the best sim out there for now get it. Physics are great, graphics are great, game modes are still expanding. Can't wait for multiplayer.You can have a race weekend with friends. It seems it is up to 24 Players depending on the track you chooses.Yeah tracks, they are very good made. Now there are not enough but this will change later on. Right now I'm eagerly awaiting Spa Francorchamps. Should be out in May.As a first in Racing it is developed with official Oculus Rift Support ... Can't wait for the consumerversion of this to have fun inside all the nicely moddeled cockpits.It is even better if you got a hang for those little lightwight rockets named Lotus because there are a lot of them in this game. And they all drive suberb. Overall, thumbs up all the way!!  "

								Overall I enjoy the game and it has brilliant driving physics but I can not afford a steering wheel. People that have a steering wheel will have a big advantage over people who have to use controllers or the keyboard in this game. It is also very annoying that you can not set a clutch axis on a controller and puts you at a great disadvantage to anyone who has a wheel and pedals because of how poor the auto clutch is. "

								This. Is. The best PC driving game on Steam as of the writing of this review. With some of the best looking cars and circuits, the very best physics, and a very talented modding community producing an ever-growing library of add-on vehicles, tracks, and apps, this is already worthy of its full-price despite being an early-access game. If the 'early access' tag frightens you, don't let it. Imagine Microsoft Flight Simulator was about cars and was in HD. That's what this is.If there's any downside, it's that it's not quite fully optimized and can be resource-intensive, especially with some of the more detailed mod vehicles out there. Then again, so were the Flight Simulator games - and MS expected computer technology to catch up with them!			"

								I like this game. The graphics are good, the sounds are great even the physics are suprisingly good. Except for the fact that the cars usually don't turn at moderate speeds, you'll have to slow down significantly to turn, but then again, it's a simulation game. Overall in my opinion, I think I will game this game 7/10. The only problem I have is with the multiplayer, not a lot of players are online. And the servers with the most players usually require track/car mods to be able to play on which is pretty dumb. We need campaign mode and TONS of cars. The new Mercedes SLS was stupid. Good from the inside, from the oustide, looks cartoon-ish.			"

								I have a friend with whom I raced in an F1 2013 League some time ago. When somebody suggested Assetto Corsa to the league, he refused to consider it, and backed up this point by copying a whole page of bugfixes from the most recent update.More fool him.Kunos have done a utterly fantastic job on this game at the time of writing - that is, towards the end of the Alpha Phase. Not only that, but they've involved the community in their decisions, looked for feedback from those who play - In fact, I'd go so far as to say you should buy the game simply to help support the developer. But then you'd be missing out on the point; you'd be buying one of the best PC Racing Simulators out there today.-Overall  This is an Early Access Review, but in saying that, the game is close to flawless. The graphics are stunning. Each car is modelled perfectly. The tracks are all laser scanned. The feel of each car is individual. The force feedback for those with wheels, is immersive. In game sounds are gorgeous. The AI are being constantly improved, and they already far outstrip those in any of the other racing games I play. Possibly the largest asset, though, is the large and very active community, who are a source of advice, feedback, and, of course, an inexhausible supply of mods, which really make the content feel more complete. Overall, it's a wonderful Sim. There is not a car that's not easy to drive, within your limits - but when you begin to push, when you begin to look for the tenths through every corner, when you place the car on the ragged edge, brushing the barriers, feeling the back start to come loose, you will make mistakes. Of course. But that just makes success more intoxicating.-Content  Probably the major con when considering the game. Though each car is beautifully crafted and offers limitless opportunity for driving, there are only a small selection in the base game. There are also only a small number of different tracks, and sadly, a lot of the classics are missing at the moment. Kunos is a small developer, of course, so this is inevitable, but it means that Project Cars is a better choice for variety (Or buying a PS4 and GT5). That said, if you don't mind doing some modding, then there are an ever increasing selection of quality cars on Assetto's forums, or on RaceDepartment. There are few times I enjoy myself as much as when taking my DAMS GP2 car around the Monaco Street Circuit, and at those points everything except the apps are modded.   In short, a lack of variety, but this is remedied by the mods. Plenty of content there for anybody.-Realism This is an important factor for a Simulator, and boy, Assetto does it well. Everything is totally customisable. EVERYTHING. The setup options are fantastically complex, with handy tooltips for those of us without a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, and the wonderful thing is that changing every variable will make the car feel, and handle slightly differently. The game measures time increments of 1/250 seconds, so you can see those changes on the clock to, and it's very satisying to gain a tenth on the straight by increasing the tyre pressure slightly and getting an improved Vmax as a result.   You can customise the grip levels on track - there are a number of preset options in terms of the amount of rubber laid down at the beginning of the session, and the grip will increase as you lap the track, with a racing line corresponding to the average line taken becoming visible as the session progresses.  You can really feel the car changing through the session - it takes a significant amount of time for tyres and brakes to get up to operating temperatures on the faster cars, but there's a massive improvement when you do - and tyre wear is realistically handled, and something that you really don't want to be on the recieving end of.  There's more as well, I promise, but I do need to move onto other sections of the review :')-Singleplayer  There are a number of different options to spend time on, each of which is devoted to a different discipline.   The practice mode is for getting to know a track, or a car, and just putting in some laps, helping tune setups, changing wheel settings, or just generally screwing around.   The Drift mode does what it says on the tin. You drift. Not much more to it than that. Extra points for combining drifts, and drifting for longer, or harder. Fun, but a novelty.   The Race mode allows you to pit any cars against each other, and it offers you a lot of flexibilty in terms of the race weekend - qualifying? Practice? Session lengths? You choose.  The Hotlap mode is for when you're really getting serious. Boost that ambient temperature, boost the track grip, take a nice fast car, and set a faster time than your friends.  Lots of modes for lots of variety, lots of things to do, but in the end you're more likely to end up playing Multiplayer.-Multiplayer  It's a mixed bag, this. The multiplayer itself is excellent. You can choose any selection of cars, and any track (Including modded ones, which is really nice), and go out. The connections are reliable, the lag is minimal, and if you have friends you enjoy racing with, who are of a similar speed, then it can get fantastically competetive. You can apply the same level of customisation to this as you can to single player - all of the variables are controlled by the server host, but the key is that they're all controllable.  That all said, actually setting up a dedicated server is tricky. There are a lot of processes that you need to run through, including port forwarding, and then running the server is heavy on bandwidth and also PC resources.  That aside, it's wonderful fun, and when leagues start to run, then I'm sure a whole new aspect will really kick off. (Speaking of leagues, sign up here if you're interested: wtwr.enjin.com)-Conclusion  There's not really a whole lot more to say. I know Kunos have got some more stuff coming - not because I'm an insider, because they're open and forthcoming, with Forums and Social Media that are in regular use. I know that the first non-alpha release will be coming soon. I know also that it's expensive - indeed, I waited until it was 50% off before buying it. If I went back now, though, given what I know, I'd gladly pay full price for it. It's brilliant. Utterly brilliant. And if you don't have it, you're missing out.			"

								After looking forever for trying to find a racing game that complimented my Logitech G27 steering wheel nicely, i started seeing video's on youtube of this game. I decided to buy it, and holy S**& BEST racing game EVER. All sounds are insanely PERFECT all the way from hearing your car echoing off the wall when you get close to the sound of rocks flying out of your tires when you accidently go off the track. So far I have never played a game where you actually start getting nervous going TOO fast, my wheel begins to shake as the car starts going to fast and coming in to a corner TOO fast has never been more nerve racking. Seriously, if you have a wheel, give this game a whirl.			"

								I was a bit intimidated moving from GRID/DIRT and even more arcadey drivers to this uber-sim, but it plays great with an XBOX controller and has enough training wheels to help get you going. I soon turned them off and discovered the thrill of seeing how close to the edge I could push the cars. Some are pretty unforgiving, but put yourself in a Lotus to start with and you'll be able to handle it a bit better.Content wise it is fair for the price. I look forward to a career mode and online racing, but until then there's enough to keep me busy. I hope they add some visual damage and other graphical niceties, but they've really focused on what counts. "

												Assetto Corsa has to be the best racing simulator I've ever played, you can really feel the momentum and aerodynamics of your vehicle, and the tracks have laser scanned features and imperfections, something other ""simulators"" fail to implement. It's endless fun to practice around tracks in the authentic vehicles the game has. It's great to be able to perfect driving skills and have an exhilarating time doing it; you really feel accomplished going around a track in a BMW M3 GT2 at substantial speeds. I'd have to say the best part of Assetto Corsa is that it is always improving with time and that I can see it aging like wine in the future, there is always new content to look forward to. I love this game, I'd highly recommend it, and a racing wheel if you can help it.			"

								I bought this game not long after it came out on steam. I loved it! I spent 12 hours on it in less than 2 weeks. Then an update came (somewhere around 0.72) and the game wouldnt let me go on track from there on after. I dont know if thats my computer, me being an idiot or the game being weird. This is a fantastic game and I would love to recommend it, but because of the runtime error every time i try to go on track it would just take me back to the home screen. Its a shame really, once this is fixed il do an update section on the comment.EDIT/UPDATEIt lives! After days of tweeking and fiddling and smacking my head on my desk repeatedly I managed to find a combonation of settings that my computer would chew and then spit out back at me! Thank you game, one of the best games I have ever played finally works.			"

												Ignore my ""time played"" stats - I have reinstalled this game again within the last few days and I play offline.I have played just about every decent PC driving/racing game since Geoff Crammonds GP4 and, until recently, I thought GTR2 was the most enjoyable driving/racing experience.  AC is now King of the Simulators (the only game I have not tried is iRacing so that may be more of a simulation but it is too expensive and I play offline).The moment I fired up AC and took my first drive I knew it was going to be sensational.  I prefer the more natural graphics of AC than the hollywood style of PCars and you can not even compare RF2 or any other top tier racing game.  I purchased a Thrustmaster T150 and, after some tweaking and advice from the internet regarding setup, I was in virtual heaven.  I read comments stating that other users just enjoyed hotlapping and I thought that can't be much fun but it is a joy to choose a car and track combination and spend long hours trying to beat your personal best times.  As an offfline player I was concerned about the reported AI behaviour but it clearly beats the manic AI drivers in PCars and is at least as good as R3E AI.  Admittedly the AI in RF2 is probably still the best but unfortunately the graphics are not good enough to tempt me to play it for long periods of time.Pros:Excellent graphics (with PP enhancements)Superb driving physicsVery good AI racingSuperb mod support (tracks, vehicles, sounds, apps, setups, graphics)Ability to create custom championshipsCons:I honestly can't think of anyIn summary I have enjoyed this game so much that I deleted my PCars, RF2 (demo) and R3E (another excellent game but requires constant internet connection to play) as well as GTR2, RACE 07 and F1 2012.  I could have kept these games on my hard drive but I know that i will be dedicating all of my time to AC so I deleted the other titles.I do not play online and I am not particularly interested in night driving or even driving in the rain.  Assetto Corsa caters for my personal preferrences and concentrates on getting the basics right - the excellent feeling of driving and racing high powered cars in exotic locations.  I am 51 years old but I feel like I am rediscovering my passion for sim racing after all these years - buy this game you will not regret it for one minute.UPDATE - Since my initial review I have spent MANY hours setting the game up to my desired taste (graphics, handling, FFB etc) and the game is even better than I originally stated.  I have installed over 30 really high quality tracks and installed several excellent car mods which has completely opened the game up with far more content.  I have started the career and, once complete, will use the ACCG app to create my own championships/career.I thought I might have been too hasty in uninstalling all of my other race sims so I reinstalled GTR2, PCars and F1 2012 to see if there was any merit in having these games on my hard drive.  The graphics in GTR2 , the AI in PCars and the arcade handling in F1 2012 convinced me that Assetto Corsa was the closest thing to perfection in the current crop of racing sims.  I stick with my initial description of pros and cons for this game and I cannot comprehend any negative reviews regarding this all-time classic.

								Damn what a game. And for now it's even not finished and still in beta.If you love driving and own a wheel and if you want the best sim out there for now get it. Physics are great, graphics are great, game modes are still expanding. Can't wait for multiplayer.You can have a race weekend with friends. It seems it is up to 24 Players depending on the track you chooses.Yeah tracks, they are very good made. Now there are not enough but this will change later on. Right now I'm eagerly awaiting Spa Francorchamps. Should be out in May.As a first in Racing it is developed with official Oculus Rift Support ... Can't wait for the consumerversion of this to have fun inside all the nicely moddeled cockpits.It is even better if you got a hang for those little lightwight rockets named Lotus because there are a lot of them in this game. And they all drive suberb. Overall, thumbs up all the way!!  "

								Overall I enjoy the game and it has brilliant driving physics but I can not afford a steering wheel. People that have a steering wheel will have a big advantage over people who have to use controllers or the keyboard in this game. It is also very annoying that you can not set a clutch axis on a controller and puts you at a great disadvantage to anyone who has a wheel and pedals because of how poor the auto clutch is. "

												So i have owned this game since early access and felt that maybe its time for a review...In many ways racing games reflect their studio's location, Tursimo has always been very Japanese oriented, Forza is quite American oriented and things like ToCa/GRiD, Project Cars, Race 07 all have a very European style to them. Asseto Corsa is no different, it makes no secret of being Italian and from the cars to the tracks to its overall identity. It draws from it in all the best ways. Thankfully Italy has no shortage of both great cars and great tracks. From the Abarth 500 to the best from Ferrari, the cars are both diverse and perfectly represented in incredable detail. The tracks as well show the diversity of the country's selection as F1 locals like Monza and Imola are the marquee tracks, the lesser known tracks like Magione and Vallelunga, with even a delightful fantasy track through the desert mountians. Of course all of that is irrelevent if the game cant do it once you get out on the track and get driving. This is the area where AC really proves its chops to go against all the aformentioned racing genre classics. The assists make the game accessable but as you improve and start peeling them away to a more simulation experience is when the game comes alive and you feel like less of a passenger and more like a master pilot blasting through the forests of Monza or the Nurburgring. In all the time i have been playing this game the only thing i have ever had to complain about is among the most minor of issues, there is no pause button mapped to the controller by default and no way to assign it. That said, once i get racing, i honestly dont want to stop anyways, so i guess it doesnt matter much in the end.			"

								This is easily the most realistic car simulator I have ever seen/played. It very well may be the most realistic racing sim on the planet. 10/10 Perfect game. Well well worth the money. I bought a Thrustmaster TX racing wheel to play this game.As a side note, I must say that although Assetto Corsa gives you access to almost every control parameter possible, it can still be difficult to get your settings right. The cars can become incredibly hard to handle if you have stability control at 0%, for instance. I assume this is how the cars would act in real life, though, and the preciseness of this game makes you miss the g-forces from real life driving to help you control.Someday, I will get an Oculus Rift and try it out with this game (yes, it supports it). I think it might help a lot to have depth perception.BUY THIS GAME.			"

								Coming from Gran Turismo or Forza? Things to know...Thought I would make this thread seeing as I am one of the above described. Firstly the game is very playable with a controller but it does require some tweaking. For something that feels a little more like GT or FM (and I do mean LITTLE) use the following control settings...Handling Speed: 10%Gamma: 4Filter: 0.2Speed Sense: 0.1Dead Zone: 0.1Having said that, this game is a LOT more realistic than GT or FM and will punish you for any bad habits. Late breaking will see you screeching into the dirt and it is essential that you pay attention to the speed in which you take corners. Basically I am saying forget everything you think you know about racing sims before playing. So is it a hard game to get into? Short answer: Yes it can be. But once you start playing with the correct mentality it is very addictive and actually a lot of fun. At the moment content is a little bare but the silver lining is that you can just concentrate on driving, there are no AI cars getting in the way. Each car handles very differently and each of them have their own quirks and challenges. Pushing a Farrarri to its limits is both terrifying and exhilirating but as you learn the cars and tracks and gain more confidence, those lap times start to look a whole lot better.Graphically the game looks very impressive for an early access release. The cars look stunning and are already up there with Gran Turismo 5's premium models and I expect that they will look even better once the game is finished. The tracks however could use some more work. Whilst they do look accurate they just feel a little lifeless. There are no trees blowing, spectators, wild life or anything else of interest. Some of the scenery also looks flat and dated such as trees that are simply two 2D images ""slotted"" together (think back to PSOne racing games for a clearer picture). However the game is far from finished so there is plenty of time to work on it. Performance was almost perfect for me, the only annoyance being some distant pop up.So that's what I think of the game so far, in summary....Is the game playable with a controller? Yes with some tweakingDoes it look good? Cars yes, tracks mehIs it GT or FM for the PC? No, it's a LOT more realisticShould I still try it? Absolutely!			"

												 This definatly a must buy if you are a big fan of racing games. It has the potential to be one of the best racing games out there, you just need to give it some time. This is going to be the Next Gen rFactor. It still has a long way to go but when it gets there it will be the best racing game. The sound needs alot of work. The force feedback also needs some work. The AI is the main problem at the moment it is very slow and doesnt do anything, it doesn't overtake, it doesn't defend. Also this game is missing alot of features, for example a good weather system. It is missing a good penalty and flag system. It doensn't have race rules for any of the series. A racing engineer would be nice aswell.  The strongest an most important part of Assetto Corsa is the modability. This game was inspired by the very popular and amazing rFactor. This means that to play this game to its full potential you will need to mod it. The modding community is starting to increase and the number of high quality mods is increasing. By the time this game gets to its 6th year there will be mods for everything and everyone. So as I sayed before just give it some time for it to improve. "

			Views: 174		

			I earn the achievement 300kmh by falling the through the map! Scrub to 7:06 to the start of the death jump run.		

I hope I have the right URL.  This game is just great, Beautiful graphics, real physics and a slew of cars and tracks to choose from.  I found the menu system slightly convoluted and a bit tedious at times.  Setting up my wheel was simple enough to play but as a new sim-racer I've alot to learn.  My wheel is a DFGT and it's not in the best condition for some reason.  The video above shows a slight oops in the game map as I fall through the map at around 7 minutes and then proceed to earn a trophy for reaching 300kmh...as I'm falling through rmember.  At any rate I've alot to learn as a newb Sim racer and this game makes me want to learn more.			"

								Yes yes yes yes yes...Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ Coming from a lot of GTR, Race07 (with every possible pack and mod) there was a lot I had to get used to..BUT... Giving it a chance, spend a lot of time tweaking my ""feel"" I came out on something that feels way different from the Simbin titles that I used to play. Used to, because AC has become my goto race-sim and after spending more that 1000 hours in Race 07 that does say something! AC just feels way way better, different (you'll have to get used to it if you spend a lot of time in Simbin games) but better.. The visuals are a lot nicer too.. (haven't really played R3E, so I don't really know about the visuals in that) I have to add though: Visuals especially look nicer if you have an awesome rig (which I don't) and up until a few patches ago I had a lot of trouble getting a halfway decent fps... since the latest few patches there was so much improvement.. I actually have an 80-110 fps on an i3 with a gt630 in a 1920x1080 Resolution.. (before the game used to run fine for a bit then drop to the 14-ish fps, that's fixed now)So now it's playable (fps wise) all the time the game starts to put a big BIG grin on my face.Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ The mod-ding community is great and it's awesome that you can make your own mods. The best content in Rfactor 1 came from the community... so bring it on..Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ There is already quite some tracks made by mod-ers out there.. not all ""as good"" but all reasonable and most, if not all, still being developed (so you can actually give input, and they're being fixed if a patch might break them).. And there are some absolute jewels.. One I'd like to mention by name.. Nordschleife 1.1 from Snoopy... OK one more then.... Joux Plane (by Kegetys?),  But there is more really good mods  out there and the game isn't even final yet.Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞The physics are good both ffb-wise (they have a somewhat different approach from simbin titles or Rfactor, but give it a real chance, you'll see that it actually feels more like driving a car) as world physics-wise ie. how a car reacts to driving over a curb/bump.. This is the first sim that actually made me scout tracks for bumps etc.. because hitting a bump wrong is a problem, your car gets instable and the next corner might not go as anticipated, because there is still an unbalance in the car. The suspension is worked out in a lot of detail. A lot of things have been done with a refreshing new approach..Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ Also there is a lot of talk about the feeling of speed in the game being off.. Its actually spot on (It's most probably the first sim-race-game that does not exaggerate the sense of speed.. (also FOV settings are important))... (run the back-straight (yeah the curvy one) on the NS with close to 300 kph in a Zonda and you'll know what I mean, you feel you are going fast because you are.. 160 kph doesn't feel that fast IRL (sorta depends on where you do it, granted.... and maybe ""in what"" even more so.. but you know what I mean)It's the circumstances that make it feel fast and AC does exactly that. If you're driving 160 or even 200 on the German Autobahn while it's otherwise empty, it doesn't feel fast at all. The excitement in racing isn't in the excessive sense of speed.. but in going head to head and being faster then someone else within the confines of the same set of rules (physics). That is what it feels like on a track IRL and also in AC. The excitement lies in either driving on your own limits, and trying to improve on yourself, trying to scrape another 10th of a second of your time, hoping not to screw up that 3rd corner before the finish, and throwing away the progress you made on the rest of the track..  or in going head to head with someone or multiple ppl, having to move out of your comfortable line and overtake other ppl safely, just to find out on this particular corner the camber is bad and you're going to run out off grip a little sooner then you expected. Those are the real thrills of racing, not the speed. IRL you don't notice the speed after a few good laps. You know how fast you're going (Awareness) but it doesn't feel fast (Perception).. Also the fastest laps, the ones in which everything goes ""right"", usually don't ""feel"" fast at all.Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ Dev's do understand the meaning of the words challenge and achievement...... A challenge is really a challenge so an achievement actually feels like an achievement, which is refreshing in racegames (Never been so happy finally getting Silver.. and yeah I know there is still gold... maybe in a lot of time with a lot of practice who knows LOL) I don't always get a gold medal.. but when I do I'm gonna be sooooo happyDev's listen to the community... There is still a lot of noticeable development/improvement still going on. It IS still an early access game. BUT In a lot of ways it already feels completely mature.. there some things that are not finished yet.. but they don't stand in the way of enjoying the game as is...  AI for instance is still being improved, that doesn't mean they are not fun to ride with right now, just that they are made even better still. The way the shifter works is great.. you can by miss-coordination actually miss a gear which will slot back in at the right rpm. The engine stall on the other hand is not working as expected yet.. namely it doesn't.. even with auto-clutch off. but that doesn't matter once you're away anyway.. I suppose they didn't think that was important right now, but I do hope they integrate that later.Cars actually feel different from each-other.. more then in most racegames, power-steering actually feels like power-steering (light with less feedback, you still feels what the car is doing but it's watered down somewhat.. like.. eh .. power-steering)The more this game develops the bigger my grin gets.. Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞Also Japanese mountainroads (Akagi Mountain pass) and BMW E90 Drift is a seriously big grin-factorBut seriously it's a good game, and it only gets better (I hope, but they're on the right track IMO)			"

								Remarkably polished even at early access. It's lacking a bit when it comes to content, but what exists is very good, and the modding community is growing as well. This game has some of the best physics of any racing sim in my opinion, and I would definitely recommend it to any sim racer.			"

								Overall I enjoy the game and it has brilliant driving physics but I can not afford a steering wheel. People that have a steering wheel will have a big advantage over people who have to use controllers or the keyboard in this game. It is also very annoying that you can not set a clutch axis on a controller and puts you at a great disadvantage to anyone who has a wheel and pedals because of how poor the auto clutch is. "

								After only two days of owning this game, I've already fallen in love with it. The menus are beautiful and easy to navigate, the gadgets you get during races are perfect, the telemetry you get in the pits is awesome, setting up cars in the pits is great and tweaking racing settings to your liking is really easy and clear. Once you actually get into the game, the graphics are pretty good (much better inside I would currently say) and the driving physics are beyond anything I've ever seen. The game poses challenge not seen in racing games such as Forza or Grand Turismo; driving is hard. You will spin out, you will crash, but it's all so much fun. All in an alpha too! I can't wait for tomorrow's multiplayer update!Problems with the game:-Too many cars in a race can cause severe lag (I have a fairly good machine)-The racing line is not currently dynamic-Graphics could do with a bit of improvingThese things are sure to be fixed and added though. If anybody can find a problem with this game, it's themself. My one true complaint is that it's a bit pricy, but still worth it in the end.			"

Flawless compatibility with 3 screen setups.  Good selection of cars so far.  Track list needs to be improved but there's some great mods on the scene already and a bit of a mass migration of modders coming over from the rfactor community.  The future is looking bright.

								I was a bit intimidated moving from GRID/DIRT and even more arcadey drivers to this uber-sim, but it plays great with an XBOX controller and has enough training wheels to help get you going. I soon turned them off and discovered the thrill of seeing how close to the edge I could push the cars. Some are pretty unforgiving, but put yourself in a Lotus to start with and you'll be able to handle it a bit better.Content wise it is fair for the price. I look forward to a career mode and online racing, but until then there's enough to keep me busy. I hope they add some visual damage and other graphical niceties, but they've really focused on what counts. "

												Assetto Corsa has to be the best racing simulator I've ever played, you can really feel the momentum and aerodynamics of your vehicle, and the tracks have laser scanned features and imperfections, something other ""simulators"" fail to implement. It's endless fun to practice around tracks in the authentic vehicles the game has. It's great to be able to perfect driving skills and have an exhilarating time doing it; you really feel accomplished going around a track in a BMW M3 GT2 at substantial speeds. I'd have to say the best part of Assetto Corsa is that it is always improving with time and that I can see it aging like wine in the future, there is always new content to look forward to. I love this game, I'd highly recommend it, and a racing wheel if you can help it.			"

								I bought this game not long after it came out on steam. I loved it! I spent 12 hours on it in less than 2 weeks. Then an update came (somewhere around 0.72) and the game wouldnt let me go on track from there on after. I dont know if thats my computer, me being an idiot or the game being weird. This is a fantastic game and I would love to recommend it, but because of the runtime error every time i try to go on track it would just take me back to the home screen. Its a shame really, once this is fixed il do an update section on the comment.EDIT/UPDATEIt lives! After days of tweeking and fiddling and smacking my head on my desk repeatedly I managed to find a combonation of settings that my computer would chew and then spit out back at me!

								For those who don't have a wheel, I suggest to start by using the mouse (speed 0.50), and start with the Formula Tatuus Abarth at Nurburgring. You will immediately appreciate how good this simulator is, and the great feeling you get from the car. After that, slowly try out other cars (I love the Ferrari 458 S3). I have tried the XBox controller, too, but the mouse is much more accurate. Of course, now I'm buying a wheel! The feeling i get by driving, even only with a mouse, is amazing. Absolutely a must-have for PC racers.			"

												Update: (game V1.2.5)- Decided to delete all of that review. That was like version .6 or something (if you haven't played it back then, then some of this review will not make sense). But it's changed since then. Got a new, much better PC. And, wow. Everything seems better. Just the feel of the game is a little different, for the best. The car's handling is very nicely done. The major understeer is gone. The suspension feels nice, stiffer than back then, which is a very good improvment. Sounds, are great as they always been. So far, I've talked about mechanics. But now, content. This game is ever growing in content (some free, some DLC). A lot of street cars, which I personally enjoy over proper race cars, but that's just my cup of tea. Everything is great and all but, there is one little thing, that you can fix. But, it's an annoyance. It's the driving position in some of the cars. The game defaults, in some cars, on top of the steering wheel. Others, way down in the car. Even some aren't centered. Like I said, you can fix this in-game. It's just a little annoyance. And, the AI is inbetween for me. Yes, it's WAY better than .6 but it still isn't great. I assume it'll eventually work itself out. Otherwise, this game is great. It's getting there. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a good racing sim.			"

								This is the first racing game/driving simulator/whatsoever that really put a smile on my face. Messed up my round a bit but got the next corner perfectly, the car was just doing all the work and I could feel every single variation in all four wheels plus it all made sense. Now, I can't say if this IS realistic because I haven't driven a McLaren MP4-12C in real life like that yet, but I wish it is in case I get to do that. That's how good this game is (in short).Now to the negative points: `.) why is it so hard to get the car back under control even if it already has slowed down to 15 mph?.) No lamborghinis! :(That's about it... oh, wait: No shortcut controls for the replay function, either that or an export function would be nice.			"

Fantastic car physics, it's easy to get immersed in the experience of driving lap after lap, just for the enjoyment of driving around a track.  It's just about the driving in this game.  Feels like you are driving a real dynamic car, when using my logitech g27 wheel.  Although it is still early release, and it doesn't have all the content yet, the driving model feels complete.

I'm able to play hotlap all tracks with ultra settings on my ageing CPU/GPU at 2560x1600 I would imagine that the game will run fantastic on a modern machine. Happy to support these developers. They are truely experts.			"

Early Access Review
								I have a friend with whom I raced in an F1 2013 League some time ago. When somebody suggested Assetto Corsa to the league, he refused to consider it, and backed up this point by copying a whole page of bugfixes from the most recent update.More fool him.Kunos have done a utterly fantastic job on this game at the time of writing - that is, towards the end of the Alpha Phase. Not only that, but they've involved the community in their decisions, looked for feedback from those who play - In fact, I'd go so far as to say you should buy the game simply to help support the developer. But then you'd be missing out on the point; you'd be buying one of the best PC Racing Simulators out there today.-Overall  This is an Early Access Review, but in saying that, the game is close to flawless. The graphics are stunning. Each car is modelled perfectly. The tracks are all laser scanned. The feel of each car is individual. The force feedback for those with wheels, is immersive. In game sounds are gorgeous. The AI are being constantly improved, and they already far outstrip those in any of the other racing games I play. Possibly the largest asset, though, is the large and very active community, who are a source of advice, feedback, and, of course, an inexhausible supply of mods, which really make the content feel more complete. Overall, it's a wonderful Sim. There is not a car that's not easy to drive, within your limits - but when you begin to push, when you begin to look for the tenths through every corner, when you place the car on the ragged edge, brushing the barriers, feeling the back start to come loose, you will make mistakes. Of course. But that just makes success more intoxicating.-Content  Probably the major con when considering the game. Though each car is beautifully crafted and offers limitless opportunity for driving, there are only a small selection in the base game. There are also only a small number of different tracks, and sadly, a lot of the classics are missing at the moment. Kunos is a small developer, of course, so this is inevitable, but it means that Project Cars is a better choice for variety (Or buying a PS4 and GT5). That said, if you don't mind doing some modding, then there are an ever increasing selection of quality cars on Assetto's forums, or on RaceDepartment. There are few times I enjoy myself as much as when taking my DAMS GP2 car around the Monaco Street Circuit, and at those points everything except the apps are modded.   In short, a lack of variety, but this is remedied by the mods. Plenty of content there for anybody.-Realism This is an important factor for a Simulator, and boy, Assetto does it well. Everything is totally customisable. EVERYTHING. The setup options are fantastically complex, with handy tooltips for those of us without a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, and the wonderful thing is that changing every variable will make the car feel, and handle slightly differently. The game measures time increments of 1/250 seconds, so you can see those changes on the clock to, and it's very satisying to gain a tenth on the straight by increasing the tyre pressure slightly and getting an improved Vmax as a result.   You can customise the grip levels on track - there are a number of preset options in terms of the amount of rubber laid down at the beginning of the session, and the grip will increase as you lap the track, with a racing line corresponding to the average line taken becoming visible as the session progresses.  You can really feel the car changing through the session - it takes a significant amount of time for tyres and brakes to get up to operating temperatures on the faster cars, but there's a massive improvement when you do - and tyre wear is realistically handled, and something that you really don't want to be on the recieving end of.  There's more as well, I promise, but I do need to move onto other sections of the review :')-Singleplayer  There are a number of different options to spend time on, each of which is devoted to a different discipline.   The practice mode is for getting to know a track, or a car, and just putting in some laps, helping tune setups, changing wheel settings, or just generally screwing around.   The Drift mode does what it says on the tin. You drift. Not much more to it than that. Extra points for combining drifts, and drifting for longer, or harder. Fun, but a novelty.   The Race mode allows you to pit any cars against each other, and it offers you a lot of flexibilty in terms of the race weekend - qualifying? Practice? Session lengths? You choose.  The Hotlap mode is for when you're really getting serious. Boost that ambient temperature, boost the track grip, take a nice fast car, and set a faster time than your friends.  Lots of modes for lots of variety, lots of things to do, but in the end you're more likely to end up playing Multiplayer.-Multiplayer  It's a mixed bag, this. The multiplayer itself is excellent. You can choose any selection of cars, and any track (Including modded ones, which is really nice), and go out. The connections are reliable, the lag is minimal, and if you have friends you enjoy racing with, who are of a similar speed, then it can get fantastically competetive. You can apply the same level of customisation to this as you can to single player - all of the variables are controlled by the server host, but the key is that they're all controllable.  That all said, actually setting up a dedicated server is tricky. There are a lot of processes that you need to run through, including port forwarding, and then running the server is heavy on bandwidth and also PC resources.  That aside, it's wonderful fun, and when leagues start to run, then I'm sure a whole new aspect will really kick off. (Speaking of leagues, sign up here if you're interested: wtwr.enjin.com)-Conclusion  There's not really a whole lot more to say. I know Kunos have got some more stuff coming - not because I'm an insider, because they're open and forthcoming, with Forums and Social Media that are in regular use. I know that the first non-alpha release will be coming soon. I know also that it's expensive - indeed, I waited until it was 50% off before buying it. If I went back now, though, given what I know, I'd gladly pay full price for it. It's brilliant. Utterly brilliant. And if you don't have it, you're missing out.			"

								great game, nice driving experience, would highly recommend, couple of areas i think it could do with improvment, the tire sim needs some work i was doing dougnuts and heated the tires up to 700C hot enough to melt metal let alone rubber that cant be right. should they burst or something, the control pad i am using is either to sensitive and slightly over steers and the wheel in the car looks all eratic and when its less sensitive and the graphics do match the movement the understeer is unbareable the whole control pad area needs work as it assumes wheel/custom when there should be one for non xbox Control pads as well ""Generic/FFB Pad"" .. the currect ""wheel/custom"" only detects accelleration on a axis as its expecting pedals I guess rather then game pad buttons, the car damage could be a bit better too. when you crash it looks like some ones been pounding on your car with a small hammer and sanding it with 240 grit and it does not look briliant all these things are no big thing and Assetto is still one of the best car sims yet, I hope they deal with the issues i mention and add more car tuning related stuff for the game			"

								After 18 hours of gametime I can well and trully say I AM IMPRESSED!My first impressions (first couple of hours) were however, different!Been simming for a fair while.GTR2,GTREVO,RFACTOR,RACE07,RFACTOR2,NKP and a little time recently in iracing (i think my year sub will go to waste now  i got this)Instant impression the word ""simcade"" sprang to mind, reason being is it was pretty easy for somebody like me to jump in and drive pretty fast, id say 8/10ths, but pushing past that (much like irl..) it looses all its cadeyness (for lake of a better word) and stands ouit as the best of all the current offering IMHO.All other current sims (and most past ones) seem to suffer from a dilloema, they are really good until you push the envelope,once you start missing breaking markers and doing things you CAN do IRL, they fall flat, especially low speed handling and slide control.AC is freaking fantastic! No its not noobforspeed, but you can control slides better and more realistically than any other sim ive ever driven!FFB is amazing! Nothing else can touch it in terms of knowing what both ends of the car are doing through the wheel.I havent smiled so much playng anything for such a long time.Results MAY vary, I run a fantec wheel and i have been told they are the best supported wheels, partership with fanatec or something? So maybe if you use a logitec,thrustmaster or somethign else you may not get the same results.Maybe one day ill dig out my trusty old g25 baack-up wheel and see what its like, right now im having far too much fun for that!Its still ind evelopment so its not perfect, it lacks some features , liek extremely well organized leagues and rules ala iracing, but I feel that is somethign that will come, they already have a penalty system that slows you down if you drop too many wheels of (stopping cutting etc) and i8m pretty sure if you spin as well, so its ahead of everythign else bar iracin g on thaqt front IMHO.Destroys iracing in the fact that its a ONE TIME PURCHASE and allows modding, YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HAH!Looks and runs very nice for me 1080p single screen with a dated gtx570oc,i7@4ghz and 32gb quad channel ddr3 1866.Im sure things like dynamic track surface and weather are on the cards for the future.11/10 from me.

								First review for a game on Steam and thought what better than to review Assetto Corsa.I'm reviewing this game for a few reasons.1.) I think it's amazing and I've really enjoyed being part of this early access journey.2.) I need to explain to people what is good, what is or was bad and why it's worth your hard earned dosh3.) Just to share my feelings on this sim.First off, this sim has amazing graphics. When it first came out I was amazed but as they've added extra bells and whistles I've had to turn some features down a bit. I'm running a pretty modest machine with an i7 3770k (un-clocked), with 8GB Ram and a Palit GTX780 card so thought it would stand up against some pretty special titles but alas, I feel the need of a second card coming to truly max this title.The feeling of the cars is amazing too. I remember before they had AI, before they had multiplayer, that you just had the car and an empty track and it was, FUN! Not had that in a racing title for a while. Although I also own rFactor 2 and that is from a similar ilk.Secondly, this is a WIP, (work in progress). I cannot stress this enough as some of the reviews or comments I've read about this sim seem to think that it's the finished article. People are so impatient these days and want everything yesterday. What's wrong with jumping on board a project, (for a reduced title fee), and getting involved with helping shape the title into what you really want.The team have already provided an amazing experience and I believe it will get better.The have added multiple cars, tracks and opened the doors to modding as we've seen on previous titles such as rFactor.Lastly, just in a nutshell, it's a great title and one that I believe I will be playing for years to come. It's worth every penny if you love racing games and honing your skills on a track day after day.The varied tracks and car combinations are more than enough and are all faithfully reproduced into a proper next gen racing sim package. Everything sounds and looks amazing and to top it all off, it handles like a proper sim too.Beauty and Brains, this is the racing sim that all others will be compared to.This is a racing sim by racing sim fans and is currently being developed with racing sim fans taking part in the beta. It's not over yet.			"

And Assetto Corsa was there to give it to me that !The customization of cars is great, and it gives an overall realistic feel ! The tracks are laser scanned, the cars are extremely detailed (tho it's not that easy to drive them all), and the driving experience is one I've never dreamed of getting out of a game ! Tho it's still early access and is lacking of variety of cars and tracks, it makes you forget it, once you start playing.Career is pretty good (as by now, I've heard it wasn't before), it's a good challenge, and multiplayer is great, when your race is not ruined by someone intentionally !

												what is there to say about this game? you will enjoy it you will hate it, i played this game since it was in alpha, im still no good at it. i would recomend you get the steering wheel for your computer to play this game to its fullest, have a good graphic card, it used all of mine and still needs more graphics power to run smoothly, then again it is running better now then when i first bought it last year or longer. Of course i would recomend this to my friends but thats because we like all types of games and this is so far the best racing/ driving simulator on PC, the drifting is a bit difficult and you cant do burnouts with out a break pettle, gas pettle and a clutch, but if you have all of that, it is worth every penny.

Even if you aren't into either but still like the classics like Need for Speed for the thrill of just driving a race car around for a change of pace; consider, look into, tell some friends or buy this game. The dedication the devs give to this title compared to other greenlight projects COUGH COUGH PROJECT RIP OFF CARS COUGH COUGH sorry that was a bad one, should be commended if nothing else for the history of video gaming to understand and know.Great graphics, great sound, LASER SCANNED TRACKS, real world gravity, weights etc you get the gist.

When it first came out I was amazed but as they've added extra bells and whistles I've had to turn some features down a bit. I'm running a pretty modest machine with an i7 3770k (un-clocked), with 8GB Ram and a Palit GTX780 card so thought it would stand up against some pretty special titles but alas, I feel the need of a second card coming to truly max this title.The feeling of the cars is amazing too. I remember before they had AI, before they had multiplayer, that you just had the car and an empty track and it was, FUN! Not had that in a racing title for a while. Although I also own rFactor 2 and that is from a similar ilk.Secondly, this is a WIP, (work in progress). I cannot stress this enough as some of the reviews or comments I've read about this sim seem to think that it's the finished article. People are so impatient these days and want everything yesterday. What's wrong with jumping on board a project, (for a reduced title fee), and getting involved with helping shape the title into what you really want.The team have already provided an amazing experience and I believe it will get better.The have added multiple cars, tracks and opened the doors to modding as we've seen on previous titles such as rFactor.Lastly, just in a nutshell, it's a great title and one that I believe I will be playing for years to come. It's worth every penny if you love racing games and honing your skills on a track day after day.The varied tracks and car combinations are more than enough and are all faithfully reproduced into a proper next gen racing sim package. Everything sounds and looks amazing and to top it all off, it handles like a proper sim too.Beauty and Brains, this is the racing sim that all others will be compared to.This is a racing sim by racing sim fans and is currently being developed with racing sim fans taking part in the beta. It's not over yet.			"

												An amazing graphical experience.  Physics are great as well but I wouldn't say it's the BEST racing experience I've had.  Mods are very simple to download and install from racedepartment or anywhere online.  Tons of tracks and a lot of really fun cars to drive.  Definitely worth trying if you are into cars and racing.  Even a keyboard can make good lap times, but of course best with a wheel or controller at least.			"

												Assetto Corsa is a great racing game to look into. Especially when going on sale. Although the content is a little light, you will be glad to know that this game is hugly supported by the modding community. So you can get many cars and tracks for free without needing DLC. which is great, because adding DLC and free modding content makes the game more enjoyable and freshSome of the negative is controller support and setting up driving settings can be a pain. The menu is boring and kind of off. Sometimes the sound is a little wierd. single player mode is a little dissapointing. the veritey of cars are pretty bad and moslty euro cars not many asain or american cars (from the base verison no dlc or mods)With all that said i still think its a great game and a must have for any racing fan. I would recommend this game espcially for wheel users as well.			"

Early Access Review
								This is easily the most realistic car simulator I have ever seen/played. It very well may be the most realistic racing sim on the planet. 10/10 Perfect game. Well well worth the money. I bought a Thrustmaster TX racing wheel to play this game.As a side note, I must say that although Assetto Corsa gives you access to almost every control parameter possible, it can still be difficult to get your settings right. The cars can become incredibly hard to handle if you have stability control at 0%, for instance. I assume this is how the cars would act in real life, though, and the preciseness of this game makes you miss the g-forces from real life driving to help you control.Someday, I will get an Oculus Rift and try it out with this game (yes, it supports it). I think it might help a lot to have depth perception.BUY THIS GAME.			"

												So i have owned this game since early access and felt that maybe its time for a review...In many ways racing games reflect their studio's location, Tursimo has always been very Japanese oriented, Forza is quite American oriented and things like ToCa/GRiD, Project Cars, Race 07 all have a very European style to them. Asseto Corsa is no different, it makes no secret of being Italian and from the cars to the tracks to its overall identity. It draws from it in all the best ways. Thankfully Italy has no shortage of both great cars and great tracks. From the Abarth 500 to the best from Ferrari, the cars are both diverse and perfectly represented in incredable detail. The tracks as well show the diversity of the country's selection as F1 locals like Monza and Imola are the marquee tracks, the lesser known tracks like Magione and Vallelunga, with even a delightful fantasy track through the desert mountians. Of course all of that is irrelevent if the game cant do it once you get out on the track and get driving. This is the area where AC really proves its chops to go against all the aformentioned racing genre classics. The assists make the game accessable but as you improve and start peeling them away to a more simulation experience is when the game comes alive and you feel like less of a passenger and more like a master pilot blasting through the forests of Monza or the Nurburgring. In all the time i have been playing this game the only thing i have ever had to complain about is among the most minor of issues, there is no pause button mapped to the controller by default and no way to assign it. That said, once i get racing, i honestly dont want to stop anyways, so i guess it doesnt matter much in the end.			"

												I bought this game solely to go with my new steering wheel and setup. This game lacks cars unless you buy the car packs, but even then the Career mode will last you many many hours. Awesome game, easy to setup and get playing, closest thing to ""racing"" that you can find in my opinion. Perfect game for wheel setups, and looks really good as well.			"

												  I bought AC planning to play it like a Forza/Gran Turismo kind of sim game, where you sit on the couch close to the screen, grab your high precision controller (DS4 in my case) and race like there's no tomorrow. Hopefully, there would even be a well designed, well paced career mode for me to get lost in.  I play it like that, and it´s absolutely brilliant. If it´s what you want, and you don´t mind not having hundreds of cars to choose from, then Assetto Corsa is the best there is (as judged against GT6, Forza 4, PCars, Grid Autosport and iRacing, which are the best recent ones I´ve played).

This game might be a bit expensive, but dont be fooled by a lack of options as this game is early access and hasnt been finished yet. I highly recommend getting this game while it is 40 dollars, not 80 when it is fully released. This game has excellent graphics and sound quality.

								AC is the best racing sim I've played in over 20 years of racing. The new RC1.0 update delivered a ton of content including a fairly basic career mode, adding to the existing special events, time attacks and multiplayer. The graphics and sound got a big overhaul and the game looks amazing (i7 4.6, GTX780) and is by far the best sounding racing game I've ever played.If you've got an Oculus Rift then plug it in because AC is amazing in VR. Apart from non-existent GUIs and car setups (and you can't race time attacks in the rift), it is a next-gen experience to race AC in VR. It is buttery smooth, very impressive due to the visuals pointing to some seriously optimised code.AC does have controller support (not full) but if you don't have a wheel then don't worry about buying, a wheel is essential to the experience.Lastly, this game has mod support so you can race F1 cars or go to your favourite tracks from other games and locations.

												This game was my replacement to Forza on the 360. Ive done away with console and my first experience on this game was tramatizing. I hated it and could't set up my xb1 controller to feel right and after much frustration I went on to other games and let it sit for almost a month. eventually I wanted to get into it and looked up other racers settings that play with a controller and then everything changed. Like a junkie I'm hooked on this game and the feeling of acomplishment is overwhealming once you find your settings and start winning races! You probably would prefer a wheel for this game but I don't have one, from grip race to drifting tandem it can be done with a controller. Laser scanned tracks are my absolute favorite part of this game, you need the ring or yours missing out.			"

												I don't know what to write so here it is about heel and toe:Drivers use the ""heel and toe"" method to smoothly combine braking and downshifting as they approach a corner. Good drivers know that blipping the throttle between gears in a downshift to speed up the engine to match the tire speed keeps the wheels from locking and stops the back end from getting loose. Heel-and-toeing simply combines blipping the throttle with braking. On early European sports and racing cars with a central throttle, the pedals were set up so the driver could use the ball of his right foot on the brake and the heel of the same foot on the gas. On modern cars, the driver uses the right side of his foot to blip the gas and the left side of the same foot to push the brake. Done correctly, your foot pivots quickly on its ball, giving a rapid blip to the throttle with the right side while the left provides steady pressure on the brake.			"

												So, I'm going to base this review on someone who grew up playing the Gran Turismo games, specifically GT3 and GT5, with that out of the way; I'll talk about Assetto Corsa now.I really love the quality control and time put into the game, what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality, rather than some racer games giving you 50+ cars and massive amounts of race tracks, Assetto Corsa doses you with small portions of cars and real-life race tracks. From what I hear, they take some sort of car with a scanner on it, drive it around the track and put it into the game, I like to imagine they put the same amount of time into the cars of this game as well. I recently got into this game after feeling nostalgic for drifting around the Tsukuba Circut in GT5 and I have to say it's the closest you can get to a proper Gran Turismo game on PC. I've tried many other racing games in an attempt to capture what made GT so great, and I think I've found it in Assetto Corsa. It has vast amounts of settings to play with, beautiful graphics, amazing sound design and a very flexible UI that lets you customize every little aspect of your racing experience. Don't like how you sit in a car? You can change that! Don't like your racer's arms? A little odd, but you can remove them! Want to create gigantic plumes of smoke when you drift? Too bad. (Even with the ambient temperature set to 36 Celsius I fail to make anything but little puffs of smoke)Now, some things that upset me!Unless you pick a legitimate race car, drift car, or step 1 car, there's really nothing you can do to fiddle with how it handles. Sure, you can toy with the brakes, and suspension, and sometimes the tires! But you don't get custom colours, you don't get to change the rims, nothing. I've tried for hours on getting the Nismo Tuned 370Z to slide, but no matter what I do, I just can't seem to get it right. I constantly find myself going back to the BMW M3 Drift tuned car to satisfy my angular needs. I previously talked about the minor problem I have about this game, and that's why I can overlook it. I'm wanting to do things in this game that the Developers don't intend you to do. This is a racing sim, not a simcade poop racer, so it makes sense that I can't have a bright pink Toyota Supra with flashy rims. The ""BMW Ferrari Porsche-to-everything-else"" ratio is crazy. If you add up all the praised Euroformancemobiles and stack them against the other cars, you'll be like ""Wow, someone's a little biased to BMW""All in all, Assetto Corsa does a great job being a competant racing game on PC, it's pretty much the only one I like. Just ask me what I think of The Crew, actually; Nevermind. Just read my review on that one. Get this game if you're interested in getting into some really great sim racing, if you're also coming from Gran Turismo, this will be a great transition to PC racing games. Only complaint I have is that it's not more like Gran Turismo. (You can't own cars or customize them with different performance parts) But then again, that's not even supposed to be an option, so I can't fault the Devs on that. I highly recommend this game, on a controller or on a racing wheel, you'll have tons of fun in this racing game. "
