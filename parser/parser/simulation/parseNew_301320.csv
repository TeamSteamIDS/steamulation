												First off: this is not a game, if you're a fan of the Rollercoaster Tycoon games this might not be for you. It's a simulation and a tool made for people who may already have a wider knowlage of roller coasters. It has no park management features like Rollercoaster Tycoon. Nolimits often requires a quite in-depth understanding of rollercoaster engineering, physics and a passion for theme parks and roller coasters. If you're a Rollercoaster Tycoon player who wants to try something new, try the demo first.Pros:Realistic-This is the most realistic design tool for roller coasters. It's not just stunning in terms of visuals, it's full of tiny details that enthusiasts can all recognise and appreciate.Massive improvement from NL1-Everything in the editor has been vastly improved, you could spend hours just fixing g-force spikes and bumps that aren't apparent in the editor. The G-force comb is nothing short of glorious, it allows you to fully finetune rides to perfection without the need for other software like Newton.Improved terrain editor-The simple addition of tunnels make this many times better than NL1.Verity-NL2 has more coaster types than you're likely to master. Classic corkscrew coasters to B&M diving coasters, this simulation has everything. I would have liked to see more family style coasters though.Scripting-This is probably the biggest advance for NL2, it makes coaster extremely flexible, though it has some problems I'll mention later.Station improvements-The addition of dueling stations and tandem stations is very helpful for creating realistic rides.Control panel-In NL1 controlling the ride was pretty much pressing the f9-11 keys, now it's fully functional and allows you to control individual block segments. It's surprisingly fun to operate rides in the simulation, some people have even made their own physical USB control panels. Unfortunately for the people building their own controls, there is a lack of hotkeys for operation, all block controls must be controlled with the mouse (but this isn't much of a loss).Cons: Itâ€™s important to be honest, there are some serious problems which aren't fixable but could potentially ruin your experience of NL2. No lessons learned from Newton-When people are forced to use other software for the actual design of a ride, there's a problem. The NL1 editor was very hard to use if you were building a coaster from scratch with no help from programs like Newton; NL2 has somewhat eliminated the need for Newton but a combination of Newton's perfectly smooth curve and the already amazing editor would have been beyond perfect.Scripting-It's a gift wrapped with a lock and chains. If you have difficulty wrapping your head around scripting transfer tracks and switches, you're screwed. Like with Newton, the NL community has made some software to make scripting easier but it simply isn't enough. (What would have been perfect is a second scripting method based of placeable triggers, It would be less flexible but certainly easier to use).And that's pretty much it.Would I recommend NL2 to the average steam user? No.Would I recommend NL2 to fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon fans? Maybe.Would I recommend NL2 to roller coaster enthusiasts? Absolutely.			"

												While I only have a hundred hours of playtime on the Steam version, I've poured many more into the standalone version.-----------------------------------------------------------------Is this game for me?First off, it's worth knowing that this is not a game, but a simulator. If this interests you, then NoLimits 2 will be a good choice. Your enjoyment of NoLimits 2 is likely bound to how many of these items apply to you: In RollerCoaster Tycoon, you loved the coaster building process the most You're a coaster enthusiast You enjoy simulation games even if you don't ""play"" them avidly You're the creative type who enjoys a blank canvas or a sandbox with no goals or restrictionsIn addition, if these apply to you, then you should probably just get this now. They do not apply to me, but having either of these skills opens up immense opportunities in NoLimits 2: You love 3D modeling You love programmingIf 2 of those bullet points match you, then I'd maybe pick up the game on sale, as you may still enjoy it but perhaps won't sink tons of hours into it. Do note that NoLimits 2 has never gone on sale for anything more than 20%, so don't expect deep discounts on Steam sales.If 3 of those bullet points match you, then you might enjoy NoLimits 2 as a casual user. If you're the type that just likes to check out the simulation, as well as how insanely creative/detailed people are, there's plenty to download and explore with the Steam workshop and fan websites. You may find yourself tinkering with building your own coasters, but some may lose interest given the vast array of tools at your disposal.If 4 or more of those bullet points match you, then I would recommend this game at full price.-----------------------------------------------------------------Comparison with Theme Park StudioThose in the market for a theme park/roller coaster simulator may have heard of Theme Park Studio - an early access project almost directly competing with NoLimits 2. However, I still feel this as though this is the superior product.It seems both NL2 or TPS have rather hefty learning curves. Both feature loads of tools and things to learn. To me, neither is easier than its competing counterpart. After that, it really comes down to how the rest stacks up.In NL2, you're getting arguably better graphics, far more accurate physics, and a *much* more polished product. This is a finished game, with ""free DLC"" updates along the way; in fact, the new wing coaster trains just debuted a week ago at the time of this review.In TPS, you're getting easier functions to build a park, and animated guests, but I feel like the advantages stop there. In NL2, it's a little less integrated, but it's still not that hard to make a path. Some simply paint the ground in asphault, while others have created path-building kits to add as scenery. Adding flat rides built by others just requires adding the scenery object (script is typically already attached). I think TPS's selling point was that in NL2 it was ""nearly impossible"" to do these things but it's really not.I really wish TPS ended up being good. It's always nice to have something new and awesome coming along but it's just not there yet. Maybe in the future it will eventually become worthy of it's purchase price, but as of now I really wouldn't spend any money on it.-----------------------------------------------------------------Personal opinion time:For me and many others, this is the absolute benchmark for accurate roller coasters. The level of intricacy with which someone can design their dream ride is unparalleled by any other software. As with anything this realistic, there is a learning curve that comes with the program if you wish to design your own. However, compared to NoLimits 1, the rate at which new users are becoming proficient truly speaks for how well the new track building system is. Some of the amazing works you'll see on YouTube, the Workshop, and NL fansites were created by people who just picked up the game a couple months ago.Now, would I recommend this game to those don't plan to build? If you're a roller coaster fanatic, I'd still say yes. With Steam's integration you can download other tracks with absolute breeze. Plus there's other options to further satisfy your hunger for rides: sites like NoLimits-Exchange.com and CoasterCrazy.com provide an excellent abundance of things to download to your heart's desire.This is as real as it gets... for the most part. If realism isn't your forte, go make that 1000 ft tall mountain racer you've always wanted. If you can build it, the simulation will always run it.But perhaps the best part is the realism. The fact that some recreations get within inches of their real-life counterparts just shows the level of detail with which you can sculpt the rails. And for some, having that dead-on accuracy makes each ride feel as though they could be built into real life. You can build your dream ride, watch it go, and truly imagine it existing at your favorite amusement park so long as you could print out blueprints. That feeling is truly awesome and cannot be replaced IMO.			"

												Okay, so you are curious about buying this product? If yes, please read this before making your decision.1. NoLimits 2 is a fantastic piece of software, yeah, software, because, according to the makers, they are targeting realism now and they prever to call it a simulation-program. Keep in mind this ISIN'T RollerCoaster Tycoon or Thrillville.2. You can't be a sadistic a-hole and watch people die, 2 reasons: there aren't any peeps in the entire simulation, just steel, wood and foliage. The second reason is that you can't crash a coaster, if it hit's the end of the open track it just displays and error stating that the coaster has crashed.3. If you want to make rollercoasters, of course you do, you have to learn it. It's not that you build gorgeous tracks within the first hour, propably not even after 10 hours of learning. There aren't track-pieces like RollerCoaster Tycoon, it's more CAD-style based, just open air. Actually it's an editor where you can design almost anything inside.4. You can add buildings, etc. to it, but you have to make them in a program like SketchUp, 3DSMAX, etc. Than you have to export -> import them. As you see, this is not a game for people who don't have patient, this is a quality program which is rather serious. (Although they have an annual April fools joke on the news-website)If you like building rollercoasters and would invest some time in it to use the same software as some of the professionals use, don't hasitate and buy this gorgeous piece of art!!! If you like rollercoasters to ride them, buy it also, on the market-place and other sources like coastercrazy, nolimits-exchange, etc. you can have an almost unlimited supply of coaster-food. Do you want to build coaster in the simple RollerCoaster Tycoon site and don't want to learn how you make proper creations, yeah, better spend your money on something better. Although this software just deserves to be bought anyways.			"

												NoLimits 2 is a very relaxing yet thrilling game where you get to ride and build your very own roller coasters! The game itself is lovely with a lot of things to play around with, the biggest one being the editor. This game concentrates more on the ride itself and less on the surroundings while most other games let you build your own parks with pre-built rides this game lets you create your own from scratch or by editing other rides. Positives: +Creative.+Very pretty.+Lots of options.+Very in depth editor with lots and lots of options.+Easy to understand tutorials in written and video form.+Audio is incredibly realistic.+Oculus Rift support.+Lots of ways to move around (walking, flying ext.)+Very large areas to build so you can build a lot of rides in one park+Controls are easy to use. Negatives: -Fly camera is buggy when you fly too fast.-Weird frame drops in random areas.-Not that many building options so your parks are going to be just rides.-Price tag I think can be lowered a bit.Overall I rate this game an  8/10  for the amout of content and creativity in this game it's 100% worth your time, but try to pick it up on sale.

												NoLimits 2 is such a fun community to be a part of! Rollercoaster enthusiasts have been waiting a long time until a proper rollercoaster game. NoLimits actually uses the same software that real rollercoaster engineers use to create their screaming behemoths. How cool is that!? That being said, the game does have a learning curve. It will take a while to master, buts itâ€™s one of those games thatâ€™s well worth the time in trying to learn! Even though the game is billed as a rollercoaster simulator, you can even build whole theme parks! The easiest way being able to import your own .3ds models into the game. If you can't find any you like online or you are not good at creating them yourself, there are tutorials online in how to use the games supports system to create buildings and objects. Do not feel overwhelmed at first for there are tutorials all over to help get a handle on the program. It may take some time to create an amazing coaster/park, but seeing these engineering marvels standing tall over your beautiful landscape is well worth it. I recommend any rollercoaster enthusiast to try the game out! "

												I bought this game because I liked roller coasters and wanted to create my own, but as soon as you open the editor in the program, you have no idea what to do, it looks extremely complicated. I can't even get my head around everything yet. If you haven't played this game before, you need to be patient and don't expect to be able to bulid an amazing roller coaster 2 a few minutes after purchasing it. Read tutorials and start with the basics and then get into the more advanced tutorials. This game is not like the RollerCoaster Tycoon series at all. But overall the graphics and roller coasters are extremely life-like and if you know what to do is a great experience.			"

I'm happy now. :)Stop reading this and download the demo, NOW!			"

												I gotta say. After optimizing the graphics settings to eliminate the minor stutter and judder (which obviously is a necessity for a complete immersion with the DK2), this simulator alone is worth the entire DK2 system. The massive community with user created tracks that keeps rolling in, the opportunity to design the coaster of your dream down to a molecular level, makes for a truly mindbending experience. This simulator is worth every penny, even without the DK2 system. It truly shines in every single aspect. Highly recommended! Pros :+ Level of creational flexibility+ Graphics/visual fidelity+ Realistic sound effects+ Physx/realism+ Huge community+ High frequency of shared custom created coasters+ Newly added DK2 support that is no more than ""mindbendingly"" immersiveCons :I honestly cannot think of any!10/10			"

												The must have for every roller coaster and theme park enthusiast and even professional of the industry!The possibilities of building coasters are almost endless. Many good looking coaster styles are included and new were added by free updates already.You can even import your own 3d models (created with third party 3d modelling software) and build a whole themed area around you coaster or even a whole theme park with several coasters and rides.Thanks to the powerful scripting language that has much in common with many popular programming languages you can take over the coasters control logic for your personal needs or make your imported 3d models ""alive"": from triggered animatronics and operational flatrides to airplanes that fly above your theme park, there're virtually no limits for what can be done with that.

												No Limits Roller Coaster 2 is the ultimate roller coaster simulator in my own opinion! The editor features a built-in g-force calculator which is useful to shape the track correctly, and the track is easily smooth with the depump vertices tool. The simulator is really well done, the graphics are stunning and the rider view effect is very realistic. The possibilities are basically infinite!One with skill could with some effort create their own Leviathan with the same high quality as the professionals. It however requires time and patience to create the perfect layout, but the result outcome is worth it. I've rode so many times the first roller coaster I've made because you feel like you are actually riding it! Creating supports is a little time consuming but you can actually save time by creating your own support prefabs.Obviously, this software is considered as a game only for roller coaster lovers. Otherwise, you better play Roller Coaster Tycoon games if you prefer the money/human management.			"

												This is probably the best roller coaster simulator available on the consumer level. Not only does it just simulate a single coaster, you have many coasters to choose from and in some cases, a whole park is simulated including some non-coaster type of rides (all of which can be ridden.) Also simulated are the fully functioning storage sheds and switch tracks which allow you to move trains into or out of circulation.If simply riding coasters isn't enough, you can also design, build, and ride your own custom coasters and share them with the community.All-in-all, this roller-coaster simulator is a must have for anyone interested in designing, building, and/or riding coasters from the comfort of their own home.

												I am really impresssed with the game. I still have a few things to learn, like how to make a launch, but it is still my favorite game of all time. The rollercoaster editor is VERY easy to use, but it just takes a little time. So, do not sit down, play it for 5 minutes, and say, ""The roller coaster editor is too hard for me."" It takes time to learn.  Pros:  1. Great graphics                    2. Realistic roller coasters                    3. Easy coaster editor                    4. Easy custom scenery importing Cons:  NONE!Overall, I recommend playing this game. This game just blew my mind.			"

												Honestly I'm upset with anyone who dares to give this masterpiece of a rollercoaster editing program a negative review. I've read most of them and it seems that they're complaining about either of these two things:- The VR triggers motion sickness- The editor is very complex and thus has a steep learning curve.I wouldn't have any issues with these two complaints, had they been properly built and supported with valid reasoning. However, that's not the case. Not at all.Of course the VR will trigger motion sickness for some people, because this is a rollercoaster simulator. If you have a weak stomach in terms of consistent movements, don't buy this game. This should have been obvious before you bought the game in the first place.Listen, if you're in doubt whether to buy this game or not, consider that this is a complex rollercoaster simulator that professional coaster designers use. Most of the community is very passionate about rollercoasters and standards are high. Don't let that scare you off though, instead watch a bunch of tutorials online if you find the editor to be too difficult. You can even choose which path you want to take. You can go with hand building, or math building. I personally could never really find myself within hand building, so i picked math building, which suits me so much better. This is a game with a steep learning curve, but with an amazing reward factor. When you've built your rollercoaster and you look at the finished product, you'll certainly be satisfied. No other rollercoaster simulator game can compare to this one when it comes to actively building rides and enjoying the beautiful graphics.  "

A - This is NOT A GAME, its a simulation and software, and B - It has a very steep learning curve. If you've never used this before you will spend hours learning the software. However, once you learn, this becomes an addiction that is hard to kick. Constantly improving your rides, building new rides, making parks, and sharing your creations with the fantastic community.

												Incomplete Review going to update throughout the week. First off this is not a park management game like the RCT series. This is a simulator specifically for roller coasters. No limits 1 was the most successful rollercoaster simulator on the consumer market but 8 years ago was when the makers announced NoLimits 2. NoLimits 2 was out at the beginning of 2014 and I was just amazed at the detail and new features. This simulator has astonishing details and physics. Now for my review I'll start with the editor (I will compare with the original NoLimits 1). Editor: The editor in NoLimits 2 is really advanced and lets you do a lot more than NoLimits 1. First they introduced scripting which allows you to go beyond the limits of what's in the editor. But as with going with track placement, they are still doing the spline based track placement. But it has changed since NoLimits 1 as it's based off of vertexs and control polygons. The supports are the same as NoLimits 1 where it's just a single spline and node. One of my favorite features is the new import options, NoLimits 1 was stuck with .3ds formats but NoLimits 2 allows for Obj. formats which are far superior. the new editor also has a build in FVD tool and allows math formulas.

												*huurrrrgkk*I bought this to help with my fear of heights/rollercoasters. I've only ever been able to do the 'kid rides'(shout-out to Space Mountain and It's a Small World!) so this was quite a large step for me.10/10 I'm still terrified. Hopefully with time I become less afraid but for now all I can do is feel sick and shout from the top of my lungs, 'WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS!? WHY IS THIS FUN!? WHY!?'You might be wondering why I'm recommending this even though I'm still scared and freak out. The game works well with my Oculus and delivers a convincing rollercoaster experience minus the wind, crowds, and vomit from the person next to you who shouldn't be on the ride to begin with.I feel the the price is a little high and would honestly say that this was about $10 more than what I would have liked to pay.

												No Limits 2 is hands-down the best roller coaster program I've used. It has a nearly endless seeming list of new features, most of which make things a whole lot easier than No Limits 1. There really is no competition. It's like comparing school cafeteria food to Olive Garden. It took 8 years but it was worth the wait.I really like how much easier the building system is compared to NL1. That's one of my favorite things about NL2. That combined with auto-heartlining the track, I feel like I can build any sequence of curves how I want, in any shape. I don't really feel the need to look back or live in the past.The graphics, while not a top priority for me, were made with TLC. The terrain editing, environments, and tree models pretty much encourage the user to make the most of it, particularly if they're designing a terrain coaster.The combs, while not exact, give an indication of how I'm doing at making the ride survivable and smooth, and help take away more of the artificial difficulty that NL1 had. Having multiple viewports is slightly awkward but I can watch the G's of one viewport while watching the radii in the other. With this much in the way of new features to aid in smooth design, I feel like I can comfortably stick with hand-building, not even think about touching FVD++ (no offense Lenny). I really wanted to make smooth, heart-lined track and be able to easily adjust earlier portions at will if needed, and now I can.The NL2MAT editor is pretty complicated for me, and I'm not sure if any adequate tutorials for that exist. Of course, scripting is even more complicated for me. I really like the scripting engine allows one to use custom trains. In fact, the attachment script is so versatile one can use it for custom trains, attaching headlights, automobiles, Tin Lizzies-type rides, Raging Rapids River Rides, etc. And this is just one little script. Too bad the scripting language is too complicated for most users.As awesome as this program is, there are a few things I don't like.-If I forget which park had a particular coaster I want to work on, I have to open and check each park. Search bar won't do.-Testing the ride just in the editor seems to have been removed.-G-force combs ignore dive machine holding brakes.-Importing an element makes all the roll nodes 'strict' so I have to uncheck 'strict' on at least most of them. Might be a bug.Overall I recommend this game for any roller coaster enthusiast, and anyone who wants to make virtual coasters but finds NL1 too hard. Even if you're not a die-hard fan and don't know the names of the manufacturers or if you don't ride roller coasters very often, I feel like the sequel difficulty drop may be enough that you just might enjoy it anyway to at least some extent.

												I really enjoy this ""game"". It's not really a game, as it is an actual simuation. Just be advised this is not Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 or Theme Park Studio. I own both, so i know this one is very different. This simulator is very realistic with physics and terrain. It is very advanced, and takes a while to get used to, but anyways, it's totally worth the money and is amazing! Also Advised: Takes a pretty powerful computer to run. I have a lower powered computer and run at pretty low settings, but on highest the game is beautiful and eye-popping. Even on lowest settings, this simulator is still a blast!			"

												THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!! However, if you get the game, don't expect to be a pro. At first, I was completely lost. But, you need to watch some tutorials and in about 2 days, I got the hang of it. Also if you are only interested in managing, sorry but your out of luck. However if you like realistic coaster designing or just like coasters in general, GET THIS GAME IT IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1			"

												You don't really need a graphics card most of the time, so thats always nice if you're stuck with a PC from Best Buy. (Never Again!!) Also, the Workshop, there's a few small community Issues..1. NOBODY ever votes often enough to have a rating show up on an item.. 2. Most items that get posted are usually parks with little detailing done to make them more appealing.3. People downvote WAY, WAY too often, and they don't bother to read descriptions most of the time! GAH!Other than that, the Community is awesome..If you like spending lengthy amounts of time playing one game or just playing with a simulator, I recommend.			"

												I have always been interested in theme park simulation, like Roller Coaster Tycoon, Thrillville, Theme park etc...  But while they all focus on different aspect of theme parks (RCT is more about management, Thrillville is more game play oriented), none of theme focused exclusively on what I like the most: roller coasters.With NoLimits 2, all that has changed.  Instead on focusing on multiple aspects of theme parks, NL2 is dedicated exclusively on roller coasters.  You build them, you ride them, and you share them. In fact, NL2 feels more like a development tools for roller coaster designers than a game simulation.Building coasters in other applications was always a little awkward.  With NL2, building coaster is so easy almost everybody can built a coaster within minutes.  You still need to understand a few basics concept (like blocks for example) and understand how to use the tools.  But when you understand these fundamental concepts,  you will be able to build incredible coasters.  From there, your imagination is the only limit.  The included documentation provides just enough to get you going.  If you want more information, some excellent tutorial videos are available on YouTube.On a technical side, the application runs surprisingly well on laptops.  I had to set the resolution to 1280x720, but other than that, it works very well.  I can now build coaster when I am on the road.I have yet to experiment with scripting and scenery so I cannot comment on these features.  But all in all, I am very satisfied with this application.  And the more I play, the more I find that while building a coaster is easy, building a GOOD coaster is hard and challenging. And when I see what other people do, I know that I have a long way to go before I could build a good coaster. "

												***Review for NoLimits 2 Professional Edition***(not all features described may be included in the standard version)NoLimits 2 by far is the best roller coaster simulator which is currently available and quite probably will be available within the next years. Its focus on realism and customizability stands out as well as the performance on weaker machines (as long as the user-built parks are optimized that is). Although building your very first coaster can be quite a task the editor is easy to control, all buttons are neatly arranged.You can take in-game screenshots with depth of field and adjustable field of view which can often be close to reality and are able to deceive unaware people (and sometimes even the ""pros""). If pictures are too boring for you there is an option for recording videos for which you can enable a motion-blur effect.Many prefabricated supports are available to help you getting your first coaster done pretty fast. Those can be atomized and customized, or you can build your own supports from scratch with nearly unlimited sizes (from 0.001 m and 2 m) and a few distinct shapes (which can be cloned for easier placement). For wooden coasters it's even possible to auto-generate the supports.Furthermore, you can choose between many different track connectors and adjust where you want to have friction wheels, friction brake runs or magnetic fins. Custom scenery objects are supported, too. Those inlcude .3ds, .lwo and .dae files and lighting effects are just awesome when used wisely since shadow-casting ones can have a large impact on performance.Well, I just cut a long story short at this point: NoLimits 2 Roller Coaster Simulation has so many features I guess many users haven't discovered everything this program has to offer yet.And if that wasn't enough already, the devs regularly provide the (very friendly and helpful) community with updates which will also eventually include new coaster styles and features in the future.Soo ... what are you waiting for? Stop reading this review, get yourself a copy of NoLimits 2 and dive into the wonderful world of speed, height, thrill and fun. Btw, they say Oculus Rift enhances the experience even more.The total play time displayed here isn't correct as I've used the non-Steam version before, maybe add 100 hours and many more for NoLimits 1.

												This is the most amazing roller coaster simulator in the world. It has so many features and abilities that it's pretty impossible to list all of them.  From the editor to the riding of the roller coasters, everything in this game has clearly been taken very seriously and done really well.This game is not for the novice roller coaster fan, unless you just want to ride other people's creations. However, if you take the time to learn the program, you can build some really amazing things that you can enjoy over and over again. Also Oculus Rift Support is pretty neat. "

												WARNING: Do NOT eat before trying some of these roller coasters. If you love anything about roller coasters, this has to be experienced.Pros:Wow, I almost got sick! I haven't designed my own coasters yet, but so far fun trying out a few of them! Cons: Could be more lifelike, maybe adding some people (maybe I haven't found that function), it just feels weird being on a coaster by myself. Wishes: 1. A world map that can be zoomed to the location of the coasters (nothing as detailed as Google), but if I want to try a coaster near me, that would be an easy way to get to it. 2. Perhaps a button to put your arms up or see your arms in VR3. Maybe hear some people screaming, see more people on the rides...			"

												I purchased this recently after hearing they enabled Oculus Rift DK2 support.  I've tried nearly all the rollercoaster experiences that have come out and this game blows them all out of the water.  It's almost comical how much better and realistic this experience is.  The game comes with about 18 different coasters (all great) and running at stable framerates.  I've also downloaded a number of user-made coasters from the various fan exchange websites and from the workshop and many of these are fun and run great as well.  I haven't spent too much time in the editor program but it looks extremely robust and judging by the complexity of included coasters; very capable.  One thing to keep in mind is the hardware requirements if using an Oculus.  I'm running an overlclocked i5  3570 with an OC'd GTX 980 and still need to play mostly on low settings to keep a stable 75fps.  The less complex coasters will play nicely on a lesser system but try the demo and give it a go.  Definitely my FAVORITE Oculus experience at the moment. Money well spent "

												This is the first game (I mean program) I actually bought with money on Steam, and it is definetely worth it. No Limits 2 is a very realistic roller coaster simulator that is light years ahead of RCT3. Although it can be difficult for newbies, as you play more your coasters will gradually get better and better. I got this during a sale, but I'd pay full price for this. Would recommend this to any coaster enthusiast or anyone looking for a more advanced and realistic version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. However, I would not recommend this to the average person on Steam. But if you wanna make a realistic B&M or wooden coaster, this is the software for you!			"

												NL2 is possibly, no, DEFINITELY the best roller coaster simulator out there. The physics are top notch, the graphics are clean and sleek, and to top it all off the sound quality is brilliant. NL2 provides the opportunity to not only ride premade coasters made by the developers themselves, it allows you to build your own creations that can come from the deepest parts of your imagination. It could be a realistic B&M Hyper coaster with huge airtime hills, a Gerstlauer Infinity Coaster with 10 or more inversions, or even a sky coaster that dives towards earth killing everyone on board with 30g's of lateral g-forces with a speed of 500mph. This editor also provides the opportunity for the community to upload their creations to the Steam Workshop, which you can download and ride yourself, which provides, in theory, infinite content. The editor is also very intuitive and pretty easy to get the hang of, however hard to master. Overall the game is worth every penny, and if you want to support the developers in the constant updates, you can buy a Â£80 version, which allows many different features not available in the standard version. Big ups to the developrs for their amazing technological achievement, this simulator.			"

												If you want this game to build rollercoasters I would highly reccomend that before you buy this game you get the demo. If you cant figure out how to use the demo then dont buy the game. Learning how to build rollercoasters in this game is like learning a new, simplified language it can be difficult and frustrating but once you get the hang of it its a very rewarding. The graphics in this game are beautiful and the game designers put so much detail into this game it amazes me. Its fun to take a break and download a coaster off the steam workshop and just relax. Or you can try to manually control a rollercoaster with 5 diffrent blocks and eventually crash the coaster. This game is amazing and if your up for a fun, new challenge I would reccomend this game to you.			"

												I recommend this game/sim if you wish to further your architecture skills concerning the roller coaster industry. the controls are a bit hard to get acquainted to, but once you do, it becomes easier.. I recommend this game to all who like the roller coaster tycoon games (RCT3 and below). Ole lange does a good job with the renderings, but they need to give the proper credit to the parks their pre-made coasters are in.			"

												No limits 2 is a roller coaster simulation game with very powerful editing tools. I personally find it very difficult to use the editor, but can make stuff with it, but due to the complexity, it allows for some amazing creations! even if youre not paticularly good at design and thinking of coasters to create, ive enjoyed simply downloading and riding rides of the workshop and other platforms like youtube! if you have the money i highly suggest no limits 2, due to its unrivaled roller coaster simulation! if you have vr, its even more worth it!

												NoLimits 2 Roller Coaster Simulation is an amazing gem. As the name suggests, it is a roller coaster simulator. But it is not just any roller coaster simulator... it is THE roller coaster simulator. You won't find it any more realistic as this and if you are a fan of roller coasters and super realistic simulation: get this game!PROs:- Strong engine with insane physics.- Many types of roller coasters.- Editor has anything you want and everything you'll ever need!- Supports external models, but has many of its own as well.- Graphics are gorgeous. - Many other roller coaster related features such as control panel for the coaster.CONs:- Config isn't really in-depth.- Not always on 60fps and thus some stuttering (and I have a GTX 765M, which pulls a lot).- This is mostly because of external models or too many coasters in a park.All in all: this is some serious strong software with great features. Any roller coaster fan who wants to build a good track, as in a real track not that Roller Coaster Tycoon stuff: buy this! You have complete freedom.EDIT: I wrote this review when having 4 hours. Currently I'm over 20 hours and looking back at this review I'd say nothing has changed. This is just great software! However, I still have to try out the Oculus Rift support.			"

												Amazing. The potential of this game is unmatched to this day, with it's realism, attention to detail, scripting and modelling abilities and physics blowing any other simulator way out of the pond. You can find yourself deciding to go on here for 30 minutes, and end up being on for 3 hours! Even without any 3D modelling or scripting knowledge, the wealth of in game scripts and items means you can create anything! The coaster styles are so real, and the graphics really blow you away. Maybe you're not into creating, or not that good (Although practise makes perfect) you can go onto the workshop and access all the amazing creations by others! The smoothness of the coasters as well outbeats Planet Coaster by a mile, and is yruly unparalelled. Wether you are a thrill-seeking enthusiast, or you saw this off youtube, it's fun for everyone!

My Thoughts:Must be a great rollercoaster editor.... The coasters I tried in VR were amazing! I never got around to building my own I was too hyped riding them!I've been searching for coasters demo's to try in VR, now I don't need to.. I just download new ones from here every day!Game Details:NoLimits 2 is the ultimate roller coaster simulation that lets you experience authentic roller coaster thrills. Climb into the world's most famous roller coasters and experience the excitement in real time. Or design a new roller coaster that is engineered to your specifications.			"

												I don't have many hours on this account, but I have MANY hours on the standalone version and my backup account. The problem with this is that people who have play rct3 come to this expecting it to be a cake walk, then only play 1 hour of it before giving up on it forever. In my opinoin, it is the single best rollercoaster simulator/builder software out there. The first one was good, too, but they really stepped up their game with nl2. The steam workshop also is a great addition, because it makes sharing your roller coasters 99% easier, and riding other peoples' coaster is a click away. I would reccomend this to anyone wanting to make coasters and has patience to learn how to build the coaster. I highly reccomend watching TheCodeMaster's tutorials on youtube if you need help.			"

You can do anything you want with rides and stuff and you can even import custom scenery! It's a great game if your willing to pay the price tag it gives.

												This simulator is great for anyone who likes roller coasters, but the price is a but steap.It is definatly worth it though, because for the price you get a ton of rollercoasters in the steam workshop and a tool to build them yourself.Not only that, but it will have Oculus rift support, and has quite good nvidia 3d vision support, for anyone who has it/wants it. Even though it glitches a bit in the menu's, the roller coasters benefit from 3d. My only complaint about the 3d vision support for this game is that it makes everything look small.Fortionatly there is a demo with some excelent roller coasters (but obviously no steam workshop support).For anyone who has been playing roller coaster tycoon 3 for the past years and wants to ride some roller coasters with more detail, no people flinging corners and twists, and no person in your face when you rice it. This might just be the game for you.			"

												One of the best rollor coaster games I have ever player with both the oculus and without, both are outstanding but if your going for the more, 'This is real' feel then make sure to get an oculus! But I think that the price is a bit to high for a game like this, but I understand the whole, '$40' thing.The creating side of it is also well done but gets a bit of getting used to! I would just buy this game is you wanted just a rollor coaster simulation game, I'd find another. But if you are looking to build, test and ride your own coaster then go right ahead and buy this game!This game was definaltley not a waste of money and I definately recommened buying this game! :D Hope this helped you decide!

												If you own an oculus rift you propably want this. It's in no way perfect, in fact its quite borked at the time I write this review. But still it's the only virtual reality rollercoaster sim out now! Even better it has steam workshop integration so there are bound to be hundreds of insane and nauseating rollercoasters coming up.Usage guide: Put on your VR headset launch the game and close your other eye. Immediately go to the menu and set Antialiasning to MSAA x8. Stand up, have someone to hold you/hold on to something you don't mind falling on. Check out the spine melter. When and only when all the loading screens are done open your other eye and enjoy falling over and vomiting!PROS:VR RollercoastersThat's about itCONS:You have to navigate the menus with your other eye closed (menus are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed.)

												First of all I'd like to point out that this is not a game, but rather a simulator oriented towards coaster enthusiasts.Now if you are an enthusiast and you would like to design or recreate a coaster yourself, this is the perfect software for you. Although it takes some time to get used to it, the built-in editor itself is very good, and if it is not enough or you dislike it then there is  free third-party software you can use to design your rides. With the ability to import models and write scripts, there are truly no limits to what you can do. The attention to detail in this simulator is stunning. You can also trust the developers, I got this software on release date on the official site and I was given the Steam key when the game came out here.			"

Although it is more difficult, there are 100000x more things that you can do with this program rather thant the rct series games. You are not locked into a couple different types of tracks like in those games. You have the power to freely create and model the track in any which way you like. It is difficult when you start playing, one thing that helped me was TheCodeMaster's tutorial series on the game.			"

												When this was just released I tried the demo and wasn't statisfied with it. It took minutes to load simple parks and they ran at only half speed, so I decided to wait till I had a new system. Tried ThemeParkStudio, not much better. During the latest sale I just couldn't resist to buy it (still don't have a new system yet) and I just tried running a few parks. The performance was much, much better than before (my system is somewhere between minimun and recommended) and the editor was also easy to get started with, thanks to a short but great tutorial.If you just want to ride some coasters, there are a lot of parks to download from the workshop, just make sure you have enough memory to run them (3GB RAM is not enough for the low quality version of the smiler, 4GB would have worked).Best rollercoaster sim ever, 10/10(I've played RCW1-2 (old), RCT1-4, TPS and NL1)			"

												I'm going to give a positive review on this game, but I am not a fan of it. It depends on your skill, me being me, I just mess around which is actually quite fun. However, when it comes to wanting to make a smooth, exciting realistic rollercoaster, it becomes difficult. Very difficult. This game is very time consuming in the way that it takes a long time to create a rollercoaster. You do get a feeling of accomplishment when you make a perfectly smooth coaster and it is the closest thing to building a rollercoaster virtually. It requires patience and skill to not get bored of this game. I don't have either of these. I'd play it every now and again, but not all day every day.  The actual state of the game is brilliant. I haven't come across a single bug, corruption or actually any issues at all other than my stupidity. Very neat and professional, finished and generally a really good game. Just be prepared to get bored of it if you're not the best coaster creator. It is harder than I expected. It is hard to create a smooth track, there's a lot of trial, error, deleting parts and rebuilding. If you REALLY want it, get it. If you don't really mind, don't bother. I would rate it: 9/10 for state and performance, 5/10 for coaster building because of the difficulty and 9/10 for simiulation (when you go on the ride). It's very impressive, just I regret buying it simply because I'm terrible at building on it.			"

												If you liked building roller coasters in RollerCoaster Tycoon, you'll probably enjoy NoLimits. Up front, just know that this is a simulator and not a game, and that it has a bit of a learning curve. Luckily there are a whole bunch of beginner tutorials that will help you build your first coaster without any problems. The more you build, the better you'll get.And if you'd rather just ride the roller coasters, you're in luck because there's a massive amount of user created parks that are super easy to download and enjoy. In addition to the Steam Workshop, there are a number of fan sites that have been sharing NoLimits coasters for years.A must-have for every coaster enthusiast.			"

												Very good roller coaster simulation game.  Its basically the next step from Ultimate Ride (if anyone has ever played that) and can becoming a really useful tool for building amazing coasters!Pros:Lots of DetailAble to record while on the coasterGreat sound effectsLots of room to buildCons:The framerate could be touched up (I heard the ""Pro"" version of this game allows 60fps recording but idk how true that is)			"

												I already loved No Limits 2. Then came VR and I loved it even more but for one issue. When trying to ride coasters at night there was a horrible doubling of the image. That seems to be fixed!!! So great to be able to ride in the evening and at night without that happeing but now there seems to be a little stuttering when riding some flat rides. Riding the Giant Spining disk always seemed fine. Now there's a bit of judder that wasn't there before. I would also like more detailed instruction on how to design coasters, parks and scenery. Still it is so great, with coasters that really feel to scale and what could be better thatn to ride in VR. Buy it!!!			"

												This is a must own if you have an Oculus Rift DK2It is the simplest game to launch in the rift as it auto-detects it and does everything for you.It creates a very intense, real sense of presence and feels pretty close to the actual thing, espically with a chair that can move around a lot.It's a lot of fun, and great game to show people who are knew to the rift.I bought this full price at $40, and I've technically only got 2 hours play tie out of it so far... but it feels very much worth it. There's no microtransactions for tracks or trains or anything, so that up front price is all you ever have to pay. There's a workshop so there should be a steady flow of new coasters to try. Cons:There's some clipping with the seats but it's avoidable and ignorable.Some of the rides are a little TO intense. I wish there was an ""intensity"" scale, like, 1-5 so I could know what I am getting into... But, just have someone who cna handle the intense ones try first. After about the 4th time you ride one you start to get bored of it, and it starts to loss it's 'effect' I guess your brain starts to predict it?Offset by free workshop so not a big deal.			"

												This game is such a huge improvement over NL1 (but NL1 was still amazing, don't get me wrong). I love the graphics and all the effects you added. I wish I had the knowledge to do more with scripts and 3d design but at least I enjoy others' works! FVD++ is perfect for making mathematically smooth tracks but also sometimes you just want to handbuild. The smoothing tool has come a long way for sure. I wish the built-in FVD tool were FVD++ or improved somehow because the current one is very hard to work with. I can't wait to see where this goes in the future!			"

												i already knew i liked this sim after trying oculus with the demo, if you have a vr headset i would recommend this hands down, no other coaster games such as planet coaster seems to be listening about how important vr is becoming to games,especially sim games, flight,train,coaster sims.the only thing i don't like about this sim, and i love building coasters. the learning curve to build coasters are extremely high. i use oculus for no limits and download from the workshop. if i am building coasters, i play planet coaster. i hope there will be a no limits 3 with more realism, such as just having other people on the coaster with you, the parks are always dead and this sim still has alot of potential. for 40 bucks to ride coasters from all of the world compared to spending the money to go somewhere and stand in line, you can't beat this. the next generation of vr and we won't even need monitors, we will all be wearing the vive or rift. hope this helps anyone choosing to buy now, one last thing, i did expect to see more coasters made by the community being this has been out 3 years, and some of my fav coasters haven't been recreated, i imagine it's the steep learning curve of the editor.

												If you like the sandbox mode of RCT3 then you will love this! You have more room to work with and can make less rough rides! In RCT you have pre-made track segments that you can only use in No limits  you make it it is like a real roller coaster designer! In Rct3 They have only a few differnt supports and it dosent look real , now you can download add-ons too make it more realistic but in No Limits they have realistic pre-made ones and make your own support! But if you like the carrer mode of RCT3 you out of luck :( they only have sand box mode so stick with RCT3 but if you like sandbox mode I would HIGHLY recommend this game! P.S. You can add pre-made thirll rides and make shem too but that might be hard.			"

												Lets start with the Pros Pros: Detailed Coasters         There are No Limits         Easy to Build          Worth the moneyCons: Took an hour for me to figure out how to build           Not a Tycoon(I honestly dont care lol)           Lots of bits and bobs to create the coaster(aka Multiple Buttons to get the park-coaster)          Many people hate it because of the time it takes to make a coaster           Also 40.00$Now my opinion for the game! I think that is a amazing game and that they pushed it to the max on how you would create the coaster. If you loved Parkitect/RCT3/RCT2/RCTW then you are going to hate this. I say this because you dont put in food stands, flat rides, or pathways(unless you find some software to do that), this ""game"" is not a game because its used to create coasters in real life(i think). If you want the game but dont want to spend 40$ then wait for a sale. I got mine for 30$ because it was on sale. I really hope this helps you and keep on riding!!!  "

												Much better than the first installment of the game. I had my doubts with the building mode at first, but it turned out to be much easier to handle. The G-forces are displayed right away which makes the tweaking much easier and you can toggle to build the coaster directly following the heartline curve. Oh and the fact that you can add multiple coasters and flatride to the files makes it not only a very powerful rollercoaster but a whole theme park simulation.I used to play RCT2 a lot on an aesthetical level but NL2 gives me more freedom in design. I just spent a few hours building 1-2 coasters and I'm looking forward trying out landscaping and adding scenery with 3d software to my design.			"

												Ok, I played NoLimits about 6 years ago, and it left a bad imprint on me, so for 6 years I said no. When NoLimits 2 was released about 2 years ago, I thought no way. But after watching videos of it for 2 years, I got convinced to spend the forty bucks and get it, and I tell you, this game is well worth the purchase. Allow me to give you the baseline of this game, and some pros and cons.This game is basically, well, a roller coaster simulation game, now, this is not a tycoon game, if you want that, spend 5 more bucks and get Planet Coaster. Since this is for NoLimits 2, I will go off this topic. NoLimits 2 is a Spline Editor, not a Piece Editor, you click where you want track, and the game will add track to go there.PROSExtremely RealisticExtremely EasyExtremely InnovativeCONSVery Hard to Add SupportsIf you put track piece A at X:0, and track B at X:-20, and you plan to go straight, and place it down, it will go back to 0.

												Probably the most realistic coaster designer I've ever played with. Yes, I said designer - even the physics are realistic. You're able to ride, design / build, and control. And yes, I said control. You're given access to a control panel which lets you control the ride from just ""automatic"" (which is the AI controlling it, or custom scripts), ""blocks"", which let's you control segments of the track and release the coaster manually. Or, full manual, which is the hardest of them all. Try to play with 3 coasters at once, it's impossible! Despite people commenting about a ""steep learning curve"", the editor is quite simple and is quite easy to learn once you've gotten yourself ""rolling"" (pun intended). I'm not very good yet, but with a bit of practice I suppose I'd be able to design many great coasters.Note -You're able to import custom models, sounds, scripts and more, but even the vanilla version is good enough to keep you excited for a good, long set of hours!Realism: 9.5/10Customisability: 9.5/10Overall: 9/10			"

												NoLimits 2 is such a fantastic simulator that any enthusiast who doesn't pick it up is making a mistake. This version is far superior to the first release, and after a few videoes and trials, it is also FAR easier to create a more realistic, smooth, and enjoyable roller coaster than before. The price is a lofty $40, but it is definitely worth every penny. I had to think a lot about making this purchase, as I was afraid I would regret it. I was definitely wrong. So many things make this simulator the best:(Pros)EVERYTHING ABOUT IT(Cons)It isn't freeSeriously, stop reading reviews and buy it.			"

												This is an amazing roller coaster simulator. This is better than any other roller coaster game I've played. I tried Theme Park Studio, but it didn't work well enough for me. RCT3 is fun, but the design part of roller coasters isn't detailed enough, and you can hardly make anything realistic. But this is perfect. Not only can you be realistic (and actually stay withing good g-forces) but you can be extremely imaginative (or boring, if that's your thing). If I want to make a typical Arrow looper, I can. If I want to make a ginormous strata coaster that's 15,000 feet long, I can still do that. There are endless possibilities.So many new features have been added since NoLimits 1. The design interface is so much cleaner and modern. The track very rarely needs adjusting and moving like in the first game. You just hit ""Depump Vertices"" and it automatically smooths (unlike in NL1 where smoothing was never enough). Things like the g-force and speed combs are really helpful because you can design in comfortable constraints instead of testing every element.The graphics are also much better. I found NL1 graphics to be somewhat jagged and even blocky sometimes. NL2 has pristine graphics and everything is much more realistic. When placing trees, you can count the leaves individually. NL1 had trees that were very bunched together. Terra-forming is a lot better now. Terrain rises in a circular pattern instead of in a square pattern.And of course, there are many more coaster types. 4D, suspended swinging, and wing are just a few of the new coaster types available. 10/10 - Perfect coaster designer. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of roller coasters.			"

												Great application for desktop, but unfortunately experimental VR support at this time is just that, and it shows. Regular drops in framerates (with a Titan X and Xeon E3-1231) and repeated flashing on-screen when loading each coaster (menu repeatedly popping in and out) actually caused mild VR sickness for the first time. Even attempting to change the settings afterwards caused the cursor to freeze whenever it went near the graphics tabs in settings. Unfortunately, at this price those issues have caused me to request a refund, since the experience for VR users simply isn't there at this time.			"

UI sems polished & workshop support means an almost neverending content supply. personally i HATE rollercoasters. i never ride them, do not like them & would have never looked at this game twice.  im that guy waiting at the exit for my friends @ the park.now, if you have an oculus........OMFG! probably one of the most immersive experiences available. i am unable to ride it in  the rift for more than 20 mins because it is That Realistic. as someone who has always had difficulty with coasters IRL, i can say without a doubt that this has increased my level of comfort.at the very least. check out the Demo, you will not be disappointed.

												Unfortunately I can only chose between Yes and No.Therefore...THIS IS >>ONLY<< A REVIEW OF THE VR COMPONENTOn the basis of me buying it solely as a rollercoaster VR experience (for the Rift CV in my case), I can only say No. I am sure it is a great game otherwise, but if what you want out of it is the same as me, then you have to be certain you have a cast iron stomach. If you do - great, go buy it now!There's a lot of VR experiences I can handle, but there are also a lot that make me sick if I'm not careful. If you like me need to be a bit careful and can't just take it all, I would not for a second recommend this game. I tried around half of a simple, straightforward, up and down rollercoaster ride (maybe 30 seconds) before I was sweatting profusely and had to tear the headset off to keep from throwing up.It should be said that I LOVE real world rollercoasters. Up, down, corkscrews, loops, twirls I've done them all and love them in real life... but in VR it would seem I just can't handle it. The high speed turns with no mitigation or control are just too hard.You can see this as a review of VR rollercoasters in general, from the point of someone who has some problems with VR nausea. Not more than most of my friends who has tried my Oculus though. I don't believe this is a particularly poor implementation, which is why I mention it as a general thing.Reviewing VR is so very difficult, because there is such an intensely physical and individual component to the experience.So all I'm saying is Caveat Emptor: VR Buyer Beware.TLDR; Purely from VR standpoint probably stay away from rollercoasters in general, unless you have no issues with simulation sickness ever.PS: I feel super bad giving the devs a ""No"" because of something they can't control. But it's still important info for potential buyers. How we discuss and review VR games are some of the issues we'll have to iron out as VR matures.			"

												This is very impressive simulation software. You can create anything to your hearts content. This simulation software focuses on what it's supposed to. The physics feel 100% spot on, the engine is difficult to run all settings at the highest, but still looks better than NoLimits 1. Again this is not a game where you build coasters to get money, infact there is no currency. If you have the skill you can re-create a park from the real world, and texture everything yourself. There are many coasters and rides in this simulation that were not in NoLimits 1 including flat rides. Really fun to play around with, and if you have no patience for creating something, the workshop has many awesome parks.			"

												I thought this game would be better than the other things I have tried of the same type, but it isn't. It sufferes from the same overly copmplex building system, that as soon as you see it, it makes you want to stop playing, and after spending only a few minuets trying to build a coaster, it makes you want to pull your hair out. Also while riding the premade stuff, I nticed that the sounds needed more work. The sounds that the water made, didn't sound like flowing water should at all, and the sounds of the coasters, just seemd to keep getitng louder and louder, until it was a roar in my ears, regardles of what speed the coaster was actually going at.

												This games editor is horrendous. Even though I am a coaster enthuesiast and I have plenty of experience with numerous rollercoaster games, this style of editor is just plain atrocias to me! And yes, I know all the real manufactures use it, but it is plain odd and I can't even get it to work! I have watched plenty of tutorials and I still can't even make a roller coaster without stumbiling into a hideous mistake and being forced to completely exit off the program! This game has an incredible learning curve that will make begginers absoloutly hate the game! I do not recomend this game to anybody who never draws out a full plan or never works at a major manufacture! Maybe someday I will learn the stratagy to this game and not hate it as much. But I am not that person who believes anybody can do anything. Everyone is limited and disabled in some way. But for now, I can not get this to work. Mostly in technical difficulties and not performance issues. I am not saying this game is bugged, but that this game is one that I can not figure out or learn anytime soon. That is my review for now, as I said I may learn this game and sucseed at it but that is not anytime soon.			"

I own almost every game in the Oculus store and a few here like Project cars. I don't consider my self sensitive to motion sickness. If I can play Project cars, I'm certainly not extremely sensitive. THIS experience... I can't last 10 seconds. Most people will want a VR rollercoaster.  Try the demo, I didn't notice it during my sale purchase.			"

												I DO LOVE THIS GAME!Although it absolutely kills me making the choice to say I don't recommend this game, I have to!My main reason is this isn't really a 'game'.. I know it's a roller coaster SIMULATOR blah blah blah but it just feelslike something is missing!!!For me, the price seemed a bit steep for such a limited amount of activities you can do.This is an amazing simulator in which you do feel like you're really on one, and they're are many rollercoasters to try,unfortuantely the makers did not add that many, the vast majority to ride are made by people on the steam workshop!What does it need?, Really simple things to give it that touch of perfection.. Needs AI, persons around the parks/on the rides shouting in your ear to give you a more realistic ride!PARKS <- this one is a big one for me, There are no parks, just riding each ride seperately.And the surroundings? - there's no tree or grass animation, I know it's not important in anyway considering it's a roller coaster simulator, but it would just give the game a much more realistic viewing.Please note I used to play roller coaster tycoon 3 so I guess I was expecting this to be a bit more like that!, appologies! if you're looking for an awesome simulator with screen vibration, visually perfect rollercoasters then this is right for you,if you're looking for a game, this is not right for you.

FPS dips into the 40s are frequent, and my GTX 970 rarely is utilized above 35% according to MSI Afterburner. Still, this is one of the best horror games I've ever played.
