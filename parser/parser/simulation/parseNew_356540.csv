												Incredibly limited both as a novel and as a game. Your choices pretty much amount to a million ways to get a 'bad ending' which ends the game immediately, a very limited 'ok ending' routes (which don't lead to love) and a decidedly subpar single-track route to 'love'.While the opening seemed promising, it rapidly went downhill, turning what could have been interesting conflict and examination of gender fluidity and self-identification into yet another 'tomboy until she gets the boy' type of story. Bought it on sale and I regret spending the money all the same.			"

												Given the fact that East Tower: Akio and East Tower: Takashi are more or less the same game apart that Sakuya is teaming up with Takashi instead of Akio, nearly whole of the review is a copy/paste of the one I did for Akio.Sakuya is a woman wishing to be a man since an incident in her childhood. She makes everything in her power to look like one. Her cousin Daiki works for Dreamworld and needs her help to try a new virtual attraction called West Tower, reserved for women. However, Sakuya managed to convince him to let her try the East Tower, reserved for men. She ends with four other testers, trapped in the virtual world, though she's happy to see that she's a man in it...This is the same beginning in each Each Tower game. Once in the virtual world, Sakuya will team up with one of the guys. In the first of the series, she's Akio's partner, whose virtual form is a child. East Tower is an attraction that will confront everyone to their own insecurities and fears.I will go straight the point: this is a visual novel, where you have choices to make. Each stage must be cleared to advance in the story, you don't have any skills or relationships to improve/destroy. However, choices are mattering: you can get a bad ending immediately where you have to begin the stage again (not the entire story), a best friend ending (by scoring A on each stage) and a romance ending (by clearing each stage with a S). If you follow the romance route, you'll end up with an extra chapter. However, some stages don't have a A rank, only a S one - in that case, for the best friend route, it's considered as if it was a A.Choices are generally made during the challenges proposed for the team. It's much rare to see them outside of them, before or after them. True, without skills or anything to worry, the game is easier than any other visuel novel I've already played (apart Shan Gui, which is more an interactive book), even the first Heileen was more complex and even Blue Rose was more complicated. I don't mind at all this lack of difficulty.I find very interesting the fact that the guy will be your best friend at the end, as the bad ending isn't a ""you're alone"", ""you're killed"", etc.. However, should you choose to pursue him, it means that your character is also evolving and accepting herself more.Let's speak about Takashi. He's a sensible young man, that admires his older sister, who seems way more stronger than him and that's why he wished to be her and that he adopted her appearance. Takashi is also the typical comical teenager boy, a side more developed in the romance route: he's hit often by Sakuya, he's slow to understand that she's a real girl and he has every corny line to deliver. However, given the fact that he's very sensible, he's wishing to be strong and the only time he did, well, he managed to get his footh in the mouth because the girl he protected was believing that she didn't need any protection. In the end, the fact the team was a girl wishing to be a boy for escaping some stereotypes and a boy that is wishing to be strong like his sister is very interesting. I largerly prefer Akio than Takashi but well, Takashi can be mature if he wants. Besides, his voice isn't as charming as Akio.Indeed, the visual novel has voice acting... in Japanese. I don't understand a thing but as the subtitles are in English, I could follow the story. The only character not voiced is you. However, I find it really good. It's always fun to hear something in a foreign language, it's reminding me some good memories with some anime.As for the style, it's really in a manga style, reminding me of The Rose of Versailles or anything directed to girls - because it's clearly stated in the official website that it's a visual novel for them (but everyone is welcome to play it). I loved it. I also loved the HUD, kinda hi-tech and with a good shade of green.The music is very good too, very adapted to each scene. I really liked it. And with Takashi being comical, you bet that you heard more the funny music than anything else.East Tower: Takashi is a little good moment I've spent, though I wished that it was a little more serious as in Akio, without having to think too much. It's not the best visual novel out there, I admit that, however, it's still worthy of a purchase and you'll learn more about Sakuya's past in this game.			"

												The East Tower series is a set of otome visual novels that are different than your standard Japanese otome game. If this review peaks your interest, I would recommend buying the whole bundle as it is cheaper than buying each one individually. The 4 games together give 15+ hours of game play.Note: If you read my reviews on any of the other games (Akio,Takashi, Kuon, Kurenai) aren't terribly differentI was surprised at how much I ended up liking game. I think a lot of that has to do as a Otome game addict I was getting a little burnt out on the mobile games. (When I say burnt out, I think I have played the main story line of more than 80 characters on mobile otome games.) East Tower Takashi is the second installment the series. The order which the game is recommended is Akio, Takashi, Kuon then Kurenai. I would recommend this game even to just VN fans (not necessarily otome fans) because it explores interesting themes and has a great overarching plot. The story is what got me hooked on this game, I love a different story than your more standard otome game that ET has. I liked the Takashi route, but I would say it is my least favorite of all the characters. -Not to say that you shouldn't buy it-. It reveals a little more about the underlying story, but not much more than Akio.  I especially like how this game explores gender related sexuality in a very interesting way. Gender fluidity is something much different to be explored in a VN/Otome game, especially for a Japanese market. Sakuya (the MC, name changeable) bends the standard female protagonist role, rebelling against the female stereotype, actually starts the virtual game as a male character.  The voice acting is very nice for an indie game. I liked some of the unique voices in the game (Daiki specifically). I wouldn't say that there is any blaring miscasts in the voice acting. Of course this being an indie game, there aren't the big shot seiyuus (voice actors) to really make the voice acting really shine. I was not big on the art style that ET has, but I grew attached to the characters anyway, which is a good sign as the likeability of the character is not just based on the art. I would say the thing that bothers me the most is the roundness of the faces, especially the young versions of the characters. I think of all the VN/Otome games ET has to take the cake on roundness of faces. There are more CGs than I was expecting for an indie game. The backgrounds in ET are interesting, I really like how the game world is portrayed. I would really say that the only (slight) drawback to this game is the art style, but it is still nice in its own way.  "

Very similar to 'East Tower - Aiko' Pro:  easy 100% achivementsCons:'social' media integration. After every stage it asks you to share your results to any of 3 websites.  Can be clicked past easy enough, but still annoying to see those websites invading games.Graphics are not very good and mostly consist of a single screen/backdrop.And surprise, another perverted VN...

												my contribution to the review pool is pretty similar to the others. east tower - takashi is similar to the previous akio title but with just enough differences to make it playable and enjoyable. it's not a BAD game just not a particularly riveting one. my sincere suggestion: get these bundled or on a good sale and *do not expect* a masterpiece. it's a solid, light, fun otome. don't compare apples to oranges here - it's just a relaxing time passer. i enjoyed it, anyway :D			"

												OMG an absolutely identical prologue to East Tower- Akio. How lazy is that?At least you experience something from the youth of the female protagonist. Everthing else has the same shape as in Akio. Same story, same flirting ranks, same social media share after a stage, same achievements.			"

												Solid continuation to East Tower - Akio. I REALLY recommend you to play those in order (Akio, Takashi, Kuon, Kurenai) and not think too much. It's rather sweet series for otome and visual novel players as long as the art doesn't bother you.			"

												This review covers all 4 of the East Tower games in one. Simply put, the game isn't very good. The art has occasional good moments but most of it is pretty bad. The story is set up in such a way that it could lend itself to an interesting discussion of gender identity and digital sexuality but it instead chooses to do cliché ""oops, I tripped and grabbed your boob"" moments. There are dialog options but the game is still very linear; you either die instantly, find a solution, or pick a solution that gives you a bit of extra dialog. I would not recommend any of these games except for Kurenai (which was admittedly pretty good). However, there are parts of the Kurenai story that won't make any sense without playing at least a bit of the other ones.The game is also way too expensive. I bought them all as a set with 40% off ($18 total) and I feel ripped-off. There are much better VNs available for much less. Takashi, Kuon, and Akio were each only about 1.5 hours of play time, which is not a great value.Finally, every time you finish a section (and there are at least 7 sections per game) the game tries to get you to post to social media. That really pisses me off. It takes me out of the moment to try to get me to advertise for a game that I paid for. Dear game devs, please don't do that!			"

												I thought this second chapter was even better since it talks about MC’s past and her thing with the boy who gave her such “complex”. It was fun to play, and Takashi is really a sweet guy. Like I already said on my review of the first chapter, the art isn’t so great but the story is interesting. It’s no masterpiece, but totally worth reading! 8/10. Can’t wait to play the next chapter!			"

												This is the second game of the East Tower series. The only difference with the first one is the guy. As a game by itself, not worth six bucks unless you really want to support the makers of it. Otherwise, it might be easier on your soul to try and get it as part of a bundle with the rest of the series. Honestly, the third and fourth games are the best, but they're only good if you play either this one or Akio, the first game. You can play both the first and this one to get the ""whole"" story, but it really isn't necessary. The guy for this one is more interesting than the first. I'd say more, but that would be spoiling it. My opinion for this is as the same for the first game: it's an ok game.			"

												This sequel to East Tower: Akio has more problems but also more highlights than the original. Some of the stages are more convoluted than those of the previous game and also female Takashi's voice is grating to listen to. Nevertheless, it IS voiced, and that's more than can be said for many visual novels on Steam. Plus, the flashback scenes are priceless and worth a second playthrough if you didn't see them the first time. I highly recommend it due to the strong latter stages of the game, although occasionally it feels like a chore to get there.			"
