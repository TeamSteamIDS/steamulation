												I'm in two minds about this game... Ok, I've not played it very long, but I thought I'd write this review to tell others before they buy it.  It needs A LOT more work.Firstly, the blurb is quite misleading - It's not a tycoon/sim style game.It feels like a port from a tablet game.  There is an element of planning when it comes to controlling where and when your aircrafts go, but a major downside is when you want to build a new building, the game has already told you where it's going to be built.The tutorial is poorly done.  It gives no indication of how to play the game, no tutorial text, it just runs like the regular game with a hand now and then that pops up on screen.Pros:- The price is right (£2.50 in UK)- The Jetway is a nice touch (also would have been nice if you'd mentioned it was manual)- The maps and how you can see your plane's position over the US/EU- Has potentialCons:- No real freedom, everything is pre-built- Very bad tutorial- Very repetative- No real indication of how to play the game- Passengers don't scream when a plane crashes- The sound effects are horrible, and some are REALLY LOUD like the plane taking off and the emergency servicesI would recommend this game IF - and ONLY IF - you are a fan of what I've written above, or you just need a new game to pass a couple of hours.

												Let me start by saying this game is not fun. It is tedious, arbirary, and full of bugs.  I'm a huge fan of Aeronbiz Supersonic, the airline business game for SNES. There has never been a better airline industry sim since. Aerobiz Supersonic was not a fancy game and it had all the right elements - race against competitors, market based demand for passengers, global event causing growth and decline to markets, choice of hubs and growth of hubs, and management of your fleet. Terminal 2 does none of these. You are in charge of an airport in Seattle (why would you hub in Seattle!?). You main job is to move the aircraft around on the tarmac and make sure they don't run into each other. In other words, this game is tedious and boring. It also doesn't make any sense. You get $$ and xp for completing flights, but the $$ and xp you get do not relate to the distance or number of passengers. For example, I saved up to buy a A340 so I could fly to Europe instead of domestic routes thinking these inter-continental routes would be worth more. Strangely, it was equally rewarding to fly from Seattle to Chicago and Seattle to Paris - Huh!? Games should be fun by giving the player rewards and allowing them to explore new levels of play. Terminal 2 is cheap and indie, so my expectation were not high, yet it still failed to even be amusing. This game rather focuses on  - micro-managing movement of aircraft in real time - mkae a mistake, an aircraft (or two) explode, but without any major consequences than lost revenue from that plane. In fact the game tallies you crashes in a sick sadistic way. This is not only boring, but not challenging unless the game throws unrealistic obsticles in the way, like it the runway gets covered with snow after you clear a plane to land on what was then a clear runway (no aborting either). Throw in some bugs, like an aircraft getting stuck in a hanger so that aircraft and hanger and useless and you get the picture.  Terminal 2 takes all the tedious aspects of the airport business and simlulates them in an incomplete and buggy system. Avoid!			"

												I really want to like this game.  Literally everything I want in a transport management game, but it really suffers from the technical aspect.  First off the game feels like it was designed to be played on a tablet, only offering windowed and full screen options, and that's it.  You're also constantly dealing with multiple currencies (Fuel, XP and Money), but seeing as how the game is only $4 I can forgive those minor issues.  Other issues however include that the game looks really rough, everything just feels unfinished, and lacks polish.  The UI also looks quite rough and in need of a coat of paint, and some tweeks in funcionality.  Navigating a plane from the gate to the runway takes a few too many clicks in different locations for my taste.  Same goes for navigating a plane from the runway to the gate.  Why do I have to load the plane with passengers prior to sending it to the hanger for repairs?  I doubt the passengers want to sit on the plane while it's being repaired.The tutorials suck as explaining the game to you, you're better off just going with Trial and Error.  Danger symbols aren't explained until you figure out what they are, which probably means your plane will explode before you figure out why it exploded.  There is also very little incentive to fly anywhere other than Miami, as it gives you a bunch of XP and Money.  I really want to like this game since I have always wanted to have a good airport management sim, this game lays the foundation, but needs work technically and design wise.  If the developer is able to clean up the graphical issues, and smooth over the learning curve there might actually be an excellent game here.  However for now, it still needs a lot of work.			"

												I know I don't have many hours on the game, to be honest it's not something you can play for hours. At least in my opinion, the game does get a bit frustrating at times and I'll explain why.So essentially you own one airport. You buy the aircraft using money and XP (virtual, of course). You go through a process of clicking, allowing it to forward between taxiways to the gate. You have to do a sequence of unloading, choosing new destination, refueling, boarding and then more clicks to get it to the runway, it takes off and you don't see it until it returns to land in which you need to clear it and again start the process of guiding it to the gate.Now, it's not too bad. Although the clicking process becomes tedious; when you have 3 aircraft on the ground you'll appreciate it better (you don't want aircraft crossing paths and crashing on the ground).You build upon your airport by buying additional features, ie an extra gate, ways of increasing passenger numbers (you'll need to do this as I found out when you have a lot of aircraft frequently attending; you can't make an aircraft leave until it's full it seems).It's an okay game for what it is and at £2.51 you can hardly grumble. Essentially this is a game you'll expect to play on an iPad (or of course, other tablet system on the market). The large buttons and clicking really gives it that impression it's ported from a tablet.Pros- Cheap, good for a bit of time wasting- Easy to play once you get the general idea of it- It is interestingly challenging when you have many aircraft to juggle all trying to land, take off at onceCons- Aircraft crash too much (i'll explain below)- Not enough money made to make reasonable progression.- Low resolution (yep, it's a tablet game for sure)So to explain the cons..Aircraft will crash. Some can be avoided, some can't. The obvious is making sure they're fueled up before they leave. Don't send the smaller aircraft on too much of a long haul as I found out. However, the frustrating part, essentially what has made me stop playing it, is the fact that your aircraft crashes and it's lost. All but one of my aircraft crashed within 5 flights and I went through about 8 or 9. This means they never make their money back and eventually you run out of money and have no planes to fly; game over. Likewise with lack of XP. There are events that can crash your aircraft. For example, an icey runway you have to deice before a plane lands on it. Also windy conditions will crash a plane everytime. The ice is easily avoidable hower the wind appears random to me and on the occasion the wind randomly kicks in as I've authroised a plane to land.. causing it to crash. Overall I think it's a massive overkill for the amount of times aircraft crash, you just cannot progress as this happens. As your plane is flying over the Alantic, you hear a crash terrain alarm and that's it; you're powerless to do anything and it's gone. I was expecting a bit more control over what happens, everything is very linear. For example plane servicing. I thought maybe more plane servicing would prevent crashes, however you cannot service a plane until it's 'due' a service when the light flashes.Bugs? Yeah there's a few. Only one I can really highlight as an issue however.. To progress an aircraft you have to click on it, which will pop up yellow buttons to guide the plane to taxiways, hangar etc. I noticed a few times you need to click the plane a few times before they appear. No biggie, however still contributes to the frustration. If you have a few £ spare and want to waste a few hours, have a bit of patience and you might enjoy this.. until your last plane crashes then you can only really start again.			"

												Pretty simple game - build an aircraft, board aircraft, fly routes. Could benefit from some tweaking: Auto routes would be helpful; passenger demand for destinations should be indicated; greater preventative controls. Most glaring bug that I noticed is that if you order an aircraft to do a command (i.e. take off, land, taxi) and a warning comes up afterward, your ship is sunk as there's no way to cancel commands or make emergency changes.

												I bought this game mainly out of desperation for an airline/airport sim and also because, having seen his direct communication with other reviewers, the developer looks like they genuinely care what the players of the game think... which seems almost unique these days! While the game isn't the fullest creation of all time, hence the more than reasonable price, it is good for passing some time and having fun for a while. Also, this game and this developer both seem to have great potential, which is one reason I recommend purchasing this game as it seems like a worth while investment in later development :)!			"

												Ok i truely wanted to like the game as i am a tycoon fanatic. i still play rollercoaster tycoon one for example lol and first zoo tycoons. So graphics not a real issue.  the premis of the game is great. The idea for game is great. The execution of game is horrible.So I will do the Pro's con's thing... Pro:1: neat idea2: looks of game decent 3: had potentialCons:1: neat idea not fullfilled2: its a micromanage nightmare3: tutorials not informative. they simply 1 min long video4: Can not design own airport every thing is preset for you5: game is too structored for my tastes not many options6: Game needs more polish and less micromanageingGame could of been good but with preset build slots. And constant micromanage game quickly becomes a chore instead of fun. Here's hopeing that their terminal 3 doesnt follow same style or will fail also. to simply launch a plane the following steps ""clicks"" are needed...1. click plane2. select call tanker3. click boarding ramp4. click plane5. select board6. click boarding ramp7. click plane 8. send to runway9. gets half way and need select hanger or runway10. click plane to line up11. launch planenow thats one plane. think about when have dozen or more to deal with. Now and then will need send them to hanger for repairs. When i did it sent loaded plane to hanger lolGame could of been lot more fun if had more automation and options. And also more freedom when building. Hope dev takes all the feedback into consideration when makes T3 otherwise game will flop. BUT if takes feedback into consideration could have a fun and enjoyable game. Suggestions: 1: freedom to build as choose2: less mircomanageing3: more options with flights and planesIn closure I can not recommend this game as it stands now. Dev states a patch comeing will try to redo review at that time to see if game better or same. "

												This game is designed for tablets. It is also based off a facebook game. and while there are no in game items to purchase with money, there are a lot of ""coming soon"" marked items that you cant get.The game also has two speed settings to switch between, ""Boringly Slow"" and ""Annoyingly Fast"".You start out with an insane amount of money and a incredily low amount of XP. you need both to purchese anything new for your airport. Since you not giving any clear direction how to progress you will end up wasting these while you figure out how to play the game since the two tutriols included in the game only teach you how to take off and land.The game often feels quite cramped with the camera and the amount of area you can view. You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, however it is revered from any other game or application that has ever existed making it feel awkward.certain actions will snap the camera's focus onto one section of the map while others wont.The gameplay could be fun if a few more things were refined. i feel however like i am playing a beta			"

												My honest opinion is that this game does not feel complete. I belive there should be more info on the different buildings. Mind you, I just played it for couple of minutes, but some part of the game, I DO like. easy UI, the realism, specially when it comes to the weather. Meaning you have to defrost the runway before take off and landing your aircrafts. Now. Downside. You can not choose where to start, you can't send your plane directly to the hangar for repairs after offloading your passengers. I also feel there should be MORE to control on the airport, like where to put your buildings, be able to click the buildings and get a sort of ""inside view"" of the buildings. Like the terminal, and the possibility to upgrade it, and add stuff. Gives the player more to do than just refule, takeoff, land, send planes to the Hangar, and build the planes and add buildings to the airport. But again, that's MY hones opinion of this game. Not much to do, but an agreeable price. specially on steam. Let's see what they bring on the next version: The Terminal 3.			"

												A nice little game.Well despite what other people write in their review we can build a few buildings, but the possitions of them are pre set, but you can expand as you go along with xp and money.There are also a large amount of aircraft ( i think 8 ) and they all have various qualities such as speed or passengers.It is also possible to fly to various locations in US and Europe, I do however not really see any reason to fly from US to europe since you get the same amount of money and XP.. Once you get a fleet of aircrafts then the game start to become fun...  First of all you have to tell your planes where to go, and if they should land or do a go around. Also taxi on the ground are simulated and such things as refueling.So once you have example 4 aircraft landing and taxi at the same time it become a bit of a puzzle, since if any of your aircraft touch each toher they blow up on the ground...  However it is different in the air above the airport.. if two planes touch it will create an emergency and you need to make your airplane land asp. When landed click the airplane and you will see the firefighers come and put out the fire and after that you can taxi away form the runway... However this take some time so while you wait you might get problems with other airplanes waiting to land, and I really hope you have a backup plan since els your planes will fall to the ground sooner or later.Also from time to time there are ingame events such as snow on the runway that need to be cleared and it will open the runway for 30sec to allow plane to land..  and sometimes there are a strong wind that will make it 50%-50% if you survive if you try to land.All in all for 3,59euro I think this game is great and for that kind of money you get what you pay for, and EVEN MORE than you pay for.. It is a nice little game. "

												When I think of a airport management game, I think about designing airplanes, setting up contracts with other airports, full custimization of my airport with unlimited control, and even the ability to design the terminals that most of my clients will go through. Then maybe even have control to building buildings that influence my control over a city to increase my client base. I think of having all kinds of different clients, with different taste. Whether its flying people around the control, or getting air mail and cargo rushed due to a national emergency.Then we have Terminal 2. Sadly this is not my dream game that I had hoped for. Too many limited choices in everything that you can think of. Planes, buildings, everything is just too limited. The game took less than 50 megabytes to install. Its not a pc game, it is a incomplete port to pc that was designed on a pc for a mobile phone. Planes crashed faster than I can build them. You sell some planes, they crash and now you have no clients to serve. Game freezes at random times. And even if you do get going you get stuck with such a limited choice that your doing nothing but wondering what is the next game your going to play. Its best to stay away from this one folks. No stars out of 5.No prosCons, Incomplete, port, crashes, incomplete or destructive game mechanics. Do not even get me started with audio.Advice to developer  Game needs to be rethought out because what you have now is not going to work.			"

												3 hours on game so far and will have plenty more, ok, the game isn't the prettiest looking graphics wise, and there are a few bugs that could do with ironing out, they are not bugs that cause crashes etc etc.... more asthetic things like when an aircraft is in the hanger and it's a little difficult to see or click on, but it's not a major floor in the game, just rather a tweak or three needed here and there.The game cost less that £3.00 so anyone moaning about a game at that price is just silly, they spend more on a Mcdonalds and that's gone in 2 minutes, this game will atleast give a few hours of game play at the least.It is a basic game in looks, tutorials and sounds, however! for a game that's been programmed by just one fan of this type of Air plane / Sim / Management game then he deserves a lot more credit than to just have his game slated by people who have less than a couple of hours on the game, yes I agree tweaks are needed but the game is playable and if you want to help improve the game than contact the guy that made it and offer the advice on how he can improve it, after all there are currently no games like this around, the last was Airport Tycoon 3 and that stopped working after Windows XP.After just 3 hours of playing I already have 6 routes flying and it's hard work keeping all the planes serviced and running, which is what a management sim is suppose to be, you do have to juggle the planes landing and taking off just like Air Traffic Control do, and the spanner in the works is when a plane announces a Mayday and you have to clear a runway as it's coming in fast with an engine on fire.Graphics I would give a 5 / 10, as they are very 1990's but then Minecraft graphics are very 1990's in my view :) Sound I would give 4 / 10 as they are basic but do the job although could be better, but gameplay I would give a good 8 / 10, the game is challenging and needs a few hours spent playing on it to realise that.For the price it's worth a punt, less than £3 and you have another PC game on your Steam account and even if you only give it a couple of hours of gameplay then it will atleast last longer than the Big Mac did :)			"

												I liked the game. It's no COD but what do you expect for the price. The game seems unfinished and I feel it has a lot of potential. I'm sure we will not see one more big push to polish it up a bit, but still it's fun.  It's not too tricky or too simple to play. It's perfect for filling in the time between life happenings. It sort of reminds me of the trading ship portion of the ""Anno 1602 A.D."" game from back in the day. If you decide to purchase the game and only play it an hour it's worth the low cost. After all how much do you pay for your energy drinks that are gone in less than an hour. Thank you			"

												Wow. Hmm... I really don't know what to say about this game. The game looks exactly like it does on the store page, and I love simulation games, but this game is just plain terrible. The first thing that I noticed is that there are almost no tutorials. There technically IS a tutorial section, but there is no explanation text. You basically just watch silent videos that explain things via point-and-click. It is up to you to figure out what is going on. The next thing that bothers me is the fact that there are too many hazards that ruin your airport. Things like there suddenly being no cement or pavement on your main runway, which I could not figure out how to fix. The thing that just killed this game for me happened when I had two planes waiting for the runway to be repaired before they could take off. I selected ""Line up,"" which you would think would cause the planes to ""line up"" in an orderly fashion. Instead, the second plane just casually crashed into the plane in front of it. My entire airport operation was pretty much dead as they were my only two planes. I am glad this game was cheap.			"

Everytime I get my planes coming back to WA Airport, they are in ""mayday"" mode, and when I have no time left to keep them circling, the game makes sure the wind warning is up so I keep losing planes in crashes when the can't land.  It's a no win scenario, and the planes aren't cheap from a n XP perspective.  Playing for 2 hours and I can NEVER make progress because I keep losing planes.

I have never received a patch or seen patch notes.- AI has no logic if it sees a plane go in front of it even when it has time to break it just crashes into the other aircraft.- Various graphical bugs.

												Interesting idea, fun for maybe 20 minutes ish. Too many bugs in the game for it to be worthwhile, and only so many aircraft that you can make room for with the bugs. Its more of a blend of ATC, airport, and airline management. No business strategy or competition to deal with though. Lets see, some examples.Aircraft will run into the back of other taxiing planes and explode.Aircraft will land in unsafe conditions and explode. Aircraft will push back into others on the ramp/taxiway and explode.If I could have tryed a demo, I would not have bought the game. Hell, I wouldnt play it for free now that I know these issues.			"

												Don't buy. It has lots of bugs, limited gameplay, 1990's graphics and slow and boring progression - all things that could be forgiveable if only game was somehow funny.Runway accidents are far too frequent. It takes a lot to gain enough experience to purchase an airplane, then when you try to make it land, the second before it actually touches the ground it starts blowing wind or the runway covers with snow out of nowhere and the aircraft has no chanche but smashing. Quite frustrating.Also, there's no point in sending planes to farthest places, as you gain less than you would gain sending them to closer locations, while time taken and fuel consumption are much higher.To end with: be careful to fuel up your aircrafts before you even start to sending them around your airport, as once they have left the gate where you initially sent them, there's no way you can send them back or anything. In other words, once the plane has left the gate, even if it hasn't taken of or whatever, its destiny has already been written - if you forgot to fuel it up and destination is too far, all you can do is to delay the beginning of their suicidal mission.Huge ""WTF!?"".

												This game would of been perfect for a time filler on a tablet. Unfortunatly on computer to be honest, it's dead boring. Essentially it is an unfinished game, no real way to find out how some of the finer points of the game are supposed to be played. Not to mention ur plane will crash over and over, being that the resource system is so slow this means that you will undoublty hit that exit game button. So much potential, but just not worth the money or the time. If a large patch was released overhauling the entire game, then i would definatly return to it. Sadly though this game was a massive let down, wasn't until i quit the first time that the game isn't even a beta or alpha, which is honestly how it feels.			"

												Wanted to like this game, as i love airport tycoons, and i was hoping to like it, but sadly i dont, on the bright side, the developers said they will do a third and that would be free for the people that already owns the second, hope is true and hope is better			"

												My review of the Terminal 2 - 1. LOADS GAME.2. Watch how to buy a plane.3. Skips about how to get plane to take off.4. Loads new game.5. Buys plane - 95 people on board.6. Plane goes to America - New York. (Oddly enough not sure why I chose this...)7. Buys emergency services.8. Weather gets misty cloudy so cant see anything at all.(This was odd.)9. Plane comes back on fire - alarm bells ring.10. Lands plane - emergency services can't do anything.(No one came to help?)11. Plane blows up with everything inside with peices everywhere - profit???That was the most strangest interesting 5 mins of my time.....			"

												For almost everyone, this game will be too buggy to enjoy.  Lots of bugs, including show stoppers, lacking in polish and no long term playability or end game.However, for die hards like myself, who are desperate to try every airport sim/game out there, you can have some fun with it.The good news is that the developer has stated that he is working on a patch for later this year, and also Terminal 3 3D.  So hopefully a lot of the bugs in this will get fixed.If the bugs, polish and long term play are addressed, this could become a really good game.  It has the potential.			"

Australia ( yeah im aussie) please if the developers of the game actualy read this then come on fix this game so its fun			"
