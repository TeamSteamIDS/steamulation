												As a regular KSP player, I've been playing Simple Rockets for a few minutes, and I can already tell we'll get along nicely! It is just as the name suggests; simple rockets. You can't expect more than that. It is done well enough for anyone who wants a game like KSP, but does not have the time, computer power, or yearning for a 3rd dimension for things to go wrong.As a bonus, most of the internal files seem to be in easily moddable formats (png, wav, xml) so I can already smell the mods for this game!

Disclaimer: I use the word simple way more than anyone ever should in a single review.SimpleRockets is a 2D spacecraft building sandbox game developed by Jundroo, LLC. SimpleRockets is effectively a simplified and 2D version of KSP (the dev even says on the store page it's heavily influenced by KSP) so as you would imagine you build spacecraft of all different shapes and sizes and send them on their way into the dark expanse we know as Space. Blast off from Smearth and travel to Smercury, Smars, the Smoon, Smenus, Smupiter, Smaturn, Smuranus and Smeptune.+Simple graphics, they do look more akin to something you'd find in a flash game but they fit the game well+Simple building mechanics, you get a list of parts and they all have highlighted areas to show where they can be attached to other objects+Despite being such a simple game you can make some rather complex things as can be seen in the Store page screenshots though I'm not really good enough to make such things+Being a simplified version of KSP makes this a useful tool for practising things, particularly orbital mechanics, before trying them in KSP+As well as a sandbox mode there are a number of challenges with varying levels of difficulty to try out+The controls are great (basically the same as KSP as well which is nice)+You can choose what planet to launch from in Sandbox mode which is really cool+You can split the screen down the middle, one half displaying your spacecraft and the other half displaying the map of the solar system+The plants (and Smoon) all feel very different to each other-There's not a huge amount of parts available to use but from what I understand the game is easy to mod so perhaps we'll see some mod packs soon-The camera centers on the planet and can't be moved which is a little annoying upon re-entry as you often have to watch your rocket descend from an odd point of view-Sound effects don't play for anything that isn't attached to your command module, for example if you detatch a stage too early and your rockets are still firing you can't hear them. Not a major issue but something I found irritating-Parts only have very brief descriptions giving you a basic idea of what they do but there's no specifications for themVerdict:Worth Purchasing (7.5/10)SimpleRockets provides a more accesible experience than Kerbal Space Program while maintaining the essence of spacecraft building. If you're a fan of KSP but aren't overly good at it, like myself, chances are you'll enjoy this one.No drama, Just Reviews?El K.			"

Simple RocketsThis review was last edited when I had completed the ""Parachute Landing"" Challenge (8/18)Quick ReviewSimpleRockets is a 2D rocket simulation with easy to use controls, basic but adequate graphics. You can either take on a preset challenge or fly in a sandbox environment. You design your own rocket from preset modules and then fly it! I found the game tremendous fun to play as well as educational on some of the basic principals of flying rocketsLong ReviewThe build screen is a drag and drop affair where modules are dropped onto attach points. There are no resource restrictions so the design of your rocket is limited only by the modules available and your imagination. The flight screen is a 2D display of your rocket. You control your rocket by using a segmented bar to select the amount of thrust and a circular slider to select the direction. There is an ""action"" button to allow you to perform acts like ignite rockets and separate modules. The flight screen can be split in two to also display a map showing your current flight path. The amount of fuel you have remaining is displayed as a progress bar.The game plays in full screen or windows mode (although with restricted resolutions) and has a pause button, essential if like me you have a young family who can interupt you at any time! Input is via a mouse.There is a good tutorial which takes 5-10 minutes and gave me a good basic understanding of what the game was about.Once you have completed the tutorials there are 18 challenges to take on ranging from a simple blast off procedure through reaching a planetary orbit to landing on a moon. Typically a single attempt at a challenge is less than 5 minutes.However, this is the type of game that you need to be a gaming/physics genius to suceed first time on many of the challenges. So be prepared for disaster again and again and again until you find the right design along with the right strategy to succeed. The knock on consequence is that a 5 minute attempt becomes an hour to actually succeed ..There is a personal high score table for challenges so you can compare your scores with different designs/strategies and try to keep improving your personal bestThere is also a Sandbox mode where you can pick a planet to build and test your rocket on. The planets are based on our own solar system.ProsThe user interface is extremely easy to useSmooth progression through the challengesAn easy game to pickup and play a single challenge in one sittingConsNone of the windowed modes fill my 1440x900 screenMarks Out Of 55) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away freeWhere I got the game from Coinplay Weekend Bundle 3 [coinplay.io].

												SimpleRockets is great. As taken from the name, it's quite simple - however there are a lot of things to do. I bought this game as my current computer cannot run Kerbal Space Program, however I still wanted to build rockets. It goes without saying that this isn't KSP so don't buy if you're expecting an advanced game like that.As far as it goes you can build rockets, probes and rovers, and basically send them wherever you want - oh and the graphics are just plain awesome.Thinking of getting it? Do it!			"

												Fun little game to mess around with when you are away from a computer that can handle KSP.Pros:- Launch rockets into space.- Launch rockets into the ground.- Fun little challenges that have some fairly difficult ones.- Teaches you mechanics that will be useful in KSP.- Recommends in game that you go buy KSP (made by a different developer).Cons:- Lack of tools for building large/complex rockets quickly.- Lack of information about parts: one challenge asks you to get into orbit using only 10,000L of fuel, but how many liters are in each tank?  (Edit: It is the number in the tank name, but there still is a general lack of information in game about the weight/thrust/purpose of different parts.)			"

												TL;DR: If you don't already have Kerbal Space Program, this is a good buy. But don't expect nearly as much depth as KSP.They call it SimpleRockets, maybe it should be called VerySimpleRockets.The developer says that this game was inspired by Kerbal Space Program, and it does play somewhat like KSP... But it lacks the depth of KSP in more ways than one. Such as being 2D-only, only having two dozen or so parts to choose from, lacking most of the happy-go-boom style and atmosphere I am used to in KSP, being limited to miscellanous challenges and a sandbox mode. It lacks some conveniences in KSP, such as selecting a part while holding ALT to quickly copy it. I was also annoyed by the behavior of the auto navigation feature - I found it difficult to stop my forcket from rotating, it would wobble left and right of my intended direction.On the other hand, it has a realistic model of the solar system. Mod support is listed in the trailer, but I haven't poked around enough to know what to mod.Complaints aside, it is, in fact, fun. If you don't want to drop $40 on Kerbal Space Program, this game might be a good alternative.			"

												Kerbal space program in a single plane.  It's still rocket science, but everything is a lot easier when you only have x-y.  I would strongly recommend this over KSP for kids.  And if you enjoy KSP, this is a good companion - it has more of an arcadey fun feel to KSP's realism.			"

												SimpleRockets is one of those games you get really addictive to it then after a few days you get bored of it and leave it, Simply because it takes to long to learn new things )like learning to land on the ""smoon"") But then you get back to it and it starts all over again.In my opinion, they should keep updating it with new fuel containers / rockets so we dont have a small variation on it. I would recomend it but only if you love space or you want to learn from it. I would rate it at least a 9 / 10 for good physics and realistic calculations.			"

												I love messing about in this game. Whether you make a ""simple"" rocket with a realistic design or a fuel tank loaded monstrosity, you will find plenty to do.There are plenty of challenges & objectives in this game but the popular ones are obviously Sandbox or Maximum Speed.There's quite a few bugs here and there but they seem to be ironed out as soon as possible.People keep comparing this game of being an easier version of KSP, but I haven't played it so I can't judge it yet.But I'll be sure to pick that up soon as it looks fun.+   Opportunity to do space stuff.(Moon landing, orbiting, etc)  Lots of challenges to do.(Possibly more in updates.)  Frequent updates and bug fixes.  Custom skins and themes.  Developer who offers support and guidance.  Steam Trading Cards.(If that's your thing)-  Annoying bugs but sometimes with humorous effectLarger and more complicated designs have a problem as one of the limitations of the game is that you can only connect to one point, but a workaround seems to be in place though.I enjoyed SimpleRockets last year and had played it for weeks before moving on to other games.Now that it's on Steam and with more updates than before. I'll be sure to give it another go.			"

												Simple Rockets is basically what it says in the name; ""Simple"". This 2d rocket building game is mostly a sandbox, there isnt much of any career or campaign mode except for the few tutorial stages to help teach the user how to play and also how to create rockets and other machines. Unlike Kerbal Space Program, this game is much easier playing in 2D vs 3D.The great thing is that this game is easily modable, the old version on android and iOS both have a ton of mods available(upping the number of available parts to atleast 30 parts, probably more), this version shouldnt be much different, and will allow you to create even more complex ships in the future.Ive honestly probably invested atleast 40 hours by playing it on my phone whenever I'm waiting or am bored, this game is so  well developed that it actually drains my battery less than any other basic game, and should be able to run on basically any computer, it runs on my old atom laptop and my baytrail tablet beautifully, as well as my i5 mac mini(You probably dont even need a gpu to play this game)			"

												SimpleRockets tries to be a simple 2D version of Kerbal and succeeds in providing the base for that. However the game also feels like it can't quite reach it's intended goal, as it's just lacking in too many areas. Just to name a few:the interface is a little clunky and lacks proper keyboard shortcutsdocumentation of rocket parts is lackinggamepad support for flying the vehicle doesn't existbackground graphics are flat color gradients and fail to convey a sense of vehicle motionthe camera is static and again fails to convey a sense of speed or the forces involvedmission design is very basiclack of Kerbals makes the whole thing feel sterile as there is no personality to itIt's overall not a bad game, but it feels more like EarlyAccess then a fully finished product.

												SimpleRockets!  Exactly what the title says, this is a game akin to Kerbal Space Program where you are launching semi-realistic rockets into near and far 'Smearth' orbit.   The graphics are wonderfully done, and the gameplay is challenging while adhering to Newtonian physics.Defintely a perfect gateway game to the much more realistic and complex KSP, especially for newbies or children who require a simpler platform for learning the basics.

												Prior to obtaining this game on Steam I have played this game for several months off and on.  This is probably among my top few favorite games.  I would endorse this without reservation and encourage it for everyone.  Although this game couldn't be said to have the best graphics of any space game, I beleive it reasonable to claim that this has some of the best and simplest gameplay of all realistic space games.  It is easiest to learn and has a sprawling potential for the imaginative soul who loves to understand how spaceflight really works.This game puts real spaceflight physics (or a reasonable facsimile) into a sidescrolling 2d solar system and allows one to design rocket ships of all sorts and sizes and shapes using components that lock together.  If one builds their rocket ship correctly and it does not explode (a good portion of the pleasure in starting out in the game, as I recall, is building one ship after another and seeing all the things that lead to catastrophic failure and the presumed death of any presumably present pilots in a firey explosion) then one can go into orbit (whatever orbit one choses), fly to other planets or the sun (if one builds enough rocket stages to change one's velocity appropriately) and land on them with parachutes and rockets and sometimes water landings).  There are in-game instructions for how to manage various feats and there are challenges in the game to keep one interested.  I have completed all but one of those challenges.There are mods for this game--at least the non-steam version--but they do not appear to be entirely compatible with the latest update.  I look forward to the possibility of mods for this game through Steam.I have seen in various updates an improvement in the types of ship components available and I always hope for more to become available.  This game is endorsed by the website AtomicRockets and I think that is a strong endorsement as they validly criticize so much that is presented as science fiction.  I would endorse this without reservation and encourage it for everyone.  The planets are out there in this game and only in understanding what it really takes to get to the planets in our solar system can one truly appreciate the value and accomplishment of the real space missions that have been acheived.

Less Rocket Science, More Casual FunSimple Rockets is a detailed spacecraft building and piloting simulation inspired by games like Kerbal Space Program. The main difference is that Simple Rockets is all 2d. While playing Simple Rockets you’ll get a lot of the same sort of things you’d do in KSP – a trial and error focused experience where the player tries to reach new goals like creating a rocket capable of leaving the atmosphere, then piloting it into orbit.Overall, Simple Rockets presents itself as a more accessible game than Kerbal Space Program. The interface is organized and easy to navigate, and should you choose to play them, the tutorials teach the player exactly what they need to do for most goals. The art isn’t much to look at, but is perfectly functional with every rocket piece and visual cue being clearly designed and unique.Check out Simple Rockets if you want a more casual take on the rocket building of games like Kerbal Space Program.

Make massive monster rockets than take 2 minutes just to lift off the ground, or build moon landers.

												Solid. Great little game for casual rocketeers like me: though I own and admire Kerbal Space Program, I find it a little daunting. In addition, SimpleRockets is tiny, and it loads and plays like greased lightning even on my potato of a rig.Verdict: two rockets up (oh myyyy)!			"

												This game is amazing. Having played this game on the mobile version, switching to the pc version gives the extra drive to enjoy it far more. Andrew Garrison the dev is absolutely amazing in keeping his community involved(and his april fools game was the best). Seriously, if you want a game with a smart, intellectual community and the best Dev look no further, you found your game.			"

												First off, I'd like to thank Jundroo (This Game's Dev) for giving steam keys to the owners of the Gumroad PC version. I was thinking I would need to repurchase the game to get the steam version, but it appears that is not the case!Anyhow, to the review. As others have said this is like KSP but in 2D. If you want KSP but your PC is too weak, or if you're not willing to fork out $40 for the game, this is quite a good alternative. While it is lacking in the amount of parts and the variety of parts, there are still many planets and even a comet (Of which there are none in KSP) to land on. You can still build rovers, bases, stations, and landers, which is great considering the games low price point. So overall, this game is great for anyone who is a fan of space games, or wants to get into one!			"

												Poor man's Kerbal Space Program. It is a great game on Android. There is not much work done on PC that differs from the Android version. Only thing that surprised me was the price. This game is really overpriced on Steam. If you have Android/iOS phone, be sure to get that version because it's way cheaper. Or wait for some kind of sale.This game is great. I love it on Android. Props to the developer for making something this much fun. It's not as much fun on computers though because of the controls made for touchscreens.8/10			"

I have watched the grow for about a year now, on it's mobile but also recently on the PC.

It's not overly expensive and offers a good amount of entertainment, while being very easy to get to grips with.

The cosmos is massive with to scale models of planets and  orbits. It's lucky that their is a fast forward mode. It's a 2D  version of Kerbal Space program (they have given credits to the Kerbal Space program creators). It is deffinately worth the money and seeing that I bought it during the sale thats a bonus. I love this game and I'm sure I'll have hours fun in the future. At only an eighth of the price of Kerbal Space program, this 2D wonderland is well worth a try.			"

												Simple Rockets is a rather straightforward game, which I picked up for about $8.00 USD during the steam summer sale. A steam port of a mobile game, the game title is quite accurate. You assemble and launch rockets using in a 2D world with a basic physics model and interface. It actively pays homage to KSP, which the author explicitly credits for some inspiration, and the build interface in particular is quite reminiscent of it.That said, one should not expect the same level of detail as one would from KSP. There is a limited selection of components, the physics model is quite simple, and the interface is quite barebones, having been designed for use on phones and tablets. Manuever plotting doesn't quite exist, which can make it somewhat hit or miss. The upside, however, is that it is simple enough to get into, and there is no resource, part, or limits other the physics themselves, so messing up a launch won't set you back anything other than time.Which is part of the fun, after all, watching your contraptions randomly explode into a billion pieces. It does come with some missions, but they are mostly for training and orientation. The sandbox mode is a welcome departure rom KSP, in that it allows you to build and launch from any planet. It could use some additional polish, however that may not be plausible unless the developer is willing to make a PC only game version. In addition to aforementioned manuever plotting, the game currently lacksmany components, and adding RCS components to your vehicles can be a pain as there is no way to show the center of gravity for vehicles. The lack of these features doesn't detract from the game or its pricetag, however, so you can get by without them.Overall, I would give this game a 7.5 out of 10, rating it as a good way to play away an afternoon, thus passing the movie ticket test.

												Simple Rockets is a rather straightforward game, which I picked up for about $8.00 USD during the steam summer sale. A steam port of a mobile game, the game title is quite accurate. You assemble and launch rockets using in a 2D world with a basic physics model and interface. It actively pays homage to KSP, which the author explicitly credits for some inspiration, and the build interface in particular is quite reminiscent of it.That said, one should not expect the same level of detail as one would from KSP. There is a limited selection of components, the physics model is quite simple, and the interface is quite barebones, having been designed for use on phones and tablets. Manuever plotting doesn't quite exist, which can make it somewhat hit or miss. The upside, however, is that it is simple enough to get into, and there is no resource, part, or limits other the physics themselves, so messing up a launch won't set you back anything other than time.Which is part of the fun, after all, watching your contraptions randomly explode into a billion pieces. It does come with some missions, but they are mostly for training and orientation. The sandbox mode is a welcome departure rom KSP, in that it allows you to build and launch from any planet. It could use some additional polish, however that may not be plausible unless the developer is willing to make a PC only game version. In addition to aforementioned manuever plotting, the game currently lacksmany components, and adding RCS components to your vehicles can be a pain as there is no way to show the center of gravity for vehicles. The lack of these features doesn't detract from the game or its pricetag, however, so you can get by without them.Overall, I would give this game a 7.5 out of 10, rating it as a good way to play away an afternoon, thus passing the movie ticket test.

												Less ""Realistic"" than Kerbal Space Program- By which I mean that unlike KSP, it has a rocket-building interface that makes sense, controls that aren't clunky as hell for no reason, no stupid ""do this to earn this type of rocket"" mode, et cetera, et cetera. This is Kerbal Space Program for people who like to have fun.			"

												Its a very easy game, its incredibly simple to get from the smeath to the smoon, and getting to other planets would only require slightly more planing and more fuel/thrust. The controls, maps, and building are all a bit awkward, and dont act exactly how they should. Its really just an IOS game, and it would be kind of fun to play on the bus on your phone.That being said this game has potential, its not a bad game in anyway. I really only see it as being worth $3-5 for whats in it current, and what you get compared to KSP.			"

												Cant play it. UGH. But I shouldn't blame this game for it, because it's either an ancient, foreign computer (which I'm using) that's tripping Steam up or that Steam was inadvertently designed to appear attacked by the games it runs to AVG, which stops the games. I did play it on a relative's computer, and I had fun launching rockets. Most of which tipped over and blew up, ran out of fuel before orbit and crashed and blew up, or landed on the moon... much to fast and blew up. I did get an ion engine craft into earth orbit, and then out of earth orbit. I suppose I'm still inexperienced with the game, although all the blowing up was sorta fun.			"

												I've been a space buff for 50+ years, but my gaming is limited these days to app store fare on my Kindle tablet.  I got SR for free from the Amazon app store and was hooked right away; the Steam PC version is identical, but the larger screen makes it all much more enjoyable, and the price is still very reasonable.  I've wanted to try KSP, but I don't have a gaming PC to run it.  I even considered buying an Xbox for that purpose; however, the price is high, and after reading some of those reviews it seemed wise to hold off.Meanwhile, SR is downright addictive!  The learning curve is smooth and simple, thanks in part to a good tutorial and progressive challenge missions to master, before jumping into the sandbox and designing one's own from scratch.  It's mod friendly and a nice variety is available.  The UI is pretty good, although some streamlining to eliminate extra mouse clicks and such would be nice.I hope SR continues to develop.  The analog tools that make orbital flights, rendesvous, trips between planets and soft landings doable work well, but could be improved upon.  The planets and moons are basically featureless, which detracts a little from the thrill of completing a mission.			"

Does it keep you around for longer than a few hours?  Not really.  Everything works pretty well, there is just a lack of depth in my opinion.Who whould I say should buy this?  Someone that wants to get into this genre of space simulation games but doesn't know where to start.  This will help show you some of the mechanics you need to play the more complex games.Overall I give this a 9/15, 4/5 for controls, 2/5 for gameplay, and 3/5 for graphics.			"
