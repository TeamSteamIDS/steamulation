												Wanna know what red crucible is like, and in particular, their dev team?I've been banned from the red crucible discussion board for a post I made. Originally I made a thread titled ""Why pay money for this"" and I basically asked why should anyone pay to buy custom guns and gear that you cant use because theres only a dozen servers and theyre always not only full, but got EXTRA people in them waiting for slots to open up. They let 4 extra people join a full server to wait for someone to leave and the first to click ""join team"" gets to play. So I asked, and a dev named kazdonut responded with: ""Its a free to play game. Dont want to pay? Alright. Thanks for checking out Red Crucible.""So I responded to that, with:I'd like to show everyone, the dev shows his exact feelings regarding the playerbase and the game in his comment, which i quote (emphasis added)""Its a free to play game. Dont want to PAY? Alright. Thanks for checking out Red Crucible.""He and the rest of the developers dont care about the bugs, about the hackers, about the stupidly OP melee, the lack of servers, he doesnt give two ♥♥♥♥s about anything but your money. Just money. The DEVELOPER who responded didnt address my complaint at all. And its just one, of many complaints, that the developers dont give a fu.ck about.They don't care if theres no servers to play on, they don't care about the bugs or the ridiculously overpowered weapons (they care about those actually, since theyre for sale), they don't care about the hackers, they dont care that a quarter of the time i'm driving a vehicle it flips upside down, the devs dont care about any of that except your money.The developers basically said ""well its 'done', It's time to get paid! Now lets just sit back and rake in the cash!"" And that's their stance on red crucible. They cant be fu.cked to write a single line of code anymore if it isnt for a chest with a special gun in it.kazdonut is right. It IS a free to play game. And that's what it should remain. Free. You're an idiot if you spend any money on this and an a.sshole for rewarding their laziness.And now I'm permanently banned from their message board for ""griefing."" They had to shut me up, you see, I might cost them a dollar. Do yourself a favor, skip this turd, and if you must play it, dont pay a cent for it, cause everything is ridiculously overpriced (20 dollars to unlock an attack helicopter) and the devs will laugh at your stupid a.ss for giving them money. Don't give them money. Theyre human garbage.UPDATE 5/6: I forgot to mention, I hope you speak spanish, because everyone else in the game does. Good luck communicating to the rest of the server theres a hacker if you dont speak spanish. Why does everyone speak spanish? I suspect because its a free game, and because the devs cant be bothered to pay for any dedicated servers so theres nowhere for them to go. Also, as of today, theyve introduced a new gun. The badger grenade launcher. This truly ups the pay 2 win factor of the game by a couple degrees. The grenade launcher is devastating. One hit kill while youre behind cover, shoot it through a window, whatever. Supposedly it doesnt even arc, the grenades go right where you point them. So you dont even need the skill to kill a guy in a room through a window. The guy with one in the server was destroying our team. By introducing that gun and making it completely unbalanced for anyone without lots of cash to flush away, the devs have unequivocally proven they dont care about their game, just money. On the plus side, if you have lots of money to spare, this is a great game. Several hundred though. Remember, the devs love money.			"

THIS GAME IS NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE SAYGIVE IT A TRYHERE ARE SOME MISUNDERSTANDING:""THERE IS ONE MAP ONLY !!!""But actually there are several maps that can be unlocked using 100 in-game currency, which is really cheap. People say this just because they don't know where to unlock it.""WEAPONS ARE EXPENSIVE AS FXXX IN THE STORE""That's right, but you can unlock them using your level up rewards. 1lv= 1 weapon""CANNOT CHANGE THE CONTROL WHICH IS STUPID""You can't change the key binding in game, but you can change it in the setting window popping out before the game client is started.At the end, this game is still very new, so give it a try. If there were a bug or you disliked the graphics or audio, give a comment to the development team, they would like to see our reply :D			"

												OK, I'll be honest.Graphics are bad, sounds are not that realistic and there not many maps in the game (I counted 5 so far).But it's not a bad game, in fact it could be pretty fun. Sure there are Russians and Americans fighting on both sides, but besides that, the gameplay is pretty fun. And it could be more fun when you're playing whit friends. And it's free, doesn't need high PC specs and the game isn't big, it's only 730 MB.So I say, just give it a try, if you don't like it you're always able to remove this game.Beware for moderators. At there player profile they're like gods, and they can't be kicked. So for them, it's okay to hack.			"

												What is Red Crucible (Registered Trademark): Firestorm? Budget Pay-2-Win Call of Duty.It's a generic, ugly, boring, poor-man's military shooter that does absolutely nothing new. Everything it does has been done before and much MUCH better. -Pay-2-Win shop with premium currency for better weapons.-Graphics are atrocious and the frame rate stutters.-No imagination with weapons/vehicles. Just generic copy-paste rifles and jeeps.-Riddled with bugs reflecting of lazy design and horrible collision detection.-Objects clip in to each other and cause visual errors.-Animations are slow and clunky,-Combat is boring and slow-paced with no real options besides ""point gun and shoot"".The game is so generic that if you've played any military shooter from the last decade you've seen the entirety of this game. Don't waste your time or your money when you could be playing something identical to this except better quality.			"

												I took my time with the game and I like what I see.I'll list the positives and negatives. + The gameplay is smooth and enjoyable+ Most vehicles control well and it takes only a few moments to get used to them+ Teamwork is encouraged+ The game is not won by kills but by completing the objectives+ Runs on old and new computers+ A free game to play that is actually good+ Not pay to win+ Give a taste of the abilities enabled in the game (airstrikes are the best)+ Almost no lag+ Has a transition between first person and third person+ Only about 1gb download- The points system is ridiculous for prices of different weapons, abilities, etc.- The majority of unlockables need some serious time investment (like 3 hours just for a different class)- Vehicles are locked with no transport helicopters available at all- The community doesn't interact well (may change in the future)- Game glitches, has bugs and may crash- Not many people playing at the moment- Maps are locked- Mediocre graphics It may be mediocre in the graphics department but the game certainly has some good gameplay, interesting vehicles and an enjoyable experience. I will edit this to a recommendation if they decide to be easier with the advancement as I can't recommend playing this game for so long when there is barely any reward in doing so. It would have fared better with a pay model rather than being free to play in my opinion. If you want a free game to satisfy that new FPS urge, this isn't as fast paced as COD, MOH or BF so it will not be for you.If you're a fan of the older type of BF and shooters, this is a good appetizer.

												Alot of people have said this, but this game is a pay-to-win game. I have been playing since the beginning of Rc2 in 2013. The game was okay, obivously the game in that state of time wasn't the best. Overtime Rc2 became better, becoming the game I would spend most of my time playing. Then RCF came around and everything change. I'm assuming RGS were determine to make money of this version of the game. So they added War chests, Legendary chests, new weapons every week. In the past (Rc2), you normally got what you pay for. Like for instance, Gold weapons cost 1000 coins. That's about $30. With the introduction of War chests, I lost over $500 dollars, but I know what you're probaly thinking. It's risky but we're talking ten year olds kids steling money from their parents, just to get this some ""special"" gun. I know, I've been there. I don't recommend anyone to this game because RGS don't care about the fans, they f___ing care about making easy money. Thank you if you spend 5 minutes of your day to view this.			"

								God, the comments on this game, all i see are casuals who are afraid to explore this game. As an advice you shouldn't judge a game just after 20 mins in - game. The thing is, that graphics are OK, they are not bad at all. Of course there are several bugs in this game, but its not pay to win at all. Whoever wants those prem weapons, they get them, but they aren't that OP, it's even easy to kill a guy with a prem weapon, if you are a thinking human being. Plus you don't just digest the bullets like in CoD series. I'd suggest people to give it a try, explore game options and contet and only then judge. 8/10.			"

												Feels like youre fighting a losing battle against cancer. Please dont play this game, the mechanics are buggy, at best. and while there is non premium currency, the rate is too slow to counter act the absurd need to pay for anything good.no weapon customization, you will have to buy currency to have weapons with attatchments. No im not exaggerating, you will have to spend money, real life money, to get a weapon with attachtments. Otherwise it\'s iron sight hell (which look like♥♥♥♥♥♥. Things like Grenades, medikits, and flares can be purchased with non premium currency, but again, the need to buy is shoved in your face consistantly. Support from the Dev team is ignorant at best and customer service over all is abhorrent. Even being free to play this game hurts. The lack of initial direction (even after tutorial) is one of the most frustrating aspects as well. The mechanics in General are confusing, even after a steady read of instructions, I found myself running around and looking for my♥♥♥♥♥ Even Sniping is weird (MP5K sniper variant, I mean seriously...) and just lacks any....girth? I think thats the word im looking for, yes girth.Also I ddont know where they got those screen shots because those are not from the game, at all. Not even a little bit.3/10 please...dont. Why cant i press no on do you recommend this game more than once?			"

								honestly the game looks like garbage, and yes is dated, not golden eye 64 or battlefield 1942 dated but more like battlefield 2 or call of duty 4. The game looks and plays like an old game, and thats what makes it fun. for once a shooter that is more of a game than a war simulation, movie, ""real life"", overplayed, overdone garbage. is it worth a play? YES!  it is fun, and easy to play.is it worth your money? YES! its free and don't listen to that pay to win BS. the paid weapons have the same stats as the free weapons. the only difference is the fancy skins. i have played for a bit now and not felt under powered compared to the paying players yet.Play it its free, nothing to lose other than 750mb if hard drive space ""OH NO!!!""if you like it good for you!if you hate it? why complain? its ♥♥♥♥EN FREE!!!!my tip: dont use experice honor points to unlock new weapons. find a gun that you like and then use your points for claymores. ive gone like 23/2 with just claymores alone XD			"

												'Red Crucible: Firestorm' is Pay-to-Win. It has it's moments when it displays what it could potentially otherwise be but it can't hide the fact that success in this game, to a degree, can be purchased.Premium weapons (those which are required to be bought and aren't achievable through natural game play) is the literal death of competetive matches in Red Crucible. They far out-weigh all other weapons in performance yet are accessible to anyone willing to fork out the cash. Amusingly, the devs of Red Crucible could argue that these weapons are 'theoretically' attainable by even the cheapest prick through the game credits accumulated by in-game play. However, anyone who may have played the game before will vouch that these credits (or coins) are ridiculously difficult to obtain in a mass large enough to purchase a premium weapon.In early stages (1 - 20) a player may not notice the severe advantage a premium weapon presents to their opponent, simple skills and tactics being more than enough to equalize the disparity. It is only upon reaching levels 20 - 26 that it becomes abrupty apparent, making these levels the hardest to level up from and compete in. It is only now, after many hours wasted, that I find myself in a position to compete against anybody without the asistance of a premium gun. I rather enjoyed the game to be honest, the matches are generally competetive and fun. Yet it is on pure principle that I can't recommend this game to anyone. Red Crucible: Firestorm isn't designed to reward effort, nor hours, and certainly not skill, but the amount of cash a kid is willing to steal from their parents. 5/10: I still play the game so can't hate too much.

								I guess It is pretty good. Huge grind. Have 2 maps as default and you unlock maps as you go along. It requires a lot of guts to call something a poor man's battlefield. This nails that. It brings elements from battlefield and other games. Lowers the quality of gameplay and reduces the graphics to make a f2p game that is designed for lower end graphics cards. Can be fun but if you want innovation and eyecandy over fun then you should look elsewhere. However it is f2p so you can try it out, if you don't like it uninstall it there is absolutely nothing you can loose.			"

												i have been playing this game for over 4 years in stand alone and browser. thanks to the steam , first time i can actually make a review about this game . ( its because , if you review this somewhere else like in their community or in facebook group , you get the ban if you had listed atleast 1 con )---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------first let's talk about PRO's : 1. core logic of the game is cool . your player view will make your game play interesting , you can run , jump shoot or get killed by a camper.this is the only reason , many players use their money on this and still playing this game , but for the rest of the community , this game is pure toxic. let me tell you why.CON'S :1. there are over 1000's of games in steam are less then 10$ , but a single premium gun in this game cost 15$ ( and there are over 100's of premium , you should sell your full home to buy them all )2. dev says its free to play , players say its pay to win , but actual fact is , its pay to survive . even buying premium stuff will only increase your chance of winning , but it won't give you a sure win.3. free guns are joke. with that bad aim , and less ammo . you will run out of ammo , before you shoot your enemy .. unless you are a camper.4. one SIDED devs : rules they make generally differs for each and every players , if a player is dev friend or a member from top clans  , whatever he do , he get unbanned and he will come back to the game , in other side for a non popular person , even if you just opened cheatengine you get a permanent ban.5. The servers : i don't know what they are doing with the player's money , the servers are still sucks. oh wait , did i said servers ? actually there is only one.6. Ego DEvs: yup , if you say any bad review , you get banned straight away in their community forums.7. it punishes new players , 90 % of players leave this game after they reach lvl 20. its because , with that low armor and guns they have to face the lvl 35 players with premium stuffs.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------so over all for players , 1. if you like spend much money and like to dominate other's with your money , go for this. get all stuff , abuse it and join a top clan where you meet the same type of greedy players , make a CVA and burn other players. otherwise , stay out of this XD.2. if you are going to still play this , then remember soemthing , save your hp's so after three months , you can atleast get one premium weapon and you can survive with that.for devs ( even tho , they not going to listen , its my job to do it ) ,1. can you guys first change your partiallity rules for players , everytime you guys only focus on selling new guns every week and support top clan players .2. instead of putting many premium stuffs , why not make this game purchasable for like 20$ and put all ingame items free , so every one can abuse it : ) , in other hand you get your money too ( but i dont think so , its going to happen , since you guys tasted a lot of money just from the weekend sales , however think about it , a good game attracts , many players and may be 100 k sales possible too )-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***** if you not even read my review , and comes directly down , then all i said is stay away from this game , till they change the pay 2 survive system *****			"

So you dont even need the skill to kill a guy in a room through a window. The guy with one in the server was destroying our team. By introducing that gun and making it completely unbalanced for anyone without lots of cash to flush away, the devs have unequivocally proven they dont care about their game, just money. On the plus side, if you have lots of money to spare, this is a great game. Several hundred though. Remember, the devs love money.			"

No random cleavage, just real military stuff.- The sound design of weapons is fine, it fits the game.- The gameplay is just enjoyable as an early 2000s shooter.But apparently an early 2000s shooter game is better than this.Cons -Game feels very unpolished/ unfinished:- I don't complain about the graphics, but what i do complain is the lack of effects this game has e.g. no bullet puffs when bullets hit surfaces i.e you won't even know if someone is shooting at you from a distance.- Pay to win. You''ll get an M16 as a starter while those able to pay will have high calibre rifles with holographic sights (which helps alot in this game)- Aiming feels clunky and unsmooth, it's only possible to aim people at close range.- You have to unlock maps wtf? Who would wanna stay and play and unlock maps?- Limited amount of grenades per day???- Spawn system of maps is putrid. There's chokepoints from spawn points, so enemy team can literally just stick around in front of your spawn point and shoot you down.- Along with spawning system is the map design is also putrid. In deathmatch games the maps are basically like 3 hallow streets/ buildings that both team rush head on.- Lack of details e.g no props / designs inside buildings.- Boring voice acting			"

Fences should be runned over by tanks and apcs3. Add a passenger gunner seat in tank ,apcs and transport helicopters for more exciting gameplay for the passengers4. Add more maps...5. More interactive enviroment and map evolutionWell, i know all of them are hard to do but with these game is 10/10 for sure #Bulletproff tree leaves OP!!!			"

								TLDR: Would be good if the devs shaped up and stopped being lax. Reeks of intense laziness, but it downloads fast enought to warrant a try.              This game has potential, but that's about it. If the devs want this game to remain competitive on the steam market they have to eliminate the pay2win garbage they use currently. They release weapons that are completely better than the weapons you are provided with, and you have no way to compete against wallet warriors. At the moment it comes across as a crappy battlefield clone, and has unoriginal gameplay. The game is badly optimized and has very unstable fps. The ui reeks of laziness, and the recoil and reload animations feel like you are shooting an airsoft gun. Textures are not well made, and look the same on medium, high, and very high settings. Your sensitivity is lowered a ton when you begin to sprint, and you cannot change your bindings. Still a small download file, so try it out nonetheless. If the devs shaped up then this would be one of the best games on steam. "

								Everyone who is bashing the game should stop, this is a game that came out on early access TODAY! It will most likely receive many updates in which make it better. All I'm saying is don't bash the game until it is finished. There is a reason there is such thing as early access for a reason. For developers to receive feedback. Instead of just saying the game sucks, at least point out where so the developers can fix it. I like the game so far, and have come across a few glitches on the elevator where the people go into the floor, and some missing audio is noticed. I hope developers fix these glitches as well as make the audio better for some of the things. All in all, it is really fun so far, so I would recommend trying it for at least an hour before bashing it.			"

												So when I played the browser version of CR2 I loved it. Then one day I logged on to find CRF. I'm like WTF is this. So I stop playing becasue I was so mad that I had just lost all of my progress. Then a few months ago I decided ti play RCF. I found out it was on steam,  so I downloaded it on steam. In RC2 I could get 120 FPS on high graphics with 12 to 53 ping. Now I get 40 FPS on low graphics and 120 to 350 ping. So that's why I don't play the RC series anymore because they ruiened it as soon as RCF came out. So Devs if you read this maybe you should take RC2 out of the back of your computer storage and put it back up so the people who liked it can play it. Also in the browser version of RC2 there was no chance of crashing unless your browser. Now in RCF I can maybe get one match in before it crashes. So all in all I think that they should relaunch RC2 as a standalone game. I didn't sit hear for 30 min of my Monday morning just so this could be reveiwed then forgotten. So take this into consideration I'm sure many people will agree.			"

												Well first off, I'd like to say this game has so much potential to be a good game, but currently RGS, or Rocketeer Games Studios is a bit behind. Right off the bat, I'd say, don't get this game. Its not worth it. But here are my pros and cons. Pros:-Unlockable sections for free to play players-Active devs that look into our suggestions and complaints-Fun maps-Vehicles maps, tanks, APCs, helis are used in this game -A variety of outfits, but sometimes, they don't have the stuff I haveCons:-In terms of gameplay, it is a gun and run type or game. Its no fun because there are people with no skills and its aweful. -Terrible spawn system. it was fine at first, but then RGS just butchered it. Its just spawn in and die immediately. Its either spawn camp or be spawn camped. -Unrealistic physics, tanks would just flip over on a ground that has a 12 degree angle-50 cal snipers aren't even 1 shot kill to the chest, you will need to use gun boost, which is extremely over powered in this game. -Somewhat but mostly pay to win. Especially in vehicle matches, gold class tanks, helis, etc are over powered. Such as the KA Alligator, or guns such as the Saiga-12, aka the Automatic Shotgun sniper and the Hellrasier which is no longer aviable for purchase anymore, thank god because the Hellrasier is so OP. -Community is terrible, although I blame RGS for letting this happen, So many cheaters, hacker, and anything new such as missions, we say no because of cheaters, so RCF has a bad reputation when it comes to cheaters-White dot servers, hackers can still continue to play because they get another chance but shoving them in a hacker lobby. But farmers or glitchers just get straight banned. Devs proirities aren't straight.-V mode, very nooby, third person user = camper- Lots of bugs and glitches, although RGS is doing their job by fixing them, they need a lot of work becuase most of them are annoying			"

Need lots of in game currency and have to unlock tiers before getting to the good weapons.- Can get repetative I would give this game a 6/10.

								After playing the venerable Red Crucible 2 for many years, I can easily one of the worst games I've ever played.How this was made into an entire game and taken out of the browser I have no idea.First off, a quick history lesson.RC:F is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Red Crucible 2 and Battlefield. RC:F was made as a direct replacement for RC2, removing the latter from Kongregate and their website. Sucks to suck if you put any money into RC2. RC:F features better graphics (yes, it's possible), better maps (well...), better vehicles, more lag, and the same ridiculous amount of Brazilians.PROS:+Graphics (Compared to RC2)+Vehicles (They actually did a pretty good job here. Well, good for them.)+Map sizes+-Weapon choicesCONS:-Performance. 40FPS on min while running GTA:V at 115FPS-Connection is so bad. Shooting through walls.-Pay to Win.-Vehicle driving.-Most weapons are pretty much reskins.-Everything is bland.-Animations-Map and texture glitches.-It's just RC2 but everything is reskinned and made 100% worse.-This♥♥♥♥♥♥replaced RC2.-This♥♥♥♥♥♥took RC2 off the internet.-This♥♥♥♥♥♥exists.-Ammo: A new feature in RC:F is ammo counters. Cool beans right? Well limited ammo hasn't existed in Red Crucible ever until this installation, and alot of vets are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mad. And for good reason. We're used to being able to use suppressing fire and being able to shoot in peace, not to mention the unlimited reserve ammo was a staple of the series. Now we get three mags. Three. These weapons fire so damn fast and can glitch out and even fire twice at once. There goes all of your ammo.			"

												If you don't have a good pc and money to afford Battlefield 4 then you can play this instead.It's kinda buggy, could be better optimized, don't know about p2w as I have not spent enough time in game.Hitreg seems fine for me, claymores are pretty usefull, mp5 sniper rifle is idk. weird?mp5 snipor reifol - that was the thing that made me drop that game but after that you can unlock M21 so it's good.Also this one was on facebook first so that made me feel uneasy too but I find it nice to play free battlefieldesque game.+There are some good shooters on fb like Contract Wars and one game with zombies that is a single player one, it's called Dead Trigger 2 so there is no need to fear this game as it is one of those games that are the highest quality ones on facebook.Try it, it's free and if you don't like it you can pretty much uninstall it.EDIT1: I have played about 5 hours or so and I have checked every mode except Survival, you have modes where you can use vehicles + infrantry and modes where you play as infrantry only.You also have missions that you can activate and by completing those you can get exp and honors (honors is the ingame currency) you can even unlock some vehicles for completing missions! You can get some exp and money from Achievements aswell but you don't need to activate them or something.So far, so good. I haven't seen any hackers, bug abusers and I have seen some people with weapons and vehicles from item shop xD They were kinda meh, there was a guy with IS gun on the other team and he was on 5th place in his team and there was a guy with your standard m16 rifle and he was the first one.I will update the review when I'll have more to add.

												How to fix this game: Make it cost $5 and get rid of microtransactions, better maps, fix spawn killing, get rid of or change melee mechanics, ad ranked, fix netcode(I should not be dying at the top of the stairs when the player killing me is looking at the bottom or when I'm behind a wall.) Ballance the matchmaking. Add a competitive aspect, larger games, I haven't played this in a while but it was fun but when everyone is using a p2w gun and you are using a gun that you just spent 20 hours grinding kills for its obnoxious.

								Alright, I havn't played very long but here is my opinion.MUCH better than RC:2 in MY opinion. I love this game, like you do NOT understand.But one of my problems with it is that there are only 2 maps. But it IS early access, so I will give it time before I nag on that.The prices are also WAY higher than RC:2 (I think RC:2 was a facebook game). That is all that is TRULY wrong with it.Now to the good part. The weapons seem to be balanced, but everyone only ever uses assualt anways, so ya.All I see are m16's, maybe an AK-74. The vehichle spawn system is also VERY nice.But tanks are a bit to OP, I took on 1 tank, 2 APC's and 2 RPGS and WON. But I aint even mad :)Overall, this is a fun Early Access game, I recomend it and give it about an 8/10.Looking forward for more!			"

								Loved to play the older version. This one has many things from it. I don't say it's bad.First the cons,- audio is bad i must admit,- vehicles feel stiff,- aiming has smoothing that isn't able to turn off,- bad optimisation (however, since one update, fps raised twice as much).Pros,- it's not a p2w game if you are good in fps games,- there are vehicles,- couple classes and a lot of weapons,- fun to play with friends.Overall, i hope this game will not die and will be even better entertaiment in the future.

Early Access Review
								Well, this game is good, but only if we talking about early access game. I think it has a future, but only if developers will work hard with this game.It is really like Battlefield for slow PCs. However, it has bad optimization for bad PCs, my PC is peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥now (Intel Core i3 1.4 GGz with Intel Graphics 3000), but it easilly can run Warface on minimum settings without lags (but with long load screens), but when we talking about this game, I see completelly random lags, they aren't depending on locations, map, they are just... Random.Well, I said it's BF for slow PCs? Well, not really. There are very big amount of guns, but they are not customisable, there are no upgrades like silencers or scopes, only ""class"" upgrade (just upgrade of damage, accuracy, etc). There are 4 classes, like in BF, but only if we talk about amount. Itself there are completelly different classes. There are only Rifleman and Sniper from BF classes, but Rifleman can use shotgun (there is only one shotgun I found with the name ""Shotgun"", genius), and Sniper can use really ANYTHING with the scope (even your first weapon will be not a sniper rifle, but MP5 with scope, genius too). New classes are Support (Medic) and Demolition (Engineer). Support is completelly imbalanced class, it doesn't use shotguns, it uses machineguns, and in this game mechanics of MG is the same as mechanics of Assault Rifles, but MG has got much more bullets in magazine (AK-74 has 20, RPK-74 has 50). So why we even need Rifleman when we can play Support? Next is almost useless Demolition. He has got grenade launchers as primary weapon, but there aren't a lot of them, they are hard to get (for second you need 5th level, I'm still 4th, it's hard to level-up here), and only one of them in the shop is for in-game money, others are for ""donation"". First weapon from this class is RPG-7, but it can't destroy tank from two shots and has got only 5 bullets! As you understood, there are hard to see player with this class.Next is the worst, only 4 vechiels. Even less than in BF:H. I looked in the shop, in upgrades, but no, there aren't buyable vechiels. I promise you, if situation will not change after early access, I will just not reccomend this game.In-app purchases and the balance aren't so much scary before you will see ♥♥♥♥♥♥-support that pwning all your team with top machinegun or nerd-rifleman with Groza, that need one-two shoots to kill. Off cource, you can buy this machinegun for in game money, but first - some weapons are just premium and buyable only for gold (we recieve only 10 gold per level, but as I said, it's too hard to level-up and this MG cost 1,000 gold), second - we recieve 10-100 in-game points per round, but this MG costs 100,000 I-GP. Oh, we can level-up and by Groza, it's cheap, but am I need to say again about level-ups?So now the game is pretty much poor, but I liked it, it is fun to play. Can't wait to see non-early access release. Don't make me sad, developers!			"

												It has been almost 4 years since I played this game. The old version of this game is called red crucible 2 and it updated to Firestorm version about 2 years ago.   This is a fun game with multiple gameplay (including infantry matches, vehichle mathes and diverse modes) and the graphics is okay. However, it is totally a P2W game, which is extremely unbalanced. A stupid premium weapon in this game costs you about 20$ or even more. Some of these weapens are OP because there are huge differences between premium weapon and common one. You can not fight against the players who have premium or legendary weopons unless you buy one as well. So if you don't wanna get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked, you better buy the freaking weapons.    I play this game occasionally and i found that there are fewer and fewer players in this game, most of my friends quit this game. The standard that determines a game is successful or not is whether the free players enjoy it. Free players are critical part in a game, only if they have the good gaming experience, the game can attract more players and make them stay. I hope the develpers could realize it.			"

								There's not much of a pay to win aspect as most people say there is, the most used gun is the berukt costing only 1 gold coin or a 1 honor point. both of wich are easy to get out of a rank up and daily drops. Most of the weapons, clothes, and drops are pretty much identical to the standard default weapons. The only things in game that do make a diference are the unlockable items that cost honor points 600 each per item. Its fun but hackers are in most TDM servers killing the mode and not enough people vote on kicking the hacker out, there should be just a simple imediate kick from the admin of server and dedicated servers wich ban you from ALL other dedicated server matches. Models on Kuvic are odd espcially the Helis and the helicopter in territories look strange and should be taken out with 1 tank shell and not 10 shots. Good substitute if you dont have a PC for BF4.

								OK So this game is about 50/50 the game itself is AMAIZING if you can get over the poor sound quality and the outdated graphics the GAMEPLAY is awesome. It's a little bit of a grind to unlock stuff like wepons and i THINK you have to buy armer i am not to sure . TDM and a Conquest (battlefield refrence) like gamemode witch the name i cannot remmember are included as well as other classic game modes such as the bomb planting game mode and such. There is Vehecles in the game such as tanks and heli's ecetera ecetera some of the maps are really well designed and are interesting. Over all the game itself is a verry good game and i WOULD rate it 8/10 just for that. HOWEVER there is one bad side witch you get with every game nowdays. The players. Spawn camping is rediculous in this game, for TDM i cant really blame it with the maps being smaller than justin biebers♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but even in the conquest game mode thingy it's a bit one sided for most of the game . there is no team voip so team comunicaition is almost non exsistant and even when you do type the chat box is so small most people do not even read it combined with the fact that everyone is just out for their own and ignore you anyway. IF people worked as a team insted of doing their own thing or relentless spawn camping this game ( if you can ignore outdated graphics and sound) was one of the most fun games i have played in a long time, i started playing at like 9pm and when i checked my phone ""ten minuites later"" it was 2 am. you will easilly get stuck into this game and with that being said i really do recomend it.To get the best play experience out of this game i would probably get a bunch of freinds and use some sort of voice comunicaition to use team work. playing solo can be kind of frustrating as theres slim to no team work.Some bonus things that i personally found interesting. there is 4 different classes +Sniper+Assault+Support+Demolitions The characters don't really change their looks witch i found interesting as you have to customise your own character and have to change the looks yourself. and it adds variation to the game reguardless that most people go assault of support. There is items that you save up for and can buy like med kits, grenades, spawn points, air strikes, the list goes on and it's a fairly decent list at that. and best of all most of the items are all usefull and not some random crap you wont ever use . thus making you select your items carefully. If you are still reading this then to shorten all of this:Worth the Download: Yes i would say so. it is only a half hour download ( Australian net ) and there is allot of items to buy with ingame cash you earn , the maps are well designed tho some are a little small, there is Vehicles , A medium variety to guns, Character customisaition , and allot of potential if you have freinds.Reasons not to buy: There is a rediculous ammount of spawn camping thus you may rage quit being put up against experienced players . There probably could be a few more bigger maps. if graphics are a big thing to you these graphics are a little out dated and there isn't much in the way of sound fx witch for me is a little boring but not a big problem.You will like this game with friends . solo may be tough. thank you for reading and i hope you have a good gaming experience should you choose to Download it.

								I don't write reviews often, but when I do, I have to be playing the single most ♥♥♥♥♥iest game that looked promising but failed to deliver.To start, it looks like it was made with Unity and runs like it too, and it's not helping it any that it took me like 6 minutes to download, and this isn't even my gaming computer!The frame rate is smooth (Because of the PlayStation 1 Graphics) and it's got the very very basics of an FPS, it's got micro transactions coming out the wazoo.I played basic training when I hopped in, greeted by a stereotypical redneck. It's really appalling when the game tells me how to look around and move in an FPS in 2015...anyways the training is like MW2s training only not as good and when you shoot the gun sounds like a very shy man whispering to his crush in a library in the Queen of England's presence while every celebrity in the world rides by in a gold-plated Limosine offering him a job as an actor who only has to ever say 1 word and gets 50 trillion dollars.Turning the camera is a chore and it slides all over the ♥♥♥♥ing place. This game is buggy as hell and broken to♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Might I add the tanks are so ♥♥♥♥ing smooth and quick it's like your piloting the world's fastest space ship except you can't aim the gun down and regular bullets do damage to your armor.)The Textures on the very high setting are worse than Half-Life 1's textures on the lowest setting and worst resolution.I ♥♥♥♥ed with my character customization to find everything looked like♥♥♥♥♥♥ and played one match only to find I had no choice what gamemode I wanted, or even play until the game previously started finished. And even then the game was♥♥♥♥♥♥ I killed everyone because they had dial up connections, flipped my tank over after crashing it into a friendly jeep just to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to the driver, and then got my♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked in when my tank ran out of ammo. And there's different classes but they're all pretty much useless, save for assault, wich is the only one anybody competent ♥♥♥♥ing uses.Worst game of the month, not worth the 715.7 KB it takes up, go get Heroes and Generals instead if you're looking for a good game like this. Go buy Day of Defeat! Or just play another round of CTF in TF2!EDIT: Alright, so I played a bit more, and it got worse. Obviously in the trailer they HAD to be showing another game, no way, NONE of the guns shown in the trailer fire smoothly like that, and it talks about destructible environments...yeah, sure. That's why someone in a house (One of the ONLY two houses you can go in on that map) Was able to shoot my tank and have it do DAMAGE with an M16, and when I shot next to him it A: Didn't do splash damage so it didn't hurt him and B: Did NOT make even a mark on the wall next to him I hit.

												Back in 2012, when Red Crucible 2 was actually good. It was a free to play game, not many people spent money on weapons or custom loadouts, then when Firestorm came along, Rocketeer just ruined it all.Red Crucible Firestorm is just as upsetting the day it was initially released. This game was and still is actually horrible compared to Red Crucible 2, not trying to say that Red Crucible 2 sucked, it was fun. Lots of things bother me in Firestorm more than it did in RC2. For instance, the one thing that bothers me the most in this game is the field of view.I noticed the field of view is much more lower than it was in RC2, may I suggest adding an FOV slider? This would probably make thousands of other players happy too.Another thing, the gameplay itself. The gameplay is laggy, the maps are not the same as they used to be, and the sprinting is awful. Could you also maybe lower the prices of purchasing Coins too? Even in Red Crucible 2, Coins were expensive, and unfortunately they still are. For me, purchasing 5000 Coins would be around $50. Rocketeer, are you all about money? Some of us people have to work hard everyday. This money is not easy to come across.Before I finish this short review off, I just wanted to mention one last thing about this game. Since Red Crucible 2 was updated to Firestorm, it's also very upsetting to see that this is only a Multiplayer game and not Singleplayer as well. I would have more fun playing this in Singleplayer.Multiplayer is the worst thing compared to FOV in this game, like seriously. The community and the players are totally disrespectful. Not to mention, the fact that this game has lots of Negative reviews is because of the community itself. For years of playing on servers, It's so rare to find someone else that speaks English in the game. I'm always playing with a bunch of foreigners and I don't understand the language their using in the chat clearly.I'm not sure if this game is exactly set to be in America, because lots of Brasilian, Russian, and Japanese people play this game, speaking in their own fluent language besides English. This really bothers me.Furthermore, if a newb were to join a server for the first time, a Level 1 usually, he/she will not be welcomed by anyone at all. Everyone on the server will stay quiet and pretend nothing happened, thus making the player leave. Maybe these people need to be a bit more respectful to others and greet the newbies to the game if it's their first time?And a wrap-up, some of the players on servers are either just straight up hackers or trollers. I am constantly getting killed in the safezone by the enemy team when I'm not even stepping out of the safezone, getting killed by the same player, over and over again, while he is spamming the chat saying ""Jaja n00b!"". These guys often will speedhack in the map, have godmode, or just having infinite ammo and killing everyone on the other team. Rocketeer Games, fix your stupid game. Stop sitting back and asking us for money to pay for expensive Coins that won't improve your game at all. If you see Mixed reviews on Steam, do something about it. People are writing Negative things about your game, including I. Gameplay is buggy, players are unfriendly, and you guys are just asking for money. If this game actually gets fixed back to when it was actually fun, I will play this once again.			"

												A really great free to play game that starts off beginners with a fighting chance. The game needs more maps but the amount of different vehicles and the well priced store really make this game worth grinding at. They are pretty generous with daily boosts and free coins for leveling up. Its very cheap to purchase coins I think, and the cost for leveling your weapons up is cheap as well. The game has a decent variety of start of gear and a good amount of different gear in the store to make your soldier look cool and blend in well.			"

The new UI is good, comparing it to the old red crucible one. I think snipers should be reworked to be actually useful (maybe prone would help).

												This is a game you'll go on to love and hate.The developers seem to be non existent, they just pull a Valve on us. They add grapgical and sound updates, and it's 100% pay to win game.The thing is, there are a lot of broken things in this game, such as the T-55 tank, which is more of a bouncy castle than a tank.However, you can just buy a ♥♥♥♥♥on of coins and special store only tanks and hey look at that, you're OP and nobody can touch you.The thing is though, if you have a good team in this game, your tank can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥ The Anti-Vehicle Mine will♥♥♥♥♥♥any tank that goes over it, or destroy it in one good blow. So you've got that going for you.But then there's the server that loves to kick you for no reason, even if you suicide because you can't change your loadout while alive!Oh but then there's more, there are hackers, everywhere. The difference between this game and CS:GO is that the hackers actually get banned instead of staying.However, if you wanna use the votekick, you can't. Nobody speak english so they have no idea what to press, and it requires a ridiculous ammount of people to kick someone. If more than half the people vote yes, kick them! Don't be like CS:GO and make everyone have to vote yes!Oh yeah, there's also no respect in this game. Nobody respects the art of war, nobody will honor you in any way.Then there's the ridiculous spawn protection. The ♥♥♥♥ing spawn can be camped indefinitely with an artillery making it so that you cannot kill them, but they can launch rockets halfway across the map and destroy your will to live. And instead of the devs having half a brain and thinking, ""Hold on, let's make it so that if the person in spawn fires their weapon in any way, they can take damage."" They just make a giant ♥♥♥♥ing circle in where if the enemy goes into, you can't do any damage to them. So every team has that going for them.And the weapons, the ♥♥♥♥ing weapons man.The UZI which is a secondary is actually well balanced, it's the only balanced weapon. The ASVAL is OP, you can't beat it if you've got good aim, I don't even bother to unlock any other weapon, the ASVAL is 3 bullets to death, and 1 shot to the head to death. So yeah, considering it's full auto you can destroy a mob of enemies without even trying. The weapon spread is also terrible, if you use your sights, no spread whatsoever (this makes literally no sense) but then you've got using no sights, which = your bullets can go in any direction, most never go straight. Oh yeah! If you pull out a grenade while running after pulling out a weapon, the ♥♥♥♥ing weapon's spread goes to the grenade as well, this also goes for the following: planting mines, planting claymores, basically using anything that you have to use the grenade/use key for.Also, never use helicopters, they don't work at all except for transport.So why do I recommend this game if it's basically one giant bug pile?Think of it this way, this game is it's own sort of perfectly imperfect world.There is nobody who is more or lesser than one another. If you play as a team and play the objectives (which nobody does, and team 1 (blue) always ♥♥♥♥ing wins), then you'll actually have a good time.You might not understand any of the 34 languages people speak in this game, but that's okay you'll still yell at eachother no matter what.As I was saying though, the enemy as all these bugs against you, and you have them all against the enemy, so go ahead and plant mines everywhere and decimate the enemy.I've never hated and loved a game more, but if I'm honest, you have to play it to get anything I'm saying here, so do that it's a small download and definitely worth it.

												After seeing on how little Red Crucible Firestorm has progressed in a year I thought of making a review of this gameI've played Red crucible since 2012 at the main site and Kongragate, used to be good back then until the Firestorm struckRed Crucible Firestorm lacks both the quality and quantity an FPS usully hasWhat Red Crucibles Firestorm tries to do is to make itself unique as an FPS and tries to stand out,but instead fails most of it.uninspired game modes, classes and maps, outdated visual, long load time, poor voice acting, numerous of bugs, lags and crashes, low replay value,tedious and bland gameplay, poorly-designed spawn points and system as well as the lifeless community.  If you were to compile a list of the most overused elements of multiplayer FPS from the dawn of the genre to today  Red Crucible Firestorm would be a much crappier version of what you’re imagining (with pay to win mechanics to the fullest extend)You could either get premium weapons (which are better than the regular ones) by either grinding for months, or pay 20$ or more depending on weaponAs a free to play FPS, this game will continuously and desperatly try to take money away from you by large amounts. Rocketeer Games Studio will be desperate enough to the point where they nerfed every existing weapon to release better ones so you woud keep spending your money like a fool.Instead of making Red Crucible Firestorm a better game by fixing bugs and major issues, and releasing any new content at all, Rocketeer Games Studio is too busy releasing new weapons and vehicles weekly so players would spend 20$ for it or more to gamble for it since some of the weapons are only obtainable by gambling  real money.In short, there is no reason to ever play Red Crucible Firestorm at this state.Never waste time and money on this			"

												WARNING: This is a Free To Play (FTP) but Pay To Win (PTW) game.First thing I have mention, is the fact that this game is a PTW. If you are not willing to spend a good 50-80 bucks on this, I would just recomend on not playing it at all. I started playing RC:FS a few months ago, when the PTW was not so intense as it is right now. Back then, you didn't have to buy any vehicles, just the weapons. The gameplay is insanely fun, if you spend the right cash on it. The game itself though, is completely loaded with hackers/cheaters so that's kind of annoying.The graphics on this game are not bad, they have a little feeling to it, which makes it enjoyable. I guess I just have to say, don't play if you are not ready to spend some cash on it. Excuse me if it kinda makes no sense or if I made any grammar mistakes for English is not my native lenguage.

												Okay, this is NOT bad game, as far as gameplay goes. It's similar to the Battlefield series, you can get in tanks, helicopters, and jeeps. Or you can just run around on foot. It's a very cool game when you first open it. Graphics aren't the best either.Now the bugs. The bugs in starting the game are terrible. Sometimes I'm stuck on the loading screen and can't get past it. Sometimes game crashes randomly while trying to start it. Sometimes I'm stuck on the main menu and all the buttons disappear except the exit button. Frustrating at first. But somehow if I leave the game alone for a day, or even just a few hours, and I come back, the game runs normally. Pretty weird. A lot of other people are having the same problems in the discusions. But like I said, overall gameplay is fun. It's even funner with friends.			"

								Shortly after getting this game and playing it for a while i found that red crucible firestorm doesnt have much changes from its previous games such as red crucible and red crucible 2 on kongregate which i found red crucible always to befun. but there are pros and cons to this game pros include the game is fun and easy to learn, most people and notice how i said most people are relativley friendly and good sport so you wont have trouble finding good competition and fun on this game (unlike cs go where everyone is a butthurt silver) the game does not take much to run on your computer of course though you do need a little more than a potato to run it decently. cons include you have limited resources (grenades, smokes, airstrikes ect ect) THERE ARE INGAME PURCHASES and yes all caps because this is a big deal because for example thee could be people that absolutley destroy you because they have better equipment and ive come across this quite a few times but you can still easily grind for money and experience and get these items i in my opinion its not exactly a pay to play game it is balanced and the payments are not neccesarry to be able to beat people. but overall i do recommend this game.

								Here are my first impressions on the game (mind that first impressions of a game are very important because they need to keep the player playing, especially in a free to play title):The Graphics options are lackluster, but the game offers some standart-ish Unity settings.Mouse smoothing can't be disabled and hurts my feelings. A lot.Textures and models load into the game as if it was in a browser, a big no for me at least.The gameplay is slow and sluggish. There are weapons that are objectively better than others and the game goes as far as allowing weapon upgrading. (P2W)The sound design is pretty terrible.This game is no alternative to known shooters and if you want a free to play shooter, there are some decent ones out there, get one of them.			"

												After nearly 300 hours of gameplay, i can say that the devs are here for your money. I am ashamed that i spent this much time with it, it was probably just me hoping to see if it will ever go back to the RC2 style format, but that is clearly not happening now(even if it did, i lost interest in it now, found better games my PC can handle). However i'd still recommend following their news just to see what kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥they'll add next.Also, the devs seem to love russia quite abit.			"

								This game is rally fun its not really a pay to win game but you can pay to win. I would just like to point out the fact that i spent $250 on red crucible 2 and since red crucible 2 is down and im playing on a new account because of steam i now want to transfer the items to my new account or get a refund or get 16000 in game coins which adds up to $250 i think im not good at math. But i reccomend this game its probably the most fun i have had on a game and teamworkish on a game i have had in a long time			"

								Played far long enough to get the idea, while it's free to play i cant particularly recommend it in it's current state. Now keeping in mind im aware it's in Early Access, it still feels very bare-bones and unfinished, it's the bare minimum of what you'd call a functional game. I'd check on it after a month or two to see how much it's progressed, but as it stands, there's simply not enough content. Badly done animations, awful sound effects, slow and janky controls and an overall hollow and cheap feeling that cant really be accurately described unless you try for yourself. There's really nothing special that makes it stand out in an overcrowded FPS market. Even older Korean F2P games from several years ago play and look better than this.THE GOOD+ Maps are large/medium sized and feel alright+ Weapons appear to be decently balanced+ The ability to pilot aircraft and vehicles+ Seems to run well on older machinesTHE BAD- Muddy and bland graphics- Floaty and unrefined controls- No voice chat- Menus/Options are insultingly bare-bones- Sound Effects/Voices are hilariously bad- Poorly optimized, constant FPS spikesTHE UGLYIphone/browser ""gamers"" thinking this thing is actually quality entertainment.

BOTTOM LINEIt definitely needs a lot of work. Red Crucible is essentially a glorified browser game thrown together on steam to try to make a quick buck. It feels like it's trying to cheaply imitate the Battlefield series, but honestly, there are much better alternatives at the moment. (Planetside 2, Battlefield Play4Free, WarRock,) Or you know, you could actually go BUY an actual Battlefield game. Check on it again in a few months of this review and see if things get better.4/10 Not Recommended			"

												Theres some reasons why I uninstalled this game;1. SWEET CHRIST WHAT IS THAT MUTATION IN THE LOADOUT SCREEN?!2. Tiered guns, basically poor man's COD but with more expensive prices3. P2W, 1 guy buys the most op weapon in the game, thats gg for the whole entire match4. RPGs and explosives don't respond as is, if you direct hit a guy with an RPG, it won't kill him, instead, it'll just clip right through him.5. The amount of lag...6. Does EVERY item in this game have to be paid to use?!7. Uzi as a secondary? Srsly?8. The maps are literally 1 sided, theres no way to balance it, unless you folow reason no. 2.9. Too little ammo for any type of combat, since after you wasted 1 clip, you have to run all the way back to an ammo stash.10. Leveling up is completely slow and pointless.11. So health packs are basically useless, not only the hp needs to be paid (as always), it only heals the player up to 75% of hp, which is really fkin stupid.			"

Dont let the bad graphics fool you It's actually a really fun enjoyable game and the graphics you dont even really notice. my only problem is that the controls are a little odd (for some things such as view changes) and that there is no way to switch sides in a mitch and that you are permanently right side view in tps mode. all in all a fun enjoyable experience would recomend to you if you are new to steam and/or fps or if you are a seasoned veteran.

												Very good game and very addictive gameplay. Even if you lose most matches, don't give up. I myself have lost more than I even care to remember and even have to restart everything in the game when steam took the linux version off the launcher.(The linux version is currently available on Rocketeer's website.) My point is, keep on gaming and don't ever give up.			"

												Thanks for dropping support for the Linux version grrrrrr.This game was great fun to play,  with 2 hours within a day I was really starting to like this game, but noo you have to kill support over night with no reason or infomation on why it's been removed. until such a time it's fixed i will not recommend.Updte, It appears support was dropped due to a bug in the linux version. yes they still have a none steam version....... clearly these devs are slow.

												(RE-EDIT)Red Crucible Firestorm is NOT PAY TO WIN. Most of the people here who have reviewed don't even have ONE HOUR OF GAMEPLAY. Sure, there are OP looking customized weapons, but you can get competing guns in the unlock tier with the ingame currency, which in my opinion is very easy to get, especially with the fact that there are daily rewards that grant you a consumable, honor points, and once I got premium currency, so therefore if you keep grinding and getting daily rewards you could eventually get something good. Starting the game people will just judge it by the cheesy tutorial and perhaps encountering some bad players that have no idea what they are doing in the lower levels, or vice versa. Somewhat like Warframe where you have to grind and you get daily rewards (pretty much the only similarity), I like this game. You may be bad at the beginning, or maybe you're a killing smurf, I don't know. But atleast give this game an hour or two before you rant about the game.			"

								its terrible perhaps the worst shooter i have ever played ever. the shooting is boreing the movement speed is extrodinarly low and look at the unlocks, the first gun they let you unlock for assault rifles is WORSE the third is identical to the default! the preformance is far worse then it has any right being and the vehical play is levels of mediocre that are dangerious to comprihend!the gun models are WAY oversized with no option to resize them in sight and the FOV is locked and low! probably to get the game to preform halfways deacently. simply put its boreing, so boreing i think my brain melted. theres potental there to be a good game they only need to add engageing mechanics where there is currently super bland shooter cutout.oh and before anyone says its early acess or whatever they have made TWO OF THESE BEFORE THIS YA MIGHT THINK THEY WOLUD HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING IN TWO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ITTERATIONS OF THE SAME BULL BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPEEEEEE!! THEY JUST SLAP SLIGHTLY NICER GRAPHICS ON IT ADD FIRESTORM TO THE TITLE AND VOLA! A NEW WAY TO ROB YOU OF YOUR PRECIOUS MICROTRANSACTION MONEY! AND YOU KNOW WHATS WORSE? THE ONE BEFORE THIS WAS ACTUALLY FUN! THEY LITERALLY MADE A GAME WITH MORE GRAPHICS LESS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FUN WHAT THE HELL HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE!			"

I spent a lot of my time on different accounts and i can recomend it for these reasons: -You dont need the most powerfull computer in the world. A 2005 windows will do.-Easy to learn, enjoyable to play.-Simple graphics (not bad and unfinished)-really intense combat, with vehichles and infantry included.negative:-not too much people play this.-Weapons are unlocked (which is a + because noobs cant just come and distroy everything)-WiP graphics. (work in progress)-Some guns are OP and are bought for real money, which kind of makes the game Pay to Win, but if you have skill, you will beat PtW players with ease.			"

All they need to do is improve the overall quality of the game, to make this game so much better.			"

												This game is, well, kind of good. Let me explain. I will first list the positives and negatives of the game then go on to talk about my personal complications with my first through playthroughs of the game.Positives:+Good Gameplay, runs smoothly on old and new computers+Downloaded super fast.+Good community, nice people+Doesn't really force you to pay for anything+Nice selection of vehicles that are easy control and spawn quickly.Negatives (Hope you are ready):- Bad Graphics- Horrible Sound FX- Over used FPS cliche (the game is extremely alike to any Battlefield game)- Not a wide choice of weaponry when you first start out (which isn't that big of a problem because most fps' are like that)- There is only 4 maps in the entire game.- While all vehicles are easy to maneveur they are extremely too fast and un realistic.- You can't turn up the brightness?- *cough cough* bad graphics.Alright now I am going to go ahead and talk about my personal experiences, good and bad.When I first launched the game the first thing I noticed was the menu, it's easy to use and fast and efficient, but is a little bit bland, with no sound fx on anything you click, which isn't a big deal but it's nice to have some feedback when you click something. I then went to the settings to see if I needed to change anything with the graphics. When scrolling through the options I noticed there is no brightness setting what so ever. This wasn't a problem at the time but would later prove as one later on. I then proceeded to start up the game after dicking with the settings and joined a game quickly. Sweet, didn't have to wait a long time so that means there is a good amount of people playing. When I finally got in the game this is when the brightness level was a problem, I couldn't see a thing and the brightness on my laptop was all the way up. Thankfully I just started using my mini flatscreen as my daul monitor and turned up the brightness on  it instead, perfect the game is good now. I will edit this later when I have more to complaim about. But over all I recommend this game, it just has some minor flaws to it but hey, it's free.			"

												good but not good enough.              the developers of red crucible firestorm put time into this game, but not enough. i say this because the graphics are a very outdated for a game considering that it came out in 2015. but i usually don't play for the good graphics i play for the enjoyment a game has to offer. And there is another flaw in the game wich is that if you are  looking for a good expierence in this game is that you have to basically ""pay to play"" meaning if you want new/better weapons or vehicles you have to purchase the special items with in game currency wich is known as honour/coins. and usually the items you have to pay for cost over 100 coins or 35000-70000 honour wich takes some time to get. if you don't want to pay with coins or honour you buy it with real money or you can buy coins and honour with money as well. So after spen about 6 hours on record i have noticed these problems thank you for reading this long and possibly helpfull review.  "

								It's a bit clunky, and it is obviously a work in progress.  But this game shows great potential.  If you want a casual shooter to pick up and play withut a lot of fluff or fuss, this is it.  I would be stoked to see more choices in character customuzation, but what they offer for customization is still better than a lot of the big shooters.

								At the time of this review, I have only put 30 minutes into the game and probably a little more within the next 30 minutes. Just imagine, Homefront / Call of Duty had sex with Battlefield, then cheated on Arma, then when the baby was born. A non-gender baby, was dying because it was too small, so they gave it steroids, letting it breath but in the long run will have small brain damage causing it not to be as smart as the others. Basically it's a Free to Play Arma 2 Paintball modIt's a paintball military simExcept you can have a 9mm M5K Sniper rifle that's OP as ♥♥♥♥It's NOT A BAD GAME but for early access, the amount of improvement that's needed is equal to a clogged toilet being overflowed outside the door, forcing you to clean up the feces that they consider natural.

								This game has quite a bit of potential, I must say. Before reading more, please note that I am aware of this game being in early stages. Brushed up textures, sounds, improved gun handling and flight mechanics and this will be quite the treasure! One of the few things that could be added is radio chatter; I've noticed that your character calls out all objective being captured from their position (perhaps he had a hunch). Different vehicle types for each faction/team would be nice to see as well. For team game modes, it would be nicer to see people wearing similar camo rather than everyone looking as if they attended a free for all (for the aspect of immersion, I suppose). A field of view slider or at least a wider field would be better as well. Being able to go prone would be quite nice but then again you would have those skrubs doing drop shots. An attachment system would be pretty nice, even if they stuck with the current upgrade system for weapons. Have an initial base weapon - standard rifle with no attachments which could then be ugraded into a rifle with a sight or foregrip and so on and so forth. All that being said, you really should give this game a chance, it can be rather fun and it's free - you literally cannot complain! :D			"

Early Access Review
								this game is great.now i've played a lot of battlefield(bad company 2, battlefield 3 and 4)  and a lot of COD(basically all of them)and i could say this game takes a bit from both of those titles. it has good gameplay, even your rotten potato can run it and while i've only played on 2 maps(i think they are only 2 maps in general. 1 for close combat and 1 for vehicles and long range combat) they both have a fair amount of content. this game is great, but not perfect, keep in mind that this IS a free to play game and you shouldn't expect the same qualities of a full priced games here. it has its cons, for example, only 2 maps (at the time of this review) and it does get repetitive after a few hours but still, it can be a good time-passer while you wait for other games to download.another good thing that i like about this game is the constent updates. since the day i downloaded it (2 weeks ago) my steam updated this game 3 times. so i'm guessing there will be more maps, vehicles and weapons to come in the future.and the ONE thing that i absolutely hate about this game is the price for weapons, for example: an ""O.K"" sniper rifle is 35k$(or honors) and each match gives you about 50-200(depending on how well you play) so it takes an enormous amount of time for you to get your first ""good""(you could call it like that) gun.but all the pros and cons aside, i enjoy this game as a way to pass time, its fun, it can be tense from time to time and if you play with friends, it could make for a good free tactical shooter.

								this game is great.now i've played a lot of battlefield(bad company 2, battlefield 3 and 4)  and a lot of COD(basically all of them)and i could say this game takes a bit from both of those titles. it has good gameplay, even your rotten potato can run it and while i've only played on 2 maps(i think they are only 2 maps in general. 1 for close combat and 1 for vehicles and long range combat) they both have a fair amount of content. this game is great, but not perfect, keep in mind that this IS a free to play game and you shouldn't expect the same qualities of a full priced games here. it has its cons, for example, only 2 maps (at the time of this review) and it does get repetitive after a few hours but still, it can be a good time-passer while you wait for other games to download.another good thing that i like about this game is the constent updates. since the day i downloaded it (2 weeks ago) my steam updated this game 3 times. so i'm guessing there will be more maps, vehicles and weapons to come in the future.and the ONE thing that i absolutely hate about this game is the price for weapons, for example: an ""O.K"" sniper rifle is 35k$(or honors) and each match gives you about 50-200(depending on how well you play) so it takes an enormous amount of time for you to get your first ""good""(you could call it like that) gun.but all the pros and cons aside, i enjoy this game as a way to pass time, its fun, it can be tense from time to time and if you play with friends, it could make for a good free tactical shooter.

												This game is very fun the thing is that it takes ages to buy guns from the store. AT LEAST lower the price or make it easier to get gold coins and those silver coins (sorry i forgot what they are called) and maybe you could costimize the guns you have. like add sights barrels silencers and all that crap but overall its a great game to play!

It built off the concepts introduced in Red Crucible 2 and made major improvements to balance, including adding limited ammo, vehicle spawners, and better weapon tiers. Maps were modified and improved, with a few failures (I'm looking at you, Favela!) and shortcomings. I recommend this game, but don't feel bad if you get rekt by the one guy with the purchased weapon.My suggestions to the team: make some servers block pay to win weapons.			"

												This game was fun for awhile, especially early on, but the game does kinda drone on after awhile and all the micro transactions destroy the game. As long as your in a good game without alot of p2w players the game is really fun for being f2p and the updates make the game more and more fun. I would recomend as a free game to play and fans of the early battlefield games that this game draws heavy inspiration from.			"

								This is basically Battlefield, Call of Duty, Small bit of TF2, Small bit of Counter-Strike and Small little bit of Crossfire...It's really fun with friends or solo! But the prices on guns should be a little bit cheaper...It also has a fair community and kind of bad tweakings (Especially on bad PC's...) For a small size I really think you should pick this game up and Shoot 'em up! Rating:9.1/10(Tip: Run on low for better performance for old, crappy or dumb Computers....And spam the heck out of claymores near the enemy spawn or the place where they usually go but they cannot see!)

								Good game, great gameplay, simple and easy to learn mechanics, fun maps. If I had any issues it's that theres not enough guns, not enough clothing, and most of the guns have the same ammo. Theres a machine gun that has what I can only assume is a 100 round clip but in the game it holds only 50 and you have to reload. I also wish the bundles could have items sold seperately because for the PMC set you get like a SCAR and a tomahawk when all I really want from the set is the jeans. I don't have time to spend farming for months to get 100,000 honor for a pair of jeans or the money to buy 3000 coins for a set that the only thing I'll use most often of it would be again, the cool looking jeans.

								It's Just a nicer looking version of the standard version of Red Cruicible 2, that was available on their website and on Kongregrate. They've added a few extra features such as customisable weapons and additional consumables i.e. Claymores and Smoke Grenades. Whilst it is easier to just throw a couple bucks at this game to get some of the better, the level unlockable ones are good enough in most gunfights. The best way to think of this game is play it as a poor mans Battlefield where most things will cost you money or will take a long♥♥♥♥♥time to unlock.Is it worth downloading and playing? Yes. Is it worth spending money on? No, not unless you wish to grind countless hours like I did with the original.6/10 would be a fair verdict. Great time waster, but not something to spend countless hours in.			"

								This game has a better hit detection than Battlefield 4 (tried CTE after a long break — nuh-huh, good luck killing anyone). Infantry gameplay-wise, it's much less frustrating. Here I could run around spamming voice commands (= no strafing!) and still do pretty good.There is certainly a room for improvement. Namely, graphics aren't particularly modern, sounds need more detail, aiming feels ""slippery"" and the menus are a bit confusing (combine store with loadout? ""Leave"" button only on a scoreboard screen?). However, considering this game is an Early Access, hopefully, it will become a nice F2P gem in YOUR library.			"

								FIrst of all, the changes they made in Red Crucible Firestorm is great, more spot to take cover, scenery and the customization, weapons, game modes (although it is like Battlefield), although it's great, there are bugs that REALLY make this game bad such as bullet go trough walls, of course in real life bullets able to penetrate trough walls, such as wood, and bricks, but Metal?, it's most likely not possible, and also the reload, the reload takes about 2-3 seconds, and it's annoying. That's what i found in this game recently, but i also wished that the maps will be free, no longer need to purchase it, and also i wish that the game would have more destruction, blood effect (blood pool, blood spray in the wall).Overall, i would rate this early access game 4/8			"

While most of the weapons and vehicles will cost you an arm and a leg in in-app purchases, I don't think it's pay to win. If you're ok with ~40 fps, put the settings on high and the game looks really good, seeing as it's free. Seeing as it's free, I would give the game a 7/10.

												Red Crucible Firestorm adds acspects from games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield. It has many guns to use and has a solid 6 maps to play on. If you have high ping I recommend lowering the graphic detail. Graphics do not matter too much. There are a good 4 classes ( Not counting vehicles) and lots of gamemodes to play on.

								In its current state i cant recomend this game due to a few bugs that ruin the game.Splash damage: I was in a APC when i was bombed, after a few seconds they laned 4 feet from me yet i took no damage even though i should have died or should have taken damage to the point 1 hit could kill me.Tanks/APC's: These are to buggy when driving upward or downward the camera shakes up and down making it hard to aim at aircraft and does get annoying when driving to a location. Hopefuly this is an easy fix and in the next update this gets fixed.Tank/APC spawning: There needs to be a timer when a vehical is spawned because if i spawned a APC after someone spawned another one we are both glitched in eachother and its random but one of us will end up half under the ground unable to move. From what i know the only way to fix that is to respawn the vehical.Driving: Im able to stop instantly making me able to stablize and fire almost as soon as i stop. When driving over some barriars there can be a glitch like the spawning one where half your vehical is under the ground unable to move. Sometimes it will blow up as soon as you exit and other times it wont but this is a huge issue thats bugging me since it happends a few times a game.Flying: So far aircraft have no use other then a reason to jump out and parachute down. In an APC im able to shoot someone down as soon as they leave and since helicopters have no offencive armaments they can easily be shot down if the pilot does not eject. I know more will be added but again air vehicals are not worth it yet it will either get you killed or you will have to bail out and again die from an APC.Stamina: You can infinatly run without having to stop. This is one thing i wish to see added as soon as posible since this does get annoying. Most of the issues are with vehicals but at this current state all i can say is i cannot recommend the game yet. Later on when a few more updates and patches come out it will be improved just its not there yet.			"

								I have played this game since Red Crucible 2, to Red Crucible Firestorm Beta to now, and I rest my case. This game is a good start up, but needs some serious work to become something bigger.Pros:- A bunch of customization options- A good balance of graphics to appeal to a wide variety of computer setups- Vehicles that actually work- A good variety of maps and modes- A smooth, great feeling Cons:- Wonky gun mechanics- HORRIBLE map balance, with teams having a big advantage on some over the other- Sound design is horrible- Class balance is whack- Needs polishing on a few bugs on controls and hit boxes on player models- While character customization is awesome, the weapon customization is zero to nothingVerdict:A very early game (Take a look at the title, ""Early Access"" geniuses), I would say is a good start up, though the game is held back by balance issues and even, a lack of players. I would say, try it out, and if it floats your boat, stay tuned for upcoming updates that Rocketeer Studios will put out that will make your experience even better. If you don't like this game, make sure to give them constructive feedback at their forums. I don't hate anyone more who say ""I hate this game. This game sucks."" And that's it. Give them constructive feedback, so that they can consider ways to fix your concerns. "

								*FIRST IMPRESSIONS**Training Mode (It's for noobs, I know this.)*So this pretty much seem like a generic shooter, but worse, It has terrible graphics and optimizations are not apparent. The sound effects are pretty much more boring than watching reality tv for 24 hours while strapped down to a chair. And announcers voice lines are so terrible it sounds like they were recorded via Skype and 2 people there were using desk mics next to their speakers.*First Multiplayer Match*Matchmaking is terrible, I clicked the play button and ended in up in the same lobby 10 times in a row, So I decide to open up the server browser and what do I find? 4 games........... So I guess other people know it's terrible too...... People die easy and I die easy, It looks like there is no real balance in this game so far. I exited the game and uninstalled because, I just couldn't put myself up to playing an entire match because it was so mind numbingly boring.*FINAL VERDICT*Graphics 6/20Sound 4/20Gameplay 4/20Optimizations 3/20Originality 0/2017/100Bloody awful, You would have more fun watching paint dry.

At first the game looks good, but if you play longer you will see what I mean, if I say the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥GraphicsThe Graphics are more like 2005 than 2016, and there are oftengraphical bugs. On some maps there are spots with totally no light, were players are camping and sniping.In general it looks like some Unity Assetpack.WeaponsThe Weapons are okay in my opinion. One of the things I like in this game.But one Problem is, that the game is totally Pay2Win.Vehicles & General PerformanceThe Vehicles are totally buggy and the pay2win tanks are totally op.The Challenger2 Tank combined with vehicle regeneration is totally invincible!Sometimes when the game hates you and you go into a helicopter you get teleportet in the void, and you have to restart your game. But if you never restartet games, in Red Crucible you will learn it!For example sometimes you cant change your weapon anymore or cant click on some buttons, or you are even unable to shoot. In all these cases you have to restart.ModsThere are in general 2 Problems with mods.There are nearly no modsIf a Mod is in your match, you better leave, because they are abusive af!To the first Problem: I play this game since last year every few weeks, and there is a flyhacker I know since the beginning. He still didn't got banned. I already have him on skype xDHackers just won't get banned.To the second Problem: I have mods only sometimes in matches. But when you got a Mod in your match, you should leave immediately!Most mods are hacking, for example using commands to kill some players for fun, and they are changing your ingamename and/or they are removing items or money from your account (Ingameaccount, not Steamaccount)I just hate the mods in this game, I am happy, that I am not banned. I have many friends who already got 30-days bans for nothing...ConclusionI wouldn't recommend this game. One year ago it was fine. But the devs do nothing on this games, except putting in new pay2win weapons&vehicles.So, If you want to invest about 200$ in weapons etc. and invest it often, because a mod can ban you, this game is for you! (But you could just buy battlefield. Costs less, and is better) "

												Round up:Graphics - 6-7/10 (Look below)Gameplay - 9.5/10Guns - 8/10Physics - 7/10Overall - 9/10 (Cos hackers) :(((((For more details look belowNote: I have spent about 5000-6500 hours on this game on browser and about £150/$250 on stuffMany people don't see the potential in this game. For a previously browser game (Red Crucible 2) it is exceptional. The gameplay on this game is one of the best i have known - far surpasses any from Call of Duty. In this game there is around 10 maps i think (not sure since new updates) and all of them are so diverse from each other - One minute you could be having a close quarters gun match but then the next you could be having a tank battle in the middle of the desert. There is one flaw to the maps and that is that they (for some reason) removed Favela, which any previous players would have known that this was the best map on this game - if not one of the best for any game. And thats saying something seeming as it is a browser based game (or was). However, the CEO of Rocketeer Games has said that they would be reintroducing it to the game. Hopefully then the game will be back in its former glory. The next thing - The guns. The diversity of guns in this game is mindblowing. These can feature from close quarters guns such as the Deagle (Which for some reason in this game is called the DEagle) to the M95 one shot sniper rifle. Gun paints are included with some weapons (which never used to be a feature) with decent designs. You can also get sights for some weapons which is epic. Only flaw to this is that they only seem to come with paid guns (or 60,000 - 100,000 honor points guns) and they cannot be bought separate or individual. So overall the guns are pretty good.Also the suits/skins are very expensive with some only being able to be bought with money (another flaw). The graphics: Decent enough for a browser based games. However they need top-range processors and graphics cards from my experience. I use a AMD Radeon 7500 series card and a Intel i5 processor (not very good to be fair) and i can only seem to run on lowest settings at 120fps whereas when i use medium graphics i can only run at 40fps (wtf????). So maybe this game is optimized more for Nvidea users. This is just my experience so no idea.Hackers: The thing that lets this game down so much is that there are so many hackers.

								To be Completely honest this game is just like Red Crucible just re textured which is not bad but also not the greatest they have some problems with the inventory because i'm not able to get in to the vehicle area at all they don't give out enough of the primary currency for you to buy things like ive played two games and i'm not even half way out of the 900 honor points there guns are also overpriced from my experience almost no gun in the previous game was over 100,000 honor points.

								    I've played RC2, and I think this game can have a lot of potential, however I do have a problem with the ""unlocking"" system. I'm using """"'s because it's not so much unlocking, as it is a locked weapon you have to rank up for to buy with either gold, or medals. I've had the server also ""Close my connection"" abruptly for no real reason a couple times, but I'm sure you guys will fix this....right?   Also, to people who complained about the game being ""broken,"" and ""unfinished"" that's because it's an Early Access title you numbnut.That is all			"

								the game itself as a fps game is nice but i think you missed a couple of important stuff like-1. change the FOV.2. the graphics are not so good even on ultra settings.3. some of the maps are really big and that's great but there are not enough players to fill the map and the textured of the stuff like buildings and so are blurred.4. there are no purchasable attachments and this is very needed.i hope you will read it and fix those stuff, other than that the game is fantastic.

								Essentially what Red Crucible does is it takes the best elements from both the Call of Duty franchise and Battlefield franchise and combines them to have the best of both worlds without the negatives. If you're looking for the next step in online fps action, this is the game for you. Don't let the fact that it is free deter you from what is easily shaping up to be one of the best games of 2015. Don't pay attention to negative reviews that say things like  ""this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; or ""♥♥♥♥ this trash pile"", there was an argument between some of the devs which resulted in disgruntled employees writing poor reviews for this game. Where Red Crucible really steps up is through it's intense multiplayer matches, that, coupled with next gen graphics and realistic weapon/vehicle sounds creates a fantastic combat atmosphere. This game is truly immersive and it's FREE!! Now I know that free to play games can often garner a sense of poor quality and a ""pay to win"" feel where microtransactions reign supreme. But fear not because this game has ZERO microtransactions, none whatsoever. And that is good news for passionate fps gamers. You have nothing to lose by downloading this game and spending countless hours shooting your friends in unprecedented 1080p beauty. I only have 0.3 hours on record as I am writing this review from a second account. Cheers and enjoy the game.			"

								Ive really gotten enjoyment out of this game so far. It has quite a bit of potential, but me and my friend came across a bug: Me and him had the same # title of Kiev maps, but got logged into the ""same"" match and it was 2 totally different servers. But, it doesnt stop me from playing and getting new things. I'd like to see a higher player count on the bigger maps, more maps, and leaning instead of having to go in-and-out of 3rd person to check your corners.Overall, i'd give it a 8.5/10 because of the lack of maps.I do recommend this game, its definitly helped with my PC FPS skills a lot, and improved my console skills extensivley, coming from a console-geek. Some of the weapons need to be nerfed, like the AK-74, is kind of OP in my opinion, and you need to buff the FAMAS so far. This has won my heart so far for Mac Free-To-Play games...-Hawkmoon			"

Unfortunatly, waiting times for the training mode was 5 minutes for 3 minute course. the game runs as if i were to play battlefield 4 on an Ipad 1st Gen. im not saying the game is bad but with more developement it could be a great multiplayer FPS.

												This game is good however there is one problem, when there is a hacker, glitcher etc you can votekick, the votekick itself isn't bad but the way it kicks is flawed, there will always be that one person who doesn't vote yes and the person continues hacking/glitching, there should also be a reporting system where you can report a player instead of just kicking, reporting makes it better as if there are various reports on a player you can decide that that person has been hacking/glitching and you can put an end to it. My views on the game however is that there are too many OP guns such as the wrecker, if you can tone down the settings you can avoid annoying campers who mow down people from spawn. Every day I go on the game play 5 mins and there is a hacker or glitcher or some dude with an OP gun that just makes me leave the game.I enjoy this game though, it's just a shame some people ruin it by doing these things.P.S PLEASE add cars/helicopters to Frankfurt and Red Dawn and shorten helicopter respawn times.

								It's a good game. You can have fun by yourself or with others. It only takes one shot to kill someone wit a headshot. It is all around fun and easy to get into and a great option if you dont want battlefield.			"

								To be honest, this game is great. It is very addicting, very simple, and very fun. There are 1 or 2 minor kinks, but overall, I have not seen many bugs. The game is paced well for the most part and matches are the perfect length. Guns feel nice, and work well. The community is ok, and I've only come across 2 hackers, and those were speedhacks. You unlock more weapons, maps, and character customization items with money earned in game, buying gold for real money, or just levelling up. This is a f2p game that runs well, and plays well. If you want to kill some time, I would defininetly recommend this game if you like shooters. I have way more than 2 hours total because this game was on Kongregate way before Steam.TL;DR: Good game, great weapons and vehicles, not too many bugs. 8/10			"

								played a couple games and looked at the store. I liked the basic aspects and the F2P system, the weapons looked expensive (in game currency) but there was no buy for a month BS and the game gives you a small amount of primium currency even. Gameplay wise, for me it was smooth but my only complaint is  the drivers animations are non-exsistant when someone drives though it is comical also the reload feels a bit slow but I guess it discurages running and gunning a little. overall this game is on the right track. Give it a try(will update as I play)			"

								Ive really gotten enjoyment out of this game so far. It has quite a bit of potential, but me and my friend came across a bug: Me and him had the same # title of Kiev maps, but got logged into the ""same"" match and it was 2 totally different servers. But, it doesnt stop me from playing and getting new things. I'd like to see a higher player count on the bigger maps, more maps, and leaning instead of having to go in-and-out of 3rd person to check your corners.Overall, i'd give it a 8.5/10 because of the lack of maps.I do recommend this game, its definitly helped with my PC FPS skills a lot, and improved my console skills extensivley, coming from a console-geek. Some of the weapons need to be nerfed, like the AK-74, is kind of OP in my opinion, and you need to buff the FAMAS so far. This has won my heart so far for Mac Free-To-Play games...-Hawkmoon			"

												I have been playing Red Crucible Firestrom for quite a whle and dominating servers daily but i have stopped ever since i came across a GROZA-M(a premium gun for whch you could buy in the store for around $20)I was in the second tier pool and seeing this guy have a gun whch is a tier above me and destroying servers eviscerates the fun in the game.And my gun, (a PKMG)could not even equalize to the overpoweredness of the gun.So as his body armor.This is already an element of a pay2win game.Secondly, the amount of bugs in the game.I was once in a lobby waiting for the 30 second countdown to expire when i somehow managed to glitch myself out of it.All the players were standing still and i was thus free.I managed to get to a usual place for me to spawncamp, and sure enough,players started running out and i got a multikill in seconds.Another element of a bad game.Even grenades are bugged,peole shootng through the walls and abusing the third person view to check behind walls.The hitmarkers are bad, showing me that i headshotted someone but did'nt get the kill.All in all,there's nothing wrong with playing this game.Its just that how glitchy and pay2win this game is offering you $20 dollars for a virtual gun.

								Essentially what Red Crucible does is it takes the best elements from both the Call of Duty franchise and Battlefield franchise and combines them to have the best of both worlds without the negatives. If you're looking for the next step in online fps action, this is the game for you. Don't let the fact that it is free deter you from what is easily shaping up to be one of the best games of 2015. Don't pay attention to negative reviews that say things like  ""this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; or ""♥♥♥♥ this trash pile"", there was an argument between some of the devs which resulted in disgruntled employees writing poor reviews for this game. Where Red Crucible really steps up is through it's intense multiplayer matches, that, coupled with next gen graphics and realistic weapon/vehicle sounds creates a fantastic combat atmosphere. This game is truly immersive and it's FREE!! Now I know that free to play games can often garner a sense of poor quality and a ""pay to win"" feel where microtransactions reign supreme. But fear not because this game has ZERO microtransactions, none whatsoever. And that is good news for passionate fps gamers. You have nothing to lose by downloading this game and spending countless hours shooting your friends in unprecedented 1080p beauty. I only have 0.3 hours on record as I am writing this review from a second account. Cheers and enjoy the game.			"

								Essentially what Red Crucible does is it takes the best elements from both the Call of Duty franchise and Battlefield franchise and combines them to have the best of both worlds without the negatives. If you're looking for the next step in online fps action, this is the game for you. Don't let the fact that it is free deter you from what is easily shaping up to be one of the best games of 2015. Don't pay attention to negative reviews that say things like  ""this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; or ""♥♥♥♥ this trash pile"", there was an argument between some of the devs which resulted in disgruntled employees writing poor reviews for this game. Where Red Crucible really steps up is through it's intense multiplayer matches, that, coupled with next gen graphics and realistic weapon/vehicle sounds creates a fantastic combat atmosphere. This game is truly immersive and it's FREE!! Now I know that free to play games can often garner a sense of poor quality and a ""pay to win"" feel where microtransactions reign supreme. But fear not because this game has ZERO microtransactions, none whatsoever. And that is good news for passionate fps gamers. You have nothing to lose by downloading this game and spending countless hours shooting your friends in unprecedented 1080p beauty. I only have 0.3 hours on record as I am writing this review from a second account. Cheers and enjoy the game.			"

								It feels like every other shooter, but that is not a bad thing. Red Crucible: Firestorm is a shooter that you instantly know how to play if you play FPSs with a keyboard and mouse. Although struggling behind in terms of gameplay features and gameplay elements, it feels nice in the hands (even though the default sensitivity might be really sluggish for some). I feel confident to see where this game goes. In the end, Firestorm has potential to be that free FPS killer we would all go to to play.			"

Awesome gamemodes including survival and conquestCONS:1. graphics are ok but not the best and get really bad if u put them on low2. kind of ping lag in vehicles but not too bad unless you're the passenger3.

								It has potential. Its also a little odd that people who played it for only a few minutes bash it. Early Access games are always in different stages of completion when released to us and I think a lot of people forget that. rather they think that being a Steam member means that they get exclusive access to a nearly finished game...because they were awesome enough to install Steam. I really enjoy watching Early Access games develop while others seem to become disenchanted with the process. Those folks should just stay away from Early Access. It only aggravates them.After playing for a little while (and Im not sure why Steam has my time so low) I can tell what they are trying to achieve. It feels like a cross between Battlefield, Insurgency, and older CoD. Since the player has the ability to set various mine types, toss various grenades, AND call in an air strike, it really give each player the ability to change the course of a battle. That is something that is missing in certain games like Insurgency or the other two aforementioned. Since a class system limits your ability to effect change during a battle, you do not always have an opportunity to be a ""game-changer"". If the devs stick with this, and polish the game to completion, this will become the central feature that will make this game different than others. Just try it out and you'll see what I mean. How many times were you playing BF, CoD, or even Insurgency and you see an opportunity to do something but cant due to class restriction? I know there are many times that I see a tactical strike or manuever that I cant do but someone else can...and they miss that window...and Im screaming at the monitor. In Red Crucible there are less missed opportunities. And that makes the basic structure of the gameplay and character foundation refreshing.BTW, its free. Just try it out. It downloads in seconds...literally.			"

												I played RC2 on browser for about 1 year. Then, I decided to try this sequel but to be honest, I was dissapointed. This sequel, is a pay to win. Apart from the old Red Crucible 2, playable on browser, this game has not changed much. The graphics are pretty much the same. No new maps for almost 3-4 years. The only thing coming out are expensive weapons, which can give you a massive advantage if you decide to purchase them. The cost is pretty high also. Very unbalanced. Very repetitive and also sometimes, server failures.			"

								Hey, Ozzny here, i'm an old player, almost 2 years playing the old update ""RC2"" and i am in raking.So, in my opinion RCF is a great game, although it has some bugs but its being worked on.I see people saying ""this game sucks"" , ""no recommend"". Do not judge without even playing for like 1 hour at least. If the game is on early acess its because its being worked on and constantly updating. RGS are working hard to make the game better and since the release, they already improved the game a lot by listening to players feedback and that's good for the community.Another thing, the game hasn't only 1 map, don't worry it has 6 arenas and 1 coming soon, you guys can't unlock them but that must be some bug and i'm sure it will be fixed as soon as its possible.Anyway this game is a Free2Play and not Pay2Win so it worth to download it and give it a try!

												Nope. It's just not a good first person shooter. You are better off with CS:GO. The movement keys are one of the standard FPS games model. Basically, the WASD movements, G for grenade, Shift for Sprint and C for crouch. The game felt extremely unsmooth compared to games like Call of Duty, things like aiming, throwing the grenade and shooting behind a wall felt unpolished. Pay to win and the 750 coins for $10 just blew it for me.PROS1. Interesting mapsThe map I played was Kiev, where you fight onboard an aircraft carrier. Although, you have that in the Battlefield series.2. Map interactionsYou get to use the elevator to move between the top deck and middle decks of the aircraft carrier which I found fun.3. Friendly Fire SystemIf you aim over your ally, an X will appear to prevent you from shooting them. A bit better than friendly fire off/on.CONS1. Pay To WinIt's kind of obvious. Just look at their cash shop for more information. Best deal is 750 coins for $10 and that's a one-time offer. 750 coins won't even buy you a good gun, they cost a 1000 coins.2. So Much GrindingYou actually have to unlock guns, maps and tanks, not just achievements. I had to pay 25 coins for a map called Frankfurt. It boggles the mind why you even need to grind for maps. I think the developer really believes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about extending player grinding. I got very turned off by this.3. Unpolished Partsa. Aiming Down the SightToo slow. It feels fake.b. Throwing the GrenadeMy grenade actually bounced up a slope.c. ReloadingToo slow.d. Shooting from behind a wallI think my gun jams if more than 50% of your body is behind the wall, so you can still see the enemy but you can't shoot.			"

												I would Highly recomend this game if you are willing to spend money. What I am really saying is it is a pay to win game. I obviously being the fool I am spent $10 on this game and I am enjoyiing it. But if you look at it in a fair light if a game is free then there must be some way for the creaters to make money. That is why I do not understand people who are ranting and raving about a game being a pay to win. I said that but I wasn't complaining about it. Now there is a pretty bad problem that needs to be fixed and it is concerning what I purchased. I bought an M4A1. A basic gun I was so exited about whipping it out in a match and destroying everyone in sight. But unfortunatly when I took it out and looked through the sight I couldn't see through. There is some weird glitch blocking my view when I aim. This has never happened with any other gun. I would be satisfied with a replacement or a refund so I can get a different gun. Now besides that everything else is ok. Some maps are weird and spawn camping gets pretty bad at some points in a game. I really hope they fix my request and for a final overall rating I will give it a 7.5/104/1/17Well after I wrote this review I played the game and my gun was fixed. Now it is up and running like it should be thank you for reading my review!!			"

												This game is only fun when playing with friends. They have maps that are way too wide open for my opinion, you have to run like 1000m from A to D. Without any friends it will get boring really REALLY fast. I went to a match where the enemy team only had 1 player and we had like 6 players. I don't know what to say about this game, it's just bad, not really bad. The good/okay things are the controls.✦✦✧✧✧			"

												I would Highly recomend this game if you are willing to spend money. What I am really saying is it is a pay to win game. I obviously being the fool I am spent $10 on this game and I am enjoyiing it. But if you look at it in a fair light if a game is free then there must be some way for the creaters to make money. That is why I do not understand people who are ranting and raving about a game being a pay to win. I said that but I wasn't complaining about it. Now there is a pretty bad problem that needs to be fixed and it is concerning what I purchased. I bought an M4A1. A basic gun I was so exited about whipping it out in a match and destroying everyone in sight. But unfortunatly when I took it out and looked through the sight I couldn't see through. There is some weird glitch blocking my view when I aim. This has never happened with any other gun. I would be satisfied with a replacement or a refund so I can get a different gun. Now besides that everything else is ok. Some maps are weird and spawn camping gets pretty bad at some points in a game. I really hope they fix my request and for a final overall rating I will give it a 7.5/104/1/17Well after I wrote this review I played the game and my gun was fixed. Now it is up and running like it should be thank you for reading my review!!			"

								Since downloading the game I have had some good times playing this. Red Crucible back in the day was known for its tedious sound design, awful graphics and funny but annoying art. This is.. well its the same but with some nice graphical addtions. The gameplay is smooth 'To a Degree' and the feel of the game is almost identical to Counter Strike. However, my major cutback on me giving this game 100% love is the system strain. It really does juice my custom build for what the game has to offer. Overall, Its a nice game and good for its price! Give the developers some time and this will sure be a massive hit in the future.			"

								WWWOOOWWWWok so im lookin for some new f2p games on steam and i see this now i havent play red crucible1 or 2 so i dint know what to expect form it. so i download it and load it up and realise its hard to find antbody to shoot!your runing around in maps the size of battle field 3 and 4 maps witha 16 player limit?becuase of this my favorite map was resources becuase its at a COD level of size.and thean i had so much fun.i highly recommend this game to people new to the first pesron shooter  genera becuse its soooo new that every single player basicly sucks at it.i swear that 9 out of 10 people are still useing the first gun they give you.oh yeah and one thing that sets red crucible firestorm apart from the rest is that theres no currency purchase or vip.how manny mmo games for free have you played that have currency only purchasble with real money.keep in mid it takes a while to get enough to buy a new gun but its so fufiling to shoot and kill your first enemy with it.you can buy it but its not chesp 1 real dollar (in USD) is woth 5 coins in game.-proseasy to lurn mechanics and controlsgreat level design if it wernt for the tiny player countbalanced weapons (seriously the starting weapon kills in like 3 hits and its a assult rifle)a wide range of vehiclesscarly fast matchmakeing lobbyno purchasable currency-consa terrible in game chatno availible mic useagnoo music when in gamenot alot in the the way of settingsREALY hard to get the in game curency.

The game also provides great customization and from playing the new updates I can tell that the developers are improving the customization of your player, weapons, and vehicles I am also pleased with the little to no bugs that I have seen during the recent updates. I also must say that the upgrade system for you guns works well and when you do upgrade you tell right away the improvement of your weapns. Cant wait to see more from this game interms of gameplay, weapons and attachments!			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to rate this game up because you get good entertainment for being a free game. It is somewhat reminiscent of the Battlefield games, but with fewer players, so basically like the console version. It is early access and shows potential for what it already has.The vehicles are well designed and seem to be balanced. The guns seem fine and shouldn't need tweaking. What the game really needs to shine is a larger player-base and larger servers.Honestly, the fact that a game of this substance is free is pretty neat. The game is under a gigabyte in size but still has a lot of assets in it.Try the game out if your interested. It's around 795 MB, which shouldn't take long to download. The gameplay can be slow at times, but the maps are fun to roam around and you'll find enemies eventually.7/10 for its current early access state			"

TL;DR AT BOTTOM OF REVIEWAlthough I don't care much about the game's aesthetic value (or lack thereof) and poor graphics, or the fact that it's incredibly pay-to-win with yet another poorly implemented progression system, what really annoys me is that its mechanics within matches (relating to combat, movement etc) are completely broken, unbalanced, illogical and in various ways have ripped off games that have been more successful without sticking with a recurring theme throughout (If you'd like to know what I mean, search for gameplay of any of the Red Crucible games (since they're all the same). See if it interests you, keeping in mind a comparison of the game in question and another that isn't free to play - For example, Insurgency).As a result, the community consists almost entirely of people who barely know that the mouse buttons are used to shoot and aim down sights or through a scope and that the W, A, S and D keys are used to move the in-game character around a given map as anyone else has probably stopped playing the game by now.I've found that many Red Crucible players are quite toxic as well, and I've had a couple of 'hackusations' in my five hours playing this game, which does well to illustrate my aforementioned implication regarding the low median skill level of players.The game's maps are poorly designed and the majority are hidden behind in-game purchases; this, in my opinion, is a stupid decision from the developers as it segregates the game's community - Even more so since it's hard to find the page from which additional maps can be purchased - Many players will play nothing but the few maps offered to them from the very beginning.---------------------------------------------------Clearly, I wouldn't recommend this game. Here are some alternative games that I'd recommend playing instead if you're looking for a first-person shooter that doesn't cost money -Unreal Tournament 4 - An arena shooter that's in development and completely free as opposed to being free-to-play. The developers of the game are happy to take suggestions from the community, and everyone I've come across in said community whilst playing the game is extremely helpful and positive.Dirty Bomb - Despite having idiotic developers who don't listen to the game's community at all, the premise of its shooting, movement and map layouts is sound and it's one of the most satisfying shooters to play that isn't an arena game.Contract Wars - I personally dislike this one for similar reasons to why I dislike Red Crucible, but it's basically a step up in every possible way and far more focused on infantry combat as opposed to vehicular fighting. It's also browser-based, and its progression system is far better designed.Urban Terror - An open-source game with an HD version currently in the making. Its slogan is 'Fun over Realism' and this is reflected in gameplay.Alternatively, a game like Battlefield 4, which this tries quite hard to mimic, can be purchased from♥♥♥♥♥for less than ten dollars. I picked up the deluxe edition for twenty pounds during an O r i g i n sale, and its predecessors can be bought for even less. I've since seen similar sales offering the same discount multiple times, so keep looking on Origin if you're interested (I acknowledge that O r i g i n is evil, but it's still better than the Red Crucible series). Insurgency is also on sale often on Steam and various other websites, with its current price on♥♥♥♥♥being just over three pounds. It's a far better game from a technical standpoint, and New World Interactive have proved multiple times that they respect their community.---------------------------------------------------TL;DRWatch a bit of these two videos. If you think the first game looks better, don't bother with Red Crucible and try something I mentioned above.If you think the second game looks better, give it a go. Seriously, though, you're missing out on some really good games and if your budget really is zero you should also try the games I suggested above.---------------------------------------------------An example of the high skill ceiling in other games like Unreal Tournament.Red Crucible: Firestorm gameplay by a well-known (Relatively speaking) Red Crucible Youtuber.If your budget is greater than a few pounds, however, close this page, buy Insurgency, Battlefield, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or any equivalent paid shooter, and make the most of your newly acquired game(s).Edited to prevent Steam's censorship of the word 'O r i g i n'Edited once again: From looking at other negative reviews for Red Crucible: Firestorm, it seems that someone is going through all of them and blindly rating them as being unhelpful. This is yet another example of the toxicity and stupidity of the community.			"

Early Access Review
								I gave this game a try and it seems okay. It's Early Access right now so hopefully some of the issues will get figured out before final release.The gameplay is kind of fun but there are some definite problems that make it a bit annoying at times. One thing I thought was annoying was how the run key isn't like a regular run key. When you hold run, you are forced to run forward. You can turn your mouse from side to side when running, but, you cannot strafe whatsoever. Also when running you can not pull up your gun at all. You have to stop to shoot, but even when stopping to shoot there is a split second where you still can't aim. This can be annoying when fighingI also had issues with shooting over crates. Maybe it was just me, but every time I would be behind a crate and my crosshairs above, and I have someone in my sights I can't seem to ever hit them, like maybe the bullet isn't making it over the box, I am not sure.There are a ton of items & weapons in the game. When using items, you have to buy more because they each only seem to have one use. I loved using the airstrikes, that was fun stuff. Weapons seem to unlock as you level, or may be purchased. When they unlock however, they still need to be purchased (Although I don't know if they are cheaper this way..? maybe??)The maps are a strange situation once again. You start on Kiev and can only access that map until you level up and unlock other maps. These other unlocked maps must also be purchased either in game money or real money. It's of a strange setup because I would think that it could split the playerbase somewhat. Maybe I'm wrong.When you level up in game, you earn gold and in game money (honor I think). When you complete a map I think you earn honor, but no gold. I made 2 levels when I was on, and got 15 gold each one. That's not really enough to get anything decent though.Here's my very first playthrough video if you want to check it out.


YouTube™ Video: Lets Try Games - RED CRUCIBLE: FIRESTORM - Air Striking & Bullet Shooting 

			Views: 521		

			I was looking around on Steam last night and saw Red Crucible: Firestorm just came out. It's Free to Play and in Early Access. It's a FPS type of game. Sounds okay to me, time to check it out.		

I would recommend this game because I did have fun playing. It's a bit clunky and the animations are a little basic, but it's still in Early Access and it is Free to Play so there is no loss if you don't like it. Give it a shot, why not :) "

												First off, I've got more then 2K Hours invested into the game, but I play on the standalone and not this version, so trust me because I know what I'm talking about Mister Level 30 talking to you youngsters here.Now for those who's wondering if it's a Pay2Win, I'll be straight with you- no, it isn't, you can work towards getting a Premium Gun unlike other games, every 7 days you get a chance to win up to 100 coins, everyday you log in you get a reward a consumable, XPs or Honor Points. So if you're super lucky, you can earn up to 1,000 coins in about 10 weeks, or save up the 15 coins you earn each time you level up.Why does a single premium cost about 20 bucks? because they don't want the game infested with premium users, for those who want a small advantage of not showing up on the radar and more ammo capacity you'd whip out your wallet and give them about 20 bucks, but the weapon from the Class Section is just as good, just about 10 bullet less and you show up on the radar, because I'll be honest with you guys, every weapon has a tracer, so it's already pretty balanced out, it's only a big advantage in a Search and Destroy match where you arm the bomb or defuse it, and people rarely play that match.Now if you're new and you're wondering where these 600 Honor Points weapon and armor are follow these steps carefully.1. in the menu area, click on Character.2. click on the UNLOCK button at the top, next to Inventory and Store.3. and there you have it, this is where you'd find your Weapons of all Classes: Assault, Support, Sniper, Demolition- they even have your Secondary and Melee as an option.4. this also where you unlock maps a.k.a ""Arena""5. Appearence is the Armor, if you're wondering why you're dying so fast, it's because you need armor, me personally, don't get the helmet, get the armor, because every weapon is a one shot to the head, although the Developers have told me that Helmets are suppose to add to how much armor you have, but they're pretty useless in my opinion, so don't waste Honor Points (HP) on them.Click on Browse to open the servers and matches, at the top you can see 2 option Create and Browse, the Play button is an auto set up match.Now this is one of the tricky parts of the game, when you reach lvl 20 you're going to have to face players 2 tiers above you, this is NORMAL, every high ranked players have all been through this, if you're wondering why they do this I'll give you a few ideas why-1. Lack of Players.2. Most players rarely play Vehicle matches, they want to encourage gameplay in vehicle maps, which is why once you've hit lvl 20- I'll give you 2 options at this point, try to use demolition as a weapon, it's really hard to do but it's a ONE SHOT KILL, which is why the blast radius is very small, you have to have direct impact- or you play the vehicle maps, unlike infantry maps vehicle maps will stay the same, the tank deals the same damage, the Choppers do too, just about everything does.Things that are considered inappropriate and can result in short and PERMANENT bans are posing as Moderators, Cursing in the public chat, and HACKING, if you find hacks on this game report to the developers immediately, at http://community.rocketeergames.com/categories/bug-reports If you find a hacker click on their profile copy their Gamer ID, (optional) record them or take screenshots, preferably recordings, report it the link above as well, this works for people who you see hacking or for people who are cursing or threatening you or making you feel uncomfortable, take a screenshot, the Developers and the community don't take kindly to them so rest assured they'll be dealt with- they have 2 warning one might be a 24 hour ban and a warning the second is Permanent.In a hacker's situation it's a permanent ban no warning no nothing, it doesn't matter if they have payed money or not, hackers are hackers in the community and the Developer's eyes, we have morals, there are a lot of people who record hackers and are very regarded on the forums, bounty hunters in a way.The game has evolve a lot in a year, there have been weapons, maps, and vehicles releases, we are now implementing a Achievement and Missions into the game, where you can earn up to 5K Honor points and 50 coins from doing them, though easy it takes a lot of time investments.Now if you're here and you're complaining about Graphics, yeah it isn't the greatest, but it's decent for a Free Game, if you want better you can spend your money elsewhere for it, it's a lot more then any other FPS facebook games you see out there, in the mass of CSGO wannabes this is a an okay game a lot like Battlefield.The recoil has a pattern so it's easy to control, which is what makes it a fun and easy game, one that is simple and easy to pick up on, if you do good in any FPS games give it a try, if you don't like it you don't like it, everyone has their preferences, and that's respectable, most players quit because the game gets dule for them- which is why I recommend making friends on the forums not ingame, because you lose that connection since you aren't close, we are a family on the forum, we look out for one another- no one is bigger or better.If you ever encounter any bugs, glitches, or issues with the game goto http://community.rocketeergames.com/categories/red-crucible-firestorm-beta-bugsBut if you ever need me, when no Moderators or Developers or responding I'll be glad to help, message me on the forums athttp://community.rocketeergames.com/profile/Ravenor Via Youtube (I prefer it if you messaged me on the forums, but if there are any technificulties you're welcome to use whichever media you prefer)https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMuBl0zaRohQdNNr2hLAznQI hope I have helped you, I've been going over a couple of these reviews and they aren't very descriptive or helpful, the way I see it- when giving criticism be sure to put things that can be improved on, otherwise they are just Spams, give real Opinions, not just 1 or 2 sentences based on how it was for you, that's all Folks if you stayed this long props, with that said, Peace ✌			"

												Oh look! Another negative Review for me to read! Seriously. By the time you read this review you have probably seen about 20 negative reviews and 2 positive reviews. What can i say about this game? Well, first of all you will get fuc.king rekt when you start out. 2, it is riddled with bugs. The devs cant bother about doing jack sh.it if you cant purchase a chest to get it or if it cant earn money. 3, the graphics are trash. I play at 20 fps at high graphics. On a HP Pavilion. I think ive said enough about the graphics. 4, you start out with an assault rifle with 3 clips. You will be saying F*CK! IM OUT! before you even hit someone. 5, if you give a review on their forum or facebook page with 1 con you will get your♥♥♥♥♥banned from the forum/facebook page. I have seen quite a few reviews saying they got banned just because they reviewed the game there. I expect by the end of 2016 they will fix 1 bug in your game for like $50. What number are we on? F*ck it. The ranking system is SLOW. it takes forever just to rank up. Most people stop playing before level 25. 7, you start your first game then you come up against level 30 fuc.ks with tanks and♥♥♥♥♥♥and get ♥♥♥♥ing dominated. But its not a game without someone's tank giving up on life and flipping the fu.ck over.Jokes and sh*t No Man's Lie is better.Heroes and Generals is less P2WIts not pay to WIN, its pay to SURVIVE 30 SECONDS.Devs cant be bothered to add a damn potato if it cant be unlocked from a 20$ chest. NEW ITEM:(insert name or inanimate object here) Purchaseable from the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥chest.The sound effects are probably made by rubbing 2 ♥♥♥♥ing pickles together. End of this review. Oh wait! Theres more♥♥♥♥♥♥Know what you SHOULD bother with? TOXIKK. Its free. A new player could face a dev and have no disadvantages other than skill. Full version is ♥♥♥♥in cheap too. 11 dollars on sale. needs more players. Install that instead of this garbage.-100,000,000,000,000,000.420/2 "

												It is a fun game to play, but there is usually hackers everywhere. I dont really like this game anymore.And it takes forever to level up, literally forever. But yeah so its fun to ♥♥♥♥ around with hacks, but it isnt really fun anymore, the graphics are like 2003 comparing to 2016 games are much better than they used to be.			"

												Despite what the reviews say, I think you might as well download this game and give it a shot. The game only takes a few minutes to download and only takes about 1GB of space. The game is vey arcady, your not gonna get any quality ""MilSim"" gameplay out of this. It is very p2w but I haven't encountered anyone yet who completely dominated the game since their items were so powerful. I haven't spent a cent on this game and still manage to get about a 2 kdr every round, so this game is not awfully unbalanced. I enjoy infantry combat over vehicular and play infantry only much more, so I can't make any remarks on the vehicles. I encourage anyone who actually read my review to at least give the game a try, and uninstall it if its not appealing to you.			"

								My RCF Review overallA slight introductionAlright, Elite Rift here, and some of you may know me from older times, like RC2 where I was named Elite Hunter 39, and RC1 where I was named Excalibur 38.Now I have been playing Red Crucible for 5 years now.As a long-time player, I would like to say that Red Crucible has gone from a simple multiplayer tank-fighting game, to an all-out infantry and tank hybrid war in RC2.Now I understand RC2 had lesser graphics.I understand how RC2 allowed you to carry multiple weapons AND switch the weapons in the battlefield, but those weapon-switching days are gone.Seriously, I found it fun too, but look at other games like COD or Battlefield. They don't allow loadout changing in the battlefield. And thus it was removed.The RGS has gone for a more realistic development to the game, and are currently working on releasing a new map called ""The Favela"".RGS has improved the graphics from RC1, and quite frankly, they're still starting out, atleast two months fresh from the update, optimization can still be possible.The ConsAs for the cons in the game, there are some, and I will list down four of them.1. Improve the sounds for almost all the weapons. Sure the new sounds compared to RC1 show a vast improvement, but if you're going for realism, you have to be able to FEEL the power of a 7.62 mm caliber-rifle firing out.2. Some rifles in RCF are designed in such a way that the IRL stats compared to the RCF design doesn't fit. The SCAR for example. Designed as a SCAR-L ( 5.56mm ), however it's stats indicate that it's a 7.62mm gun. It also carries the normal 30 round 5.56mm magazine, and it's easily OP.3. Optimization. I understand you guys are working hard to release Favela and other gun updates, but I would like to suggest that you work on Optimization for even a bit more before moving on.4. OP weapons. I'd like to give an example but I think you know what I'm talking about.5. Katana length makes it looks like a Fang already.Overall?RCF is a major improvement to the game.The graphics, how the guns have been ""balanced"".They have come a long way from RC1, and I'd like to say that they've certainly improved.I would like to say however, those cons above are suggestions for improvement.RCF has great gameplay indeed. But it certainly holds room for improvement. A lot more, in fact.			"

								Hello Darkness My Old Friend=====================Haven't played this game in ages, nor did I ever see it coming to Steam.If you think it's a pay to win, just you wait, the original browser unity game titled ""Red Crucible: 2"" was ♥♥♥♥ing terrible but somewhat entertaining with pay to wintactics.  The guns on it were just downright rediculus, and I only played to gamebecause it was the only game my Mac OSX could run.  I spent maybe 150 dollars max on buying dozens of costumes including the Santa costume, zombie costume, and manyother stupid♥♥♥♥♥uniforms and♥♥♥♥♥♥to make me look cool.  I bought so many guns to the pointI had to figure out what weapon did the most damage even though they were one shots.  Make no mistake that it is still the same damn game, with some music and a graphical upgrade.Play at your own risk, the game ♥♥♥♥s with your head with the idea of you being a god tier soldier,even though there is just two weapons to chose from now, it will get worse, trust me, this is the calmbefore the storm, down vote the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game, kick it the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥crack of the steam store.I will never forgive what it has done to me.

								I have literally played this game for 50 minutes and I can all ready tell you it sucks.The gameplay is horrible. Most of the players are terrible at the game, making it too easy to be fun. I got 23 kills and 5 deaths my first match, so you can see where i'm coming from.The controls are fairly normal for an FPS game.The audio is not actually that bad. It's good enough to make you feel like you are in a paintball game but thats about it. All of the guns sound like pea shooters, and the environmental sounds are trash.The visuals are decent.The game is pay to win, NOT free to play. I matched with one individual with a RPK machine gun and he pretty much dominated the battlefield because the gun literally kills in one shot.All in all, its not worth your time to play this game.So here are some other games worth your time:- Counter Strike Global Offensive- Battlefield 2- Team Fortress 2- Star Wars BattlefrontAnd pretty much any FPS you can think of BESIDES the previous Red Crucible games.This game gets a 2/10 I did not find it enjoyable.

								I tried the game for about an hour, the game was very laggy and the FPS was very uncomfortable. Gameplay elements like vehicles are not that developed and it's pay2win (i dare you to deny that, the last assault rifle does way more damage than the m16 according to the stat bar)In other games like battlefield, you can have a high damage gun but then it would have low accuracy or high recoil, however this is not the case in RC:FS. They are all buffed guns with direct upgrade stats-Very bad performance-Never adjust FOV-pay to win -tank acting weird when moving on a non-flat surface (i understand the game is on development)-Lots of grinding -only 3 mags for the m16? Wtf?-Lots of purchasable gadgets like airstrike, grenades, medkits and you have to pay for them for quite a price. -no full map and not so good UI (idk if you can put a full map up but i haven't discover it yet)-No PING display? What?Why would you need to have i7, GTX660 and 8 gb ram to play that game (its recommended requirements)			"

All of the maps except autobahn and favela are terrible.  They are way to big for the amount of players that they allow.  The missions can be fun, but ussually take veery long to complete and   often do not save your progress on them when a match ends.			"

												I love it... While it is a pay to win type of game you can still unlock items as you progress through the levels. The graphics are ok but a little dated. It kind of reminds me of Battlefield 2 in the graphics department. It runs smooth with no issues at all and I play it on a linux computer with AMD parts as we all know AMD drivers are terrible on Linux systems. I also have to say that I read a lot of negative reviews about this game, Glitches, full of hackers, hit box is off, etc... blah, blah, blah... I will say I have seen none of the issues others have had, if they in fact have had those issues. What I hate the most is people whining about all of these things when it is a free to play game. you gave it a try and didnt like it, move on and try something else. All in all you have to give this game a try, its free so you have nothing to lose. Unless you are one of those whiners that just have to complain about everything...			"

								If you love old school pc shooters this is the one for you!. It has a lot of nostalgic feel to it, you can't change any of the keybinds but they're pretty easy to pick up. It has a lot of interesting weapons and a wide variety of game modes. If you want to have fun in an old school tactical shooter I would highly recommend you give this a try.Think Insurgency if you feel like testing your skill and tactics on a neat and modern looking map.

								6/4/2015Hello all, I doubt you know me, and do not caare for it, however, I am a excessive FPS player, and have verious things to say, explain, and suggest for RC:F in it's current standalone Alpha phase.Current Things I Think Are Missing:1) Toggle ADS/Hold ADS optionsNow, most people know, that in any fast paced bullet hell shooter, like RC:F, toggle ADS can be a absolute pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in close quarters. I agree! And to further this, the toggle ADS in this game, has gottan my♥♥♥♥♥killed more times than I ever care to count. As such, I think that a toggle/hold preference would be a very nice feature to the game in the overall long term of it, as this will make combat far more fluid, and weapons(such as LMGs and Sniper Rifles) far more usable.2) Health RestorationNow, most shooters, have a way to restore health, however, RC:F does not. ""But, yes it does!"": you're probabaly rambling. No, no it doesn't. Wasting currency that is already a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥grind to earn for medkits, is in my oppion, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. Staying alive is a vital part of a shooter, and having a class that can deploy health, would vastly improove the game over all in things like TDM(exclude it in survival, or it'll never end), and conquest.3) Honour DropratesTheir ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Flat out. Maybe 30-60 for a match if you're top player for TDM and conquest, and MAYBE if you're lucky, 15-70 for winning a survival match. And to put this into perspective, the least a gun in the store costs, is 32,000. TO average the rate you'd need, you would have to play around nearly 10,000 matches to get what you need. I understand that it's probably like this because this was a facebook game taht's transitioning into a stand alone, but it's not okay to try and force the playbase to buy currency for anything of use. That kills a game fast, and it'll end up like certain other games(*cough* Warface, AVA, ect. *cough*). So I suggest to increase this substantialy. To around 150 for being top three on your team if you win, and 75 for top three for a lose. And in suvival perhaps 175 for winning, and reduce that by 25 for each place behind first you are(this being because Survival is far harder to win at).4) No Anti-Hack CurrentlyAs far as I've seen there's no anti hack, and people can use hall-hacks, and aimbot to their delight, and not even have to hide it(I've seen alot of it in this games first week already on Steam) and when a hack starts playing pepole start leaving fast. I suggest you guys look into Valve Anti Cheat quickly, and a way to activaly weed out hacks who are hiding on your game.5) The Giant Graphic for KillsThat thing gets in the way alot for me. I often am fighting on the ground, kill a guy, and am killed from above, because the graphic blocks a pretty large portion og the upper screen.If these things are implamented as a whole, I will be thrilled. but if things like 1,2,3,4 are implented at all, I'll be happy anyway, because it'll vastly improve overall enjoyablity of the game.My current thoughts of the game, is that it's very fun, and very fast. Could use some optimizations, as FPS difference between Ultra and Lowest is about 4 frames on a number of machines me and friends have tested, which goes to say it's poorly optimized in many ways, nonetheless even on a toaster, you will easily get 19-34 FPS after the game finishes it's background downloading, which I'd like to say I'm not a fan of, the game should update before launching, and through steam so your ping doesn't spike, and your fps doesn't♥♥♥♥♥♥itself.Anyway, this conludes my rantish thoughts of this game! Hope you enjoyed reading, this has been BlueDarterz! GLHF and kick some♥♥♥♥♥!!			"

								Great game! Here is quick tip for playing this game, remember to set your resoulution to max and all graphics settings on high, then it becomes much better! TIPS for better gameplay:-Purchase more maps with the ribbons for more gameplay options.-Try the snipers.-Set the resoulution to the max setting. PROS:-Poor Man's Battlefield-Easy on computer-The Snipers are OP.-Good Maps.-Golf CartsCONS:-Graphics need some improvement.-Arms to close to the screen.-Fences or other obsticales cant break.But overall it is a good game, I would recommend it if you cant buy Battlefield.

								This game is infinitely better than Red Crucible 2.It's not p2w at all. The guns you can buy are only slightly better than base guns.Although the graphics are 2007-ish, some of the in-game artwork is pretty good.With minimum you can run the game 30-60 fps, I get maybe 30-40.Since it's early in development I recommend getting it and ranking up before everyone else gets it.My only main con is that the LMG's have been seriously downgraded, they're basically completely useless.This game needs a lot of work but it has a really good base to it, I see it being really good in the future.Also here is a story.>Be me>Day 1 of game, liking it so far>Just got brand new ak-74 from rank up>It only has 20 rounds in a mag, that's weird>Join TDM on kiev (favorite map=only map)>Absolutely destroying enemy>Go on 30 killstreak>Finally get knifed from 10 feet away (not abnormal)>Game then says, ""Match Lost"">WTF.jpeg>Look at scoreboard>Me 30 and 1>Everyone else on my team   0 and 15   0 and 5   0 and 7   0 and 12   0 and 10>well10/10 would lose because of crappy team again			"

												This Game is pretty good.  Its realistic and very fun. There are 5 diffrent maps and as seen in the video, you have accesories on top such as airstrikes or medkits. You also get a Reward every single day! From Coins to more accesories. In the Gun selection there are diffrent categories like Assult, Sniper, Support, Demolition (RPG) and more! I recommend this game because its free, the first 10 minutes was pretty fun, and you even have vehicles you can drive like tanks and helecopters.			"

												Red Crucible: Firestorm is a free to play PVP shooter game. It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  Has 4 maps unlocked and 3 maps that requires some form of unlocking.  This game is Pay to Win, since it is selling a OP Tank in the store and other weapons.  It is a poor man's subsitute for Battlefield 2 to 4.  Try it, but there are better free to play games than this.  You might wanna read the other reviews also.For more info:

Early Access Review
								Note: I've played this game since 2011, when it was still a browser game called Red Crucible 2 and probably have more like 50 hours of game time.Essentially, Red Crucible: Firestorm is still a browser game, just Red Crucible 2 with a fancy (and annoyingly convoluted) new UI slapped on. It's just another generic first person shooter with no personality.""Don't be too hard on it. It's free-to-play!"" -a reasonable point.However, to call this game free-to-play would be a stretch at best.""Features of the ""free-to-play"" model:1. Consumables-LOTS of consumables. They sell experience and damage boosts that last 10 MINUTES. That's right, folks. Just pay about 25 cents worth of premium currency or some in game currency and you can get a little extra experience for a single round. You want to have extra experience for an hour? That will cost you about $1.50. Same thing goes for grenades, airstrikes, and medpacks. You have to buy all of those with currency or premium currency 1 at a time, which may seem cheap, but it adds up.2. Weapon upgrades. Most FPS games have a variety of different weapons that suit different roles but have tradeoffs i.e. higher damage but higher recoil, higher accuracy but lower rate of fire. Not in Red Crucible: Firestorm.In Red Crucible Firestorm, you PAY a lot of in game currency or real money to UPGRADE your weapons. That's right: the damage goes up with NO DOWNSIDES. You do unlock new weapons as you level up, BUT they are essentialy carbon copies of each other with higher damage.3. Armor upgrades-To go along with the weapon upgrades, you can buy and upgrade your armor with a lot of in game currency or real money. This offsets the advantage from upgrading your weapons.4. Premium weapons. You can buy premium weapons for 300-1000 coins or 30,000-100,000 ""honor points,"" in game currency. This translates to prices of $10-$15 for a single weapon!!! And you can only buy coins in weird increments of 250, 750, 875, etc., forcing you to pay for more than you need. And buying with honor points? Forget it. It would take thousands of hours to get that many honor points from playing the games.IN CONCLUSION: In addition to tons of crappy consumables, you have to constantly upgrade your weapons and armor as you level up. These armor and weapon upgrades cancel each other out, leaving you with a net gain of 0, but if you don't upgrade or get better ones, you'll get left in the dust. The top tier automatic weapons can one-shot kill you many times over if you don't pay a ton to upgrade your armor. Also premium weapons are really expensive.Other cons:1. Graphics-They're what you'd expect from an internet flash game: bad by today's standards, maybe decent back in 2007.2. User Interface-It's terrible. Tons of nested menus and drop down bars. It's bad.3. Matchmaking-You often get placed in matches with people many levels above you. This means that they can one shot you with an upgraded version of the same gun you're using. You don't stand a chance.TL;DR: 3/10 Play it for the laughs. NEVER spend money.			"

								I can safely say that this is a mix of cod an battlefield. The Battlefield part:This game almost seems like a battlefield game at first glance(minus the amazing graphics) and i mean that in a good way. The reason that i think it feels like battlefield is because of the atmosphere it creates. You really do feel like you are in a real battle. And trust me, there are some really intense moments in this game. And, even though i played this game for a mere hour i can safely say that this is one of the best indie shooters that i ever played.  As of now there are barely any maps that are actually being played other than the kiev carrier map and i cant remember the other maps name.The Cod part:Bad graphicsWay to much hpVehicles are way to easy to drive. like the killstreaks in cod.notice that some of the screenshots are taken at 20 fps.

												Anyone else like seeing how, most people leave the bad reviews, played enough time to play, ONE match, and decide it's fate. Listen the game does get better, you don't need real currency for most anything, thier is such a thing called an unlock tab, that allows you to unlock new guns, helmets, and vehicals as you progress the levels, and when you unlock them with in game earned money though matches and promotions, you have it for life, no time bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ so that's a plus. Yes the graphics are bad, but considering the game is nearly 85% free, I can get past that, and for having bad graphics, it's produced some pretty good maps likea big♥♥♥♥♥city, or the favelas of Brazil.

								Well IMO; it's fun and free, there's no harm in getting it and watching it develop, but I do have a small rant to express.What I see here is a game with nothing to separate it from every other FPS; same guns, same vehicles, average graphics and basic objectives. What I'd like to see is the developers get bogged down and get creative and crazy to make something that isn't like everything else.Invent a new game mode, design some wacky guns, incorroporate some freedom options to really get us interested. I doubt they will see this but there you go.  "

												I would really reccomend this game.The graphics are not so good but it is the gameplay thats amazingFirst of all you have driveable vehicles like helicopters, cars, and tanks.second of all, the game is not a pay2win but there are some increases in accuracy of the gun if you purchase the one with a scope. I have almost 50 hours on record and one thing that makes me angry is the market. this game needs a good place where you can buy weapons. I mean you can unlock them and all but meh.....a market will be much better. maybe you can buy guns with honor points and repair them with coins.Another thing i would like to be added is voice messages like in cs go. For example you press k button or any button (you can choose in settings) to send a voice message.But all in all, the game is really good and i really love it.			"

								""Ultra"" quality settings are definatly nowhere near ""Fancy"" setting on minecraft from what I saw from the inventory screen. I would judge the gameplay but the inabilaty to connect to a game was a *small* issue. This was the first time I tried playing. Then I figured mabey the game can't properly run at 5760 x 1080 so I went down to 1920 x 1080 and that then made the options to start a game or options of any sort disappear. Then when I went back to 5760 x 1080, the game had the same problem but crashed when I clicked on anything. This continued to happen on all resolutions and on all texture qualities. So overall this game is a huge disappointment and hopefully this will change in the updates to come. But of course this is MY reveiw from MY computer sso you may not have the same issues as me so I the game works for you, congrats and I hope you have fun playing it but I just couldn't get the game to work so I left this reveiw.

												The Platinum Edition to those unaware is really the PMC Gold Bundle. The three special weapons are the Scar, DEagle and Tomahawk. Plus you get the cosmetics like clothes, beards etc. The price to get this bundle is cheaper than it is than the actual gold price on the store page of RCF. I wouldn't recommend this bundle at all. Sure it's a good gun (scar) but there are gold bundles that cost like 20 dollars and are just as good. A good example would be the navy seal G. The game itself. Very Buggy especially the map Kiev-Low FPS and high Ping.  I can run bigger maps like A7 autobahn and Red Dawn with ease. The reload animations is poor. For Support weapons and Demolition it's disgusting. The Devs should focus on fixing these bugs rather than focus on adding new pricey ONLY GOLD VERSION guns. Overall i spent over 20 dollars on this game. I have a gold gun and ill tell you It's absolutely not worth it. What really annoys me is the sell price. Let's look at this in further detail below:-Normal guns cost 600 honor points. Sell price is a measly 60 honor-Bronze guns cost 30,000 honor points- Devs raised it to 35,000- Sell price is 3500-Silver guns cost 60,000 honor points. Sell price is 6000-Gold guns cost 100,000 honor points. Sell price is 10,000Let me also remind you that for an average player- 5/7 kills will equate to around 25 honor points. Plus the extra 25 points IF your team wins the match. So 50 in total. It's gonna take a helluva long time to save up 100,000 honor points...It seems that we get 10% of our money back which is completely stupid. It should be 50% for God's Sake.What's really sad is that the game has potential, except the Devs are not using this potential. Overall a disappointment for me.			"

								Lol this game is the pay 2 win god , 40$ to to buy a decent gun.When you get into lvl 9 players will start showing up whit lvl 17 and others whit pay 2 win guns  while others need to waste a whole mag into the enemy to be able to do something while the enemy one shots you , that is if your not pay 2 win.Dont let the game trailer fool you , getting 9 million coins is bassicly imposible , you get 15 per lvl up and lvling up is hard as all balls.And you can unlock weapons too for not paying , but they wont be very affective againts other players , oh excuse me the MOST OF THEM , they are pay 2 win and just there on theyre lazy asses and bassicly not doing anything while others are trying tactics how to flank outnumber and destroy.So im giving this game a 2/10 (EPIC FAIL) and the reason im not giving it 1/10 is becouse i like the vehicle combat a bit thats the only thing.Couse pay 2 winers cant really outmatch you there whit money			"

								i dont know where to start if you ever met a P2W game , this game will beat it in P2W aspectthe in game currency (honor points)  is SO hard to grind , i even do everything , CAP ,kill, destroy , but still, if im lucky i get 100HP in a conquest game which take up to 15-20 min if not higher , its hard to level up after you reach level 9 , and there is so p2w weapons in this game , and ARMOR too , so you might find a guy with same level as yours but he payed,  so he got super good weapon with super armor ,means he need less shots to kill you , while you need more shots to kill himthe voice commands sounds are so FKED up , my littile brother can do better so pay 25$ at least or higher , and get OP weapon and OP armor and there are only servers from ONE riegon , which i think BR , the lag is so big in this game , its made for BR people only , as there is no EU servers , i have 150-200 ping in it the GRAPHICS are SO out dated , it look like some kid 3D modeling yet there is a fun part in this game ,which is how stupid it is and that why  i have 11hr playing  "

								Here are a few pros and cons on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I played it on Facebook a while so don't let my hours fool you+Satisfying to kill enemies+Big maps+Decently active community+Can be learned and played easily easily+No signup with your email ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t+Fairly simple mechanics for more casual FPS gamersAnd some cons-Graphics are about 12 years outdated-Even though the maps are big, which was a pro, they still ♥♥♥♥ing suck. You only use about 1/12 of it for actual fighting-Active community, but they still don't do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ They don't work on the objective, they don't even let you go in the same vehicle as them.-Achieving new guns is almost impossible, it will take a week just for you to get the worst gun in the game. And the worst gun really ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. The only way to get out of your standard is to pay money.-Homescreen and stats look so unprofessional and bad. The fonts look like MS Paint and was incorporated into a game. Like the start screen of a game you made in a day when you were 15-Don't let the screenshots on this♥♥♥♥♥♥fool you with good looking graphics. They are the worst.-The replayability is just terrible. You'll play like 5 rounds (which should I note take about 10 minutes) then never play the game again.I rate this game a 3/10. Killing enemies is satisfying, active community, and easy to pick up on. But also extremely aggravating and something you'll never play ever again.			"

								NO NO NO and NOREAD CAREFULLY AND TAKE A LOOK AT POSITIVE REVIEWS... 99% OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FROM THE FAN BOYS, THAT MADE FAKE ACCOUNTS, TO VOTE YES TO THIS GAME, WITH A PROMISE OF THE DEVELOPERS FROM THIS GAME THAT FANBOYS WILL RECEIVE A FREE WEAPONS WHEN THE GAME REACH 1000 POSITIVES REVIEWS, JUST VIEW POSITIVE REVIEWERS PROFILES, ALL NEW ACCOUNTS WITH ONLY RCF IN THEIR ACCOUNTS, DON'T LET YOURSELF GET FOOLED BY FANBOYS.Think twice, three, four times before even instal this game to try it  into your computer, its not worth it at every levels.Graphics sucks, game mechanic suck but the MORE IMPORTANT thing is THIS DEVELOPMENT TEAM ARE A BUNCH OF SCAMMERS with absolutely no respect for community, this dogs bite on the hand that feed them.I played this ""♥♥♥♥♥torm"" since the beta and reported several bugs and glitches, 90% of them are still there, if you guys take a look at their forum, you will see a total community of around 30 to 40 users max, and all those fanboys say wonderfull things of the game, YOU DON'T SEE NO ONE COMPLAINT, DEVELOPERS DELETE THE POSTS OF PEOPLE THAT POINT THE FINGER TO THEM, they delete the topics, posts and BAN THE USERS I' was banned from RCF forum, cause i said that the weapons they sell in game are expensive and doesn't worth $15.Development team are busy creating weapons and outfits to sell for $30 instead of working on the game optimization.The game suffer from graphic optimization, even with a GTX970 the game freezes, even with 100 MB optic fiber connection we have rubber banding, and the mouse smoothing is awfull.

								Do not get this game. The graphics on ultra are not that enjoyable, the servers are not created well enough, there are some people that cheat the game and give themselves god mode, infinite ammo, or invisibility. I played the game for less than 30 minutes and I ran into a god mode hacker. I do not hate this game, but I do not recommend it. It is free, though. I do not want to sway anyone, but definitely try the game out if you do not believe me. There are some alright aspects, though. The vehicles are pretty fun to pilot/drive, but if you are a helicopter, do not get your hopes up of staying in the air that long.			"

								Compared to Insurgency this game is nothing...but it has some really great ideas. You can drive tanks and helecopters unlike in  Insurgency, but you cant prone, the bushes are bulletproof and there are no respawns.... I like the running animation and how it incorporates the ""USSR"" but overall i think this game needs some real fixing. IF YOU'RE A BEGINNER IN PLAYING WAR GAMES THIS IS A LOT EASIER THAN INSURGENCY (the best game ever) BUT HARDER THAN COUNTER STRIKE.			"

								As an Early Access game, this is amazing. With tons of customization options and the handful of Vehicles to choose from; It's great!However, I am having bugs with Private Matches as I cannot create a Private Match for me and my Friends because It will not switch from Public to Private. Also, as I am planning on doing, I would like to play the game without Steam, but the Standalone copy cannot connect to my RCF Login from the Steam Version; so I will be using the Steam Version for the Time-Being.With all the Content and the obvious effort put into it; this game is amazing especially for a Free-To-Play Game. The Combat System is somewhat unique when compared to Call of Duty, and the EXP system is a lot more fun to me. To put it simply, I like this game and I hope that there will be more unlockable maps to choose from in the future!Controls: 8/10Graphics: 9/10Music/Sound: 6/10 (There really isn't a whole lot of music, But the sounds are pretty authentic when it comes to the Gunshots.)Gameplay: Fun, however does get boring after a few matches 9/10Average: 8/10 "

								Lol this game is the pay 2 win god , 40$ to to buy a decent gun.When you get into lvl 9 players will start showing up whit lvl 17 and others whit pay 2 win guns  while others need to waste a whole mag into the enemy to be able to do something while the enemy one shots you , that is if your not pay 2 win.Dont let the game trailer fool you , getting 9 million coins is bassicly imposible , you get 15 per lvl up and lvling up is hard as all balls.And you can unlock weapons too for not paying , but they wont be very affective againts other players , oh excuse me the MOST OF THEM , they are pay 2 win and just there on theyre lazy asses and bassicly not doing anything while others are trying tactics how to flank outnumber and destroy.So im giving this game a 2/10 (EPIC FAIL) and the reason im not giving it 1/10 is becouse i like the vehicle combat a bit thats the only thing.Couse pay 2 winers cant really outmatch you there whit money			"

								Do not get this game. The graphics on ultra are not that enjoyable, the servers are not created well enough, there are some people that cheat the game and give themselves god mode, infinite ammo, or invisibility. I played the game for less than 30 minutes and I ran into a god mode hacker. I do not hate this game, but I do not recommend it. It is free, though. I do not want to sway anyone, but definitely try the game out if you do not believe me. There are some alright aspects, though. The vehicles are pretty fun to pilot/drive, but if you are a helicopter, do not get your hopes up of staying in the air that long.			"

								The sound needs to be changed and some of the gun models seem a little too thick. also the map is too big. speaking of maps, they should add more of them. however i did have a ton of fun playing this game, i've gotten like 2 kills (because i suck) but I've still had fun using the tanks and helicopters and jumping out of helicopters only to find i don't have a parachute. but it IS fun to play. as long as the Devs keep updating it properly, it'll be fun.

								Hey, I think this game Is pretty cool for a free MMO RPG, and I especailly LOVE the fact that it has VEHICLES, honestly that is kind of why it is popular... But even without them I think this game would be pretty cool, anyways overall I give it a thumbs up and a 8/10 for a FREE cool game :)			"

								This game is a sorry excuse for an FPS.The voice acting is downright horrible... but hilarious. The training mission has the best ♥♥♥♥ing voice actor ever. He forgets his accents sometimes, it's so quality! And we can't forget that infamous ""ugh"" when you or an enemy dies.The gameplay is forgettable standard FPS gameplay. Aim, shoot, and your gun goes up a bit. It tried to be Call of Duty with vehicles, but for some reason I can't test them because there are no vehicular maps available for me to play at the time of this review. Maybe that could've made the game better.The sounds are really bad. Environmental, sure, they're okay. Guns? They sound like peashooters.The networking is alright. In the pitiful time I played this game, I found no errrors in hitboxes that I noticed.The graphics are okay. It's a F2P game, I didn't expect it to have good graphics. Needs some optimization, thoug.hOverall, the game is a 6/10 (AT THE TIME OF THIS REVIEW). Could it be better? Yeah. If it's released like this, it's going to be really, REALLY bad. I believe that Rocketeer Games Studio could hammer out the rough edges. P.S.: Oh, and get rid of the god awful excuse of a pay system. I am not going to pay for parachutes, grenades, or that sort. Cosmetic items would be way better imho. "

								NO NO NO and NOREAD CAREFULLY AND TAKE A LOOK AT POSITIVE REVIEWS... 99% OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FROM THE FAN BOYS, THAT MADE FAKE ACCOUNTS, TO VOTE YES TO THIS GAME, WITH A PROMISE OF THE DEVELOPERS FROM THIS GAME THAT FANBOYS WILL RECEIVE A FREE WEAPONS WHEN THE GAME REACH 1000 POSITIVES REVIEWS, JUST VIEW POSITIVE REVIEWERS PROFILES, ALL NEW ACCOUNTS WITH ONLY RCF IN THEIR ACCOUNTS, DON'T LET YOURSELF GET FOOLED BY FANBOYS.Think twice, three, four times before even instal this game to try it  into your computer, its not worth it at every levels.Graphics sucks, game mechanic suck but the MORE IMPORTANT thing is THIS DEVELOPMENT TEAM ARE A BUNCH OF SCAMMERS with absolutely no respect for community, this dogs bite on the hand that feed them.I played this ""♥♥♥♥♥torm"" since the beta and reported several bugs and glitches, 90% of them are still there, if you guys take a look at their forum, you will see a total community of around 30 to 40 users max, and all those fanboys say wonderfull things of the game, YOU DON'T SEE NO ONE COMPLAINT, DEVELOPERS DELETE THE POSTS OF PEOPLE THAT POINT THE FINGER TO THEM, they delete the topics, posts and BAN THE USERS I' was banned from RCF forum, cause i said that the weapons they sell in game are expensive and doesn't worth $15.Development team are busy creating weapons and outfits to sell for $30 instead of working on the game optimization.The game suffer from graphic optimization, even with a GTX970 the game freezes, even with 100 MB optic fiber connection we have rubber banding, and the mouse smoothing is awfull.

												This probably the WORST pay to win FPS game I have ever seen come across the web and the only reason it's even ON my system is the fact that I fell for the gossy g*o*damned cover art steam plays for the game suggestion.Not only is it the ost useless clunky user interface that I have ever seen,but the graphics are soooooo♥♥♥♥♥♥poor I am thinking about downloading pac man and reverting to IT.Right from minute one andgame launch you are spawn camped and it degenerates from there.seriously,why do ANYbody play games like these PvP any more they are all the same now,find a spawn sit on it,rinse repeat.Fail.Hack it t death ifyou can't .UNINSTALL with extreme prejudice I'm going back to Armoured warfare PvE.

												How i missed Red Crucible 2, with it's old mechanics (no fall damage, infinite ammo) and fun, i played it almost every day, but then it became Red Crucible Firestorm, i dint mind at first, because Red Crucible 2 was still there, it was then when Rocketeer ♥♥♥♥ed up and deleted red crucible 2 all together, only transfering your items to firestorm.This game did not innovate in any way from Red Crucible 2, in fact, it got worse.These are the new bad things i learned from recently playing: Your armor is pure decoration now, it used to give you extra health, now a double tap in the foot with a pistol will bring you down as if it were a granade exploding in your mouth. Then there are the premium weapons, straight upgrades to everything with cool modifications, all of which cost the in-game premium currency (clever way of stealing your money without refunds) called Coins, it costs a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of coins to buy one of these premium weapons and the coins themselves are everything but cheap.This game is completely ruined.EDIT: You may see that i don't have a lot of playtime, this is because i did not play Red Crucible 2 via steam.

								There are of course bugs and glitches, as with any early access game, but they aren't game-breaking or even all to disruptive to the actual gameplay. At the moment, it can seem a little pay-to-win, but in my opinion, it's not. It is still in early access, and there still needs to be some balancing done, like the cost of the weapons. It does seem a lot like CoD, but it still has most of its design and features grounded in original ideas. I did play some of the early editions, not on Steam, and they honestly seemed more in-depth than this one, but there is so much potential here. Overall, here's what I have to say about this game:Pros:-Simple, but fun-Easy to learn-decent graphics for early accessCons:-Pay-to-win-Controls feel clunky-One person would dominate pretty easily from some positions "

								The game has pretty much been ruined. Red Crucible 2 was just one of those fun browser games that were quite enjoyable but now that they're released Red Crucible Firestorm I feel as if all the fun has been taken out and replaced with an option to pay for absolutely everything. The default guns are more or less useless against the guns of those we call 'Wallet Warriors'.If you simply removed the option to pay for guns and instead made the game $5, I'm pretty sure more people would enjoy it.Overall I'm sick of P2W games so I guess if you still choose to play this game, don't expect too much.

								This game is unchanged from the crappy unity browser FPS I played 7 years ago. It looks slightly better than it did, in the same way saying this pile of sh*t is slightly shinier, but it is unbalanced as all hell. The basic pistol is OP. I was able to charge into enemy terretory and only died when I ran out of pistol ammo, which is limited as all hell. One-two reloads in both the primary and secondary in a war game? That was done so that one would be compelled to buy a ammo pouch using real money. Bought weapons are so much better than basic guns. All in all, it could be ok if the F2P model was DRAMATICALLY reworked.			"

								RD:F is a FPS on a large scale, similar the popular franchise ""Battlefield"". However, gameplay is not always clear and can be confusing for the first-timer. Controls of extremely vague, if you are not already accustomed to ""General Controls"" (i.e W.A.S.D to move). Economy is completely reliant of near months of gameplay for one of many weapons, skins, etc.. There are balancing issues with certain vehicles. (i.e APCs are near useless because of considerably weak armor and one tank can destroy entire teams, without much punishment.).This game obviously needs a little bit more work, some graphical and auditorial tune-ups, balancing on a large scale, and easier user interface. I do not recommend this game because of the reasons I've listed above.			"

I know its a f2p but jesus this game is just awful as a f2p even this game had stolen content from other games (Possibly)..

								I have played Red Crucible 2 for a while now, and it has a similar feel. I feel like this game has potential, but there's a lot missing. The biggest concern is microtransactions. Microtransactions are te bane of video gaming, and I would rather pay 30 bucks for the game, and when the company takes off into AAA market, I would invest more into the games. That being said, I understand the microtransactions are basically your easiest way to make money, but if your willing to overhaul the microtransactions, then at least remove them from full release and establish a static price. Graphically, this game is also generations back, and I would like to see visual improvements, if not, optimization. Controls are a bit wonky as well and the gui and hud are very hard to manipulate. If you want positive reinforcement, I love the maps. They appear to be revamps of red crucible 2 maps, but good none the less. I also like the vehicle selection, and this game honestly has a lot of great gameplay mechanics. But there is that missing aspect of refining in the game at the moment. Overall, my rating is:The Good:MapsMechanicsGameplayThe Bad:MicrotransactionsVisualsMenus and hudsAll in all, I have to give this game a thumbs down, and I only say this because it just needs to be improved, and I do expect that it will considering the game is in early release, and I might boot the game up again on next major update.

I find myself having to play for 10 years just to buy a new gun, which the cheapest gun is about 10,000 honor! I would like to find myself earning about 500 to 1000 honor per match. One more this this game needs to work on, and that is to lower the prices for weapons, consumables, and vehicles.			"

								I don't know what ppls were thinking about when they wrote their own review.But this game is pure trash. If you want to upgrade your weapons you'll need both game currency and ""gold coins""; Gold coin is the other currency, the one you have to pay with real money.So, beside you do not want to spend real money on this game, beware to don't tuch this big pale of♥♥♥♥♥♥The only noticable difference between low and ultra it's a blue filter, for the rest it's pretty much identical.The game is not optimized, this mean that even if the graphics is pure melty-solid-one-color♥♥♥♥♥♥ your gpu will skyrocket with the temperature.

								This game is terrible. The Payout is awful for how much the weapons cost. i have played it for 5.8 hours and i have only 2,000 coins roughly. the minimum to buy a gun. 100,000. And the spawn killing is awful. like seriously. AND ONLY TWO ♥♥♥♥ING MAPS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. TWO. ♥♥♥♥ING. MAPS. Yeah because being spawn killed on Kiev is so much fun. And then going and playing autobahn and litterally taking 10 minutes to run halfway across map. yeah so much fun. This game is litterally the worst game i have ever played. The classes are so awful because if only one person on the opposing team has a non-default gun. youre ♥♥♥♥ed. literally ♥♥♥♥ed. there is no winning. especially if they spawn camp. GET NEW MAPS. GET NEW GUNS. AND MAYBE THIS WOULD BE A GOOD GAME. BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT IT.			"

								*DISCLAIMER* I do not hack nor have I ever thought of hacking. I am just simply stating what I find. Please enjoy!Recent Update Changes make this game ......well..... Cancerous. Now I can barely play the game due to lag. I could play the game just fine until they changed the HUD design added in new vehicles and stuff. I recommend this game for people that want a game to hack on and you wont get banned anymore because devs just stopped caring or if you want to crash your computer every now and then.Pros: Free to playEasy to find hacksThere is an uninstall.Cons:Devs don't care anymoreCrashesLagspikesPay 2 WinOh did I mention its a freaking pro in a glory wholeeeee!!!! Its so fantastic that my gun shoots plastic. Hackers everywhere, i saw one in the air!!!!! So amazing, that this game isnt changing! "

												I donno what to say.Look guys.If you whant a ""hey look! RUN'N'GUN!"" SH*T, then you are wrong. As for the graphics and physics well.... based on some technincal stuff this thing was made using Unity Engine 3, and guess wut? Unity back in Unity 3 times didnt had a proper animation system.For the graphics, i maybe know WTF is wrong buuuuuut im not the RC:F's dev am i?This game is about strategy on battlfield. About thinking FAST. About real ACTION. It's NOT a RUN'n'GUN like Children Online Daycare......... oh..... wait a sec.... oh! i got it. Call Of Duty.Point is you must get into the game! Most of bad reviews had actually less an hour. What do you expect??? 0.5 Hrs of playing and becoming a pro? REALLY?????Point is im going to sort this out so......Pros +:+ Good Gamplay+ Good balancing (ill explain this)+ GBAP - F2P+ Not a bad learning curve.- F2P (Ill explain later)Cons - :- Behold the return of the ATARI! Behold the lord of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest graphics. Honestly, WTF? Welcome to 2002- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics- Old Engine- ♥♥♥♥♥ies optimisations EVER- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ support. They have added tons of new content and new things BUT NOT A SINGLE ENGINE UPDATE?- Mighty bugs. Not in game or something, in account managing system. There are strange bugs. Trust Me.About the balancing And F2P- Look even if someone get a pay gun,well, actually theres no such thing and buying gold just makes getting stuff faster, look it depends on the player. If he is a Newbie then killing him will be so EZ KILL, u know, and also if you are pro and so adapted to your gun, Hey, say hello to rampage with M16!This game is about GAMEPLAY. about ACTION. about STRATEGY.5/10 - ♥♥♥♥♥iest graphics ever. For shi*'s sake upgrade to unity 5. just do it.			"

								Kinda reminds me of Battlfield, but Battlefield is actually good. You can pay for weapons with skins, and you can buy some maps if you're tired of the only other two maps. The standard M16 you're given at the start of the game can kill anything with only 4 bullets, so any more bullets you might use afterwards would be wasted. The pistol can kill with two bullets, if you're good. I really really really ""like"" this game.			"

Just compared to most free to play shooters out there, this doesn't do quite the trick. It's an ok game yet i wont recommend you to play it alone. Might be fun with friends.			"

								Now I have only played this game for 20 minutes. You'll find out why below. Considering it's free to play it's not too bad on the surface. It's fairly basic, has a very 2004-esque feel to it gameplay and graphics wise. Could have been good for a few cheap laughs or to pass some time. My major problem is that it runs like crap. I have an i3-4160 and a GTX750Ti, and the game chugs even on 1080p medium settings. For a game that looks like this, that's totally unacceptable. I can run Advanced Warfare/Battlefield 4 on high no problems. But this....I have to play at low settings to get 60fps, even though it looks like a game from 10 years ago.			"

												I donno what to say.Look guys.If you whant a ""hey look! RUN'N'GUN!"" SH*T, then you are wrong. As for the graphics and physics well.... based on some technincal stuff this thing was made using Unity Engine 3, and guess wut? Unity back in Unity 3 times didnt had a proper animation system.For the graphics, i maybe know WTF is wrong buuuuuut im not the RC:F's dev am i?This game is about strategy on battlfield. About thinking FAST. About real ACTION. It's NOT a RUN'n'GUN like Children Online Daycare......... oh..... wait a sec.... oh! i got it. Call Of Duty.Point is you must get into the game! Most of bad reviews had actually less an hour. What do you expect??? 0.5 Hrs of playing and becoming a pro? REALLY?????Point is im going to sort this out so......Pros +:+ Good Gamplay+ Good balancing (ill explain this)+ GBAP - F2P+ Not a bad learning curve.- F2P (Ill explain later)Cons - :- Behold the return of the ATARI! Behold the lord of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest graphics. Honestly, WTF? Welcome to 2002- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics- Old Engine- ♥♥♥♥♥ies optimisations EVER- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ support. They have added tons of new content and new things BUT NOT A SINGLE ENGINE UPDATE?- Mighty bugs. Not in game or something, in account managing system. There are strange bugs. Trust Me.About the balancing And F2P- Look even if someone get a pay gun,well, actually theres no such thing and buying gold just makes getting stuff faster, look it depends on the player. If he is a Newbie then killing him will be so EZ KILL, u know, and also if you are pro and so adapted to your gun, Hey, say hello to rampage with M16!This game is about GAMEPLAY. about ACTION. about STRATEGY.5/10 - ♥♥♥♥♥iest graphics ever. For shi*'s sake upgrade to unity 5. just do it.			"

								This game is terrible. The Payout is awful for how much the weapons cost. i have played it for 5.8 hours and i have only 2,000 coins roughly. the minimum to buy a gun. 100,000. And the spawn killing is awful. like seriously. AND ONLY TWO ♥♥♥♥ING MAPS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. TWO. ♥♥♥♥ING. MAPS. Yeah because being spawn killed on Kiev is so much fun. And then going and playing autobahn and litterally taking 10 minutes to run halfway across map. yeah so much fun. This game is litterally the worst game i have ever played. The classes are so awful because if only one person on the opposing team has a non-default gun. youre ♥♥♥♥ed. literally ♥♥♥♥ed. there is no winning. especially if they spawn camp. GET NEW MAPS. GET NEW GUNS. AND MAYBE THIS WOULD BE A GOOD GAME. BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT IT.			"

												It made horrible first impressions.................What are you waiting for? Me to tell you what's wrong with the game?Okay.The chat is for some reason, very slow and displays a message 10 seconds after you say it.The messages you get for shooting someone are quite ridiculous. ""Kill Shot""? Seriously?Whenever you sprint, you can only go forward.Most weapons are too overpowered.You can spawnkill people by throwing grenades in the spawn from outside the boundaries.Rather than using the scrollwheel, you use ""1"", ""2"", and ""3"" to swap weapons.hip-firing assault rifles gives you CRAP accuracy. I tried hip-firing somebody and only 3 bullets hit them.Hate all you want, but this is NOT the game for me. "

								Game feels very poorly developed and runs terrible. The engine is garbage and should have just stayed as a browser game. The gameplay isn't smooth either which ruins the fun in almost every way. Yes I know this game is still early development but it still seems like a game that put 0 effort into especially when you have to buy maps and use micro-transactions to buy almost everything in this game.

								Too young of a game by too inexperienced of a dev. The game has great potential. if the dev capitalizes on the games strengths, then it would be a great game. for now, this is not even worth playing. If you want to see what the game will eventually be, play RC 1 on kongregate			"

								I'm all for Indie developers, but not for this one...If there is a game I can compare it to it would be Battlefield 1942. Is it because it is set in WW2? Nope.Graphicly and animation like it would be closest to Battlefield 1942, a game that came out in 2002, aka 13 years ago.I can understand that if you are a new player in the development game that you don't have money for a great engine and people working for you, but come on! There are so many possibilities in this day!Now if this was truly free to play, I wouldn't have such complaints about it and I would mess around on it with friends, but this game has micro transactions, it has packs you can buy.Sure it's great to support a new developer, but not if you can't even make a game look better then bloody Battlefield 1942! You can buy support on the battlefield by buying packs, you can buy new weapons to outgun your oponent, that is a big no no.I would not suggest this game to anyone, I know people will think you need to play more then you did to rate a game, but this is just lazy cash grabbery.

I'm about to uninstall the game once and for all.

												/edit (01/02/16)Okay. So actually after a few more hours I've found a few answers to the problems I wrote about initially in this ""review"" (the single sentence at the end). However, I'm still sure there better free shooters than this available. Team Fortress 2 and Tribes: Ascend immediately come to mind though they're quite different games. Warface shares more similarities and is a good example of a greater game if not only due to the solid core mechanics such as movement and aim.For a start, it wasn't immediately obvious that early new weapons actually didn't take 50000 honour each to obtain as indicated by the ""store"" tab (of which you can earn around 50-150 per match) and instead they can be purchased for less than 1000 each from the ""unlock"" tab. I recall starting with 2500 honour, so not bad. This includes the entire range of weaponry from snipers to rocket launchers, so you actually don't miss out too much. And four of us had glossed over this before I eventually found it.Obviously there is still the issue of having higher cost/level guns doing more damage (and you can also upgrade each gun?) and the consumables such as grenades, airstrikes and medkits need replenishing through purchases (though there is a chance to get some through daily/level rewards). I haven't tried the boosts to stats, but I haven't noticed anybody else with them either apart from one person running at ridiculous speed and therefore will have no appreciation for their existence. At least a rocket launcher is a new solution to the vehicles that still have poor movement.Another thing I quickly realised was the lack of maps (3) until also discovered in the ""unlock"" tab was that there were another three to unlock very cheaply at 100 honour each. However, the percentage of people playing on them was about 5%. That is to say, one server for each. This may show how very few others have found this unlock feature.The maps are honestly probably one of the strongest points of the game. Instead of the map itself, what makes them irritating is the placement of spawn points and that some routes can be linear and predictable. Spawn points are very enclosed which makes spawn lockdown (not quite spawnkilling) fairly common. Also it makes controlling territory very unrewarding as all progress is lost after death. Forgiveable with the smaller maps, due to the spawn lockdown problem, but very labourious on the larger maps. Also glass that can't be shot through. Yeah.But the main problem is none of this. It is simply the core gameplay mechanics. Sure, the movement is average, the objectives are average, the vehicles are.. average? The problem is the shooting is bad. In my opinion the best strategy in gunplay should not be to jump around corners and unloading. And this combined with having superior guns unlocked with more time spent on the game is what decides matches. Especially on smaller maps. Longer range is awful due to the hundreds of invisible walls scattered over the environment. Random bits of cover where you can still see your enemy will stop your bullets from reaching them. It happens constantly, and is why the above strategy is preferred. Also the draw distance means you can't even see people at a higher range, as well as there being a constant ""sway"" when aiming with a sniper rifle with no way to steady it whereas each other gun has no such thing.However, even with all these negatives the game has been a laugh with a few friends discovering all of the hilarity in the animations, vehicles and knife combat and has become a bit of a callback. The negatives at least made the game less serious and opened it up to find the fun hidden inside. I still can't recommend it./edit2 (03/02/16)Good update, adding a great new map and gamemode, as well as better mechanics for destroying vehicles. Also extra settings and bug fixes and guff.I'm starting to kind of like this game./edit2/edit3 (17/02/16)Can't join people lower level than you?Armour exists and shouldn't./edit3Original review below:/editPerfect if you want to play 200 games to unlock each gun while you fight on a battlefield with randomly boosted players who will have extra sprint speed and weapon damage etcetera for the next 20 minutes; where you are given a set amount of grenades, mines, medkits and airstrikes before you have to pay for new ones from the ingame store; and where on each respawn you mindlessly rush at each other with vehicles and spam click to kill anyone who isn't in one while you either flip onto the side of the vehicle or clip through another one.

The pistol can kill with two bullets, if you're good. I really really really ""like"" this game.			"

You can buy support on the battlefield by buying packs, you can buy new weapons to outgun your oponent, that is a big no no.I would not suggest this game to anyone, I know people will think you need to play more then you did to rate a game, but this is just lazy cash grabbery.

								This game is fun as hell and free to play. Some people say that it's pay to win but I don't really think so. Sure, you can buy better weapons and gear but I've played for a few days now and I haven't run into anyone with an extreme advantage over me, despite me having never put any actual money into the game. If you play enough you can unlock new weapons and maps realitivly easy with in game rewards anyway. For a free game it's awesome and I recommend it for sure. Run around and kill some people, with a gun or with a tank.			"

								Great game, has a slight resemblance to Battlefield, but nowhere near as good. The vehicles, graphics, animations, and pricing could use some tweaking. I haven't been able to play a single game with the attack helicopters, and there are no vehicles available for purchase. Weapons diversity can also help the game as well as an 'exit match' button in the loading screen before a match. There have been multiple times that I accidentally click the play button instead of the character button... maybe consider changing the word 'character' to 'soldier' or 'operator'.			"

												This game is fun if you have a low tech pc and are craving fps multiplayer action but honestly after you play for awhile and hit a tier upgrade it immediately and abruptly turns into a pay to win game. stock vehicles and weapons are absolute garbage at that point and the fun vanishes replaced with frustration at no matter how good you are you get no where. Its like having jeff gordon do a nascar race but giving him a honda civic instead of a stock car. so yeah games only fun for awhile, I would either get a better pc(low tech pc is the only reason i can see anyone playing this) or look for LITERALLY any other game.

								It's got a lot of potential for a browser game. And it is also one of the only Free-to-Play FPS games on Steam to not force you to make an account on another website just so they can spam your e-mail. It's also not really pay to win because the weapons you get are half decent and everybody else seems to have never played an FPS before. The cons are that almost everybody you're in a match with is an idiot. You'll see plenty of helicopters stuck in the corners of maps as their pilots spam the chat with ""help"". It is basically a buggy broken Battlefield on Unity.			"

												Stilton, Pear and Walnut bread(Makes one small loaf)Ingredients:500g Strong White Bread Flour10g Salt7g satchet instant yeast20g Unsalted Butter, diced and softened320ml water200g Stilton Cheese100g Walnut Peices1 pear, peeled, cored and diced1. Tip the flour into a large bowl. Add the salt to one side, yeast into the other. Add the butter and 3/4ths of the water, then turn the mixture with the fingers of one hand. Add the remaining water a little at a time, continuing to mix untill all the flour is taken in and the dough is soft and sticky; you may not need all the water.2. Coat the work surface with a little oil to prevent the dough sticking. Turn out the dough and knead for at least 5 mins, until smooth and no longer sticky. Lightly oil a bowl, return the dough to it, and cover with cling film. Put in fride for an hour, so it has doubled in size.3. Line a baking tray with grease-proof paper. Scrape the dough out of the bowl and fold it inwards again and again until all the air is knocked out and it is smooth. Add the stilton, walnut and pear peices to the dough and work them in well.4. Shape the dough into a rectangle 30 cm long, roll it up into a sausage, then flatten it out again and roll it up a bit tighter this time. Tuck the edges under and neaten the loaf by rolling the edges to taper them slightly. Put the dogh on the baking tray with greaseproof paperwith the join underneath. Place the tray in a plastic bag and leave to prove for about 40 mins, until the loaf has doubled in size. Heat the oven too 200C, or Gas 6.5. Just before baking, gently rub flour over the loaf, then make deep diagonal cuts alo9ng the top, first in one direction, then the other, to make a criss-cross pattern. Bake for about 30 mins, until well-risen and golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.			"

												Best FREE FPS game I've played. The graphics are pretty simple that my macbook can even run it, and there are many things you can do. I've played this game until I bought CoD4 from app store, and I surely enjoyed it. I played this when this game was still in appstore (strangly this game won't run anymore from appstore), and it sure was pretty fun. There are some specific things you may have to get used to, as the mouse-look control is kind of too smooth, but when you get used to it, the tanks and the helicopters are also fun to ride.			"

												Stilton, Pear and Walnut bread(Makes one small loaf)Ingredients:500g Strong White Bread Flour10g Salt7g satchet instant yeast20g Unsalted Butter, diced and softened320ml water200g Stilton Cheese100g Walnut Peices1 pear, peeled, cored and diced1. Tip the flour into a large bowl. Add the salt to one side, yeast into the other. Add the butter and 3/4ths of the water, then turn the mixture with the fingers of one hand. Add the remaining water a little at a time, continuing to mix untill all the flour is taken in and the dough is soft and sticky; you may not need all the water.2. Coat the work surface with a little oil to prevent the dough sticking. Turn out the dough and knead for at least 5 mins, until smooth and no longer sticky. Lightly oil a bowl, return the dough to it, and cover with cling film. Put in fride for an hour, so it has doubled in size.3. Line a baking tray with grease-proof paper. Scrape the dough out of the bowl and fold it inwards again and again until all the air is knocked out and it is smooth. Add the stilton, walnut and pear peices to the dough and work them in well.4. Shape the dough into a rectangle 30 cm long, roll it up into a sausage, then flatten it out again and roll it up a bit tighter this time. Tuck the edges under and neaten the loaf by rolling the edges to taper them slightly. Put the dogh on the baking tray with greaseproof paperwith the join underneath. Place the tray in a plastic bag and leave to prove for about 40 mins, until the loaf has doubled in size. Heat the oven too 200C, or Gas 6.5. Just before baking, gently rub flour over the loaf, then make deep diagonal cuts alo9ng the top, first in one direction, then the other, to make a criss-cross pattern. Bake for about 30 mins, until well-risen and golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.			"

												The game it's self is cool but it could use a missions and NPC to fight against. the game seems like it is more like a knock off of call of duty. it would be nice if there were other ways to get gear other then spending money on it.			"

												Many comments are like this....but literallly the only thing I liked was the fact that I could exit and delete the game. It's graohics are worse than Facade's, and the trailer has better graphics than the actual game. Please, save your computer from this abomination.  This game is bad. "
