Early Access Review
								Lest anyone misunderstand me, this is Not A Bad Game.I’m not recommending it at this time (as of Sept. 27 patch) because the current game content does not justify the price. Let me explain...EDIT: Updated through summer 2016. See bottom of main text for details.-----------------------------The game starts by having you select some cosmetics and gear for your captain and crew. You then enter a staged tutorial battle where you learn the basics of shooting and moving your crew around the ship. You’re moved to your home port to begin the actual game. Here you hire some crew and outfit your first ship to begin your journey.Upon leaving port you can sail around a grid-type world map. You have instructions to head north and begin fighting. In truth, there’s really nothing else you could do (that giant squid beast you spawn next to is just eye candy) so you’ll head north a few spots and pick a battle location.You’re given 10 seconds to allocate all of your crew (roughly 10 men). This is woefully inadequate and you’ll likely be at least 20 seconds into fighting before you’re satisfied with everyone being in their spot. Now it’s finally time to use those guns you were promised in the title. There will be three types of enemies: small fighters, medium gunships and heavy gunships. They will attack you with a combination of bombs, machine guns and paratroopers. Your primary job is just to aim the guns so as to compensate for your target’s relative velocity and the bullet drop. Pew Pew Pew at the enemy for a few seconds and they explode quite satisfactorally. Do this well enough and you’ll hopefully survive the battle.If you survive the battle, you’ll be rewarded with gold for your total number kills. If you're destroyed, you are sent back to home port (without losing anything) and can continue from there. Eventually you rack up enough gold to buy better guns and a bigger ship. The new equipment is roughly the same as what you had before with better stats (more guns / more damage / more armor / more health). Now you’d expect the enemies would scale up as well. They don’t. You’ll be fighting the same fighters and gunships through another 20 to 30 battles in roughly the same numbers as the first battle you fought. There aren’t any bosses or different game modes. You’ve reached the end of the current content. It’s a rather hollow feeling. (Note: there is technically an alien thing called “orbs” which you can battle, but they appear to be impossible to kill in the current game, which means it’s just a “You Lose” screen by another name.)Summary:So that’s why I’m not recommending it at the moment. There’s very little game here to recommend. The mechanics of it are sound, it runs decently well and it certainly has potential, but you’re buying a 2 hour demo of a good game, which is not worth $13 USD. If there’s significant content added in an upcoming patch, I’d happily change my vote.-------------------------Updates:Halloween 2015: Added two guns and a new ship. Equipment too powerful for existing enemiesNov. 8th: Port Siege mode added. A 3 to 6 minute 2D turret sequence with clunky WASD-based controls and excessive dirty lense effects. Not fun.Dec. 1st: A few quality of life and partial price balancing changes.Christmas: Two new guns, two new reinforcement chips, one new ship. Equipment too powerful for existing enemies.--------------------------------------------------August 2016Final Update(?):It's been over 7 months since the last time I could bring myself to mess with this shell of a game. Unfortunately, it seems the developers had a similar idea with no updates or forum contact in the last 4 months. The developers still exist. They announced a new game coming out only a week ago, but -this project appears abandoned-. Please do not buy it.If you want my personal recommendation, take a look at Airships: Conquer the Skies.It has some similarities to All-Guns (early access, 2D customized ship battles, campaign map), but better in almost every single way: lower price, more content, fewer bugs, regular updates, mod/workshop support, multiplayer, as well as an active and engaging developer.

								Let's face it kids, battleships are cool! You got big guns, explosions, hard metal and loads of sea...worthy vessels. All Guns On Deck brings its own unique take on these mammoth vessels with Action/RPG elements. This brings in ideas from FTL and combines them with the gun blasting action of an arcade game. There is loads of customization ranging from weapons, ships, parts, crew, and that's just in Early Access. Combat itself is quick, vicious, and full of satisfying explosions and crew maintenance. You may be gunning down enemies but don't pay attention and your ship is full of water and everyone drowns, or burns to death, or dies by radiation poisoning. There are many elements to master and battles to be won. This is what makes All Guns on Deck fun and unique. The drawback is that the game still has quite a long ways to go. There is plenty of room for optimization and tweaks that would make the game much more friendly to the average gamer. Things like tooltips, a decent tutorial and resolution control are still missing making the quality of life in the game difficult at times. All that aside there is still plenty of potential for some awesome dynamic combat. Throw in giant sea monsters and you got me hooked. Let's just hope the developer can deliver.I personally can't wait to see the final product and conquer the huge open world of All Guns On Deck!I made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

Early Access Review
								Don't get me wrong, I do like the game, but....for a game that's pretty much a side scroll, 2D, style game, the updates are far and few in between.  Not to mention, the few updates that do come out barely have any changes worth noting.  I mean come on, it's not a graphical masterpiece that needs a smart ai and a complicated story.  It's a simple game that has great potential, butit needs to be worked on.  Another reason I gave this a thumbs down is currently you are confined to one small area on the map.  Once you've battled your way to the next port, which doesn't take much time at all, that's it.  That's as far as the game has gotten in developement and you're waiting on the devs now.   Like I siad, I like the casual/simple game play and it has potential, but the price you pay right now for 1/8th of a game and the slow, I mean SLOW, updates from the devs with a game like this, does not make it worth getting right now.  If more updates start coming in consistantly, that actually start adding significantly to the game, then I will definitely change this to a positive review.			"

								All Guns on Deck is a fun time-killer that is still being developed. It reminds me of a lot of good Flash Games I used to play, but with another added layer of depth and difficulty. Deciding Which Crew to have where feels slightly like FTL, as you have to man differnt stations with different crew to be effective. The gameplay is rather simple, point and shoot the big bad flying things, but its satisfying. The weapons and upgrade system is well fleshed out for such a small game, and I can't wait to see that be developed further.So far I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who just needs a fun time-wasting game with some strategy to it. Will update as I play more. "

								All Guns On Deck is a naval combat RTS featuring both strategy and tactics. Rather than acquiring guns and inventory in the traditional way, this game utilizes collectible item ""chips"", which can be snapped into special inventory ""sockets"". When all your chips are placed, you enter combat. Drop hired sailors into various positional ""seats"" below decks...balance your offensive gunners with your defensive repair crew to guarantee victory. Rid the seas of all who would thwart you!Please read my full review at the link below and visit my forums:Haven Review: All Guns On Deck[gamers-haven.org]Heroes of Gamers Haven:  Forum[www.gamers-haven.org] "

Early Access Review
Be advised this is a NEUTRAL REVIEW based on the game's current state (Early Access)Short Version ReviewAll Guns On Deck is a simple yet fun game where your objective is simply manage the crew of a ship and survive waves of enemies, while exploring the world. The combat system consists of shooting down enemy air targets with your ship guns.On it's current Early Access state, it might not be worth buying. YET. Though this game has a lot of potential and can surely be a smash hit when it comes out, I think it still needs a lot of improvement.============Full Review BelowGameplayThe gameplay is simple. You start at a port with your captain and you can walk around and interact a bit with some buildings and NPCs (Non-Playable Characters.) From there you can build your first ship and start venturing yourself on the world with your ship and your crew.Now this game is like a cookie clicker, but a good one. And you are hearing this from a person that hates cookie clickers.When engaged in a battle, you'll have an awfully small time to put your crew on their designated positions and start shooting down air targets. You can either leave your crew taking care of the battle for you, or you can assist them.You can also use the guns on your ship by yourself if you don't trust the AI to shoot. Plus it's a lot of fun to shoot with the guns from the ship, though it gets a bit boring after a while.The gameplay is extremely repetitive and does not offer much options for you. Plus, the only kind of enemies you'll be finding are air targets. There are no other types of enemies, only and exclusively air targets. Another thing is the fact that in this game you have to pay attention to small details. Sometimes airborne troops might land on your ship and you'll have to deal with them, by just clicking on them. Plus if certain part your ship gets damaged in combat you will have to send a crew member to fix it. So pay attention to details.What got my attention the most, was the little complexity the combat system have. When hit by a bomb, for example, you might get some fire on your engines and other components. That fire will start damaging your ship, and if you are careless, you will die. The game has different status for your ship, like HP, armor, gun slots, but some of them didn't make much difference in combat. Though the crew will make a lot of difference.Another cool feature this game has, apart from the combat, is the siege system. That said, you can invade enemy bases and destroy them. Though, I found it a bit... unfinished. The siege section of the game feels rather weird compared to the rest of the game. It is cool, but the animations feels completely not part of the game. To be honest, this section of the game feels like a game made on Flash.Currently on the Early Access, the map that you can explore is really small. So you will likely finish this game quickly and will find yourself with nothing to do other than walk on the port and get killed by invincible sea monsters.Personal OpinionThe problem about All Guns On Deck starts when the game fails to explain how everything works. It does explain, but it explains in a terrible way. When you start a new game, there will be a tutorial. In this tutorial, they throw you to fight against an invincible enemy without the basic knowhow of the game. Also the tutorial fails to make the information clear. So, if you wish to master this game, you'll have to find it for yourself. There's also a mini encyclopedia inside the game, that covers more information than just the tutorial, though, it lacks some explanation about a lot of stuff. But I guess that's alright considering the current Early Access status of the game.Another issue with the game is that, there are for example, seven types of crew to choose from, but only four of them are explained. This is something that really annoys me in general. I hate when a game has a feature and this said feature doesn't have a meaning/explanation about it.Yet another issue with information. In the game there's a equipment shop for you, but the game also fails to explain what some weapons, for example, do, or how much damage they deal and their stats. The problem I saw is that, you can only see their stats after you buy them. What if I don't like it? Well, to bad, no refunds for your guns. Plus, the map will eventually run out of enemies, meaning, you won't be able to make money when they are gone. So yeah, no replayability whatsoever.The whole fact that you are defending your ship against planes and shooting them down with your big guns is amazing. The animations for this game are really nice considering the simplicity of it. The variation of guns is not immense at the moment but surely covers a lot for a Early Access. Plus there are some funny guns you can have, like the gift cannon that shoots presents at your enemies, or the cannon that shoots crew members. I wanna see more cool features like these in the future.PROS+ Addictive & fun gameplay;+ Quick to Learn;+ Skirmish Mode;+ No known bugs or major issues;+ Well detailed game;+ Well animated game;+ Various gun variations.+ Nice and simple graphicsCONS- Repetitive combat;- Repetitive soundtracks;- Repetitive enemies;- Lack of information around game content;- Gets easily boring;- Could use more customization;- No replayability;- Definitely not worth the price (at current state;)- Game is awfully short (at current state;)- AI aiming is terrible (needs serious improvement;)- Needs difficulty balancing.Gameplay - 6/10Interface - 4/10FINAL VEREDICT5.5/10 - Slightly Below Average (At current development state)Note for the Developer(s)Ok, let's begin with this. Your game needs to cover more information about the stuff it has. More info on the weapons, ships and stuff from the shop. More descriptive statistics and info about said features. Also while in the port, it would be nice to see a display with the current time and weather. Also a improvement on the character walking system would be nice too.Also, why can't we skip the tutorial? It breaks the whole sense of having two options on the menu of the game. One for 'New Game' and another for 'Tutorial'.The tutorial needs to cover more information about the ship, crew, and surroundings. It's like you throw me at a cage with a lion without proper training and expect me to win.Another thing, I wish there could be more ways to interact with your ship, because I feel like the ship crew does everything, and I'm just there watching they have all the fun. The only cool thing I can do is shoot the guns. If you ask me what is your game good for, I won't be able to say a thing. Though again, it is addicting, it is fun, but lacks a lot of content on it's current state. Now, the crosshair customization, that is nice. One of the coolest features I've seem in the game. Now I wish there was more customization like changing the color of the ship, using other flags, and maybe even changing the interface a bit. That would be cool to see in the future.Your game is wonderfully cool and has a lot of potential. All it needs is a push in the right direction. I await anxious for the final version to come out. Until then I hope you will do the right thing for the game and update it, add more features, and hopefully this game can be a smash hit.============If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

								Read reviews comparing the game to FTL. This game is no where near the same as FTL for replay or challenge. By the end all your doing is waiting for your ship to repair itself before you kill the last enemy to start the next wave. The crew alocation is also rather shallow you just load your ship up with 20 crew members and fill every slot not much depth to it. Also there are more than a few bugs including the inability to finish the last fight at times due to ""target"" glitches.Interesting idea that fell flat.			"

			Views: 71		

			#allgunsondeck http://store.steampowered.com/app/315330/ I apologize about the fan being on in the background, it gets very hot where I live.		

+ Fun addicting gameplay, where you frantically try to survive while managing your ship crew+ Graphically speaking everything looks great, I especially liked the backgrounds, and the the cloud/shadows that moved overheard while at the port.+ The User Interface is very well done and pretty easy to understand even though a lot of things are going on at once durign combat.+ A unique modification / card system which easily lets you modify and give interesting abilities to your ship+ The tutorial itself was quick and easy to understand and did a good job of teaching you the essential mechanics+ You fight a variety of unexpected airborn combatants (the Orbs)This game is in Early Access, please don't take these negatives too seriously- I found the game to be overly challenging at the beginning especially if you don't choose the card/ship with the 3 gun-placements from the start.  (And when I say overly challenging, if you happen to choose the ship with 1 or 2 gunplacements, you will likely always lose the first mission and may not understand what you did wrong)- After each battle you need to go back to port to heal, but typically it takes too much time to travel back so the quick way is to enter a new battle but click ""retreat to port"" before starting. I think this is a silly mechanic, and I feel like your boat should be immedietely healed after each battle considering your crew-members are constantly healing it anyway.- The difficulty curve is a bit too high it seems... I had trouble getting very far in the game as the enemies seemed to be overly difficult while I didn't seem to be getting enough money for upgrades.~ All the battles I've seen seem to be focused on air targets, it would be neat if you also had to fight enemy ships as wellOverall, I really enjoyed this game, and feel like this is somewhat of a hidden gem currently. Definitely something I'll play again especially when it comes out of Early Access.			"

This is a qualified recommendation. If there was an option between yes and no I would have chosen that.After playing the game at this early stage there are things to like about the game but there are some things that need to be fixed before the game leaves early access.Overall I like the concept behind the game. The combination of combat with ship management is a good concept for a game. Individually the two concepts work pretty well at this stage. The problems come from having to handle both aspects at the same time. The computer AI is terrible at aiming so you will have to kill most of the enemies yourself. Since you are so focused on shooting the guns though you don't have enough time to focus on tending to the ship itself. The game doesn't do a good enough job warning you when there are issues with your ship. If the game can find a better way to combine the two main elements, All Guns On Deck could be a good game but at this stage it is a little rough around the edges. Note: I received a free review copy of All Guns On Deck. Other than receiving a free review copy I received no other compensation for this review and it had no impact on the content of this review.

								It's ok, there's stuff to do in the game, basically you control a ship , on which you have to optimize its every function by assigning positions to the crew members and giving them a different kit. You have gunners, the hull repairers, the firemen, and all sorts of other ship jobs to give to your crew members. You can also control the ship yourself.

YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'All Guns On Deck' (GeForce GT640, Windows 10) 

			Views: 159		

			This game is available here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/315330 PLEASE NOTE: At the time of this video, the game is still in early access.		

Arcade action gameplay combined with FTL style mechanics. The vast horizons are full of pirates, vagabonds with no claim to the ground their feet tread. Amongst the bandits scattered across the oceans, four factions dominate the worlds main landmasses. Eutopia's conquest will be the force that rids the world of its calamity. Making way for a new era of prosperity, with all continents under one banner. In a world where sea battles are the punch line of jokes uttered by historians, the generals of Eutopia focus their efforts on reviving the lost art of ship building to aid in the campaign against aerially superior foes. Hiring small bands of mercenaries to take to the seas and launch a global attack on all fronts from beneath the skies. Though, as men once again set sail, the ocean reminds why the depths were abandoned all those years ago. All Guns On Deck is a strategy, real time tactics action rpg, naval combat game with a unique battle system and unforgiving world to conquer. Players find themselves in the boots of a naive young sea captain, eager to take to the waves in support of the war effort of his great nation. - Recommended!			"

								Would not recommend....at the moment.Cons:AI pathing is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Upgrades and new ships cost to much. You don't get enough coins per battle, so it just becomes a grinding session.The harder missions give you a lot less coin, compared to the easier missions.The little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that parachute onto your ship deal way more damage than the bombs that fall on your ship. Barely any features and no story/back story. Pro's: It looks to be a great idea. Don't get me wrong, I can see potential, but in it's current state, it's very fustrating. Hopefully, in a couple of months, we'll see it expanded and added to. At the moment, I wouldn't buy it. But check it out in a couple of months and hopefully it will be a lot better. I bought this because I was waiting for something big to download and the game did exactly what I wanted it to, kept me busy for a while. I probably won't be coming back to it for a couple of months, simply because I didn't buy it to get into it. I was just bored.			"

								A godawful game. Simple as that.Cons (since there are no positives)- AI is stupid as♥♥♥♥♥♥- You can't station your crew outside combat, rendering your crew useless before dying a couple of times when placing them.- No difficulty scaling, ammediately pitched against gunships and all that when you have a ship with 2 gun stations.- The game is just outright boring.Do NOT buy this game.

								Wait a bit because the first build 28/08 is like on let's play video with all faulty thing removed so no more option button an be a generic commander with no name . And whern you get sinked you get less number of waves and get no doubloon and all ship can for now only get a limited number of crew whitch can be placed and only 1 engineer to repair only not 4 or 5 so we get sinked fast enough.So I recommand wait and see.For now my impression this game is in early alpha -no difficulty level -no option button -no name customisation -gameplay : for the crew the 2 basic ship expect to be killed easy.seems to be a mobile phone game not pc oneshould have more deck to use more of the crew afterall (like interstellaria) the concept ""modular system command for advanced customisation.""need more gun emplacement it's a pc dammit use the average 6-8 Go Ram and 2 Ghz (steam stats)-ship should have the way to escape battle when things turn bad-superpower limited use in addition to the long charging rate time expect to be killed fast-it should be like a shoot-them up for the guns if we have more guns and add evasion system to the ship (go left and go right) and some shield module for the end-tier cause if we got 26 crew on the 1stbattleship i don't expect them to be in the reserve due to the lack of slot and buggy specialisation.Buy this game only if you want to support dev and pray they won't let a beta unfinished like some other early access company.I think i gonna wait for 2017-2018 to see the result.(one game cycle is 3 year usually now from alpha to final)			"

								It looks like a decent game at first. But one thing I don't like is the fact that you have no time to move your crew to where they need to be and assign them special roles. During this time you're getting enhialated. If you lose and your ship gets blown up, or you change ships, you have to do this all over again, and if you change weapons, you have to reassign crew for just those weapons, which isn't all that bad, but still unfair and a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It would be better if there were an option to assign crew prior to heading out to sea. The orb things are impossible to beat, even with the overpowered overkill christmas and haloween themed weapons. You can't access the whole map, once you clear out all the enemies within your reach, that's it. You can't progress any more. Kind of an unfinished disappointed feeling after purchasing the strongest ship and the strongest weapons and figuring out the best placement of the crew, you just can't beat the fetus looking orb guys and there's nowhere else to go.If more content was added, and the fetus guys became beatable, maybe through some kind of special upgrade to your ship that lets you withstand the lazerbeam and do more damage.. But if your ship is strong enough to beat those things, then the rest of the enemies will become way too easy. There's not much variety in the enemies either. They don't get stronger. Just Super difficult at the start, then you get stronger so it gets easier, then you beat all the enemies, then you die repeatedly against a giant, indistructable, floating, lazer shooting, fetus			"

								I want to give this a positive review, really as it's an interesting game. But it's not complete and from all signs the dev has abandoned it and pocketed the early access money while only having completed the first area. Decent upgrade system for weapons, ships and crew. Decent sense of task management.Once you have the best ship though the game practically plays itself with little or no need from player intervention. I have little way of knowing if the difficulty ramps up as teh only about 10% of teh game was completed. Don't waste your money on this as it's basically a beta barely out of Alpha.Edit.So here we are in late December and still not a peep from the dev. Valve also has seen fit to leave this unfinished game in it's curent state on the storefront. Message to Valve. You are hurting genuinely ethical early access devs by allowing punks like this dev to get away with this. I cannot trust an EA game from an unknown dev any more as I have seen first hand how your customer support handles cases like this.Edit the second.Alright it's now February 2017. The developer has stuck their head in the message boards long enough to explain that they will still be working on the game. As of this writing until I modify it again no action was taken but they are still in contact.			"

								This game has an interesting concept and i would like to see it go far.Pros:Cool art styleInteresting gameplayCustomisable weaponryWill run smoothly on nearly all computers, no mater how old or badCons:Repetitive battlesExtreamly difficult enemyshard to earn moneyOver all i think this game has a lot of possibilitys and might be worth £10 in the future.However I have heared that in some circles you can get this game for free and i consider that as an absolute steal and worth the miniscule amount of storage on your computer.

								A decent game, but I can not recommend it because the price is too high. I got this game for free and that's what I suggest you to do as well. Try to get this for free in a giveaway or when it is on a sale.I rate this game  5/10 .			"

								The game is not bad, looks neat, but it's really confusing, there are no pointers anywhere, the game doesn't have a ""clear"" objective and it is really anoying to navigate in the map...			"
