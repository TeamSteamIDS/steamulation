												I told my friends I was idling for cards. I lied.Edit; Crap. You put me on the front page, here is a real review.Let me start this honestly. I am totally biased. If My Heart Had Wings is the first Visual Novel I ever played, and I love it with all of my little heart. Also in case you didn't notice I've played this game for more than 900 hours, and only 20 of those hours were idle. I've run through each route in this game at least 15 times, and I can actually speak really crappy Japanese because of this game. In addition, I've spent more money on this game for the badges, emoticons, cards, extra cards and backgrounds.So yeah, I am biased. If you chose to continue thanks, and here's the review;The good parts of this game are extremely good, and the bad parts of this game are extremely bad.So here is the good. 1. The characters are well fleshed out, being both fully voice acted and having logical lives and choices. Sure each of them are anime tropes, but the tropes are presented so well that they work here. Ageha is the generic tomboy, Kotori is trapped in a wheel chair, Amane is the innocent genius, the twin's are polar opposites of eachother that rarely agree. Ageha's suggestive dialogue makes you smile, and Kotori's fears are understandable. Even Amane's childlike innocence is presented in conjunction with her hopes for the future, and living up to what it means to be an adult. 2. Next is the art, it's not the crazy excess.....of certain areas.....of the Sakura series, or the strange realism of more ""American"" anime. Here the character's are mostly normal. This is a personal preference, but I certainly appreciate it. 3. The routes are also well done. Kotori's, of course, is the main route and does have the most story, and in the words of most reviewers ""it got da feels"". But, personally, Kotori is not my favorite route. I enjoy Ageha's more, as a matter of fact Ageha's route was the first I completed. Her personality develops as much as Kotori's on the route and becomes as complex as Kotori's. The same happens with Amane's route. The twins' routes are probably the least interesting, but still work well.There is more good like the soundtrack, the dialogue, and the story itself but it's time to move onto the bad stuff.1. Moenovel, and censoring. These are probably the most obvious problems. The game was originally published in Japan, and was translated by Moenovel. They did a pretty crappy job of it. Not only are their many horrible typos, and brutal censorship, they also directly detract from the story. One moment in particular always breaks the immersion. At one point Ageha is explaing that a women can control any man with her big, bouncy, round....eyes. Now, we all know that ""eyes"" is definetely not the right word. This comment which could have gotten a laugh without censorship really crushes me. I have played this game with the fan-created restoration patch, but it is agony to install. Overall, I think this game gains a solid 8/10 for most people and a 9.5/10 for me, mostly due to nostalgia. Definetely worth the purchase at full price, and a steal for less than $5.Thanks for reading, this is my first legitimate review so please feel free tell me if there is something I should mention, or something I could improve on.Another edit; Just hit 500 hours. Currently very proud of myselfOne more edit; Thanks for voting this review to the top of the store page, I appreciate it alot.Even more edits; 200 voters?! Thanks so much everyone!I need to stop editing this; Thanks to steam user;  The Enlightenment  for pointing out that there is a partially complete (and free!) app for android and iOS of If My Heart Had Wings. Moenovel is updating it slowly, and the app is about 25% of the story.This must take forever to read; 300 people! Wow. Thanks again guys.Just keep adding, just keep adding; Thanks for getting this to 400 people!More edits; Thanks for getting this to 500 people and still having a 99% rating, it's very appreciated.I think the edits are longer than the review now; 600 people!

												TL;DR: Buy this game to support the devs (and support the devs only), and then get the Japanese version and patch it with the upcoming translation patch!I would like to recommend this game, I really would. In fact- I do recommend it. However, I don't recommend you bother with this steam version of the game. While the story is pretty good as visual novels go, this particular version is mired with two main issues: heavy censorship and blind-idiot translation.The censorship is one thing- it's a bit Orwellian in this case how far they've gone to make it completely PG, to the point of completely destroying one character's route (rather famously), but to be honest this is the lesser problem. What the slightly bigger problem is that they haven't done anything to deal with the voices, which sometimes end up saying the uncensored lines instead (I'm pretty sure you don't need any formal education in Japanese to be able to distinguish the words breasts and eyes).But again, this is fine in comparison to the real reason why I cannot recommend this game: from what I can tell, it was translated by a lot of different people, some of which did not know the characters at all, and their raw translations were mashed together to create the final product. Really, there are points where characters apparently change gender in the middle of a scene multiple times. There are cases I remember where one character's name (which is SPOKEN IN THE DIALOGUE) is replaced by another's. Honorfic translations are inconsistent (if I remember correctly) and this also creates a slight amount of confusion.You know it's bad when you're reading a visual novel in your native language and you're correcting mistakes in the translation (incorrect nouns for the most part) from listening to the voice track.APPEND: Wow, I didn't know lots of people agreed with my opinion. To continue what I was saying, the visual novel I would like to recommend is Kono Oozora ni Tsubasa wo Hirogete. However, I cannot say this, as I, as with the majority of people playing the game, cannot read Japanese well enough [or at all] to fully enjoy this game. Therefore I am taking this game for face-value from the Moe-Novel adaptation.To extend: The Moe-Novel translation is poor, and suffer from very large QC problems. It also has censorship, which unlike many others, I can accept. If it is for the sake of us getting the game on Steam at all, I'd rather have a censored game (see The Fruit of Grisaia) than no game at all. The story is pretty stable enough to support the game without any sexual content, but it is a shame that they decided to set their target audience so low as to have to warp the story of one route to allow for this. Had they only aimed for a 15-17 target audience, then honestly I wouldn't see there being many problems.As you may know, there is a uncensoring patch available, which also tauts having an improved translation. I have used this patch as well (hence the broken gametime associated with this account) and I can confirm the uncensoring works as intended. However, I cannot say that I found the translation any more consistent and accurate than the original MoeNovel one, even during scenes that weren't in the censored game. If you are looking for a simple hentai fix, then this patch should serve you well, but if you are looking for a game with proper quality controlled translations, then I cannot in good faith say it is any better than the original.I can appreciate people downvoting my review. I can do this because I have been in your position as well, having a game with a good story that you enjoy that works perfectly well for your standards. But this game is different, so much that I cannot defend it. Having a game this long and the localisation team did not care about it is pathetic. Look at Sekai Project's localisations for an example for how you can have a long visual novel that is translated fairly consistently well. I'm not saying they have no problems, but I can assure you that if I took a shot every time I found a mistake in one of their localisations, I'd be fine by the end of the visual novel. If I did it for this, even for the ""patched"" version, I'd be hammered in well under half an hour.			"

												Edit: It seems I get quite a bit of friend requests because of this review. If you plan to add me, please make your profile public as I like to see who I am dealing with.Okay, spoiler alert: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!Oh God, where to start? This has made me so FREAKING MAD.Now disregard the 0 hours I have on this, I have about 24 hours in the patched uncensored Japanese version.It uses the same translation as the steam version and the adult scenes are fan translated.Now the ""company"" called Moenovel has made a ""translation"" of this game, or it should be.The translation is outright terrible! I don't know what incompetent idiots they hired, but they sure as hell aren't translators.About a good 20 hours into the game, it simply gets really really bad, they're mixing up names.A few examples are:1) At some point they're having dinner and they translate ""Hai-yo"", which means ""(yo) sure"", but translated it as ""Mornin'"" instead.2) ""Amane plus knife equals dangerous... You take care of her, Aoi!"" And instead of Aoi, she mentioned Kana.3) Masatsugu: ""Ou- Ouch! Ah! Ageha!"" which should be ""Oh, over there! Heeeeey! Agehaaaa!""4) (This is seriously the next line) Ma-bou is Masatsugu's nickname ""Huh? Geez, you're such a baby! And so is Kumoi.""which again should be ""Oh hey, if it isn't Ma-bou! And Akari is here too."" (Akari is the first name of Kumoi.)5) And this isn't the last time they misinterpret ""ita ita"" as ""Ouch!"", such is the case here: ""Ummm... Ah! Ouch!"" which again should be ""Ummm... Ah! Over there!""6) They also can't tell remarks apart from questions, such as translating ""uaa, honto da!"" as ""Wow, really?"" instead of ""Wow, it really is!"".7) Again mixing up names: ""Habane-san wa?"" as ""And Aoi?"" instead ""Habane is?"" or ""Kotori is?"", since they always mention her by her first name for some reason.8) Again a simply idiotic mistranslation here ""Are te...?"" as ""Arrrrgh"" instead of ""Isn't that...?"".9) Did I also mention these people can't speak English? ""Did you forget about that those legs of yours?""10) ""Do you have a twin?"" instead of ""Where are the twinsisters?"" After that our protagonist talks about ramen,but since he doesn't have a voice and I don't have the Japanese text here I am not sure what it said, but he completely fails  to mention anything about the twins here in English.So I mentioned 10 points in a game timespan of about 30 minutes! BUT THAT'S NOT FREAKING ALL!There is much more! I guess they somewhat made the beginning a bit less bad,since that only consists of mistranslations and typos.After the 22 hour mark they just plainly give up and put whatever crap they can come up with there.I suppose they didn't expect anybody to read this for more than 20 hours anyway.Is this what the visual novel scene has come to?Translations made by incompetent idiots that do a worse job than google translate?Apparently yes, if you scroll up you can see that this game has a ""very positive"" rating, VERY FREAKING POSITIVE!Either the players of this are very forgiving and hope the next VN translation is going to be better or steam just hates quality.Now enough about the translation, for the game itself it PAINS me to not being able to recommend this.It's such a lovely novel, the characters are very cute and likeable, has a good story that keeps you interested and the art is great!I really love this novel, but that's exactly why I can't let this pass. The company has to pay for this pathetic excuse for a translation.So if you want to support the VN, buy the Japanese version instead, but not this one.And as you might have seen, this one has been majorly censored, anything ""adult"" is censored out.They even censored the kissing scenes! CENSORED! KISSING! That's ridiculous!There is a patch to uncensor the steam version, but it's very buggy. Which is the reason I decided to download the Japanese version instead.So yeah, if you want to support a localization company, support Sekai Project or Manga Gamer instead.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I love this game so much I literally bought it again just to have it on steam.I'm so excited!!! Okay, here we go.""If My Heart Had Wings"" is a beautiful and touching Visual Novel rivaled only by the likes of Katawa Shoujo. It is eroge and bishoujo; it's not a porn game, but there are adult themes and elements. The soundtrack is SUPERB. The plot is intriguing and every character is incredibly fleshed out. No two paths are anything close to being alike. Speaking of paths, there are multiple ways this VN can play out, as is typical of VN. All of them are deep and emotionally satisfying. I literally had to take a day off work the day I got this game the first time because I couldn't tear myself away from the story. The only VN I've ever loved more than this one is Katawa Shoujo, and I keep mentioning it because there are so many parallels that can be drawn from this VN to that one.In the story.... JUST KIDDING!! There are no spoilers in this review!!TL;DRIt will make your cold dead heart feel alive again. Great music, great art, amazingly detailed characters and story. A Must-have!DID I MENTION THE DUCK WITH THE TOP HAT?EDIT: Here is a link to the site that restores the erotic content http://fuwanovel.org/novels/if-my-heart-had-wings-restoration-patch "

												If My Heart Had Wings would of been an excellent Visual Novel for both beginners and long time fans if it was not so devastated by MoeNovels attempts to ""localize"" the game, tons of sections are incorrectly translated and then displayed in ways that make no sense in the context they are used. The game is littered with typos and bugs, this VN could of been fine as an all ages version but not only is the sexual content cut but anything resembling an ""adult"" theme is cut, including slightly innapropriate jokes.My playthrough of all routes was done with the Restoration patch, using this disables steam achievements, restores the missing sexual content (and other removed scenes) and lightly fixes some translation discrepencies. The sole reason I bought the game on Steam was to support more Visual nvoels in the west but I, however will not be supporting any more MoeNovel published visual novels in the future if they keep up this pattern of butchering what was once a great expierence. This has ruined the original developers vision by misrepresenting it with this so called ""Localization"".Other than that the only problems I had with the game was that it is not very good for replayability and a lot of routes are locked until you have completed others, this isn't uncommon for Visual Novels but since IMHHW focuses a lot on the Glider, every route is extremely similiar other than the few dates and bonding moments on routes.Once the characters actually start dating the game goes a little down hill on a few routes, namely Ageha's and Amanes as it becomes more focused on the glider. However Kotori, Asa and Yoru all have a bit more time spent on the relationship side of things so are more enjoyable.To summarize, I would be lying if I said I did not enjoy my time with If my Heart had wings but I felt like it could of been much better without the huge localization issues, as such I feel I could only recommend this to people with little knowledge of visual novels or the japanese language and that's hardly much of a recommendation. Time would of been better spent finishing another novel. 4/10 you dun ♥♥♥♥ed it upEdit: Check the comments, I edited some misinformation on my part :)			"

												If my heart has wings, winner of several visual novel game awards, is an all-ages visual novel that is available on Steam. If My Heart Had Wings is a romance title centering around a high school glider club known as the “Soaring Club.” It is a touching story about loss, love, and passion which is an enjoyable read from start to finish. There are 5 routes in total and all of them had happy moments and depressing moments. It’s hard not to get invested in a character emotionally when they have so much detail put into them.If My Heart Had Wings had several explicit sex scenes upon its original release in Japan. However, all of these scenes have been cut wholesale from the game and additional nude scenes have been heavily edited in the Western version. Therefore I will not be talking about the adult version.The storyAoi Minase returns with shattered dreams to his hometown of Kazegaura. There, atop a hill lined with windmills, he encounters a wheelchair-bound girl, Kotori Habane, and a beautiful, white glider soaring through the sky. Together, they decide to revive their school’s Soaring Club in order to ride the “Morning Glory”, a cloud known to appear once in a blue moon on the wind that blows across Kazegaura.Characters The characters has a diverse and well-rounded cast. There is Ageha, the childhood best friend character who is transitioning from tom boy into a popular girl; Amane, an eccentric genius who has repeatedly failed her senior year in order to remain in the Soaring Club; Asa, the cute, excitable freshman; and Yoru, Asa’s twin sister, seemingly polar opposite; and Kotori the main girl of the story, Kotori, is by far the most interesting character. She is your typical tsundere but have a physical disability,of not being able to use her legs and much of the story focuses on her dealing with her disability of overcoming it and while dealing with the psychological effect of her being a teenage girl not being able to walk on her own.Visual and audio elementsI generally enjoyed the overall art and visual elements of the game, the background art is really beautiful with vibrant colors being used and the environment is absolutely stunning. Character designs are top-notch too with beautiful CG’s.The audio elements i really loved it has a full Japanese audio for all of the girls, and side characters combined with a well fitting soundtrack sets the mood and feel like it belongs in the situation and the environment.The consOverall i feel that there is not many flaws i can find in this visual novel other than it gives way too much information about gilders that turn some point of the story from interesting to boring and some “typo” plus bad translation.In conclusionI would definitely recommend this great title from MOE novel, it’s a title not to be missed as this is something that will be a deep, engaging experience.Click here for full review![azusantiara.wordpress.com] "

												If My Heart Had Wings is a 8/10 Romance Eroge Visual Novel Originally Developed by Pulltop Games. Unfortunately, Moenovel's localisation provided a cut, messy abortion that turned a 8/10 game into a 3/10 4kids friendly VN. With its release on Steam being delayed by 5+ Hours and not being changed for the better, this VN would have been considered bad and be left on the backburner.However, with a 18+ Restoration Patch, all of the cut content is restored and the re-translation makes If My Heart Has Wings a bearable Romantic Eroge to read.

												If you're using Windows 8, do not buy this game.The Steam version of this game is badly translated, and has horrible, needless errors like backgrounds not appearing. There is a restoration patch to improve the experience, but there is currently no viable patch for Windows 8. When one is released, then this will be worth buying.It's disgraceful that such a chopped-up, broken version of a game was released just for the sake of making it family-friendly. Frankly, the people who did this should be ashamed of themselves.			"

												This Game is absolutely amazing 10/10 100/100, the one flaw it has is steams censorship of the game, it's so dumb. I can play GTA 5 and interatively TORTURE a man, and that's OK. I can see THE 3D♥♥♥♥♥♥of a stripper, SEE THE SEX I AM HAVING WITH A GOD DAMN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, BUT HEAVEN FORBID I SEE A BRA FROM SOMEONE GETTING WET, OR SEE A WOMAN'S NIPPLES. Steam I would like to remind you that it is not  a crime for a woman to be topless she can have her boobs out, and most of these games from Japan do a certian amount of censoring anyway. I understand not wanting to have a game that is essentially porn, but the sex scences are very short. I enjoy them purely under a pregression point, it makes the relationship seem real,  because people have SEX, it's part of life, and to hide it cheapens our lives on the whole. I genuinely want a refund because you had the 18+ gate on the game, and I just can't accept this. I understand with The Devil on G-String why you censored that it had an incest route that might look bad for your image. All in All is the fact that because this game is still 18+ and has been heavily censored I am quite upset.			"

												MoeNovel is a scumbag company who are only out to make a quick buck, and nothing more. They took a popular Japanese ""Eroge"" VN (in this case, If My Heart Had Wings), churned the text through the Google Translate meat grinder, butchered off any mention of sexual content, and♥♥♥♥♥♥it out to the English-speaking public. Never had they bothered to fix any of the translation or grammar errors.Bigger problem, is that the community didn't care or bother. They just translated the erotic scenes and♥♥♥♥♥♥out a patch for them. Even the ones with the young-looking twins. Wow, excellent. Shows how much people actually care about the story and the characters. Hah!And to add insult to injury, If you think you are getting the full experience by buying the ""Deluxe Edition"", you're gravely mistaken. There are two additional expansions for this VN which were never translated or anything. One of them is called ""Flight Diary"" and the other is called ""Snow Presents"".			"

												I really want to be able to recommend this, it's an excellent VN in its own right but the Moenovel release is atrocious. Sure there's censorship, but the h-scenes in the original were a little gratuitous anyway so that's not a big deal - the main issue is the translation. There are five routes, three of which I've played - two of the three are mostly fine (Kotori, Amane) but the third (Ageha) is so poorly translated that a good amount of it is borderline nonsensical. There are frequent typos, grammar issues and lines too long for the text box, and even with my incredibly basic understanding of a few Japanese phrases it's possible to pick out blatant errors in the text from listening to the voice lines. I don't understand how Moenovel thought this was acceptable for a commercial release, it's an insult to the source material.			"

----tl;drGraphics/Art: 10Sound/Voices: 10Gameplay/Controls: 5Story: 9OVERALL: 9----FYI, this is the vanilla 'censored' version, essentially the standard game installed via Steam, no patches or any fan disks unlocked. I'll explain why later.This is a visual novel whereby you, Aoi, an expert bike racer injures his knee and returns to his hometown to continue his schooling. There he learns about the Soaring Club and the glider, and wishes to go to the skies to visit a rare cloud formation known locally as the Morning Glory, which is a real phenomenon also (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Glory_cloud).Whilst getting involved with the Soaring club, he meets a wheelchair-bound Kotori, his childhood female friend Ageha, the eternally repeating (but brilliant) student running the Club Amane, and  identical twins the childish Asa and genius Yoru. You'll also learn the history as to why the club fell on hard times due to an accident in its past. Oh, and there's a pet duck wearing a top hat, and he's called Hat.As with visual novels, if you are interested in a character, just follow the options, pick the right girl for you, and don't change. You'll end up on their route all the way to the end. The prologue is common to all routes, and the first route you need to do is Kotori, since it helps to unlock the Asa and Yoru routes. There are no full nudity scenes, nor sex, but you'll read about that later. Time to play is as follows:Prologue (common route) – 7 hours Kotori – 15 hours Ageha – 5 hoursAmane – 3 hoursAsa – 3 hoursYoru – 3 hoursBad end – 1 hour (just trying to find it!)I played the game to 100% completion and got all achievements, so the figure above is the approximate time needed to get them.Not sure why Kotori took so long, I may have left the game running by accident for a while. You can cheat a little by saving the game at the main choices (of which there are about five) in separate slots, and select a different character, and follow on from there, which is why subsequent playthroughs are quicker, since you can choose to skip all read text to get to the next choice, and then eventually see the new scenes. Controls are basic; hence the low score, but visual novels don't exactly require dexterous fingers and 6000 DPI mice.Voice acting is there for all characters and most secondary characters too, aside from the protagonist, who is silent, only having text for him. The voices are great, though it can get tiring to listen to them, you can easily continue clicking the text and the next voice will play for the next paragraph. Music (if you buy it in the DLC) is also peaceful, comical and exciting when the mood calls for it, pleasant listening for a 29 track soundtrack. There are two songs which are sung in Japanese, with instrumental versions included too.Art is beautiful all throughout, from the sprites which are high quality even on my 1920x1080 screen to the backgrounds, with many desktop wallpaper-worthy images to see. There are even some movies showing the flight of the glider, windmills, and characters in the intro. You won't be disappointed.The story is the catch though; you're intrigued by the characters and the concept of flying in a glider. Technical specs and terminology are mentioned on occasion, and it even helped alleviate me when it comes to flying, since any aircraft can glide provided there's enough lift and the wings are level. The routes are quite satisfying to play through. Without spoilers, Kotori's route delves into her disability and getting to help her fly in the glider. Ageha route is the childhood friend learning to love him instead of seeing him as just that. Amane's route talks about the main mystery in the story, what happened to the previous Soaring Club members, and also her lack of common sense in most social situations. Asa focuses on her childishness and how she sees herself in the world. Yoru's is similar, her route detailing how her intelligence can be used to help others.Spoilers follow in a moment. The only thing I really disliked with regards to the story was Yoru's route, the problem for me was that there was no 'Yoru route', instead going down the trap of a double-date where both twins are the girlfriends of the protagonist at the same time. This really put a dampener on the entire story for me, especially since you have to make a distinct choice to properly reject Yoru instead of getting to know her early on like the main three girls, or to choose both of them. Other issues now; sadly, there are a large number of grammar and spelling errors. I expected at least one, but not this many. At points even character names are mixed up so you don't know who they are talking about, 'Quack' is sometimes translated as 'Kuaa', you get the picture. Quality varies from route to route, so it is possible that translators split the jobs up, leaving the less experienced ones to do a route, resulting in these errors. It is quite unfortunate, since it is very jarring to see this during a visual novel. Censorship was another problem, for some people at least. I chose not to apply the patch to restore the missing CGs (and yes, nude sex scenes too) with the text corrections as well for two reasons. First is that I wanted to read a story, not read a story and then skip the sex stuff for no reason. I feel it doesn't improve the story whatsoever, and from what I have read, there are a lot of scenes especially in Ageha's route. The writing in those scenes (based off other VNs) is cringe worthy, and I personally do not enjoy seeing images like that. Second reason is when you apply the patch, you lose chance to gain achievements since it messes with the games coding in Steam's eyes.Some text was changed too to comply with censorship, though it doesn't make much sense, since it is only words! Things like 'she has great big eyes', when the Japanese voice mentions the word for breasts (something you sadly learn after watching lots of anime). One scene (no great spoiler here), where Amane is watching Titanic is actually about her watching porn, though I still found the censored text funny.For me, the overall routes in terms of personal quality are ranked as follows: Amane > Kotori > Asa > Yoru > Ageha. The first two have a lot of drama in them, and the ladies really seem to change by the end for the better, and you get quite attached to them. The twins are fairly equal, against coming to terms with their own problems. Ageha to honest annoyed me, and never really seemed to be serious, though that will be up to you to read and decide. Even Yoru's route ranks higher than that for me. I have heard that the restoration patch helps improve Ageha's route since a lot was cut, but I'm not going to review that version.Despite the text error and censorship problems, this is well worth a purchase. The art is gorgeous, music great, voices funny, story intriguing and leaves you wanting to read the next scene, and before you know it, the sun's gone down.I could apply the patch now and see all the missed content, but seeing I'll need to play the game over again, it makes me a little sick, so I've had my fill of gliders for a long while to come…(edit: grammar)			"

												Love this visual novel so much, however if you're going to get it I suggest getting the restoration patch from fuwanovel to restore all the cut content ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Update: Installing the restoration patch will disable achievements. Still, it's worth installing the patch for reasons ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"
