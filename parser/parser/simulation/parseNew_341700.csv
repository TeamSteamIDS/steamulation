												I bought this game and wish I hadn't. I knew that it would be a rudimentary interface, answer multiple choice questions to affect your character's destiny, etc. And the premise is very interesting: play out the life of an elderly Frenchman and try to help him stay alive as long as he can, etc.But the game doesn't really value life, and takes a denigrating and condescending stance toward older people. I myself am 66 years of age, so I noticed that the game just seems to have this one-dimensional view of an older person living in humble circumstances. I go along with tracking the character's mood and other attributes, but there were just too many instances of the character stepping in dog feces, having a bird defecate on his head, being made fun of by younger people, etc. Three or four years into the character's game life, he is about 68 years old, and a screen pops up asking 'just how long can one live and have life still worth living?' or words to that effect. Since I myself am 66, it seems to me that the game simply forecloses on the possibilities of living for its protagonist. You get the picture? An inevitable, unchangeable slide toward death, with what remains of life being totally mundane and uninspiring. There's just nothing engaging about the game's storyline.That said, I do think it's possible that the game's developers are onto something. My generation in the USA, the 'baby boomers', are certainly concerned with what life still has to offer us. Playing out life's possibilities for a person of humble origin in the later years is something I would try again. What about giving us a dozen different characters, from backgrounds including bedouins, Congolese, Australian Aborigines, Native Americans, etcv., etc.? This sort of game could have fantastic educational potential; could help make the world a better place.So I say, 'Try again' to the game's developers, and am grateful that they tried this idea out.

												I have a review for this game, but I'm going to type a wall of text here in hopes that you can't see my review. Because I think there's a major point to this game that you can't ever have someone tell you about. I think you have to experience it.. I think you have to feel it.  If you can come to that point on your own, it's a beautiful and amazingly well designed game for a very low price. The problem is, in my review I'm going to spoil what I believe the ""secret"" point of this game is. I know some of you will click it anyways and miss out. But I'm challenging you. Is $2 really so much to pay to believe in another human being? Just please. Trust me. Don't read the rest of this review until after you've at least played through the game once on your own. For those of you that insist on seeing it now, or for those of you who have played through once and are back now to read this, here is my review: This game is magnificent. It's not amazing as far as gameplay, sound, graphics.. No. It's clearly not meant to be that type of game, but is any visual novel really about the visuals? They're just an accentuation for the story you're being immersed in. The point of the game is the reason why I love it. I played the game for about 45 minutes. Just one play through. The first ten to fifteen minutes, I was treating it like another silly game I didn't care about.. Halfway through I started really getting interested in the story. It hooks you in and goes from using third person references to saying ""You did this. You remember this. You were sad because."" ... without you noticing, the game goes from telling you a story about someone else to engaging you in a story about yourself. At some point, I think year seven or so. The stories stop. The family history goes no further. You learn about your parents, how they met. You learn about yourself. You learn about your brothers, and how you struggled. You learn about your first love and how she was your pillar when times got hard. When times became harder she was only there for you more. And then suddenly the history stops. The GAMEPLAY stops.  And you're asked.. there really a reason to balance your life? To prolong your suffering and loneliness? To keep thinking about things. To keep hoping for another love as deep and fulfilling as the one you lived. And at that point I realized. This game lies to you. The game tells you the point is to keep yourself alive as long as possible. And yes, you can do that for the leaderboards if you like. You can be a robot and experience life in the most optimal way for survival. Or you can do what you feel is  right as you come to terms with death. In my own final days, I visited many loved relatives and friends. Put aside money for my children, even when I didn't have any. Went out to theatre and surrounded myself with people I cared for. People stole from me and silly things would bother me.. And one day the money ran out and I died. I cried a little bit but.. I died living to the fullest. And that. That is what I think this game is truly about. It's not a grind to live as long as you can. It's only a grind for as long as it takes for you to realize that grinding your life away is NOT the life you should want to live. At that point the game teaches you something deep about yourself and allows you to come to terms with human mortality. For that reason I believe this game is magnificent.  But who knows. I might be seeing magic where there is nothing. Perhaps it wasn't their intention. Regardless, I'm very glad for what I got out of this game.. I'm kind of sad I would have missed it if it wasn't so cheap. 10 out of 10 .  Thank you to the people who worked on this gem.			"

""Old age is just a record of one's whole life."" - Muhammad AliBoy, wasn't that accurate and... depressing... in the right way, I guess. Okay, give me a moment to arrange an actual review from the crippling strike of empathy that I just took to my guts.Cahors Sunset is a unique mini game that invites you to become an elderly French man named Valentin Puget. You live and recount your life's tale, alongside witnessing many political changes of France's own history. Your main goal is to keep the old man alive as long as possible by making everyday choices like either drinking a fine wine, or simply visiting your doctor. You have to keep an eye on his social, financial, psychological and physical abilities to present a well balanced life. As months pass and the old man ages even more, he suffers certain ailments and penalties to all his stats. Every single thing that you choose to do carry both positive and negative consequences on different assets. Also, you are the object of happenstances of life that you have no control over, just as real life.Narration is elegant and realistic, shedding some light to the story of a life and an era while asking the player to emphasize himself/herself with someone that resides in the winter of a life. Challenges of being old, vulnerable and fragile; living side by side with the possibility that it might be your last day on earth is heavy to say the least. You keep living, and living, and living... and at some point, you ask yourself: is this living?The game leaves you with a sudden urge to stop whatever you are doing, pick up the phone and call your grandparents; just so you can share something, anything with them while it still matters. It leaves you with a short, but strong experience that you can benefit from as a humane virtue.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Cahors Sunset is an interactive story board  with  a choice of three decisions each month of a sixty odd year old man; each desision you make affects various arrtibutes such as happiness  weight, anxiety, social life etc.   The aim of the game is to keep your man alive as long as possible by keeping these attributs well balanced.  I reckon the game  a life of  several play throughs before it  becomes  a little boring.  I've played for about   2.7 hours so far and   have  enjoyed it somewhat, but can't see me playing it much except maybe for the odd five minures as a filler between other games.  It was  only Â£1.35, so for the  time I enjoyed it was worth the money.  If you want something different I will recommend it, but if you don't like   text based adventures  don't bother. :)The game could have  had   much more replayability if  there had been  more than one character to play through. Maybe the developer will add more in the future.If you are into online    score tables  you may  enjoy trying to   beat the top ten players.  The age at which your character dies  is recorded there.  My best  score so far is 69 years 9 months old.  The  top 10 scores are between 74 years 3 months and 76 years.  you die when one of your attributes be it  health, weight, social, anxiety, money,  etc goes to zero.   Whenever it's your birthday from around the age of  67 onwards you lose      several points from each attribute at each  birthday, so mae sure you make the right choices to survive and beat the top scores.  :)			"

												Cahors Sunset is a light RPG where you play as an old man living out his final days and remembering his past. In Cahors Sunset as stated before is a very light RPG where you play as an old man Valentin Puget. He is living in his final day's as he tells you the story of his youth as you try and keep him alive as long as possible. Gameplay wise this game is as simple as it get's. You get to choose a different action each month which will either increase some of your stats or lower them. If some of your stats get too low you will die and lose the game. Each choice comes with either a negative or a positive outcome which will either increase some of your stats or decrease them ( these stats are on top of your monthly choices). Graphics are pretty much not existent as they are stock photos of the Cahors town in France. Most of them are on a loop so expect to see them over and over again.The music is incredibly tedious, it get's tiresome really fast and you will want to mute it as soon as possible.To experience the full story it took me 30 minutes. After that you can keep playing and see how long you can keep Valentin alive. There is also a leaderboard so you can upload your best scores.In the end the story is great, but not that great. I liked the story, but the gameplay is very tedious and to play it just to experience the full story is not worth it. Since the game is cheap you can check it out if story driven games are your type of thing, but I wouldn't recommend buying the game for yourself.Final Rating:6/10 - Buy it on a discount or skipIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												This game is a brilliantly conceived choose your own adventure/simulator experience. Your goal is to keep an old man in the twilight of his life, alive as long as possible. You are given a set of three choices for an activity every month. Each activity has pros and cons which impact your stats, which in turn serve to keep you alive longer. Things like Mood, Money, Social Life, Weight, and so on. If any of your stats fall under 25 points, you are considered to be at risk. If any fall to 0, you die. So, in addition to your monthly decision, each month a random event happens as well, that is outside your control and also impacts your stats. Additionally, every year, you lose a chunkl of points to every stat (and this increases for every year you live...so 2 points the first year, 4 the second, and so on). However, each year you also get to choose a resolution which gives you a few bonuses to your stats. Additionally, each month you live, you are given a bit of the old mans memoirs, and also given a piece of French history from that real life month (this game starts in the 1960's btw). So, that is basically the game in a nutshell. However, what I found is the game is actually a very delicate and caring experience. You can choose to have the old man live a life that is lonely and self serving, gregarious and outgoing, have him dedicate himself to his friends and family or ignore them completely, etc...how you choose to have the old man live out his twilight years can serve as much as a reflection of your own personality and place in life as it does to actually keep the old man alive...or not. So in a sense, this game is as much about you as it is about the old man.I thought this was a fairly unique and engaging way to approach makig a game, and I really cant recommend this one enough. The replay value is limitless and the introspective nature of the game is priceless. An easy 10 out of 10, and what I consider a must play.			"

												It's times like this that I wish my curiosity had not gotten the better of me.Cahors Sunset is served to you as a series of questions after a dialogue of what has most recently happened to effect his life. The game allows you to control the decisions of an old French man. Every action you take has an effect on your character and not all choices are good; many contain unwanted side effects, mainly dropping his mood(when it came to choices I would pick). The idea is to balance the positive and negative effects of each action you take and the impacts they have on the old man's health... However, unlike quite a few other visual novels, or choice driven story games, I find this flat and really not compelling enough to want to sit there for a solid 3 to 5 hours just clicking various text boxes.Though this novel had the chance to be something great, I feel as though it fails to reach the level it could. I can admire what they were trying to achieve by making this a fully choice driven story, where your decisions directly effect how long this man lives, but it takes the most stereotypical view of elderly people and just flops in trying to convey anything really deep and meaningful.It just feels like an empty and random number generator. So long as you keep attributes at a stable level you'll live longer, so long as some random thing doesn't happen to make your anxiety or mood drop to a near nothing.. Like a song you don't like playing on the radio.. At the end of it all, the payoff feels really unrewarding. On the positive notes, it has a really nice soundtrack, a lot of solid effort to convey what is going on within your characters life, full texts and decent length.Does not balance out well between pros and cons, as it's more or less something you'll pick up for about 5-10 minutes and then go along your merry way.

												TL;DR: The game is a random number generator dependent upon RNG. So long as you keep attributes at a stable level (sometimes dependent upon a lot of luck) you'll survive. The payoff is unrewarding. The game has potential to be more than what it is.Purchase reason: Game appeared in the new releases of Steam. The description piqued my interest. There aren't many games on the platform that appear to have this type of background. Further, my partner adores French culture and history so that helped the purchase decision.Install note: Be forewarned that the game will attempt to install Adobe Air when you try and start the game for the first time.Initial reaction: The concept plays out a little too simply - You make a single choice for the month (they can be very simple things that would be a common occurrence in everyday life such as attending a sports contest). There doesn't appear to be nearly as much substance in the game as what there could be.In game music: It's pleasant enough to listen to at first. However, I must admit to turning the sound down/off before completing my first game as it became grating.A possible subtle point of the game: Each month the game provides a description of what is happening in the world beyond your control. This effects your own life minimalistically. As such I can see that this is one of the points that Locomotivah may be attempting to make with the game. That we as individuals believe that what happens in the greater scheme of life may not impact us nearly as much as we may believe it does.At the beginning of each birth year you make a fresh resolution. This resolution provides a positive and a negative effect each month. One option is to take up smoking which increases your anxiety while decreasing your physical health. Another thing that happens each birth year is that you lose a point in each attribute for each year that you've survived. For example, after your first year you lose one in each category and so on.Post-first game reaction: My initial reaction stands. The game has potential for deeper gameplay than it currently provides. At this current point in time it's essentially a random number generator with different categories that you can't drop beneath.  So long as the RNG is in your favor and you select the most appropriate choice each month you will continue to survive.Unfortunately, I don't believe that the reward/payoff is rewarding enough for spending much time with the game. Unless, of course, your goal is to get into the top of the leaderboards. That's about all you can hope for as the game has no achievements nor does it have trading cards (yet).My Recommendation: It's one of those games that deserves an inbetween recommendation. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it by itself - even though at $2 or $1.69 with its 15% launch promotion it's certainly priced correctly - but it is something that's worth a playthrough if the setting and the mini-storyline piques your interest. I'd recommend holding off for an inevitable indie bundle.			"

												A neat idea, but the mechanics are too primitive to do it justice. As far as I can tell there is no continuity to your actions beyond the stats change -- my old man seemed perfectly happy to buy new car after new car, never once stopping to ponder the deeper questions of life, such as:How many cars does one man need?How big is my garage?I thought I vowed to use public transport last month, why am I buying another car?

												Seems like a tribute tale to those who have left this earth, it's a story about a older man in France trying to live out his last days as long as possible. Simple game play mechanics that seem to have an optimal strategy, the reason you would want to look at this game is more for the emotional side more then anything else. It's got a story that feels like one of an old distant relative, and is the main reason why I'm recommending the game. Otherwise, it's proably not the game for you.Some gameplay footage and info also included here:

 A point and click decision simulator   Playing as an old French man you have to weigh the positives and negatives of each decision to keep your overall attributes positive You start of at the age of 60 with your attributes such as money, mood, anxiety and weight set to a certain value. All decisions you make affect these attributes. You only have to decide out of 3 options each time, choosing which decision will benefit you best.The artwork in the backround is beautiful with somber music playing as you make your decisions. The game tells stories of events affecting France and events from your past. Random events also occur frequently which affect your attributes. I found the decision making becoming a bit repetitive but the game does well at putting you in the shoes of this man. You feel the sadness and emotion of every decision.At the price I don't have a problem recommending it for the experience.			"

												Cahors Sunset is a part simulation game and part visual novel about an old French guy. The game tells you the story of the man's past and while doing so, you are suppose to keep the man alive as long as possible. After every few pages of story, you get to pick one of three choices, which either increases or decreases your anxiety, mood, weight, social life, physical health or mood. Personally, I did not care for the story much and was more concerned with keeping him alive. Every year, your stats dramatically decrease and the game throws random situations at you, which decrease your stats, otherwise you could be living forever. I could be wrong but it did not seem to matter which choice you pick, as long as you keep your status high enough. Cahors Sunset comes with some nice photo's in the background and you can learn a thing or two about French history, if that interests you. As far as I know, the French history does not alter the story.I doubt many people would replay Cahors Sunset, it's only a few bucks and it does come with an online leaderboard so you can challenge your friends in keeping the guy alive.....

												Cahors is a visual novel with slight rpg elements. It tells your life story through panels of real life pictures pulled from the internet. After a panel or two you pick out of three choices on what you want to do. Each choice has positive or negative effects to your character. If you get to zero on one of your stats you will die. The goal is to get through 4 years to complete the entire story. Each choice you make counts as one month. After the story finishes you can keep going to see how long you can survive and then get place on the leaderboards.It doesn't take long to beat but it's not fun to play. Story was ok and the leaderboard feature isn't really a great incentive in my opinion to keep playing after the story is finished. I can't recommend this to anyone since it's just not fun to play.

												Hm. Well, I don't know what to say, really.Cahors Sunset does contain a nice idea at the core, but, this is not enough to sell the game to me. As a matter of fact, it's boring to me. And it's incredibly... how do I phrase it? It's just not a good game. The random events seem to be bad for the protagonist in 90% of the cases. And the nice background photos do nothing, since the decision cards cover up about half of the screen.So, in essence... I don't even think that 1,99â¬ are worth it. I would have expected a little more. And that is sad.			"

												Well, I really donât know what to think about this thing. Cahors Sunset is not really bad. Basically, it has a very neat idea. Manoeuvre through the life of an old, depressed man by making very basic choices that affect more or less the basic conditions of his life. All that with a great look and horrible music. It could be a great thing if you are in this kind of games, as I am usually. I find the Narration most of all good: While the life goes on and you learn, what month after month in France, the home country of the old man, you learn also all his biography until the point of departure of the game. That is interesting in terms of storytelling as well as in terms of telling history. But what bothers me extremely is that the game looks and feels over all unfinished. After half an hour (half the time it took me to finish it with the age of 73 years) it feels very repetitive. Your possible choices as well as the random events repeat again and again. Also, I felt disappointed, because I think, the devs missed the opportunity to combine the historical events with the actions of the old man. Surely, this can be seen as part of the story: The world goes on and changes, and the old manâs life remains always the same depressing course down in the direction of depression and death. But I think, there could have been made a lot more. At the end, Cahors Sunset is a pretty little game that can be played, if you like to experience this kind of games. And I am not left with anger or any negative feelings. I really really like the story telling and gameplay ideas and the minimalistic style. But I wouldnât recommend it to a broader public.			"

												Cahors Sunset is a text-based game of choice. You are in control of Valentin Puget, an old man living in Cahors, France who is in his twilight years. Try to make the right choices and make him cheat death for as long as possible.Design & ArtDesign is kept conceptual. Cahors Sunset features a dynamic background of credited pictures from various sites in sephia tones. These pictures change while playing the game. Overall, the visuals are only there to create a certain mood for the background story aswell as the whole premise of Cahors Sunset.ControlsThe game is completely controlled by mouse.Sound and MusicI remember a fitting background music for the videogame. Some light classical pieces were playing and they enhanced the mood of the game. Other than that, there is no sound in the game. I believe you can turn off the music if you wish to.GameplayCahors Sunset is played through choice. Valentin Puget will start at the age of 65 and you need try to get him as old as you can. For every month, you will make a choice between different options, that will influence his stats (mood, money, weight, anxiety, social life and physical health) either positively, negatively or completely mixed up. Cahors Sunset starts you with random stats, the main point is, that you must keep his stats above a certain margin, otherwise, if one of the stats is under that crucial margin, he will face the chance of death. For every intentional choice you make, one random event will happen, whether that will have a good or bad influence on your playthrough is up to the game.Besides that simple mechanic, the game features a fleshed out background story of how the life of Valentin Puget came to be. Every month you will discover another piece of his past.WeakpointsCahors Sunset lacks replayability. Once I completed the game once, I did not feel the need to play through it again. Thankfully, the background story is skippable, for those of you who want to reach the top of the leaderboards.Besides the neat mechanic and the very detailed storyline, there isn't much else to this game. Fortunatly, that is compensated for its price. Just be aware of the fact, that Cahors Sunset is a very small game that might not entertain you for longer than two hours tops.Concluding ThoughtsCahors Sunset is a neat little game. It showed me with what difficulties seniors have to deal in their everyday life and how important it is to cherish your last memories and moments while you are still alive. Because once we die, we all just become dust but we want our memories to be forever set in stone.The game entertained me for as short as it was and with its challenging premise really awakens a sort of spirit inside me. I felt attached to Valentin Puget and a rush of sadness embraced me, when I realised, that this could very well be the fate of any person in the world. The game exists less for its gameplay and more for its meaning. If you enjoy games, that make you want to see the bigger picture, I can safely recommend this game to you.			"

												Like me, you probably read the description of Cahors Sunset and quickly decided whether you were interested or not, and if the concept didn't grab you outright, I doubt it will win you over even with its many charms.In Cahors Sunset you play Valentin Puget a 65 year old French man, with the goal of keep him as healthy and happy as possible as he approaches man's inevitable end. Each month you are presented a choice of three activites for Valentin to perform. Each choice will affect his six attributes, anxiety, social life, mood, weight, money, and physical health. For example, going to Paris with a friend may raise your mood, and social life, but will be a large blow to your wallet. If any of your attributes fall below 25, you put Valentin at risk of death. Some events however, are out of your control. These seemingly randomized events will yield a loss or gain to your attributes, but even when things don't go your way the consequences are measured enough to avoid feeling cheap. As each year passes and Valentin ages you will take a penalty to your attributes, and be given a choice to select a new year's resolution which will passively affect your stats every month. Vowing to travel less may slightly increase your funds but lower your social life.The light RPG mechanics work well enough, but to me the story is really the games main draw and it delievers it well. As each month game unfolds, you will uncover snippets about Valentin's life, loves and loss. It begins with the story of his parents, and makes its way to present day. The game also sets the stage with current events unfolding in 20th century  France.The game was clearly made on a budget, but the developer made smart decisions for the presentation which bolster the solid writing. Each screen has a backdrop of a beautiful photo from France, taken from Flickr. Although they are all from different artists, they feel surpsingly cohesive and are unified with a Sepia filter. The royalty free music chosen blends well the photography, making for a languid, melancholy atmosphere.  I wish perhaps though, the photographs could have been credited strictly in the credits. Its a minor complaint, but something about Flickr being referenced outright when I'm in 1960s France is a little mood breaking. Also a zooming effect performed on some of the the photograpy leaves a strange rippling effect which can be a bit distracting. It could be an issue with my monitor though.I suppose now the its time to ask the question lingering the back of everyone's minds when discussing these more expiremental games. Is it any fun? Well, I don't know if ""fun"" is neccesarily right word to apply here. I think instead I would choose to say that Cahors Sunset is ""affecting"". I can't ever recall imagining what it's like to be an old man 1960s France, or the last time a game made me really and truly think about aging and how I will look back on my own story in the years to come. To me that makes Cahors Sunset a success, and I'm glad I got the chance to experience it.Again, it's difficult to recommended this anyone who is not intially open to the concept, but if you find yourself among the curious, I think you should give it a try.If you like, check out my first impressions video on the game below.

												I found this game to be pretty depressing, and the story is nowhere near worth it. You spend the entire game desperately trying to keep the old man's attributes up and watching as you fail miserably. If you enjoy watching someone slowly lose the will/strength to live, this is the game for you.			"

												Small, but nice game.In fact, it's a sort of short, but well written, story about the last year of a retired and old man.You try to reach the end of each year managing your poor resources, making choices, and trying to know your entire story, told at end of each month.The game itself (as you can check from the playing time) is pretty simple and is not really a difficult simulation, but the whole setting is nice and the story quite interesting.Also, I found really good the idea of mixing your past memories with 60' and 70' local (France) events.And, I found the price more than correct (in fact, could also be selled for a bit more, maybe around 3-4 â¬, I found it could worth it).Recommended, a little game with an interesting setting and globally well-executed.

												Maybe it was the beautiful violin soundtrack, but this was a relatively emotional & unique experience, which i wouldn't have expected from a CYOA game about finance management.I do wish Toulouse had played better, I do not blame them for my death, in the end it was the increase in medicines pricing & having just bought & read the newspaper my lifestyle could not be sustained; I hope Matteo can find someone else to go the restaurant with as I died without being able to attend.

												An extremely creative and fun initiative. Cahors shine in an era that all indies are trying to follow the same succesfull recipe with a lack of personality, but Cahors Sunset came to prove that still possible be original and shows this with its narrative well done and cohese, Its points system really makes you believe that each decision count towards your character's final destination.

												Totally a depression simulator... My mood decreased in only 30 minutes.The photohraphs, music and subject are interesting but; this is a game you play only once and don't want to play anymore without a friend.You really like the old man in the game, try to make his life perfect. Eventually, you realise that money brings happiness.I sadly say no.			"

												It's fun to play if you know, going in that it's a simple multiple choice and stat juggling game.Downsides:The attributions for the photos ""from user WallabyFala89 on somesite"" are a bit immersion-bneaking.The background photos slowly zoom but they ripple annoyingly as they seem to be not using sub-pixel sampling.You will ""wtf"" quite a bit at some of the decisions you have to make and what the consequences are.The game has a far too depressing take on what it's like to be ""old"" (and 65 is not really that old unless viewed by a 19 year old).The English is not the best.I would give it a thumbs down for sure if it was more expensive, but for the price I think it offers enough.

												First of all: this game has horrible music produced in the simplest way a computer has to offer! My ears hurt and I got headache from this cheap, awful synthesizer strings. Graphics are not existing and not part of the game while it offers atmospheric background pictures. ThereÂ´s a very usual story of an old mans life beeing told (via text only) and historical moments in the history of france from 1960-1965 are beeing displayed (via text). If you survive longer by making absolutely simple, repetetive desicions the historical and your personal background stops. Maybe you could imagine it stops beeing importnat at some point, but I refuse to think in this simplified way and think this is not what I expected from this game.While I like and support interesting ideas - this one is not produced with all passion and full-hearted at all. It doesnÂ´t deserve to be published on Steam, not even at that small price. This should be offered for free as it makes no sense at all to play it again.Experimental games like ""The Plan"" which are teaching a similar lesson and have been part of the developers way to learn programming or game design, or to represent hi skill should be for free and the is no reason this game is sold.Game is acceptable to run it once (with sound off), no positive shocks, not even in storytelling which was the onyl way to impress with visibly limited possibilities - but more than all that... thumbs down for even trying to sell it...EDIT: Now go developer team & friends, give me thumbs down to save your catastrophical project.... 0 of 8 people thumbs down after 12 hours the review exists!!! Not only bad game designers and script editors, but also fake marketing clowns!			"

												Decent concept, but execution is a bit wonky.Choices doesn't seem to matter consistently over time, just affects the stats when the choice is done. I can't really recommend the game at this point, but if you got a few bucks to spare and you're looking for something different, give it a shot. It's a pretty unique experience.			"

												If this game has taught me anything, it is how important it is for Old People to be allowed into Stripclubs and Casinos!Visiting family, playing chess in the park, strolling aroud the neighbourhood... none of this brings as much joy and benefit when compared to being a gambling lecher.+10 points to devs for stealing all the artwork from social media sites.+10 points for proving that pigeons really do aim for old people+10 points for having unlimited supply of cars to sell+10 points for showing us that an old person can die simply by listening to a song they hate-10 points for not being anime.

												You are the old man making choices on how to live on through life. This game is much more of something you choose in order to stay alive, and whatever you choose you either gain or lose something (such as anxiety, mood, physical health, money, etc.). You need to keep status above 25, lower than that will risk of death. The game is actually interesting, this is more of a survival game and theres apparently global ranking. So see if you can live out the longest than anyone in that score if you are up for it.You'll have to be smart on what choice you make, otherwise you will have a hard time going through choices that keeps you going forcing you to lower your status in order to gain another.Luck is also involved when you select your choice, so prepare whats coming to you.Anyways, 10/10. Would try again if i feel like it. And regardless of my game time, i was rather new to it and did it only one go. It gets harder eventually, so prepare yourself if you are buying this.			"

												This game is simple but so so beautiful. Reading the life story of the main character is a rollercoaster of emotions, and the historical facts that pop up are both entertaining and informative. Some of the options can get repetitive, but other than that, this game is a must have for your library			"

												A game that feeds you story day by day. It goes from story segment to stat-raising decision to random stat-changing event and then repeats as long as you keep your stats high enough to live another day. You celebrate every birthday by losing stats and getting closer to death.The story was pretty interesting but depressing. From as far as I got in my playthroughs, it's a depressing story that highlights the bad things that happen when you live long enough to experience them.The gameplay was disappointing to me because the choices were only about the stats.In my first playthrough I hoped that the choices mattered beyond juggling stats. I picked choices that felt good to me (stats were important but I also factored in how I felt about the actual action). But eventually it felt like the options were randomly generated and didn't affect anything beyond the stat gains/losses. There were times when two options had the same stat changes but the action was seeing a different movie/show. I hoped that meant there was something special about the choice but I never saw the difference. Nothing special happens if you skip your meds, smoke or quit, pay back debts, or keep in touch with family. If I recall correctly, at another time I got the option to sell my old car which I declined, then two months later bought a new car, and then again, two months later I bought another new car. That was silly enough to break my immersion.I got to the 'end game' in my second playthrough by ignoring the action flavor text and picking choices that had the best overall net gains (there are choices that give you a net loss) and prioritizing stats that were getting low.Maybe worth a try if you want to see a depressing story. The gameplay itself is just filler that limits how much story you can see.			"
