Early Access Review
								UPDATE: It's been more than a year since I wrote this review, and the ""many things wrong with this game"" still stands. The game has new features, but with old bugs still around, it just makes things worse. Save your money and maybe give it another year.--I recommend you to watchlist/follow this game and track its progress. But I can't recommend a purchase at the moment.There's many things right with the game, and many things wrong. I hope I can clarify them in this review.Note that it is definitely early to judge, but not early enough to get a good intuition about the game's direction - which is what worries the most.--Farlight Explorers is best described as a 3D Survival Factorio (with smaller production scale). Your goal is to guarantee your survival by building your life support systems - get Electricity to make Water, get Water and Electricity to make Oxygen and Food.Your goal is also to extract the most ore from the planet's veins, and build your base and spaceship in order to explore space - there's currently no more goals due to the early state of the game, but more are planned.My comments about aspects of the game:- GRAPHICS: The game looks amazing for a single-man team. The artist deserves praise - I really love his style.- SOUND: There's a single song which loops, and the sound is fine but needs mastering. When turrets fire, they'll definitely give you a heart attack.- INTERFACE: The interface is fine and easy to understand, but could do with a lot of work. There's an insane amount of typos, and building machines is not really symmetrical as one might expect (so it's very OCD unfriendly, beware :P)- BUGS: There's the usual bugs, but you can get around them by making saves or reloading an autosave. I didn't encounter any game-breaking or save-corrupting bug, though, which is good. Some bugs are really worrying, currently. Like using conveyor as you would in Factorio (or as the game makes you feel free to use) will slow your game below 10 FPS, and that's worrying giving that this should be one of the main parts of the game: building machines and transport systems.About the gameplay:- BUILDING uses the ""snap"" system a lot of 3D games use nowadays. Build a floor, then you can ""snap"" the next floor tile to the existant one. However, building right now can be really annoying and very time consuming due to the ""snapping"" bugging around. Building your SPACESHIP follows the same system, which makes it very customizable and cool (and VERY time consuming).- RESOURCE GATHERING AND MACHINES: The planets have Ore Veins which you can build automated Extractors in. Then make use of robot arms and conveyors to take the ore to Furnaces to make Ingots. Then to Hydraulic Presses to make Plates. And to another Hydraulic Press to make Gears.It looks really good and feels really satisfying when you're done building, but it is rather time-consuming and buggy.- SURVIVAL: The constant need for oxygen will make you want to spread Oxygen Dispensers all around your base - and you can do that. Having this survival requirement is pretty cool and very interesting in the beginning - if you don't build fast enough, you'll end up dead.- SPACESHIP: There's no reason to fly your own space ship at the moment - it currently works more like a teleport. You can't fly in space, and your ship jumps directly between planets. You CAN ""plug"" your Spaceship into a base and share electricity/water/oxygen with it, which is great...but is too much work, and you'd be better off building the necessary buildings on the ground instead. So maybe it will become more useful at a later time.- EXPLORATION: There's different types of planets, but most of them have a limited area. So won't be exploring whole planets, but small parts of them. However, with a big number of planets, this won't be an issue, but it's good pointing out.Some resources are only available on some planets, and that's really cool. It would be amazing in the future to transport resources between planets and different bases!CONCLUSION:There's a ton of potential in Farlight Explorers, there's no denying. The game went through a great transformation this year, which made it look really good. The developer is definitely interested in developing it.It looks nice, it plays nice, it feels nice. But that's not enough when talking about Early Access titles.There's two reasons I cannot recommend buying it.  First, it's too early to believe it will be made into a full game. Second, because there's no clear direction or road map for the game.It could become an actual 3D Survival Factorio, or something much more limited and not as freeform as expected.This would mean you'd be investing in something expecting a certain game, and end up with something completely different. It's dangerous, and hard to trust in.There are suggestion lists and all that, but all organized and discussed by players. The dev does read and reply, but still there's no guarantee what will be done and what won't.So I do recommend for you to watch it. All that I said above can be invalidated at any moment. A clear roadmap and direction would make it MUCH easier to trust in the developer's vision and tag along with him, but the best advice is to watch it from a distance right now.All the best for the developer, though - I'd love to see this becoming successful.Thanks for reading!

Keep in mind that at the time I am posting this review and video...No other videos or reviews exist yet for this game that just launched in early access a few short hours ago.I like it.  I like it a lot so far.I haven't played nearly long enough to find any hostile creatures at this point, and am eager to get that far!  So far, I like how the planet exploring works.  I like the gathering, the crafting list is impressive, and building the machines and tools works great.  Connecting the ""wires"" is a little bit finicky but it does work, remember to use the T and Y keys as well as your R key for rotating to get your wires to move in almost any manner needed.  Once I remembered to use the T and Y keys, it made this all easier.The game is early access, and at this point still needs a death scene, or at least a ""You Are Dead"" screen before just moving you from whatever you were doing to the universe screen with no message or indication you died, but it works for now  (just watch your health status as well as your oxygen, thirst, and food status bars)I will be playing this game much more and will update this review as needed once I get further into this pretty deep and advanced single player sandbox space exploration and survival game.  Once I get a good feel for everything in the early access game such as building space ships, using the guns, armor, and combat then I should be able to give a much more informative review of what this early access game offers currently.However, I CAN say this...  So far, I am VERY impressed and I am WANTING to play this game more!  It looks to be very much worth it's asking price even with as little of it's content as I have played to this point.  If this game is a game you are interested in, or looks good to you, you likely won't be disappointed.  Jump In!  ..I give it two entusiastic THUMBS UP at this point!  ...Watch my video above as it should give you a very good idea of what you're buying into.  :-) "

								Ok, big area of frustration. There are two games. The new version and old version. It took me about 4 hours of gameplay before realizing most construction materials don't unlock after a time.... they simply don't exist in the ""new version"".This game is so underdeveloped that it shouldn't even be purchasable as early access. I would NOT recommend it to anyone until it's a LOT closer to completion.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't review games often.  Or much at all.  But for some reason I felt the need to write one for this game.  I also wrote this review day 1 of release, so don't judge this review too accurate a few updates down the line.  To start off, the controls are a bit wonky (mostly just the space bar switching between cursor and viewing mode).  That's probably my biggest pet peave of this game.  Otherwise the controls seem fine.  You choose the solar system and planet you want to start on, which is kinda cool.  I like that.  The mining is a bit wonky in visuals, a laser just pops from your nipples like rays of victory, but in reality you're shooting from a gun you can't see.  The planet has nice atmosphere (no pun intended) and desert planets feel like desert planets.  So far I haven't seen any other, although I'm not sure you're able to yet.  Haven't checked.  The wiring system and water piping is a bit wonky as well, there should be a 4-way connecter to help this sort of thing out, but instead you just place them on on top of the other facing different ways, which sometimes works, and sometimes just looks rather silly. The Ore Extractor seems a bit glitchy and wont always extract ore, although it's day 1 so I'm not too picky.  The robotic arms will fling rocks or whatever it is they are moving, not just directly behind them, but if they are elavated, behind and to the side, a ways.  While this would be ideal for practicing some baseball, not so helpful when the furnace is not gettin any dlicious iron to feast on.  The good parts, however, outweigh the bad ones.  It's challenging (slightly, mostly just to figure out how everything works together) to get your base all set up and automated, which is a good thing I think, makes your finished base give you a good sense of accompishment.  The artwork is pretty sweet.  The sound affects of the machines are delightful.  The game isn't broken as far as I can tell.  The few bugs I've noticed are rare and not game breaking.  Runs pretty smoothly.   "

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI am generally not one for the whole survival, crafting, thing. I am much more interested in base building/management games. Luckily for me, outside of the irritation generated by having to deal with oxygen and food, which is a minor inconvenience, this game is much more a game of base building and management than it is of survival, and even crafting (though crafting is for certain a core element of the game). Once you get past the basics... electricity, oxygen, food... you are left with the goal of building a starship, which is a pretty significant goal. And to do so efficiently, you must leverage the power of automation. You manage the process of digging up the necessary materials, transporting them to a storage facility, and then removing them from that facility in order to turn them in to ingots, plates and gears to craft the next elements of your base, or star ship. The game gets you in to the flow quickly - though the tutorials need some tweaking. They break immersion and are incredibly irritating and seemingly unavoidable. Since they are delivered through, and stored as some form of email, simply notifying the user of new tutorial content would be highly preferable. Within two hours, you are, however deep in the process of trying to build a mighty automated infrastructure, and figuring out why your robot arms are tossing your newly crafted ingots 20 yards away from where you want it. The game is intelligently designed, and presumably combat and other threats will present themselves as you expand your search for the necessary elements for your next goal. There are no lack of bugs - however... placing a battery may teleport you at high speed a good 100 yards away from your base for not obvious reason. Indeed, random teleportation results are common and irritating, but overall not game breaking as everything seems to be as you left it when you finally make it back to base. The night-time element is just annoying. I get it's ""value"" to the game in terms of simulation and immersion, but it does nothing but encourage you to stand near your oxygen generator. A way of speeding up time at night might be a very nice feature for those who just don't plan to do much while the outside is dark. The controls are a little bit of an ""acquired"" taste. A reckless player may well delete their storage facility and every one of those hard-earned items. Deletion should not be possible on an item that contains other items. This is a simple fix and one I am shocked the developer didn't consider. Overall, though, the game is a reasonably well-designed and executed, though I would wait for a sale where it's closer to $10 than $20 in it's current state. The full retail price may well be worth it when the game goes to final release, but this early access version is hard to justify more than the $10-12 range.First impressions video for Farlight Explorers

Early Access Review
								I deleted my old review because it was seriously outdated and this will be just a short and to the point review. I seriously loved the original concept and direction this game had. It was a fun builder/survival game, kind of like a 3D factorio. But over the course of the last year or so, things have gotten out of whack. The game has a different vibe now, and more content keeps getting added before issues with the game get fixed. At this rate, it will end up going the way of other EA titles: tons of potential, but poor execution and an overall very mediocre gameEDIT: Let it be known that I will gladly change my review if this changes in the future. I have mad respect for this dev (thats right, singular) because he works harder than some entire teams of devs. But unfortunately my respect for the deveoper isn't enough for me to actually recommend this game. I truly hope that changes in the future though			"

								It's kind of like an Early Access 3D FPS Factorio, without the Alien Insects. It's not quite there yet. Lots of bugs. Random crashes. Missing content. ( Early-Access ) It can get a bit grindy at times. But I have seen regular updates, so there is hope.For me? $15 - $20 is the price I pay to go the movies for a couple hours entertainment. I figure I got my moneys worth out of this game. So as long as they keep working on it, I'll give it a thumbs up.That said, If $15 is your entire gaming budget for awhile... I would suggest not buying this one right away. It needs to cook a little longer.			"

Early Access Review
								1-English version2-Versión español1) English:This is an early review that i would update with a few more hours of play and a few more patches.Farlight Explorers is about surviving and building an automated base to cover all your needs for food and oxygen in a procedurally generated planet that you previously chose from a galaxy map. As far as i know, there are 5 types of planets you can choose or visit someday with the appropriate technology: desert, ice, gas, pure iron and asteroid.Once you choose a planet, you crash into it and start the game with a few ship modules randomly dispersed through all the map that you can loot for resources. Apart from that, you need to create a base from the scratch, mining minerals to start crafting the machines you will need: solar generators, water pumps, oxygen and food generators, batteries to store the solar energy, ore extractors, furnaces, research machinery and a lot more.The game is very stable with no crashes at all and character movement, although sometimes feels a little strange, is very fluid and precise.The machines are just awesome, beautifully designed and the sky at night with all the stars you can see is also amazing.The placement system, in my opinion, is a little confusing. You need to wire all machines to the power generators once placed and sometimes you don't know how and where to connect those wires.This is one of the EA games more stables i played at release date and can have a brilliant future. As for now, you can play a lot of hours only to just create your base, test all machines and make automation.2) Versión Español:Este es un análisis que actualizaré con algunas horas más de juego y tras algunos parches.Farlight Explorers es un juego de supervivencia y construcción de una base automatizada para cubrir todas tus necesidades de comida y oxígeno en un planeta generado proceduralmente y que previamente has elegido desde el mapa de la galaxia. Por ahora, que yo haya visto, hay 5 tipos de planetas que puedes elegir o visitar algún día con la tecnología apropiada: desierto, hielo, gas, todo hierro y asteroide.Una vez has seleccionado un planeta, te estrellas en él y empieza el juego propiamente dicho con algunos módulos de tu nave caída dispersos aleatoriamente a través del mapa y en los que podrás encontrar recursos. Aparte de esto, necesitas crear una base desde cero, minando minerales para comenzar a crear las máquinas que necesitas: generadores solares (seguidores solares muy realistas pero más bonitos que los que existen ahora, claro), bombas de agua, generadores de comida y oxígeno, baterías para almacenar la energía solar, extractores de mineral, hornos de fundición, maquinaria de investigación y muchas más.El juego es muy estable sin una sola petada y el movimiento del personaje, aunque algunas veces parece algo extraño, es muy fluído y preciso.Las máquinas son, simplemente, impresionantes con un diseño muy bonito y el cielo por la noche con todas las estrellas que se ven es también asombroso.El sistema de colocación de los bloques, en mi opinión, es algo confuso. Tienes que conectar todas las máquinas a los generadores de electricidad una vez colocadas y a veces no sabes ni cómo ni dónde conectar el cableado.En definitiva, este es uno de los juegos ""EA"" más estables que he jugado el mismo día del lanzamiento y puede tener un futuro brillante. Por ahora, se le pueden sacar muchas horas para construir la base, probar todas las máquinas y automatizar todos los procesos.			"

								Farlight Explorers starts off in a procedurally generated galaxy. Selecting which planet you which to colonize and proceeding to land you then get to work scanning the unknown surface for raw materials to forge into base components. Thankfully your ship contained enough food and oxygen for several days so you stand some chance of survival.

The initial aim of the game as mentioned is to survive. While I have not run into hostile creatures yet I assume they exist as you are able to craft weapons, turrets and body armour. There seemed no dire need to focus on these and your time and resources were better spent on setting up a self-sustained base. Main structures all needed to be placed on platforms but there were elevators and other craftables for multistory designs. Most of these required power or water, which all had to be connected with pipes or wires like lego pieces before they would function correctly.Advanced construction seemed to be focused on automating processes. Combining conveyer belts, robot arms and furnaces you're able to setup supply lines for harvesting resources much faster. Characters are able to research tech trees which seemed mostly focused on making things more efficient, quicker mining speed, lower power draw etc. Another aspect of the game I've not touched yet was the spacecraft building. Traveling around the surface you will discover space junk (which you see fall from the skies), searching these piles results in finding harder to make items and many parts for your ship. Once you construct the ship apparently you're able to travel between planets and setup trade routes, which should be a bunch of fun. :)One of the other items your character started with was a jetpack, with unlimited fuel no less. You're able to fly up, rotate on axis and fall from great heights, all planets I visited seemed to have moon-like gravity. Overall the controls and user interface were quite good, placement of objects and player movement seemed intuitive though I'm sure the animations, graphics and layouts will be refined with time.  For initial release Farlight Explorers is a solid game and I found myself wanting to play more. After several hours play I ran into no major problems at all, so if you enjoy these kind of games it's well worth shortlisting. Cheers.			"

								Early Access Review - Good game premise, but (for me at least) an absolutely terrible interface made it unpleasant to play. Controls were obscure and non-intuitive. I'm a huge fan of the Outpost-style space explorer and colony building games, but this just didn't do anything for me, and the interface made it not worth the hassle. At the point that I tried it, the graphics were really, really sub-par, and the translation to English was really lacking as well. Perhaps later, but not recommended right now.			"

Early Access Review
								For those that are into hardcore survival with a space theme this game is not quite what you are looking for at the moment, think space engineers but less complicated. Still it does fill a unqiue niche in the genre and even in its current alpha state is extremely addictive.  If you are a early access support of games this is definitely a jewel to have in your library. What it does right. - Being able to hop from planet to planet with realtive ease is a beautiful and sadly rare thing amongst games of this genre but Farlight pulls it off. - MINING! omg the countless hours you spend whiddling away for resources to build your next stick! Not here pal, mining is automatic, just plop down a extraction drill, throw in some power and let the goodtimes roll. It should be noted that you can still mine by hand faster than a extraction drilling platform initially. but put 10 or 15 of these puppies up and being able to focus on building is a huge plus in this game espcially when the monotony of placing pipes and wires and conveyor belts takes up a considerably chunk of time.- Production is pretty streamlined at the moment. X amount of water and power will get you pretty much everywhere so the only real micromanaging is making sure you have ample amount of supplies. - Bugs, the dev works hard at crushing game bugs as you can follow in the forums. Surprisingly enough for a EA game i have only once ever had a game crashing bug, Most have been minor annoyances that you can write off as early access.What the game still needs work on:- Content. At the moment the only real goal is to make a huge production ship capable of making everything and fly to planet to planet strip mining the planets dry which does not take long, maybe 5 hours if you are new to the game. Then thats it, end game. If i understand right there is only one guy making this and while hes peddling his production content out fast as his little legs can move, impressively so, being able to crank out more for a very creative game would help him generate a larger fan base. Maybe hire one or two people extra. "

			Views: 6,476		

			Ephjizilla takes a look at the brand new game, Farlight Explorers, currently available on Steam Early Access. Steam Description: Farlight Explorers, Space-Sandbox game, made for space exploration,...		

This is a promising game.  At the moment (Alpha 0.9, as I write this), the controls are clunky and there are a couple of odd bugs but it is playable and you can see the potential for a fun game.  It's kind of like a cross between Space Engineers and Factorio.  Pros:- Systems (electricity, water, oxygen etc) are fun to assemble and pretty flexible.- Gameplay concepts are pretty intuitive.- Well designed machine models.Cons:- UI/UX is unpolished (your mouse does double duty as a pointer and view control, forcing you to change between states)- Controls are clumsy (it'd be great to have a single 'use' button that recognises context)- Player models are rudimentary and animations are very basic- The world isn't really 'open' (if you run far enough it boots you back to the galaxy map)- The written instructions (in the English localization) need a native English speaker to correct them.Most of the cons should be ironed out as development proceeds. Of course, that all depends on the developer.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now and recommend this game.  Make note: my recommendation is only for people who enjoy playing early access titles. This is NOT a polished final game at this stage.			"

								Interesting Take on Sandbox Genre.  Create electricity, via sun/coal.  Extract/Mine for Coal,Iron,Copper, and more.  Craft more complex Factories/items to eventually automate everthing.  Produce Life Vital, Food, Water, and oxygen to keep your health up.  This is a very in depth game in factory making and possible ship production on a mass scale.  I feel the development should be taken to another level with and Array of ships and space mining and multiple galaxies instead of the  one.  A major advantage  any sandbox game can have is Story Driven Content!  this has none atm cept for surviving/supplies crafting, but only temperarry i hope.  I would suggest running the game open source to allow the many hobbiests of the space genre grind out some ships/spacestation platform type items, but then again i don't write code so who am i to say anything else but that I love how in depth the game starts out and can't wait for more evolved content!

								This game is in very Early Access at the moment however it has already alot of fun to be had and is very playable.  Its a sandbox survival game, but somehow this game feels like stargate except you have to craft SG1 lol.Its just too awesome, the developer also does multiple updates daily sometimes which is great too.  He engages with the community very rapidly and listens to suggestions and ideas.  Even @ full price i feel this game is worth it.  Fair enough to those that would like to follow development and see how it pans out but i have no hesitation in recommending buying at a reasonable price.Positives Fully science fiction sandbox, craft and pilot your own spaceship then head off to explore other planets and solar systemsVery regular updates on the test buildDev is a genuine nice guyUE3 with a possible future update to UE4Huge potential, dev knows what hes doing with his codeAmazing fluid jetpack flight, hold down left shift to go faster.  I can see great youtube videos being made here +1NegativesUpdates are too often lol, nah not really.

As of now the ui doesn't feel ""fluid"" making it a layer that distracts new players from enjoying the game expirience. The gameplay concept of building planetary outposts is a great project to take on and leaves a huge space for improvement i would like to commend the dev for taking it on. The content rigth now is plenty and enjoyable.The visuals and sounds make an outstanding effort to be consistent to the gameplay.If you like building bases, space, resource gathering and crafting and survival. this game sticks to that formula. And i recommend to stick to it for the long haul. I know i will ;) . "

								Hmmmm......curse Steams black and white thumbs up or down policy on reviewing games.Would I recommend this......yes......pretty much.It is VERY much a work in progress but it is at least progressing. The game is in many ways a variation on Space Engineers, but has significant differences  - it's harder to stay alive as a single player at the start for one.So in short, a few of the pluses and minuses from my few hours in game......Pro's :Lots of minerals/resource types to acquire and do different things withDecent (and growing) number of specialised buildings/machines to create100% design your own base with complete freedom of layoutManually requires you to connect power/water/air between production units (this is a little painful at times, but definitely adds something)You pick up mined resource on contact  - no endlessly pushing a key to add them to inventoryDay/night cycle where night significantly alters gameplay.There is a final goal to reach (not yet implemented) so (will) you always play with more purpose than just survivingResource gathering is, at least initially, time and labour intensive so you don't have an intergalactic mega palace with all the mod-cons after an hour of play.Design your own spaceship (I haven't got this far yet, but its an option) Cons:Inventory interface is clunky and labourious when emptying objects - no double click to add/move.Some graphical effects are not exactly state of the art (eg firing the laser, asteroids impacting the surface, explosions)Pathing issues at times (constantly get stuck on mineral deposits)Building placement is awkward as extremely hard to identify where input/output ports are on the blocksGlitchy still at times (eg falling through planet surface to remerge a few seconds later several hundred metres from where you fell through) - which can be an issue in the dead of night.Planetary surfaces are a little bland and basic (one expects bleak and hostile, but these lack other wordly atmosphere and detail)Once you have an oxygen and food supply going survival is almost guaranteed.

								Tried it a few times, nothing has really changed - mostly unplayable, the tutorial is a weird mess that interupts what your doing and doesnt explain anything that well - the UI is halfway broken, sometimes you open a box by select clicking on it, sometimes double click, sometimes you need to press F - the same goes for closing the window again - trial and error and its not the same every time. Sometimes you cant place items in the quick slots, right click when using an item and you ""deselect"" that tool your using.The star/galaxy map is moved around with the keyboard - but you cant select galaxies/planets with keys - no, you need to press the left click button. But the mouse cant move anything?!? But... Why?!?Day and night is litterally - now its day and BLINK, lights out, now its night?!?Build menu in inventory is awkward and doesnt really make much sense. And when placing the build items, how to connect them doesnt make much sense either.The idea is great, a great mix of Factorio with fps/survival elements - but its been nearly a year since i first tried this out and it still lacks immensly in playability and its still littered with bugs and really needs a massive overhaul of the way things work.Therefore - wait around, follow it and see what happens. Since its taken so long to become barely playable, im not optimistic about seeing it developed fully. Stay clear for now			"

								I was not sure at first to buy this game or not, but after reading alot of the developper post, and on the forum, I do believe that after that much time, updating the engine, and still dedicating himself with updates, once couple weeks, by adding a lot of content and bug fixing, this will be a great game that people will be talking about.Any fan of Factorio will like this game; it is the same ressource, management, survival feeling but in 3D! After putting +30 hours in my first week, I cannot wait for the next update to discover what will be delivered. The endgame require majors steps to be able to accomplish it and before you know it, you will see yourself immerged in this 3D world, building your base to provide everything you need to craft the next component. What is amazing, is this feeling of building the ""facility"", and even if this was criticised by some people, I did really enjoyed putting every single piece of wire or water pipe under the fondation, or in the roof of my ""rafinery"", oh and dont forget the air vent if you dont want to run out of oxygen!To summarize: If you can pass by the bugs, that you like Factorio, and would like to try it in 3D, than this game will take couples of hours from you ! I am sure this will be a blast once completed!			"

								""A more then epic space adventure, and a beyond epic developer!""  -AthenI cant' decide what I like more; the game?, or the developer? Each is amazing and each is making this game something special.  If you enjoy designing and exploring, get this game. Period. The breakdown: (Early Access)Pros:-Massive crafting table-New exciting changes happen daily -Harvesting via automation-Many worlds to explore-Design, fly, and enjoy your own spaceship-Design, live in, and defend your baseCons:-Small bugs-Not all features readyThe pros easily outweigh the cons. The cons are not really cons, after all, its early access. The developer is the most active and responsive to ideas that I have ever seen. He is working his arze off like you can't even imagine. Most of us are under the impression that he never sleeps...lol.			"

								I like this game, because it is not an easy one. It is hard to build a base, you have to think on the resources you have to make progress on your production. Make me a lot of fun to research how to a do a thing, a factory, wires, re-desing. It is very glorius to see your base from the jetpack, give it a try !			"

								This game is really uniqe in my opinion, being able to construct a base how you want it, watching out for metoir strikes all the time, building robotics that can ferry your drilled resources to holding tanks or directly into refinarys. then when you have enough build a space ship and move to new worlds to do this. I would recomend 8/10			"

								UPDATE 01/05/2016 - ***Change in Recommendation***Seeing it has been about 3 months since I last reviewed this, I saw there had been quite a few updates to the game and thought I would ""check in"" on the state of the game.It would appear some of the gripes I had about this game have been addressed. While it still feels like an Early Alpha, there is an ""End Game"" now with the construction of the Singularity Gate. There have also been many new machines and parts added to the game, as well as some new effects.While there is still quite some distance to go, I think there is enough content to give the game a go if you are a fan of making production chains, survival, and building. However, if you are waiting for the game to be more polished, I would say hold off awhile longer, but I feel like there is enough content now to feel comfortable recommending it to those that are willing to give it shot.ORIGINAL REVIEWThe game is still in Early Access, so this recommendation is for this point in development. It is likely my recommendation may change in the future, but for the Early Access uninitiated, this recommendation is for you.First off, as a big fan of Factorio and survival style games, this game has immediate draws due to similar gameplay so the potential is there. I'll be keeping an eye on it's progress to see if the patches resolve my current issues with recommending this game.For those that are hesitant to pickup this game, for RIGHT NOW I cannot recommend the game. It is Early Access, so at this stage there is still lots of work left to do. I feature and play lots of Early Access games on my Twitch Stream, so I am no stranger to missing features or incomplete systems. While I have a pretty high tolerance for that sort of thing, I'd much rather wait a bit longer before trying the game again in its current state. The basis of my recommendation is based on if I think the game is fun right now, and for me that is a definitive no.Will the game get better? I'd be hard pressed to say anything but yes, because the developer seems pretty active and the patches are pretty good at squashing various bugs. If you're a fan of Factorio, and games that you build production chains, this game will be right up your alley and should be watched at the very least. If you don't mind picking up a game to support a developer, and not necessarily clocking a lot of hours in the game right away, then by all means grab this.Pros- Complex Production Chains. (This is kind of the point of the game.)- Lots of parts.- Groundwork for exploration and exploitation. (You're going to need to setup on multiple planets.)- Survival Aspect (Food and Oxygen), although some of the cons can make this seem worse than it should be.Cons (due to Early Access)- Could use some more refinement in the tutorial.- Placement can be finicky, which can cause frustration on making longer production chains.- Lots of visual placeholders can be confusing. (For example, meteors that look like they'll hit the player but don't?)- No actual ""endgame"" yet. (No longer an issue)			"

								Yes, I know it's early access. Read to the end before you start barking at me.This game desperately needs a tutorial. And I mean a proper one, not a hastily tossed together series of text boxes that say too much but explain too little.I choked to death trying to figure out how to connect my generator to the oxygen generator. All I was able to do was to wrap the power generator with a cable that went around, but power never happened.I'm gonna say it again. This game needs, desperately, a tutorial that explains how do these parts work together.It also needs tooltips so I can know what these science fiction gizmos do. The water pump and the oxygen pump look ridiculously similar, and the only way to tell them apart is to use them as soon as you've crafted them.I get it. Early access, yeah.There are such things as early testing and internal testing. Paying 20 bucks for something THIS unfinished? I wish more companies were like Mojang, who started selling their game cheap, and went to their full release price as soon as they reached their release version.IF this game leaves this barebones state and enters something more relatable to ""BETA"", I'll check it again and change my review accordingly. As of right now, tho? Stay clear. It's awful.Too frustrated to play it for any longer.			"

								this is a great game i recomend it if you like to play games as they are being developed if not i would say to wait a little bit till he adds some more features in and gets it a little more polished which i would say 3-4 months but i have too say he has made a lot of progress on this since i have bought this the day it came out on steam. it is very fun and has a lot of good potential. Since my first review  on august 24 their has been many new implemented things into the game which continue to add and improve this game. Now this game has a long way to go still but as long as it keeps getting updated and stays on track its potential will in time turn into a great game.			"

								I want to see so much more with this game I hope the devs never quit.  The factory automation stuff is amazing and at times can feel a bit like Infinifactory.The rest of the game however is a bit lacking.  The planets are very simple, there's no NPCs, and no challenges other than building a factory and a ship.  For a game that has ""Explorers"" in the title you'd think that exploring would be an integral part of the game, but it's not.  Exploring is about as dull as this game gets.In about 4 and a half hours of gameplay I managed to build a very simple ship, get to another planet, harvest some ""rare"" ores, and crash my ship completely destroying it. All in all, not bad and worth the four and a half hours I spent on it.  Now the game will sit in my library collecting dust waiting for major updates.			"

								As much as I want to like this game, I simply can't recommend it. The UI is terrible, the interact key only works about 10% of the time, the menus get in the way of actually playing the game and overall it isn't worth the asking price. I'd say it feels like something someone made for their college project, but I've seen more complete college projects out there. Keep an eye on it, sure, but save your money.			"

								I'm recommending this with a ***HUGE*** caution tag on it: if you don't like bugs and need an end-game goal to works towards, then wait on buying it. If you don't mind bugs including collision errors and can work under your own steam (no pun intended), then go for it, especially on a sale.If you like: - Space Engineers - Medieval Engineers - (and maybe Unturned)...then you will probably like this game. I myself have invested numerous hours into SE and other community members have as well. If you play the game and heartily enjoy it you might want to look into this. You start out with nothing but yourself and an escape pod full of some critical essentials. Mine, craft, and build your factory base literally from the ground up, first establishing an oxygen supply, then a food supply, then automated mining and production. After a certain point you can build a spaceship and move to another system, and build another base, automating that as well. Then another. And another. I haven't gotten as far as building a ship and moving to another planet yet, but I'm really digging the base building so far. The art style doesn't look terribly original, but this actually works to the game's advantage - I went to a few space museums (eg, the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, and a couple others). The aesthetics of this game remind of the Mars colony-displays a few museums had, and it reminds me of them in the best way possible. It's all done in Unreal engine and looks very nice by default. I have an Intel GFX card on a 2013 laptop so I generally run most games on minimum graphics, which makes a lot of them look pretty flat or, in some games look faded and pixelated. This game still looks good and doesn't cause my PC to feel like it's on fire either. Also the motion blur is not disorienting (like I've found it to be in other games, such as Sniper Elite V2), yet is pleasantly noticeable and adds to the immersion. Major points for pulling that off right in my own book. Controls are a bit wonky at first, but you get used to them. In some ways they remind me of Entropia Universe (real-world cash game I played for a couple hours but got tired of very quickly - it's not on Steam, I wouldn't bother playing it). It takes some getting used to at first but after awhile it comes naturally. Tutorial is awful. Except for the beginning, you have to manually access it via ""?""-button in your inventory. There is a community guide though which explains things pretty well with images, etc. A number of things in the game are self-explanatory or easily figured out though - don't discount the guide or help button of course, but this game isn't so complex you'll be dead-in-the-water if you try to go it alone. As long as you know what a few things do you can  figure most things out. The only thing I haven't figured out yet or seen explained properly is how research works. I have had a research computer built and running for a few hours now but I never have any research points to spend... hopefully this will be explained in greater detail later on...Game has enough physics to troll you. Parts fall through conveyors, robotic arms get stuck in machines, and ores you mine manually from resource deposits will fall back into the deposit and can't be collected. As each deposit has a finite amount of resource for you to acquire, once that ore falls back into the deposit (due to faulty collision calculations), you can't get it back, because the game is smart enough to not let the player clip through the deposit. The dev has said he's looking into this though and will probably be fixed soon. As a whole, the game works pretty smoothly. It's still very rough around the edges, but it's playable. I can see myself investing a long time into this and look forward to doing so.(Note: I'll try and update my review with each significant update/bug-fix)			"

								The game is in EARLY ACCESS and it's a little rough getting started.  The ""tutorial"", for example, is just some sparse documentation that pops up periodically, not tied in any way to what you're doing in-game.  As such, it took me a little while to realize that this is Factorio in 3D.  If you don't know Factorio, go buy it and play it right now (it's not yet on Steam).  With a foundation of playing Factorio, this game is an enormously fun 3D upgrade to it. If you like building automated factories and resource management, definitely get this game. There's a lot of work to be done on it and hopefully the developers realize the amazing vision here!			"

								This is the best cable management sim ever :) Actually it's too unpolished yet to enjoy the full concept. However the game is pretty addictive even at its current state.			"

								Just could not get on with the control system for the game. It seems counter-intuitive, or at least, ill thought out. To be honest, that made it so hard (for me) to play the game, that its hard to tell whether there is a good game hidden underneath. I guess for those able to persist with the controls, you will be rewarded, I hope that the dev will look at this in future updates, and this may be a game I have another look at in a few months time. But for now, I can't recommend it.			"

								I really dont see how someone can give this a bad review. It is a really fun game from the time I have spent playing it. Only thing is making sure everything is attached right is my only annoyance. Also the placing of different parts could be a little smoother because everything is janky atm. If the devs stick with this then its gonna be really great			"

								For being early access the game set at epic graphics runs fantastic!! It really has alot of potential.. The only thing I would love to see as maybe a multiplayer aspect to it, not sure if thats part of the developement of the game but that would be great to have a friend or 2 to be able to join in..

								I cannot recommend this game in its current state. I spent over 2 hours building a base. I hooked things up to the grid and it seemed to be working fine, but then the batteries were not supplying enough power for the entire base (no big deal). When morning came around, the machines that were unpowered at night due to the lack of batteries would not restart. I tried deleting and replacing wires, even deleting and replacing the machines themselves, but they would not restart. The wires said I had a positive charge.Then when I quit the game and came back later, my game loads to a black screen. I can't see anything. When I open the inventory, it flashes for a split second then disappears. So now my saved game is useless. This was released for even Early Access far too early on.			"

								While the game does have promise, it needs a lot of work. The interface is very awkward. You cannot Mouse Look with the cursor. You will have to toggle between cursor and moving/turning. You can only place items/build with the cursor, but if you need to turn the camera, you have to toggle out of cursor mode, turn, toggle back to cursor and begin again. The toggle is the space bar.......which for every other game should be to jump. If, like me, you attempt to jump, you may lose your ability to turn...until you try to jump again. And you cannot select anything in your environment if you have your turn/move mode on. You cannot scroll along your inventory bar. Scroll only zooms. The instructions, while written in English, are written by someone who does not speak English very well (at all? *cough Google Translate*). Very confusing. And a lot is left for you to figure out. Not necessarily a bad thing, although if you are already frustrated.......Starting a new game while exiting out of an old game will give you the same inventory in the new game as in the old. Will also give you the same health and oxygen......bad if you are running out of both as you will not have time to do anything about it.			"

								update review well ive had this game maybe a year almost i cant remeber .... but i have noticed majour addvanced updates within the graphics and style of the game and the options you can play through ... you get to choose 5 or 4 options on how you want to play the game ... then there is a solar system full of planets to choose from and explore each one is diffrent but there must be at least more than 200 or 300 planets to choose from so you do have a wide scale choice to choose from .... the materials and structures are really well designed you just have to get use to knowing what goes where and how to use everything ...... mmmm you also have enemys atacking you at times and astroids ..so you need to protect youre base structure ..... the sky and the land is really well done with day and night .... also the game is always at some time being updated with new stuff and details ....... i would reccomend this game as everything works and the detail is grate ....................... however i should note that this game for me is more of a ... time game passer ie you play it to pass the time a way ... i find that it does take a while to set everything up and play but there is game options for that but yea besides takeing a while the game is good so id reccomend			"

								I was very interested in this game but after 1 hour of coming to grips with it I saved progress. Since then every attempt to restart the game has produced a crash. There is no support I can  find with developer and Steam is their normal dilatory self. Rather than wait for support which may not materialise I have requested refund. As final attempt i removed local content and reinstalled game. Steam is now asking me to purchase what is already in Games Library			"

								The graphics need to be improved, the mechanics need to be improved, the clunkiness needs to be dealt with and the lack of a helpful tutorial cripples gameplay from the start. The game needs more elegance, user-frieandlyness, and an overall rethinking to the highest degree. The building mechanics are quite frustrating with some blocks and the hints and tips pop-ups you get randomly pull you out of whatever you were about to craft.One of the biggest mistakes of my lifego buy big pharma or somethingIm done.

								While I'm very interested in playing his game I have encountered a snag. No matter what I do I cannot put anything into any of the 9 bottom user slots for use!! This problem basically stops you from playing. If you try different keys or mouse clicks to put say the laser drill into the slots you end up crashing the game. So either the tutorial is not sufficent or the game has issues. Might want to wait for a while before purchasing it.			"
