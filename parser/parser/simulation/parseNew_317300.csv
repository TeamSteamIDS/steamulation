												I thoroughly enjoyed this quirky dating sim! I'll break down what I consider to be the pros and cons of the game (seriously though, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.)Pros:+ Sometimes visual novels/dating sims suffer from an excess of boring, mononous text. Thankfully, this one does NOT! The writing is fun and engaging, and the scenes aren't unnecessarily long. + The characters are unique and pretty realistic, each with their positive and negative traits. I thought they all added flavor to the story.+ Options for queer romance!!! <3 For my first playthrough, I played as Anne and romanced Isabella... the storyline was simultaneously adorable and sultry.+ Playing on normal difficulty, the game felt well-balanced. The stats DO matter and you definitely have to think about how you plan your week. The choices make a huge difference too. However, I never felt completely overwhelmed. Basically, the game is not *that* hard, but it isn't a cakewalk, either.+ The animation is very cute and the game is aesthetically-pleasing overall.+ Replay value definitely is there, since there are two characters to play and four romance paths for each.Cons:- Sometimes that guitar theme song that plays in the background gets really annoying. I think it's a song that's too loud/overwhelming to be playing on loop during some of the scenes. - I would have liked more art. The only scenes you see drawn out are the two BIG romance scenes you earn (one during spring break and one at the end of the game). There are plenty of other romantic/funny scenes during the game that would have been amazing to actually see instead of just imagine.- I wish there were more queer romance options (No Anne x Sally!?!?! *pouts*)If you like dating sims, I encourage you to give this game a whirl! It is sure to entertain!			"

												As a visual novel dating simulation with a $25.00 price tag, Roommates had high expectations to live up to when I started it. There are definitely a couple of things it does right: the diversity of the cast of characters (in terms of ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender) is well done. It's also nice to see a dating game where players have a choice between playing as a male or female protagonist (each of which can romance both male and female love interests).However, I found it to be severely lacking for the following reasons:- I only found two of the characters (Dominic and Isabella) worth pursuing. The others were either boring or downright unappealing to me (particularly Rakesh, who constantly seemed out to get the straight-laced protagonist in trouble).- The male protagonist is so outlandishly obnoxious that after playing as the female main character (during which you're able to romance him), I had absolutely no interest in playing as him.- The romances end with the characters going their separate ways. The only way to get a happy ending is to achieve a set of frustratingly hidden goals in addition to successfully wooing your character of choice. This was intriguingly realistic, but also severely disappointing.I found myself losing interest in it after completing only a couple of playthroughs and then struggling my way (via a guide) to one of the happy endings. The thought of going back to play it again fills me with a sense of exhausted boredom—which is exactly how you shouldn't feel when you're thinking about a good dating sim.			"

												Ok so here goes nothing. I bought this game mostly for some fun and nothing serious, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is actually good. So where to start, When i first started playing it i wasent taking choices serious but after a while u realize that the choices actually matter. There is also alot of choices which makes it feel like its your journey . I got drawn into the story and really enjoyed it. Another plus is that there are some funny jokes here and there. Ive gotten every ending with both of the characters and i love all the endings. I just hope another game like Roommates comes out.I would say this game is a 9/10 if u like visual novels and dating sims.			"

												Personally this game isn't for me; I didn't like the art style, the writing didn't keep me engaged and I found myself just wanting to get it over and done with. It just really seemed like the minimal amount of effort possible went into the story and I found myself cringing at how bad it was at times.This game also includes you picking what you do during the week regarding studying and extra-curricular acitivities to make sure you have the right skills for whoever you're wanting to romance, during the week events also happen which you can skip or take part in depending on whether it'll get the right person to like you more or not. Be warned though, there is a lot of reading and as I didn't find it engaging it made the game have a very slow pace to it.Also if you're looking for a game featuring nudity this isn't for you, and when the naughtier scenes do start happening there is only ~2 risque images with nsfw text which does the whole fade to black/30 minutes later thing before anything really happens. This isn't a downside for myself but I bet it would be for others.However there are some things I did like about it.PROS:- being able to play as female or male- being able to romance female or male- diversity of characters- diversity of sexual orientations (holy♥♥♥♥♥♥pansexual is actually used!)

												Roommates is a dating sim/visual novel where you play as either a guy or a girl who starts at college. Like other games in the genre you decide for each part of the day what you want to do, which increases or decreases certain statistics. A great feature in this game is that you can schedule the week planner ahead of time, rather than needing to decide each day (part) again what you want to do next. And you can also change this at any time.The daily routine is interrupted by events throughout the week, which mainly serve to advance the story and your relationship with the other characters.The writing is hilarious at points and Roommates has a good rock soundtrack.Some minor gripes I have are that there is very little animation other than characters sliding in and out, and that it isn't always clear what your chosen response will lead to. At times I picked what I thought was a flirting response only to have my character say something completely inappropriate, destroying their relationship with the character I was pursuing at the time.Very unique to the genre, Roommates has both girl chasing boy, boy chasing boy, and homosexual relationships included. Because of this there are multiple endings and many choices in this game really matter.Overall this is a highly impressive VN.			"

												Pros:+ Funny/silly dialog+ Rather clever story (like working in a murder mystery and a prisoner's dilemma)+ Balancing immediate feedback with delayed results+ Nice drawing, decend sound+ Hetero- and homosexual pairingsCons:- Somewhat immature at times- All girls are huge breasted creatures- Some choices are unintuitive (You would never expect the ensuing dialog from the selection label)- Most choices are beyond obvious (Choose X if you want X to like you)- ""Victory Conditions"" and some gameplay dependencies are not particularly well explained.But overall I enjoyed my time with the game. I might even return to it one day and try to get some of the other pairings. If you decide to give the game a try keep these things in mind and you'll have an even better experience. They are not story spoilers, just gameplay clarifications that I would have appreciated. But in case you want to figure everything out yourself I've put them in spoiler tags anyway:Most activities give you bonus points when more than 75% rested.You can't romance more than one character per playthrough. Focus on them.To romance a character you need 100 romance points as well as the necessary stat points as described in game BEFORE spring break.To get a characters true ending, there's an additional criteria. You really have to focus to get that. "

												Pretty good, lighthearted VN.  It has pretty cliche characters, but each one has a different side to them if you get to know them better.  It's nothing mindblowing, you won't find a lot of earthshaking literature here but it's entertaining and stays entertaining.There's two playable characters, one male and one female with four romance paths each for a total of eight paths.  Two of those paths are same-sex paths.  The stat system and picking your schedule is very gamey and doesn't do much except artificially close off the ""good"" endings if you do it wrong.  Basically you pick out a character you want to romance and only pick activities that are associated with the stats they apparently like.  There's no consequences for never raising any of the other stats except the two you need.  I guess you can care about grades too, but you can just study in the time blocks where your chosen stat activities aren't available.  The so-called bad boy I played that wanted to drop out of college was a top student, while still getting the girl and finding time between the sexual tension to front a band.It's a neat little story, but like I said it's not going to be an intellectual roller-coaster and it's not meant to be.  Roommates is a VN about light comedy, light romance and sweet character interaction.  You won't find a lot of philosophy, but you'll find some nifty references, a few laughs and enough sweet/cute scenes to give you diabetes.			"

												Okay.... I've played this a bit. It's an okay game. It's nothing spectacular or awesome, in my opinion. Perhaps it's just me, but it feels a bit ""shallow"" and the characters seem a bit flat too. I didn't see that I have to click on ""Stat"" at first to see what kind of requirements each person has, so the first playthrough I just ended up alone :P It also feels a bit strange to not have a first-person view of things... One more gripe I have is that the ""Play Event"" option was not clear! Sometimes it did the opposite of what I would expect. I would not recommend this game at the original price. Wait for a sale (I got it through Humble Bundle). It generally left something to be desired.			"

												The best dating simulator I've played so far! The cast is very diverse, but the characters are all likeable and relatable. Seriously, I want a Dominic in my life XD you can choose to play as Anne or Max; each of them has four romance options. The writing is legit good (only flaw I think is when Isabella and Max interact and use those cringey nicknames)! The romance and your college life intertwine well, and you can even influence how characters will do after college with your choices, which is great because they all matter. The art has a nice crispy flare to it; the CGs are made by a different artist I think, but they still look cute (or sexy, wink wink). The sountrack is great and conveys the mood perfectly. The Halloween track is my fave! The simulation part I was afraid of is actually intuitive and pretty nice, with three levels of difficulty (if you suck at it like me just select the easy one and you'll be fine).Final verdict: great for both seasoned fans and neophytes of the genre :)			"

												To be honest, I didn’t liked this game so much. It’s REALLY expensive, the writing and characters are cliche, and it gets quite boring after one or two playthroughs. But I have to give it some credit for the fact that you can play as a male or a female MC. I found that interesting, and also the fact that there are two bisexual characters. Overall, I only recommend this game on a good sale and for players who are already used to Winter Wolves games. If you don’t like status raising system in VNs, don’t get this.4/10.			"

												If you like visual novels and Dating Sims , then you'll probably find this game entertaining . You can choose to play as either Max or Anne so it is basically for both genders. You can organize you schedule , raise your stats, make friends and choose your date. You can even choose to be in a homosexual relationship if you want, which is pretty nice. I wasn't a fan of the art at first but I got used to it pretty quickly. Also, some of the characters seem a bit annoying at first but they grow on you as the game progresses. I have only played as Anne so far and I think my favorite partner for her is Dominic, they're so cute together.Overall , I really enjoyed this game and I think it was worth the money I spent.			"

												I had very high hopes for this game. It popped up in my queue and I added it to my wishlist when I saw it was $25, not wanting to spend that much on it. I bought it when it was on sale for $15, figuring it was worth it if it was so expensive for a visual novel. Unfortunately, I was not all that impressed with the game. The characters were okay; their personalities were pretty shallow and they all fit into a stereotype. It is impossible to romance the person you want on your first play through because you spend so much time figuring the scheduler out before realizing how to utilize it to gain enough points in the right fields to romance the character you want (or I suppose I could just be a dumbass). The story isn't very interesting in my opinion and there's not much variability in it, unless you just skip every event.Outside of that, the replay value is decent because there are so many routes you can take, but the story doesn't really differ much in each one, so it sort of ruins the point of it.I would not spend more than $5 on this game. It was not worth what you're being charged for just to get a mediocre story with little variability in it between the different romance options.			"

												So I just wrote a really big review, but I figured no one would read it and I stutter with words. So I burned that thing. Here I go again.Roommates!!What is Roommates? Roommates it's that book you know it's not that good, but you like anyway. It's a mixed bag. A mixed bag of... actually, is more like a cake. A cake filled with good stuff and some bad stuff. I'm having a hard time with this metaphor.So, what is Roommates? Roommates is a VN with some simulator sim stuff tossed in. You can choose between two characters, sweet and shy Anne or loud and obnoxious Max, and get through college. This means, of course, getting a boy/girlfriend. You'll also have to manage your time to study, get money and raise the correct stats you need for the ending you want.Okay, okay, now. How well does the game accomplish this little simulation of college? I'm a lazy bum and not in college, so I've no idea. But as a game it's pretty fun. The simulation sim part of it is pretty good and well balanced. Not too hard, not too easy. The characters are actually pretty good, even though first impressions might not say so. Cliche, but well handled and charming. You learn to like them and want to see more of them. There's diversity in them, from beliefs to oriental sexuations (yes). That aside, The game has quite a lot of content and requires at least a few playtroughs to get most of it, quite a lot more to get all the endings. The art and music is okay. Good, but nothing to write home about. The storyline is just kinda there. You're in college, having fun and trying to get laid. Overall, I found the game really enjoyable. The comedy is good, the characters are fun to read, and you just want to keep moving forward to see more of these fun situations involving them. So the game is great? Should you run to buy it!? Errr... not quite? There's some stuff that will put some people off. First, the characters. I liked them all, but some of them are kind of a hit or miss. A lot of people will instantly hate Max, the male protagonist. And the characters are probably the only reason you'd want to keep playing, so not liking them is kind of a big deal. And about the content... while it's true that there's several routes and endings to get, the story is just kinda there and aside from some events there might be little reasons to replay the game. Many players will lose interest after getting one or two endings.So the game sucks!? No! Well, I don't think so, anyawy!  I've been charmed by the game. I know the characters have some problems, and I know the writing can be repetitive and uninspired. But honestly, I think the game deserves some playtime, specially if you like visual novels. It's by no means a bad game, it simply falls short at the price point is at. My advice is get it during sale. You probably won't get every ending, but you'll get some enjoyment out of it!			"

												i just ranted a bit about this game on some chatroom, and i think ill post it as my reviewi am very happyi just played a vn for the past 5-6 hours, and i finally got the ending i wantedi had to redo it because the vn had this stupid thing where you had to organize what you do during a week, and to get certain characters endings you had to get a certain amount of points in several stats that do literally nothing other than unlock better endings if you reach the aforementioned amountit also had to interrupt me with dialogue on the days that i had to use to increase these stats for the route i was aiming for and make it so much more harder to do it without bankrupting your character or making them burn out/fail collegeoh right, you also had money that you use for literally nothingyou just gotta make sure you dont go bankrupt from doing activites. you dont even use the money when you buy valentines gifts, the one thing you'd think money would be important in. i honestly thought that the money was important, and that i would use it for something big in the future, but no. although i dont reccomend it, if you want a vn with a really ♥♥♥♥ing weird way of achieving your desired ending with more thought being givin to the weekly schedule than the characters and their paths (its seriously so ♥♥♥♥ing easy. you dont even need to think about it unless you dont know who you wanna go for), then get this game i guess.edit: i probably should have added that i think the entire reason this isnt a full blown visual novel instead of what seems to be a puzzle game with a storyline is because the creators just didn't have enough ideas to make a storyline for all these characters, with more endings than you didnt get em, you got em but lost em, and you got em lost em then got em again.(i haven't played every route, so i dont know if this is true for every route)			"

												This game is a huge step up from the first game from this compony I played. The art work is a major improvement, The dialogue and plot alters slightly depending on who you romance, it's funny, good music and it has some moments that just made me want to 'squee'. It also has achievements for each of the ends and CG scenes. Which, is another thing about this game, you can pick between male and female.This game was so worth $25. "

												This is a great VN. I've only done one romance route so far but there are about ~6-9 depending on how you count things. I banked about 6 hours for one route, although naturally you will spend less time on your subsequent routes unless you want to reread everything. The writing is entertaining and well done. It isn't an epic multi layered story but it isn't meant to be either. The choices you make matter but only a few of them will mess up your romance route, and of those most are easy to discern. It's best to stick with one romance partner from the get go unless you don't want a romance ending (you can still get a satisfying ending while not romantically ending up with anyone). You can play as a male or female and both of them have distinctively different personalities. For each protagonist there are 3 opposite sex options and 1 same sex option. The music in the game is good and catchy (at least a couple of tracks I would listen to for fun outside of the game), although there were a few oddly silent parts that I wish had some music. The art is great and is anime-styled. Romance scenes get to the edge of where underwear comes off, and then is a ""fade to black.""I would suggest taking a peak at the guide for this game (on steam) so you get the best ending for your romance choice the first time through. It's not very spoilery. If you INSIST on not reading it, I would suggest making sure to make sure to get affection points in every scene with the character you want to romance (go back and test the options, etc) and focus on their associated stats (you can find out by clicking on the ""stats"" button) to the exclusion of almost everything else. To romance Anne (who I went with) you need to keep your grades up, too. MAKE SURE to get to have enough rest while preferring actions, if you dip below about 70% your stat increases diminish greatly. Skip events that don't involve your intended romance partner (if you're not sure, save and then test out the event)  so you get more rest. It's fast to replay the game because of the handy skip feature so don't worry about wasting too much time. Plus you get to save at any time, and I would recommend saving a lot, there are plenty of save slots too. Also ask on the forums if you need any help.This is another good Winter Wolves VN and I look forward even more to their future games. If you not sure or are new to VNs, get the game on sale.			"

												So, 4 hours in, and I'm struggling to get my AnneXSally ending only to find out Anne can't get with Sally, which SUCKS. 4 hours wasted. HOWEVER, It's not♥♥♥♥♥♥ so I'll write a real review. Pros:Well designed storyline, and a funny storyline at times. Skills are able to be earned faster the more you do them.You get to manage your time like an actual college kid with infinite motivation.Cons:Anne cannot date Sally. In a game where you have a stat page for all 5 of the characters, it doesn't plainly let you know NO, YOU CAN'T SHAG THIS ONE. Car-Car is one of the best characters, and I'm super sad you can't date her. Music is looped poorly, and there are a lot of points in the game where it's silent for no reason, and there are times where music meshes poorly. You don't get a lot of interactions some weeks, which I guess is realistic, but c'mon, it's a dating sim where I can't date the hippy s the farm girl. I gues I expected too much. I'm being overly critical. I have a bad taste in my mouth because I feel like I wasted 5 hoursd. Be that as it may, I still have to recommend this!Side note, IZZY'S FACE LOOKS SO MANLY, AND HER ARMS ARE ALWAYS ABOVE HER HEAD, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.			"

												Winter Wolves won me over with an excellent RPG/visual novel mashup ""Loren the Amazon Princess"", so I was intrigued what other great games they might have under their belt. ""Roommates"" as a pure visual novel/dating sim might not have the ""saving the world from Great Evil"" level of urgency, and a stereotypical US college setting is as generic as it gets, but still, having a great experience with Loren, I was expecting a healhty amount of cheesy fun. And - a few issues aside - I get just that.""Roommates"" is distinctively casual in approach and won't intimidate you with plethora of options and it's nice to look at but it feels just too basic, even for what it's trying to be.Story itself has very little drama to it, just your average teenage stuff. As a consequence, the characters are a bit thin, as there is no real opportunity for them to develop any unique personality. The game just doesn't make you standing before any serious dilemma, but maybe that's the whole point. It's supposed fun in casual way, and at times, it is. As a bonus, you might learn what can be done with a jar of mayonnaise (and a little creativity!).The game is entirely about pursuing romance with characters, so all you have to do is make sure you made the right choices and have a stats at a minimum required level to ""unlock"" the desired ending. The issue is, while the 'right' choices in ""Roommates"" are mostly obvious, there are some make-or-break ones which are not. On my first playthrough, pursuing Rakesh, I didn't get the 'romance' ending solely because of picking a wrong Valentine's Day gift. So be careful, use a multiple save game slots, and be prepared to go back to your old save.As for the visuals, character art is good and the backdrops are nice, if nothing outstanding. Sound is serviceable, save for the title theme song which will get on your nerves soon with it's overdone jpop impersonation.As you can see, ""Roommates"" is a mixed bag, but the ultimate verdict has to be a positive one, because... well, it's a fun game on its own, and while it doesn't live up to Loren's greatness, you may want to give it a shot, especially if you are into visual novels/date sims.Pros:+ easy to get into,+ occasionally funny, light-hearted story,+ basic, but clean and tasteful presentation,+ diverse male & female romance options for each gender.Cons:- might require a look or two in walkthrough to complete each romance path,- aside from raising stats, there is no real sense of character development,- annoying title theme song.

												Okay so lately ive been playing alot of visual novels/dating sims (i know i have no life) and i have to say that this one is at the top of my list. What list you may be asking well pfft how the hell should i know! Aaaanyways the reason i like this game so much is because you have to balance a few things along with actually getting the girl you want. You have to balance money energy and stats. The stats are used to get your waifu (or guy.. idk what theyre called in otaku so shush). Some girls /guys prefer certain stats over the others. Oh and you get to choose which gender you are. If you play as a guy you play as Max. He hates school and wants to be in a famous band. Anne is the female character. Shes a shy bookworm. If you play as max and you want to go for another guy (if you role that way who am i to judge) well you can :P if you play as anne and want to date a girl the game lets you do that as well. They're are multiple endings you can get and theres more to this game than just reading. A few weeks in and you get to go to the halloween party. At this party you play murdered (the game) and have to figure out who killed the guy. Its random everytime btw.All in all i give this game a 9/10. If it was voiced then in would be a solid 10/10. The music is good the art is good and the story is good so buy this game! plus its on humblebundle right now so you pay like 6 bucks and you get this game plus 5 other games.			"

												Definitely not worth the price.I suppose that if you like visual novels without a deep story (or much of any story, really), this could be good for you - it has lots of dialog, you can date certain characters, plan your own character's week... but there is nothing original. First, we are shoved into the life of one of the two protagonists, both of them being very stubborn in their role and - for me - very hard to even care about in the slightest. There is not much of a story going on, which I expected from the description - but I defiinitely expected more from the romance options at least. Everything that happens feels very rigid and unnatural, and I couldn't get myself to care about any of the available romance options. There are tons of better visual novels out there, and they tend to be much cheaper than this. Honestly, if the price wasn't so high, I wouldn't be this disappointed. I loved Tales of Aravorn, but this... Anything that's 20$+ should meet certain standards. This game doesn't.			"

												This game was pretty fun: the conversations were interesting and funny, there are a lot of events that happen that expand on everyone's personalities, and you get to choose between two different characters.  Granted... the beginning of the rock star makes him sound like a complete jerk, but he kind of 'molds' to your choices as you go, and he becomes better if you pick him.  The girl everyone seems to find endearing, and I agree.  The story was simple, but enjoyable.The 'stat raising/scheduling' part threw me off and doesn't feel like it adds much to the game, but I mostly play for the story anyway.  Just make sure you REALLY look at everything before you make choices: I was trying to get a romance ending and figured out, oh, I need to build certain stats that I ignored the whole way through.The price still feels high at $25, I would wait for a sale... but I always wait for a sale.  Any game that can get me to replay it to get achievements/other endings is good in my book.			"

												This game is a comedy visual novel. I say comedy, because the thing is filled with funny moments, and even the few serious moments are tinged with some snark. You can choose to play as Max, a rebellious sort that is in college to make a name for his band and break out into the world, or as Anne, a sheltered bookish girl looking to break out of her shell. Besides being able to pursue a romance with the other potential PC, there are four other potential partners. Domenic is exclusive to Anne, while Sally is only available to Max, while Rakeesh and Isabella are available to both.Truthfully, the relationships that feel the most likely are the pairings between Max and Anne, with Domenic-Anne and Sally-Max close behind. There is an interesting system in place to gather relationship points as well as money and grades (you are at college and your parents might want a return on their investment!).			"

												I loved this game. Lots of variety allowing for multiple play-throughs for each character. While some characters can feel a tad cliche it's largely well written with emotional and funny scenes, and nicely written romance scenes. I did every romance and enjoyed them all. Well worth playing, particularly if you've enjoyed some of Winter Wolves' other games (or dating sims in general).			"

												Roommates is a perfectly entertaining dating sim. There is a decent variety of potential lovers for both male and female players (or males playing as females in all likelyhood). The art style isn't my cup of tea, however the devs definitely put time into the character design, writing, backdrops as well as the player options. If you need to burn a weekend, or have an interest in dabbing into dating sims, Roomates is an overall good game for any newcomers or veterans of the genre.7.5/10  gets the Llama thumbs up.			"

												Well, it's not as cringeworthy as most titles in this genre, playing as the Guy there was none of that ""Am I good enough"" spaghetti trope garbage that litters so many titles. Though when it came to the ""Battle of the Bands"" part all I could think of was Harry Partridge's cartoons mocking every Saturday Morning Cartoon show's Battle of the Bands bit.Worth a pop for sure, one of the better titles!

For the last few I ended up skipping the text so it was pointless. I do like that you have options that affect the story line.

												This will probably sound pretty damn stupid to a lot of those who have completed the game and happen to stumble upon this review, or those who researched the game beforehand, but... I didn't really know this game was specifically a dating sim. In fact, I got the impression this game doesn't really know what it wants to be. I'm going to recommend it because although I felt disappointed at the end, it was entertaining for the most part and is worth picking up at a discount.Okay, so onto what I mentioned. I got this game in a bundle. I only read the synopsis and I loaded it not knowing what to expect. This did not come across as a dating sim because everything seemed very platonic. I assumed it was a visual novel-esque (with some interaction) game based on building friendships. Now, I know some people aren't going to like me saying this, but the fact you can build stats with same-sex characters further led me to feel it's not a full dating sim. I absolutely welcome this but I've played a lot of these kinds of games and it's the first time I've come across this gameplay mechanic. I applaud the developers for that but I didn't expect it.Anyway, I played as Max and nothing seemed to suggest romance. Then 4/5 into the game a screen pops up saying (paraphrased), ""Hey man, did you know your stats are specifically required to unlock romantic endings?!"". I was thinking ""Oh..."" at this point, wishing the box had appeared earlier on. If I recall, stats affecting character interactions is mentioned once at the beginning and it's in part my fault for not exploring the interface more but I didn't know what was required for each character. In most dating sims, you go by instinct, but even if you screw up and don't build a certain stat (like fitness for the sporty girl) there will be one girl (e.g. childhood friend) who wil date you at the end regardless. Ironically, despite informing me of this it was impossible for me to get high enough stats to unlock a CG ending at that point, so I had sunk nearly eight hours (I don't rush through VNs so it lasted a while) into the game to end up with no achievements. I also wasted a lot of time on studying attaining full grade points which didn't seem to change anything by the end. If I knew this I'd have decreased my study time to get the special cutscenes.Now that you know not to make the same dumbass mistake I did and play this like a dating sim rather than a general VN, I hope you enjoy it should you get it.

												Not sure it is worth $20, but a decent VN game with nice art and interesting time management system. If you are looking for a VN with a deep story this is not the game you are looking for; consider roommates a dating sim with VN elements.Ultimately I think the game is passable and a good casual time killer. I liked how the objectives were very clear compared to some games where there are hidden criteria and weird metrics that are not obvious. I would have liked it more if some of the characters were more likable and less cliched - for instance, the main male protagonist comes across as your typical ""rebel,"" ""bad boy,"" ""too cool for school"" doucebag and some parts were downright cringe-worthy. Fortunately, the female protagonist was much better. "

Posted: March 18, 2015
												""Roommates"" was a pretty fun little game. Simple and mundane as some of these things go (No aliens! Nobody is a pigeon!), but offering an interesting cast of characters. One unusual double-edged sword is that the game allows you to play as either a male or a female - cool! - but perhaps due to the need to write and code in all the extra combinations, either is left with a relatively spartan 3+1 choices to pursue.And pursue you don't, in my experience playing through the game twice. The game presents a week schedule which you plan ahead of time to gather skill points. Frequently intermixed are events where you can get to know the various other characters and increase your rating with them, but like many more visual-novel experiences you are given precious little opportunity to say ""I really like X, I want to spend more time with him/her."" Still, the cast are nice and varied and you can complete the game with a happy ending and without dying even if you romance nobody, which is more than I can say for a few VN/Dating sim games out there. You know who you are.If you do give the game a spin I recommend playing through once with your own choices and then perhaps again using a guide - in two playthroughs I was not able to unlock any of the 'romance' scenes, even though I was trying the second time. You need to be pretty perfect on the life decisions and have your stats geared heavily towards those favored by your crush in order to have enough points on the right track in time. Good luck!			"

												So, I suppose I'll start with the cons first. - The game lies to you, or at least obscures information. Specifically, you're never informed that you need  a toal sum of 600 points  in a characters associated stats to get their good ending, just that you need 500 to get an ending at all. The 600 thing is then mentioned when you have finished your first playthrough. - Getting said points is little more than spamming the same jobs and hobbies and hoping the RNG is in your favor. There's a slight amount of strategy, in that you need to keep your grades for one or two of the romances, and that low energy means lower stat gains, but for the most part, just spam and RNG.- As a result, the large variance of small humerous messages get quite annoying after a while, when you put it on ""skip to new unread part"", especially as you will have to suffer through an entirely new set each romance. - The soundtrack could use more variation, and if you aren't actually clicking your way through the scenes as fast as you can, you will end up with the latter half of each scene being in total silence, only to get surprised by the guitarriff again when the scene changes.Of course, that little thumb above this review is pointing up, so I unsurprisingly have some pro's as well: - The stories, while not all equally good, are for the most part quite romantic, and feel real. They also all feel different, which increases replayability, as the non-heterosexual characters' arcs change which the player character's personality. - Likewise, the Characters themselves are all likeable to some extent, and while a tad stereotypical, do feel like real people, and most of them have some sort of story arc even when you aren't trying to romance them. I especially applaud the descion to make both playable characters, well....characters, rather than just a blank slate to project yourself onto.Beyond that, there's not really that much to say. It's a good little section of stories, and I had fun playing it. Thank God for whomever introduced ""skip read section"" to Visual Novels and Dating Sims, though. It made replaying the game for a new romance far more tolerable.			"

												Nothing too deep or special, but it is good, simple fun.Takes a couple of hours to complete the game and has quite some replayability (as there are multiple endings). Though your first playthrough will probably remain the 'best', as it is your first encounter with the game and everything is still new and exciting.So get this if:- You want a VN you can easily get into.- You don't mind the somewhat cliché characters/coversations.- You want to be able to choose what to do (whether or not to hang out with another character etc) and to (partially) change the dialogue.- You want a VN with multiple endings (that are actually worth checking out).- You like a dating sim / a story that revolves around college.The only thing that annoyed me quite a bit was the (repetitive) rock music. Some tracks were spot-on, whilst other tracks really kind of ruined the mood in some scenes ... But you get used to it fast enough and the overall experience is still really nice. So if you answered yes to the (most) questions above, just get the game ^^ (might wanna get it during a sale as the game is indeed rather expensive :p).			"

												Roommates follows the wacky adventures of a college warband under one roof. You take the roll of either Max, or Anne catering their entire semester experience to what you see fit. Max takes the roll of the rocker scumbag who couldn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about how he performs in his classes. He self indulges in psychoactive drugs to pass his down time while sleeping with his guitar. Anne is the typical bookworm nerdy type, almost never leaving her room so she can read her kawaii desu fan fiction. Upon start of the game you become indoctrinated into your first college warband in preperation for the X games. Stare into the dark abyss known as Dominc, the supreme commander of the dorm, and all around ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. His favorite past times include kicking dogs, MMO RPG's, and refusing to remove the stick in his anal cavity.Soon after you meet Isabella, the not at all sexual innuendo laced character in the whole damn game. This expertly crafted character who wears very little clothing will slowly sneak right into your heart. She barely holds down her job at the campus coffee shop, because no matter what you order you'll get ♥♥♥♥ing candy. And who could forget Sally, a devote follower to the Vegan lifestyle. Events around this character include:Discussing the benefits of eating that one cowWhy Five Guys is a gift to all human kindExperimenting on baby rabbits is for the betterment of mankindWhy am I still doing thisAnd the final boss, Rakesh. He is the right hand of darkness, and should be both feared and respected. You will be under his influence the moment you start the game. You will be convinced that every event played within the game should be catered to Rakesh. This is a noob trap. His end goals include getting you into an extremely erotic bunny suit, giving him a mayo sponge bath, and force feeding him paper. Rakesh is an evil in this game you must try to avoid at all costsThe game also includes many forgetable side characters such as Spinny Glasses guy, Roxanne the anti Anne character, kinda chubby girl who you can decide to bully if you so choose (If you do, you're kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥, and last but not least, Chad the hunk cake. He is the secret mini boss you must face if you decide to romance Isabella, and lets face it, you're all going to.The core gameplay revolves around reading text while looking at still images in the background. The characters have a wide range of animation such as smiling, blushing, and opening and closing their mouth. If you're lucky you'll be treated with some amazing sound effects to go with the scenario. More gameplay mechanics include Lock Picking, Bunny Hopping, and an RPG inspired spreadsheet level up system. The game has three difficulties: Easy, Standard, and Nightmare. Upon extensive playtime, I have no idea what the difference between Easy and Normal is. Nightmare mode adds elements such as not being able to heal unless you drink a potion, and the only way to repair broken limbs is with a doctors bag, or visting a doctor. The one major event in this game is Vladimir's gambit. You must complete some ridiculous class project with a chosen partner. You can either actually do the work, or betray your partner so you both get a guaranteed C. Vladimir will tempt you with promises of wealth and a seat of power. This is a trick, and you must give in to unlock the bonus artwork. The game will have one of two endings at this point: You and Anne will pass Vladimir's gambit, and you'll recieve the ""Not Bronze Anymore"" lovers ending. The other ending has you sacrificing Anne to solidify your rise to power. Rakesh will enter at this point, stating there can be only two, a master and apprentice. This nets you the ""Whose Side Are You On?"" achievement right as he slides the cerimonial dagger into your chest.I would not recommend this game.			"

It keeps you invested because even after the fourth playthrough there are still things you haven't seen yet. Just be wary it's really easy to get into but a challenge to master... On. Easy. Mode. Then again I might just suck at stat building, but I don't even dare go to the higher difficulties because I can't even get enough stats on EASY to get the best endings!

												Thank goodness I did not get this at full price. I didn't spend much time playing the game because I just didn't feel like the plot was interesting at all. Therefore, there was no incentive for me to actually finish the story. The male protagonist, Max, seems so unlikeable, why they would make him the character you play, I don't know. What also surprises me is that they made this a game where you could play as both genders, not all dating simulators do that. Perhaps this is a reason why dating simulators choose to target one audience, because this game was too ambitious and believed that it could target both, and as a result its writing took a dive. Certainly, I did not spend much time in this, but with good reason. I could only enjoy this if I forced myself to, and I should not have to in the first place because there should be a reason for the reader to be interested (besides sexual innuendos and other methods used to compensate for writing skill). Oh, and did I mention Americans made this? There's a red flag right there, because not many Americans have been able to pull off works like this, and this certainly didn't either. If you want a dating simulator with a decent plot, try looking elsewhere. But if you want it that bad, chances are you will enjoy this.			"

												I was not really excited by the characters or writing. There isn't much of a plot aside from small talk. The game mechanics are pretty standard for these types of games and and just weren't enough to make up for the aforementioned shortcomings.			"

												As a college student, this is hands down the most relatable VN I've played in a long time. I'm so much like Anne it's crazy. (She even kind of looks like me.) I love this game. I love every WinterWolves game I've ever played.I LOVE the diversity of the cast. Roommates does a great job of representing different personalities, lifestyles, body types, races, and sexualities without coming across as judgemental.Most of the side characters are super cute (design and personality), and if they're not cute, they tend to be pretty realistic.I haven't played as Max yet, but I love that you have the option to choose between playing as a male or female character, and that you have male and female romance options for both.This is deffinatly one of my favorite games. I've spent way to many hours playing it, and I plan to spend way to many more playing it. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to invest a lot of time into really getting to know characters, and playing the game over and over and over again to get all the endings. This game might not be for you if you just want a quick cutesty little story.			"

												I've only played one route so far but I found the semi-realistic ending really unsatisfying. I play these games to feel giddy and silly. It may just be that one route but after working to get the 'prefect ending' I want the happily ever after. Or as the saying goes... happy endings depend on where you stop the story. I would have preferred it be left to my imagination. If the other routes are like this then I don't think it's a very fun game.edit: I looked into the other endings and found them just as 'realistic'.			"

												Roommates is a decent visual novel that's rough around the edges. The only faults of the game are minor things, but there's a lot of nit-picky things that add up. Here are a few:-Whenever you gain a relationship boost, it's always just -5 or +5, and it triggers this tune that eventually becomes annoying,-The music is fine, but there's not a lot of it.-Whenever it becomes time to make a decision, it isn't always clear what either decision means. I found myself having to backtrack because I would pick something and it would do something different than from what I wanted to do.-You can only backtrack (as in, go back to read previous lines) so far.-Lack of variety of art in relation to locations. There's two different points in the game in which the art for the location is recycled.Dispite the nickpicks, the game is quite enjoyable. It's no Katawa Shoujo, but it is worth the money. It's a simple (in a good way) game that has decent writing to it. I can confidently recommend it to anyone looking for another visual novel to add to their collection.			"

												An okay dating sim set in a nameless American college.You can play as either a bookworm girl or a budding rock-star boy; the game covers the first year of college, as these two get to know their four housemates and find romance.  The characters are all fine, and the stories are pretty good; I particularly appreciated that relationships progress at a believable pace.That being said, the time management aspect of the game feels unbalanced.  I liked having to balance studying and raising your other stats with resting.  But forcing players to make an explicit choice between resting and experiencing the plot seems like a bad decision.  Furthermore, some of the characters are effectively easier to romance than others, simply because of when you can do certain activities or take certain jobs.  That also affects the replayability of the game.  If you are playing as Max and want to romance Anne (a decision, by the way, which needs to be made in Week 1 if you have any hope of doing so successfully), you can only do jobs that raise the appropriate stats on three days each week, and there are only five time periods in which you can do leisure activities that she will appreciate.  And so, you do all of them--because you need every last one of those particular stat points you can get.  Really, then, the only interesing game play is what percentage of the time you study vs. rest--and there isn't a lot of depth there.It's not a bad game:  if you like Dating Sims (especially dating sims with non-traditional gender pairings), then you'll probably like this one.  Just don't expect greatness.			"

Also be sure to pick a romantic interest and stick with him or her - it's very easy to screw around and get the sadboy ending.			"

												Overall a pretty solid game with good writing. I spent my first play-through figuring out the wrong way of doing things. You don't have time to dally with multiple romance options at all - just focus on one and build the stats for that particular person. The stat building seems a little silly at times. You can level up stats to get better jobs and make more money, which is cool. But you also have minimum stats to get the romance scenes with whomever you're wooing. However, the stats don't really affect anything else that I've noticed. You don't have different abilities or options based on which stats you have. It would be cool if stats were a little more useful, since you spend a very large portion of the game focused on them.You have the option to skip events, which is useful once you know which events are applicable to the person you choose to pursue.  However, skipping a lot of events can result in breaking the plot a little bit. I managed to get through the beginning of the story without ever meeting Max's bandmate Memphis until he randomly showed up in my room (!!!) to start the Valentines shopping scene. Uhhh... so that was weird. I've only gotten the Anne x Rakesh ending at this point, but I'm wondering if this will be a trend. The ""Spring Break"" or halfway-point scene was a lot more steamy and interesting than the ""good"" ending. That said, I'm looking forward to replaying it with another romance option or even as the other protagonist (a really cool feature!). I would say that this game has significantly higher replay value than most dating sim / visual novel games that I have played in the past.			"

												The price tag may be a bit much for some(luckily I caught it on sale) but after playing through every route and getting all the endings I'd say it's still a great game with interesting characters who I wouldn't mind sharing a space with in college, the song is catchy and by now I know the lyrics, although after a while I can see it getting annoying as it is repetitive plus it loops when it plays. Since Max(the male character you can play) is in a band you'd think they'd put in more than one song but whatever it's not too big a deal since I found the story to be entertaining enough, all in all I'd say it's a solid 8/10 game and worth playing :)			"

												This was an ok game, there were things that weren't really explained and I wish there was, because I wouldn't have had to play through it again. I will explain what new players should know.First, make sure your energy stays above 70%, or you get depleted stat gains, which can effect end-game things.Make sure to get 600(total of the 2 stats combined) of the stats required for the girl/guy you want,Also, use the scroller on the mouse to reverse bad decisions, because the choices are confusing at times, and do not make sense.There is a TON of spelling/grammar mistakes, this drove me insane at times.Ths music in the background loops, over, and over, and over, and over, and over... and over. It get's annoying, so I'd recommend muting the background music after you listen to it for a bit.Over all, I'd give it a 8/10. And I do recommend the game if you can get it cheap. (50%-75% off)			"

												Is this game perfect?  No, not technically anyway.  But I don't care because I can't remember the last time a game like this has made me so damned happy.Beyond that, I honestly love every single one of the characters.  Even dull-witted obnoxious Max, spacy vegan Sally, stuck-up Dominic, and goofball Rakeesh (Anne and Isabella are great, and my favorite couple).  The game was probably a terrible dollar/hour value, but I don't care.  If you're harboring a secret (or not-so-secret) emotional side when it comes to these sorts of things, get this game NOW.Disclaimer:  I may have been slightly inebriated when writing this, but I'm practically tearing up nonetheless damn it!

												I'll say this up front, this game is not for anyone. If you're looking for deep characters or story, don't bother. However, if you're looking for some laughs and just some feel goods, then I highly recomend it.The characters are mainly stereotypical college students. You've got the studious bookworm Anne. The rocker/troublemaker Max. The tightwad dormrep Dominic. The sexy party girl Isabela. The artist Rakesh. and the ""friend of the earth"" Sally. And while they are mostly stereotypes, they do have just enough depth to keep them from getting annoying. Also, one bonus for this game, is that when/if you romance some one, the rest don't disappear. All through the game you are given MANY chances to interact with your roommates. However, if you don't like one of them, you can just skip their interactions. Also, all members of Latin House are romaceable, though not all at once. For both potential main characters has four romance options(yes that includes the other potential protag.)The gameplay, while having your traditional visual novel choice making, also has some stat. management where you plan out your character's week. In this you need to balance your grades, social life, and rest(kinda like the real thing). you also need to build certain stats associated with your chosen romance option. Each has two, a primary and a secondary. Get the stats to certain levels at certain checkpoints in the game and you get the full romance. Also, one thing that isn't completely explained in the game, is that both Anne and Max have a goal that they want to acheive by the end of the year. While the game does tell you when you need to start working towards it, you need to figure out the details on your own.As for the music, if you don't like the song in the trailer, either don't buy the game or play it on mute. Cause they play the song in the game alot. And the rest of the music is along the same lines.Hope this all helped/made sense.			"

												Cons:- Expensive- Story is too simple for my liking- Characters are not very complex- Max- Art style in some CGs is not aesthetically pleasing- Memphis is not a dateable character- Wasn't there some drama with Winter Wolves not paying their artists or not crediting the right people? Can't remember right now.Pros:- Investigation minigame with randomized results- Dominic- He's a dork- Literally Dominic- This is a western visual novel, if you're looking for complex stories and characters what are you even doing here go look at nitro+chiral or something			"

												This game was great, it really kept me entertained and some of the events were so ridiculous I had to take a few minutes to soak it in. One thing I wish for: Max x Dominic route. I was really happy with the Anne x Dominic route and I just wish Max had the same chance. I love those relationships that seem like they'd never work out but it's actually really cute when it does. :D			"

												The game to me is good. Although I've only played through one ending I've loved it. [SPOILERS]Although a scene that irked me but I couldv'e gotten over except for one scene early in the game was the ending between Max and Isabella was their ending. From a narrative perspective once I saw the scene where Isabella was talking about the boys she sees and the one she finally brings home to mama I thought they'd last. The ending I still kind of like but it just gets to me. It's still really good and I might someday get to the other endings.			"

												A great game, the fact that making your schedule doesnt interfere with events and that the events have consequences is a great way to make it feel interactive and believable. Each characters personality feels real and makes it genuinely hard who to decide to go after. There are differences between each girl or guy, but they are all extremely likable in their own ways. It has replayability that goes beyond more than following a different route. Overall a great game. It really helps that I was a l33tstreet fan before the game too. Its good to see what all those uploads were for.			"

												Overall a pretty solid game with good writing. I spent my first play-through figuring out the wrong way of doing things. You don't have time to dally with multiple romance options at all - just focus on one and build the stats for that particular person. The stat building seems a little silly at times. You can level up stats to get better jobs and make more money, which is cool. But you also have minimum stats to get the romance scenes with whomever you're wooing. However, the stats don't really affect anything else that I've noticed. You don't have different abilities or options based on which stats you have. It would be cool if stats were a little more useful, since you spend a very large portion of the game focused on them.You have the option to skip events, which is useful once you know which events are applicable to the person you choose to pursue.  However, skipping a lot of events can result in breaking the plot a little bit. I managed to get through the beginning of the story without ever meeting Max's bandmate Memphis until he randomly showed up in my room (!!!) to start the Valentines shopping scene. Uhhh... so that was weird. I've only gotten the Anne x Rakesh ending at this point, but I'm wondering if this will be a trend. The ""Spring Break"" or halfway-point scene was a lot more steamy and interesting than the ""good"" ending. That said, I'm looking forward to replaying it with another romance option or even as the other protagonist (a really cool feature!). I would say that this game has significantly higher replay value than most dating sim / visual novel games that I have played in the past.			"

												Lighthearted, funny, short, and not too complex once you figure out the weekly setup system. I replayed mutiple times trying to get the perfect ending. (Still barely missed but enjoyed every moment of it.)			"

												This game is actually a lot better than it looks.Pros:-Decent, well-paced writing without the overload of exposition that most VNs have-Queer romance options-Replayability-Intriguing characters-Genuinely challenging task systemCons:-Art is...well, just, meh. But it's presumably a very low-budget game, so that can be forgiven.-Annoying soundtrack. "

												I got this in a HumbleBundle pack, and it's the only one I've played out of the set. I regret nothing.My first playthrough, I chose Max; because I hated his character, I went with the idea that I'd make him smart and also change his entire life by making him get together with Sally, a spiritualistic Vegan. Then I realised there are homosexual choices and made the Anne x Isabella playthrough a reality.In serious though, the characters (for the most part) seem like relatable and well-thought out individuals who could well exist in the real world (my only exception to this would be Max, no one is that much of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. A few complaints:Why only Max and Anne? I would love to playthrough as Sally or Dominic!Why no Anne x Sally or Max x Dominic? Max and Dominic would especially have been an interesting story to live!There are only like 6/7 unique scenes in the game, everywhere else is just one you've seen before either inverted or exactly the same.MORE DRAWN OUT SCENES! It would have been nice to see some more of the characters' interactions drawn out.Positivities:A great beginner's VN/Date-sim, with the options to make the interactivity harder if you want to.Fairly deep characters, each with their own life-goals and aspirations.Funny and engaging dialogue.Replayability (gotta love 'em all).Pleasing artwork, it's actually really nice, despite it being often repeated.Should you buy it?Yes, it's a fun way to spend a few hours (looks at own playtime) uhh...Maybe wait until it's on sale, though. £20 here in the UK sounds a little too much.

												9/10I only played through Anne's perspective and went after Max so keep that in mind.Game Visual Quality:Overall this game is actually a very good dating sim. Coming from past Winter Wolves games, this is a huge step up in quality. While there is still grinding in terms of getting stats up to get the special ending as per all games made by this company, the quality of this game is much higher and very polished. The UI looks better and the music sounds better as well. PremiseYou're moving into a living area and are seeking personal growth. For Anne this is trying to be more social after living a sheltered life. You have 21 weeks to get two stats up to a total of over 600 to get the good ending. ConThis is my one complaint about the game and why I won't be replaying it to get the other endings. Even on easy mode you need to have good management of what you're doing week to week. To be honest, I can see making it hard onr hard or normal mode so you actually have to try on your first playthrough. But to still have it be a large in factor in easy mode when you're just trying to see the other endings is just annoying. Though honestly, this is my only problem with the game and I might return to play through other endings one day.SolutionIn the game a very underlooked at attribute is your energy, if it falls below 70% you have more of a chance of failing at activities so it's important you keep that up. This means sleeping in and taking naps and going to bed early a lot. Also it's amusing to note that studying on your own gives you a higher booste to grades than attending class... Reminds me of actual college. So as long as you keep your energy up you should be able to exceed the 600 points required but mind you I did this on easy mode, you might just make it on normal. This does feel like it needs rebalancing to be honest to be less grindy feeling but not that much extra effort.ProsNow for the good in this game, for once in a dating sim your own character experiences growth! Anne will grow to be more social and Max can be more studious, based on your own decisions while playing as them of course. There is a decently diverse group of people to court and it's really nice that the game includes same gender relationships. It's just something that in this day and age should be more normal in a dating sim.You'll have a few events during the week that you can either skip and gain energy or play and raise relationships with other characters. Skipping is a good way to regain energy if the event doesn't relate to the character you're trying to woo. Of course at the end if you never help the other characters you won't see what happens to them at the end but hey, they're not the one you're trying to date!Pros Cont.Okay one major thing in dating sims is well the lack of taking it all the way in relationships. I mean, I'm not in it for that but still, it makes things feel more real when you sleep with the character you're dating. This game does this right. Mid game if you've wooed your chosen character enough you can sleep with them. Then through the rest of the school year they'll give you small events where it's almost said that you slept together again. The ending scenes that are final are usually character resolution ones so any conflict a character faced is solved. It's a very good way to pace the game and gives a sense of completion and a level of realness. Oh and you also get nice drawings of half naked characters but ya know... that's just uhm.. it's a nice ""touch"".ConclusionThe writing in this game is great and the interactions between housemates feels real. Aside from the grindyness of getting points in your skills/traits for your bae, its an amazing experience. I would highly reccomend getting this game. If they ever rebalance the point system I would totally give this game a full 10/10. "

Fantastic game, definitely recommend playing.I'd have to say that this is definitely one of the more polished Ren'py Visual novels I've seen, while avoiding generic fap-bait character. It is a game with sex appeal that doesn't rely on sex appeal to sell. (Serious, dat Max/Rakesh scene, mmmmmm)There are a lot of events that cross over between the two characters, Max and Anne, and there are a few weird gender pronouns around the place, I presume due to the two characters sharing certain bits of dialog between their routes.Also, Rakesh and Max are super cute, though ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IS THAT ROUTE HARD TO STAY ON!Would have liked to see some exclusively gay characters, though it was great to see a game that actually has both a bi character (mmmm, Rakesh) and a pan character (mmmm, Isabella).The soundtrack is pretty great, and there is a lot of humor in the game, there had been several moments when I laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off.And it is an easy game to unlock achievements too, if you are a completionist.
