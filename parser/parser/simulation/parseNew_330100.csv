Early Access Review
								The game I have wanted all my childhood. Spaceship building with parts salvaged from other ships is a perfect mechanic in this game, and the objectives and combat feel fantastic. Controls are fully rebindable, and there are multiple different controlling modes (mouse, arrow keys, etc.). Developer is extremely responsive to community and is always talking advice, even going as far as having in game surveys on controversial additions and decisions. The main gamemode is to explore a randomly generated galaxy, but there are other gamemodes such as a deathmatch, endless mode, and hopefully an upcoming campaign. Completely worth the asking price!

												If you're into the ""Build a ship"" or ""Min-max"" style games, BossConstructor is one of those under the radar, hidden indie gems on steam.The game offers multiple seperate game modes, from quick skirmish matches to longer campaigns. It even has a seperate competitive mode using some specific predefinded missions- of which (<----This guy) currently sits on top of all of them ;P Come get me. (Currently under contest- nice Frice)Customizing your ship is done via an overhead, top down, 2d plane style set-up.Parts are added in line to one another, no overlapping/stacking like in Battleships forever, though there are parts which move that allow some more complicated builds for those interested in such.It has good selection of parts which unlock either via a discovery system or, a fast unlock-all option for looking to jump right in and get to building.Also, this game has one of the best Dev's a community could ever ask for- he's quick to reply on forums, fast to address bugs and puts an honest ear to feedback.Buy the game, if you dont like the genre: buy it anyway and gift it to a friend who does-			"

												The game has some neat ideas but lacks polishing. Issues range from developer not thinking (e.g. you cannot quit from hangar menu without first placing down a command center, whereas any other application like Word will allow you to quit without saving), to crashes (genetic algorith drops to 1FPS by the 3rd generation and then crashes) as well as minor annoyances (e.g. the ship in the hanger keeps moving when you use the mouse to move parts around, and the battle camera is so useless that you need to keep one hand on the mouse to keep adjusting the camera unless you enjoy flying blind).All of that could be fixed, but only time will tell. In it's present state, it is very hard to recommend.			"

A game about building ships and inevitably watching them blow up. BossConstructor is a top-down space flight/combat game with a focus on building your own ships. It recently released from Early Access and it’s developed by German developer Mirko Seithe. In BossConstructor (BC) you build (or download) ships which can then be used in several different game modes. Exploration Mode (effectively the game’s story mode) sees you face off against the von-Neumann, an advanced AI species that are trying to conquer the galaxy. The other modes are: a survival mode where you face-off against waves of enemies, a skirmish mode where you form teams of ships to attack each other, a mode where you watch AI attack each other and a randomized sector mode where you use your current ship to take on a single, randomly-generated sector filled with random enemies. Since everything is based around the game’s ship construction, I’ll start there. Confined to a 14x14 grid (doesn’t sound like much but it’s plenty of space), building your ship is often a case of putting the right piece in the right place. Particularly in the case of Exploration Mode, where you start with a basic ship as well as a small pack of pieces (the pieces you get depend on the pack you choose). I’ve played around with all of the default ships and pack options in Exploration mode and no matter which ones you choose, if you build a bad ship, you’re gonna have a tough time. You can also use the Hangar to edit/build entirely new ships which will then be available to use in all of the modes including Exploration (building something good will make the game easier).In Exploration Mode, you move between sectors (levels) in the galaxy, the further you get the harder it becomes. Each sector has a primary & secondary objective as well at least one enemy for you to fight (the higher the difficulty you choose at the beginning and the difficulty of the individual sector, the harder the enemies will be). As far as I’ve seen the normal difficulty levels (the easiest) only ever have one enemy that you’ll need to face off against as long as you don’t have an objective such as destroy a mining ship. Again dependent on your chosen difficulty level, when you destroy an enemy ship’s module (for example a missile launcher or an armor piece) it has a certain chance of dropping so you can pick it up. There’s also a chance for pieces blown off of your ship to be recoverable. You can also trade with the factions you meet over the course of the game for other modules. Back on the main menu you can find a tech-tree type thing which displays all of the modules in the games and shows the specific ones you’ve collected previously.The other way to acquire modules is through trading for them. Some sectors feature different structures (friendly so long as you’re on good terms with the faction) and one example of these structures is a Module Trader. Flying over to it and staying there for a few seconds opens up a menu where you can buy and sell modules. It’s worth mentioning that since your ship can’t be edited while you’re in a sector, you also cannot sell modules that are currently in use. The credits you’ll need to buy new modules can of course be earnt by selling modules you don’t need but you also earn credits for completing a sector. Completing a sector’s secondary objective, collecting new modules and not losing any modules will increase the amount earnt. One of the other structures you’ll come across is a tech lab station. These are featured in one of the game’s possible secondary objectives that tasks you with moving asteroids around and you can also pay them to upgrade modules you have in your inventory. This brings me nicely to the first of my two main issues with the game. There’s not a huge amount of mission variation. I think I’ve seen around ten different missions, most of which can appear as either a primary or secondary objective. Missions range from collecting rescue capsules and collecting ore to destroying enemy mining vessels or clearing a sector of enemies. The lack of mission variety isn’t a big enough issue to completely write off the game or anything like that but considering the fact that Exploration Mode is based around a lot of starting over (if you suck at the game like I do, anyway) then I think it would definitely benefit the game to have some more variety.My other issue with the game is how getting a couple of modules shot off is regularly game ending. To some extent, it’s the player’s responsibility to build an effective ship. However, if you collide with a ship and the thrusters on your left side get torn off, your ship becomes a super hi-tech spinning top and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it (unless you get rid of the right ones too and become a sitting duck). Most of the times I ended a run, it wasn’t because I got destroyed, it was because I had to quit due to my ship being unflyable. There is a repair bot module which repairs your ship using credits but you probably won’t see that early on. Since I actually quite like not being able to edit your ship mid-sector, I would suggest that having the ability to move modules around would work quite nicely as a middle-ground. This would allow you to move remaining parts to different positions and while it wouldn’t completely address the issue I think it certainly would have saved me from quitting a fair few times. To wrap things up, I’ll talk about bugs and controls. First up, bugs. I’ve seen a few reviews complaining about getting lots of issues with crashes and bugs. Thankfully, I haven’t had any issues with my time playing BossConstructor, of course that doesn’t mean you won’t but I don’t think this is really an issue. Now controls. One of the things I like about BossConstructor is it automatically assigns controls for movement, weapons etc. for you when you build a ship. You can also edit the default bindings as well as add your own bindings for different actions. On the subject of controls, it is worth mentioning that they can feel quite clunky but from my experience this is more due to the game’s fairly realistic physics effecting your ship rather than an issue with controls. A bulky ship with poorly placed thrusters is always going to turn and move slowly. VerdictBossContructor’s heavy emphasis on designing effective ships may be off-putting for some but if you enjoy similar games then this will be a worthy addition to your library. However, if you’re unsure about the game then I'd recommend holding off until it hits a sale.Lone Ranger Reviews.El K.			"

Early Access Review
Note: This game has been provided to me for free for review purposesOverviewBoss Constructor is a very unique and aspiring space game, where you build your own ship from modules, go on missions, explore galaxies and so on. It's an Alpha game, and I am amazed how well this game is being developed. It is packed with features, ideas, and it even has an in-build survey in the main menu so you can give your two cents on what should be changed, and when. Let's get into it!The Pros:Truly a Sandbox - You don't need to follow a storyline, there are a dozen of game modes available, you can make and edit as many ships as you like, and the ship creation is very configurable! Except modules you have to research to unlock, everything in the game is available to you from minute 1!UI OPTIONS!! - Wherever you go and can edit stuff, there is an accompanying right hand side menu with a lot of little buttons, toggles, and sliders. Everything is very detailed and really gives you the impression that you are in ultimate control.Interesting Gamemodes - From the expected Randomly Generate Galaxy you must explore, we can go to other (fully scenario customisable) modes such as Huge Space Battle or AI Simulation and even Evolution!. Yup, you can sit and watch as the game simulates natural selection on your starting ship and calculates a numerous series of descendants! Take my word for it, there are many things to do when bored!Update schedule - The game has very consistent and regularly released updates, all based on the survey you can complete in the main menu.The Cons:Hard Controls - The ship operation is very difficult, in my opinion. Ship handling is hard, and lining up correctly to shoot an enemy is even more so. I wouldn't mind it that much, but it sort of distracts me from the other gameplay elements more that I'd like.Graphics - I know this is an alpha indie game, so I won't be too harsh, the graphics are okay, but need a serious overhaul before I would accept them as ""final"" version worthy. The UI could use a redesign as well. These are on the list of the dev, so we'll see how it turns out!ConclusionThis is the most customizable space game I ever played before, and the constant updates really build up my confidence in the final release. For you, the player, as with all early access titles, I tell you this: Buy only if you wish to support development! The current game lacks many features that are about to be added, could be buggy at times and so on. However, I can vouch for the quality of the updates, and I would put my money on the official release! If you like space games, building games, and simulation games all at once, this is a good choice for you!If you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												I will 100% revise my recommendation when this game becomes less buggy. Everything else about it is decent (not amazing, but it has plenty of fun moments). I think I've put enough time into it to say I've given it a more-than-fair shot.- Crashes often, for no particular reason. And that's just in normal gameplay, as opposed to the evolution mode where it will consistently crash within the first 10 generations, and most likely much sooner.- Gets stuck on some screens in certain situations (notably, it can't get out of the ship design screen without a command center module, and it's entirely possible to remove some types of command center completely without them reappearing in your inventory, meaning you have to force-quit the game entirely)- Other, smaller stuff, like the fact that you can get a mission to protect a ship, do your damnedest to blow it up yourself and let the enemies do the same, and still succeed in keeping it alive for the requisite amount of time despite your best efforts. Or the camera often centering itself in completely nonsensical places when it's zoomed in. Little weird things like that, irritating things that should have been fixed.Fix it, guys, and I'll be right back to playing it. As it is, I've been firing it up for a short bit every bug fix or patch to see if my issues have cleared up. But my major complaints are still the same as they've been for months now.			"

								Start with a tiny little corvette then pillage and plunder your way to the mightiest battlecruiser you can design/build! It's similar to FTL where by each component can be damaged/destroyed to remove a capability but in this game you physical control the ship! Brilliant fun and dangerously addictive!!Even as a Beta it has plenty of things to do!			"

								As the title suggests this game is focused on construction, could easily spend hours completely customizing your ships in a very lego-like manner. Physics of space play a large role but after tinkering around for a while it's easy to grasp the basic concepts. Only left up to your imagination what you come up with.

Early access doesn't contain the singleplayer story, but there are randomized galaxies and expedition modes which are a bunch of fun alone. Basically you fly around the galaxies clearing out each sector, picking up new items from enemies destroyed, black holes and space anomalies in general. Completing a sector will give you the ability to use the collected pieces to repair/upgrade/enhance your spaceships.Should provide many hours of fun for fans of exploration/construction games. Can't wait to see how the full storymode plays out. :)			"

This is one of those games where you instinctively know you are in for a treat. And boy is it a treat. Boss Constructor is a game about building and flying your own spaceships. The core feature of the game is its editor which allows you to assemble your own ships based on a number of components. At first glance this concept might look confusing and hard but it's as easy as lego bricks to master. A superb game - Highly Recommended!			"

Early Access Review
								Out of all the games I've gotten on Steam so far, this is the first one I've felt like writing a review for, mainly because I see a lot of potential in this one and hope for it to succeed. So keep in mind this is my first review and it is for an Early Access game.Starting OffThis game is a sandbox through and through, focusing obviously on the construction of a customized ship and then allowing you to test it out within various game modes from a full campaign of sorts where you establish yourself with different factions that each have their focus on research types, a survival mode, random missions and more to come I am sure. Sure, there is no story, save a generic themed enemy that apparently is a threat for some reason, but let's admit that isn't what people play sandbox games for.There is already plenty of modules for making the ship function the way you like to play. Want a gunship? Make it happen. Want a ship that has more versatility in tools and tech? Do it. However, at the current point in the game, it feels like there is very limited uses for many of the different techs already available, and in time I hope to see more reasons and uses for it all.Graphically speaking, it's nothing impressive, but there's plenty of particle effects to keep things flashy enough to keep my attention. I still get the inner satisfaction when I destroy enemy ships to say the least, and the effects of the weapons and other modules feels appropriate for what they are/do. The music does its job at setting the feel for the missions and stuff, but tends to get a little repetitive after awhile and I have begun muting the music to play my own during my long sit down sessions with this game (three in total so far).Positives Exceptional Ship Customization Basic, But Helpful Tutorial (With exception of the negative below) Fully Rebindable Controls & Controller Support A Developer Who Appears Interested In Feedback Numerous Modes of Play With Challenge For AllNegatives Rebindable Controls Do Not Fix Difficult Maneuvering Moderate Learning Curve (Knowing which faction to help in the procedurally generated galaxy, and how it applies to your research is something I am still figuring out... could be helpful to explain that in the tutorial.)Neutral Factors (Things I believe will probably get better as development continues) Limited Mission Variety (Currently they could get repetitive for those who prefer variations) Few Reasons to Use Specific Module Types (This might be a personal preference thing) Occasional Bugs (To be expected with Early Access) More Control Options than Buttons on Controllers (I am sure the expected interface with the game is via keyboard and mouse, but the use of a controller is a very nice option when wanting to play casually, and it feels limited when you have to choose what abilities you want to have access to if using the controller.)AssessmentOverall this is a very entertaining experience for me, as I keep spending time trying to tweak my ships to be more streamlined, or trying to upgrade my modules. For an Early Access title, this one is one of few I have felt is worth the asking price, though I happened to find it on sale and became my replacement for another game since I can't play (and have chosen not to) Galactic Civilizations 3. With the level of customization, replayability due to a variety of game types, and the fact that the developer seems to be actively engaged with the playing community and offering frequent updates, I suggest you take a look at this game if it happens to be your cup of tea. Being still in development, it has plenty of potential to become a gem in my library.Personal Verdict 8.5 / 10 "

Early Access Review
 BossConstructor DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.BossConstructor is sort of a 2D spaceship simulator/builder with RPG elements. It reminds me a bit of the old school game; ""Asteroids"", as well as other 2D space shooters. The game has you in control of a ship that you can modify and re-build to your liking. You get different ship parts from completing tasks as well as defeating enemies. You can harvest ore from asteroids, trade, make allies with different factions, and much more. There's quite a lot to do in the game. In addition to this, there's a few different game modes to keep you entertained if you've had too much of one thing. Exploration mode is mostly what I'll be covering the most of, though there's an endless mode where you fight waves of enemies, mission mode where you can choose different challenges to complete, an evolution mode which which deals mostly with AI and their progression, and a skirmish mode which has the user define it's settings. In exploration mode, where I feel the most of the game's depth is, you jump from sector to sector (""FTL"" Style) and have to complete different objectives in that area, there are also random events that can occur. You can also stop in at different outposts and upgrade your ship parts. -------- Graphics: 7 / 10  The graphic style is just fine. The default ship designs are nice, and really, whatever you want your ship to look like, that's up too you, as it's very customizable. The user-interface is laid out nicely, nothing is too cluttered and the menus are easy to read and navigate through. Of course the game has the standard space theme and objects/models to go with it. The combat animations are nice, as well as the battle effects. The backdrops during combat are usually different and are quite beautiful to look at, but not distracting to the point where it interrupts your gameplay.  Although the visuals are somewhat generic, they get the job done while looking very nice in the process. The game has quite a bit of resolutions and  graphical settings, so it should run fine on almost any graphics card and CPU. It's a 2D space shooter, and doesn't demand that much to run. -------- Sound: 7 / 10 The sound assets of the game are delivered nicely, and at the right time. They don't become annoying or repetitive, as most of the combat noises are different from each other. The game has very satisfying explosions and attack sounds, even when you're the one being destroyed. The background music is decent, it's not something I found engaging or interesting. It was very generic ambient space music and sounds, though it worked well and fit with the motif of the game. -------- Mechanics: 9 / 10 The game mechanics are really solid. After going through the tutorial, you can understand how the game works as well as how to play. Your ship's core is a command center module/piece. Designing your ship is almost like doing a jigsaw puzzle. You add other modules/pieces to the command center, and then more pieces to THOSE pieces, and so on and so on. Each piece does something different like shoots fireballs, or thrusts the ship in a certain way. There are of course shield pieces, pieces that store or generate energy, and some that store ore. Some pieces have an energy cost (or production) value. Your ship, depending on the pieces, need a certain amount of energy to function. Firing off different weapons also consume energy. Pieces have costs, a value that's assigned to each piece that determines the overall ship value. Though in some parts or modes of the game, you have a certain cost/ship value that you must meet or stay below. Pieces also have a weight assigned, and depending on the weight, the ship can move faster or slower. Position of thrusters also matter, as you need them in-front to break, and in the rear to obviously make it you go forward. Though putting thrusters on the sides or stacking them close to each-other can help you fine tune your turns, and leave you with more accuracy. Combat is like any other asteroid-like game, you move and float around trying to attack enemies or complete objectives. Every ship-piece has hit-points, and physically get destroyed in combat when the hit-points are depleted. This doesn't mean your ship is destroyed when a piece is gone. You keep fighting until your command center is destroyed. You're given a universe map, and can make ""jumps"" to different sections, and then jumps from THOSE sections, and so on. When you hover over these sections, it tells you what missions are available (you usually have a primary and secondary mission), how many enemies are there, and any other details like if there's a outpost or an event. There's a variety of missions such as eliminating enemies, moving asteroids, collecting ore, and more.--------  Final Personal Remarks: The game is a lot of fun, and it has a lot of potential. There's a lot more updates coming to this game, however me being me, I find the game very difficult. It's hard to control the ships even when you understand how controlling the ships work. The enemies are hard to kill especially if your ship loses it's guns/cannons. I do like the game, but it's not the type of genre I enjoy, though it IS starting to grow on me. Thanks to the devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.			"

												I'm going to recommend this game.It's flawed and has some very frustruting moments (seemingly random CTDs).So far this code has caused me issues with crashes and getting it to run in the 1st place had me resetting my system a few times, but you know what? None of that matters.It's a really simple game with really simple ideas and implementations. It's a slow shoot-em up with design and upgrades and actual tactics when you start to get into '1 hit kill you' territory with NG+'sI've put in whatever hours are up there - I think 250ish. That's value enough. But I think I'll come back to this one from time to time - it's really good fun despite the horrid 1st impressions trying to get fullscreen at 1080p on dual monitors.I'm an old skool arcade shoot'em up fan btw if that matters.

								What a Fantastic game!   If this seems like the sort of game you might be interested in I would highly suggest you pick it up.Still in Early Access but CONSTANTLY updated, every time I log into Steam there seems to be a small patch tweaking/fixing things and then every Sunday for a while now there is the content patch from the Sunday twitch coding session the developer does.   One of the problems with early access is you are not sure if the game is going to ever be finished or updated at all.  The amount of features in this game constantly grows with the dedicated developer and is well worth it!Can't recommend enough, but I can try!			"

								Awesome and Incredibly addictive little game. Lots of fun and potential in it for any dignified space shooting ship assembling geekster fan (like me self). For an Early Access game I have to say it's very well executed. Every thing runs smoothly and properly and apart from some labels and feedbak info still missing here and there it is apparent that a lot of care was put into it. It's a lot of fun assembling the amorphous ships and testing them in the 'field' and the set of parts available is quite enjoyable. It should be a very decent and wide scoped game once it leaves alpha/beta stage and comes out into a full fledged game. As of now, even while in Early Access, it is already very playable and worth every cent (and surely hours of fun).			"

Early Access Review
								If you're on the fence trying to decide whether or not to buy this game, I say go for it!When I came across this game, and I watched the video and looked at the screenshots and I thought ""MEH"".I would have passed it over, but at the time the game had a 100% rating on Steam. I figured OK, statistically speaking the reviews can't all be from friends and family. The game was on sale at the time so I took a chance. Am I ever glad I did! I've been playing the game for over a week. Steam says I've logged almost 30 hours in that time... how is that possible?! I work 2 jobs! But then I do the math and yeah... I think I've been playing the game too much.So why is the game so much fun? Weapons feel great!  They have weight. I love the way my lasers rip into the hulls of enemy vessels. Missiles, torpedoes, they all FEEL good. Customizability. My battleship has like, 10 different action keys. One to fire lasers, one to fire long range weapons, one to launch my interceptors, one to open/close the main torpedo ports, one to fire the torpedoes, one for emergency hyperspace, etc etc. I sometimes get the keys mixed up and I accidentally hyperspace into an enemy ship when I was trying to turn on the emergency generator. I should really move that keybind to somewhere else. Battles are intense. No matter how awesome your ship gets, you still need to keep your eyes on the smaller enemy ships because they can still hurt you. Constant updates! The developer updated the game at least twice in the week I've had the game.Still, the game isn't perfect: It's Early Access. The game is a work-in-progress, but I've had no crashes except on the first day (but that was because the dev was working on the game). But there is a TON of content. Ships look... not quite like starships. Because it's kinda like lego. If you stick weapon modules onto a drive module and add some ore container boxes... well it's not gonna look pretty. Still, you can build some pretty respectable looking starships. But alot of times your ship is going to look like you just crazy-glued a bunch of ship parts together. Beware my garbage scow! AI isn't perfect. The AI is good enough to put up a decent fight most of the time. But then for no reason it'll hyperspace into an asteroid.

Early Access Review
								Bossconstuctor is a unique game, catering to a relatively specific niche in games that hasn't really been touched by very many developers until recently. (2 flash games, and 6 other games share similar characteristics, as far as I know.) That niche being the ability to create a ship of your design, lego-style, using a (currently) small cache of parts.From the start, there is a level of polish which is sufficient to make this game simply look better than anything people might tout as ""crap, weak, waste of money"" which I can assure you it's not. Currently, you are able to design and build a ship or fleet of ships with which to shower your rain of destruction.There is a story mode which has, in recent patches, reflected the difficulty settings much better, where the harder modes not only include more larger enemies, but makes them a bit smarter too. It takes anywhere from 1-4 hours to complete an exploration, and now there is a save feature in case you can't do it in one sitting!A unique aspect to this game is the evolution pool. This is where you can sit back and watch the computer fight itself, learn from itself, and make its ships better. There could be some improvement here, as with any random generation environment, it takes time to see real results.Eventually, I'd like to see mirko add something of a large open ecosystem you can journey through rather than small world points you have to jump to, thus combining two aspects of the game. However, the game is still early access, and as such has plenty of time to improve! :DTL,DR:Design your own spaceship, fly it around, kill things, take their parts, and attach them to yourself. Also watch the computer kill itself. Also missions. And a storyline. More stuff pls!			"

								GOOD:+ building my own ships in non-explore mode, improvising, trying them out in fun dog fights+ in explore mode: improvising small ships with limited resources. Strong loot motivation to collect modules shot down enemy ships!+ big variety of enemy ships, also a small space station, ship-factory, mine fields. Even automated evolution of enemy ships. (don't know whether this is used in explore mode though)+ custom key binding. And very clever auto-combination of which thruster is fired for which movement direction (can be overriden) no matter how you build your ship. (limited use for assymetric ships though)+ during the last 2 months: new patches keep coming. Developer's response to bugs and feature whishes very impressive.+ meaningful limitations to concentrate on the important parts: a) 2D, not 3D; b) limited maximum ship speed; c) ships get slower pretty fast if thrusters are not fired; d) battle field is not too bigBAD:- for me, nothing. Of course I miss many things, but this is early access, the game is not finished yet. Still fun to play!			"

								BossConstructor is a game about building and flying your own spaceship from point ""A"" (start) to ""B"" (end). There are a number of paths available via nodes, once completed you can travel through the node, you gain components, parts and materials by destroying ships, bosses and structures. You can only construct and refit your ship outside of nodes, so think before you leap as a emp is pointless against a spacestation. Each attempt will be different.There will be many attempts. youtube playlist : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHYbNVicUJv4FMPBUKcy0rMwQmZPYsB8G  note This game is actually built by the Dev listening to players. > suggest an idea and if worthy your idea will be posted on a voting list.> Each patch gives players a choice of voting for the next module implemented. > Get your idea ingame gets your name ingame.

												Had this on my radar for quite some time and always was put off by the negative reviews about how the ships handle. Because if one thing puts me off its weird controls. But the ships handle perfectly. Change the position of your engine modules and you end up with a different beast. The possibilities in this game are astonishing. Build a replicator ship that spawns carriers who spawn fighters? No problem. Build a melee ship that has triggerable moving spikes to punch out your enemies? No problem. Build a ship that grabs asteroids to hurl them at your victims? No problem (to be fair i haven't build this one but in theory it is possible).This game puts AAA to shame has free content patches and bugs are fixed on a regular basis.			"

								This game is quite unique and a very interesting style of game play.I am very much enjoying playing this game and I'm sure that it will keep me playing for quite some time to come.  I congratulate the developer on the direction that he is taking this game and recommend it to anyone who loves to build and fiddle with bits and pieces to create an interesting toy to play with.The dev is continually updating the game and offerring us more playthings.  He responds readily to comments and is most helpful.  All of his updates so far have been good ones.My only complaint is that at this time it is lacking a manual to give the beginner some undertanding of how the variousl components of the game system work.  However with some experimentation it has finally fallen into place and the further that I understand it, the better it gets.It is worth the price when compring it to some of my recent purchases online.  You should enjoy it.			"

												This game is a fun top down space ship shooter. You can build your vessel from the ground up with modules you collect from winning battles. There are a wide range of modules that suit all play styles. You can design fast, slow, ranged, close-quarters, shielded, stealth, mine-layer, carriers, drones etc.There is a campaign which I guess is what most people play and it it challenging at the start but less so towards the end. Like most games, once you beat the technology curve the missions are still fun, but the outcome is pretty much predictable.This is a single player game so the AI needs to be smart - and it is. It's not perfect but it's effective, considering the AI needs to control any ship of any design so none of it can be scripted. There is an evolution mode where you don't play but watch AI ships fight each other. Winners will evolve into a new ship. You can watch generaton after generation evolve. Strictly for fun, science and interests sake but you can get some very interesting designs if you leave this sim running for a while. Also makes a great display/screen saver.  :)The developer is active and responsive to bugs. New content is being added post-release so the dev is supporting the customer base. There are one or two minor useability issues that I think have been outstanding for a long time that are yet to be addressed but that's not enough reason to avoid this game.I was reluctant to by a single-player top-down shooter but the way you can design a ship from the ground up and blast away at the AI is simply rewarding.  :) "

								Great little spaceship fighting & building game that basically gets as simple or as complicated as you want it to be.You start of with a small spaceship to explore the galaxy and fight baddies, whereby each destroyed enemy has a chance to drop spaceshipparts which you can then add to your own ship and thereby, slowly and steadily, transform your little spaceship fighter into a mighty battlecruiser.There are lots of options for designing your spaceship. If you like it simple, put weapons at the front, solarpanels in the middle, armor on the sides and thrusters at the back and your done.If you like it complicated you can create an ever transforming monster of doom by using pistons and pivots to expand/retract or rotate certain parts of your ship, podracer-like-spaceships consisting of multiple parts only held together by energy-chains, or add replicators to your spaceship, which allow you to build an army of smaller, AI-controlled spaceships that you can also design.And wait there is more!This game also features interesting challenging modes where you can compete on the leaderboard for the fastest / most dangerous / most clever designs to complete the given task.And there is also an evolution mode where you can watch AI ships battle it out in a darwinistic ""survival of the fittest"" setting, where only the strongest spaceship makes it to the next round. If you ever wanted to watch how an innocent little spaceship with a small missilelauncher evolves into a beast of a bazillion guns in order to stand against its mutated bretheren, THIS is the game mode for you!All in all, really great little game so far, even though it is still in beta.10 / 10I just wish I didn't have to push stupid asteroids around in order for the lab people to like me, but hey, such is life in boss constructor.

								In a word... Impressed.Solid Concept. Well executed. In many ways it reminds me of the original Star Control... the classic that started this genreYou will also recognize some SPaZ concepts mixed in.BossConstructor is what the name implies... You begin with a very basic ship. As you fight enemies and finish missions, you acquire new parts. Adding those parts increases the power and strength of your vessel. The end goal is building up a ""Boss"" ship that is capable of taking on the AI Bosses and the invaders.For those who haven't played games like Star Control, SPaZ, and the like, you might find the in-space physics alittle challenging, at first. Gravity, inertia, solar winds, etc are present. (Your ship will not immediately stop when you release the thrusters.) Making contact with asteroids and other ships results in damage to your own...Balancing your build is important too. Every part you add increases one spec and decreases another. (Plus, adding any mass to the ship always decreases Speed & Maneuverability.)Examples:Adding Engines = + Speed & Maneuverability = Increased Energy Drain & Increased MassAdding Weapons = + Firepower & Defense = Increased Energy Drain & Increased MassAdding Solar Panels = + Energy & Capacity = Increased Ship Size & Increased Massetc, etc....Component Placement also plays a role in maneuverability, speed, & survivability...Place your Command Center in the middle of your build. It is the key to your whole ship. When it is destroyed, so are you. There are no second chances, this is a 1-life, insta-death game. -->You die = Game Over.<--Straight-forward:-Ship building/customizing -Combat-Missions-GoalsNeeds Tuning:-IU (no component mirroring button, etc)-More components (Limited choices, needs some better defensive parts)-Early Mission Balancing (first couple missions when ship is very weak)-Ship Testing Map in Builder Menu (needs a couple enemies that shoot back)This review may change here and there as I get more gametime in, additions are made, etc.All things considered, this is a solid game with a solid developer... And worth your time/money.			"

												BossConstructor is a pretty good game for those looking for a ship building/top down shooter. At the current time, I've only tried exploration mode which consists of several dozen mini space battle areas, structured in a story line format. Ship parts are colllected throughout your journey and can be added to your ship, as well as unlocking them for your account. With a good amount of choices for parts and about a dozen or two different qualities for each part, the level of customization is vast. Adding to the part variaty, there is also full key binding customization so you can assign numerous different weapons to different keys to be more strategic with energy use or assign them all to one button to unleash a devastating full barage. That being said, there are some down sides that exist. For one there are constant game crashes between loading screens which can be quite annoying. This problem is greatly alleviated by the autosave frequency which ensures that after a crash, I can easily relaunch and pick up exactly where I was. This could easily be fixed in future patches.Second issue that I've found is that the ships controls can become slightly annoying when an engine is damaged or if your ship isn't completely symmetrical leading to vearing to one side. This can be seen as part of the challenge of the game but it can get a little annoying when half my ship is blown up from a fight and I have to navigate to the end of a level with only one engine located on the right side of the ship. Going stright when your only able to make left turns isn't the least stressful thing. I will say that the sense of accomplishment was pretty nice when I finnaly did make it though.Based on what I've seen so far and what I haven't even tried out yet, I don't see how anyone with less than atleast a few hours of gameplay could give an informed enough review. It's a fun game that has some room for improvement, and based on what I've seen the creators really want to keep improving the game.			"

												This game is fine for casual fun, but it lacks the depth for any kind of extended play.  For a game about constructing ships, you'll lose any real choice in the appearance of your ship as you try to squeeze as many weapons on the front of your ship as possible without obstructing their firing arcs.

												It's rare these days to find a game that can hold my attention for a few days. Bossconstructor managed that and then some. This top down space shooter is more than meets the eye.Design your own ships, use your own imagination and come up with terrifying ships. Then take them into story mode or other challenges. You can be fast and aggressive, rely on speed and firepower, or you can be sneaky with cloaking and ranged weapons. You can be kiting with ranged weapons as well, or even just ram your opponent. You can be a turtling carrier or even your own factory, and send out your AI ships to defeat the enemy.As long as you are having fun with the ship, it's a good design. I like how the developer allows the players to find their own style, and play the game their way. There is little handholding and ""overprotective"" balancing here. I applaud that, the game is better for it, and most importantly, it's FUN.Pros:Fun GameplayDesign your own shipsRoom for lots of creativity in ship designsGreat Dev SupportChallenges, leaderboards and different game modesCons:Story Mode could be fleshed out moreA bug/crash here and there			"

												While this game in itself would be interesting to anybody who like space and building games, the repetitiveness of missions (which basically end up ALL being the same with only very minor differences) coupled with the fact that most enemies are just downright the same (again with only minor differences) force me to down rate this game. There is just not enough of anything to warrant a good rating here.The gameplay of this game can very easily be summed up by: struggle way too hard at the early game, get good stuff and then every mission is a breeze. Every single mission is either way too hard or way too easy with extremely little middle ground.I would only recomment it to someone who is very into this genre and is willing to try something new without minding ending up disapointed.Edit: Oh, and I was mistaken in thinking that I had procured this game at under 10$. I would have been happy at that price but since I paid the full 17$ I just have to mention that I feel outright cheated. One of the worst game fun/value ratio I played in a while.			"

												BossConstructor is this weird mish mash of different ideas that probably shouldn’t work together but come together beautifully. You explore the world map in a system by system, fighting your way accross the galaxy salvaging parts to create a bigger and better ship to fight an existential threat to the galaxy One of the things that stood out for me when I was playing BossConstructor is that the game was clearly a labour of love by the developer. It was dripping in character, it was dripping in attention to detail and it was well put together despite it's flaws, I found myself loving the game. But I can't really adequately explain why I found it so engaging.Perhaps it was the roguelike starting conditions, where you choose from a few options that dictate the pace how you approach first the missions. On the other hand it could have been the sandbox nature of this odd little game, letting you choose your path and how you approach each challenge put before you or whether even to do that challenge at all. It could even have been something as simple as being able to share my ships through the steam Workshop, aswell as use my friends and other people's ships to test out ideas and learn how the game's systems work. Maybe it was the storyline, which despite the occasional flaw, drew me in but didn't bog me down in exposition. It was just there, like a sprinkling backdrop of space opera. It, it could even have been just the simple exploration, salvaging, and construction gameplay loop where you take down enemies for new parts and you start out in a little tug boat but by the end of the game you have this massive ship with arrays of guns on swivels with shields and lasers flying in every direction.Regardless of what made me love the game I found myself making decisions from a cost benefit standpoint, but every now and again I saw a system being attacked and I helped it even though it didn’t really serve my strategic goals. That was profound to me. Now... I don't wanna be pretentious over what is essentially a fairly simple, and somewhat silly little space game but I really enjoyed this game and the game spoke to me and I think it’s worth looking at. So at the very least if I can't recommend the game to everyone, I can say it worth looking at and making the decision for yourself especially if you’re into exploration, customization and 2d space combat. I love the game, now that said I do have a couple of things I want to criticise the game on here and the big one that stands out for me like a sore thumb was the ending. I wont spoil it, but I felt it was underwhelming. It was a pretty big let down and it met none of my expectations. Now whether that was my expectations being miscalibrated or the game’s failing I can’t say for certain but I can say I didn’t like how it turned out. I didn’t like the ending. It left a mark on the experience that I kind of have to take imaginary reviewer points away because of it. Another thing was the variety of the content available. Five to Ten hours into the game you’re going to be hitting that “Another Day at the Job” zone where you’ve kind of seen it all before and the game has no surprises left to give you. Which is fine when you consider the scope and scale of the game and it’s development but I feel I would be dishonest by endorsing this game without airing my biggest gripes about it.Now in spite of the that there is still loads to do here. You could easily spend hours, evolving ships in the evolution mode or trying to optimize your times on the challenge levels but those are not the meat of the game.The conclusion of all this is I recommend this game for people who enjoy story lite, rogue lite, space ship building and combat games. If you’re looking to pick up a 15$ or €15 game that ticks all those boxes and get 5, 10 maybe 20 or more hours out of it then this is a good option. If you like the look of the game but you’re unsure, wait til its on sale and big it up at a reduced price. If none of the above sounds good to you, avoid the game, its not for you and ultimately its a niche title in my opinion.I also made some let's play content for the game.

Early Access Review
								Note: I was given a free copy of this game for review purposes.For a game in Early Access, it has cross-platform support, runs incredibly well (except in 100 ship battles), and has only a few UI bugs, which deserves applause. Combat [h1/]The game is 2-D, and you manuever your ship around with the left and right keys, then fire them with up and down. This also means that you must point your ship at an enemy in order to fire your weapons, which takes a lot of skill. The enemy AI is so good it feels like you are fighting a player, since they will navigate around obstacles and take care to aim, rather than just spam.This game mechanic gives skilled pilots a huge advantage with smaller ships, as they can deal out damage before a larger ship has even brought its weapons to bear. By far this is the only game I have seen where skill is the ulitmate decidin factor in a fight. Building [h1/]By defeating enemies and destroying stuff, modules are dropped. You can use these to aid in construction, and some have stats that can be positive or negative, depenidng on its quality.The more modules a ship has, the larger its mass, and therefore it is less manueverable and requires more power. Exploration [h1/]To start exploring, generate a galaxy, and you will be able to progress through randomly generated levels with objectives, such as destroying stations and/or ships in the area, or collecting stranded escape pods. Graphics [h1/]The game is very well-optimized, and you could run it wihout problems on a potato.The backgrounds are breathtaking space art, which fit well with the FTL - like artstyle for everything else, but higher-res. Misc. [h1/]No DLC.Full Steam Workshop support for sharing ships.Achievements.Very active developers (look at the update log!)Nice sound effects and space-y music.Must buy if you love anything similar to FTL.

Early Access Review
								Game is still clearly early access and not everything fully works and could still use quite a lot more polish, but it's entirely playable and enjoyable as-is and 100% worth an Early Access purchase if you enjoy the genre.The genetic algorithm mode is particularly neat even if it doesn't work very well. Not really something you see often and I dig that even if it completely freezes my computer like I dunno, 9 times out of 10?Exploration mode is the heart of the game and while it can be a really rough start if you pick a bad starter ship (with no real guidance say, that it's going to be super-hard mode since, oh hey, you just configured a ship with no weapons of any kind) overall, if you make it past the first round or two, it gets really fun. You constantly get to exercise your creativity as new modules and module varients become available to you. I'd say AI is only a challenge if you're outnumbered and surrounded, but that definitely happens and when it does, you may very well have a truly challenging fight on your hands. Most of the time, with any kind of decent tactics to control engagements and a good ship design, fights are pretty easy though. But that also makes it easier to become complacent and get totally surprised when a tactical situation changes suddenly and your gun arcs can't hit something that's picking away at your engines. Engines matter a lot in this game and once a couple are gone, you are all but hosed. I really like having a more tactical shoot-em-up, and I found most of the game design decisions here to result in pretty cool gameplay.My biggest criticism of the game, if I had any would be that the non-combat missions can get a little tedious after you get the same one too many times in a row.

Early Access Review
								When I was a kid, my friends and I used to play what we called Lego Ships. We basically built spaceships out of Legos, using very loosely defined rules as to what piece did what (Lego-guy-legs with the tops pointed forward were cannons, lights were phasers/lasers, and anything proturding off the back was a thruster), and we'd imagine characters and stories to go with our creations. Our method of fighting was to take our finger and jam it into the other guy's ship, knocking what pieces off that we could. In hindsight, that's not the worst way that one could simulate fighting in space, I guess. Despite your initial primary weapon being space-fireballs (what?), Boss Constructor feels a bit like Lego Ships made into a video game. You cobble together a ship with what you can find, and then you poke the crap out of enemies until stuff falls off. And then you take said stuff and put it on your ship to make it better.As it stands right now, the game is entertaining, if shallow. It absolutely does nothing to justify the RPG tag, so certainly don't buy it expecting a story, because if it's going to have one, it's not there yet. It's neat that the developer is asking people to vote on things like modules and asking for ideas for missions, though I do wonder if that doesn't mean the developer's running out of ideas. The game has been on Steam as an Early Access for over a year, after all, though I certainly have not been involved long enough to know what state the game was in when it was first made available. Whatever you do, don't buy this game expecting a release-quality experience. It's definitely not that. It's stable enough to play (three CTDs in 15 hours isn't bad for early access), and looks to be a great platform on which to build a really good game, but it's far from finished. Music is limited, sound effects are at least decent, and your ship handles like a big, complicated version of the ship you use in Asteroids. If you want maneuverability, or the ability to reverse, or any kind of speed, you have to place thrusters, pointed in the right direction, and enough to counter the weight of your ship. Your ship will continue indefinitely until you fire thrusters pointing the other direction to stop you. It's not nearly so complicated or hard to control as it could be, though, and the controls strike a very, very good balance between realism and playability. I've already got access to nearly every possible module, and everything from here on out seems to be just more punishing versions of what I've already done. I'm disappointed that there are so few modules that are rarer and higher tech, meaning smaller, lighter versions of what you need. I kind of thought that sort of progression was a given in a spaceship building type of game. That's not to say that the concept is absent -- just lacking. I also think the ship construction (which is definitely the core of the game) would benefit from having two or three layers so that you're not so limited in your design by the game being strictly two-dimensional. For instance, the only way to change the direction of a weapon is to put it on an auto-aim joint. As of now, there is no way to put a weapon between but below or above your thrusters, or armor, or anything else, forcing you to either extend the weapon further out than every other part of the ship, or risk (guarantee, really) shooting yourself if an enemy ends up beside you since your weapon will automatically turn to point at it, regardless of what part of your ship is in the way.Everything shield related is pretty goofy as well. You either have this orbiting projectile-blocking thing that will get between you and enemies (meaning you'll always hit it when you shoot) or some peacock-feather-looking extensions that also block your own fire. Maybe the developer just really likes the idea of parts flying off of the ships and, honestly, so do I, but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to go about fighting anything remotely hard when I can't shield my weapons.However, if you enjoy the idea of slapping parts off of other spaceships using space-arc-welders and space-fireball-launchers, then stealing those parts because apparently they're really durable but not connected very well, then I don't know of a better game for you. And, hopefully, there's a lot more to come.			"

												It's a Interesting game with spaceships fighting with each other.Graphics - 9/10 It's interestingTechnology - 8/10 It can be created on other engine, like unity. But you guys do a Good Job on java :DAudio - 10/10 It's a excellent soundbank to the game (That Includes Musics).Gameplay - 9.5/10 I saw this movements on CC (Celestial Command) on steam, and the combat mode is very funny and epic.Suggestion:Play this on exploration mode first.

								I've only put in a little time into the game so far, but so far it's been a BLAST. You can have little adventures in small, randomly generated sectors, or larger adventures in whole galaxies. Being able to easily build and tweak ships helps keep things fresh as well. VERY fun stuff, even for someone like me who doesn't tend to like building/crafting in space games.

								TL;DR: This game is like a way kick @ss HD / More Serious FTL: Faster Than Light 9/10.So at first the game is a little confusing if you're not sure exactly sure what mode to pick or how to customize your ship. Games with a high learning curve tend to be this way, but once you get past the difficulty of winging your way through a couple galaxies (took me 6 to finally GET it) you'll find it's a hell of a lot of fun!If you pick exploration mode-No,Pick exploration mode or the tutorial, the tutorial helps with basic commands but you really gotta get in there to know it all. You get to choose from a variety of 6 default ships and a ""bonus"" which adds additional ship parts to customize with at the start. You pick your ship and your bonus and BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING! click the 'edit ship / repair ship' button in the bottom right. From here you click and drag parts from the drop menu's onto your default ship or you can mix it all up or scrap the whole thing and start from scratch! All of the features work, this is an Early Access game done RIGHT. I can't wait to see what new things they add next.Once you've got a ship all powered and with guns or whatever click on a sector in the galaxy and pay attention to your Primary and Secondary objectives. You don't have to complete them, but if you want to advance to the other sectors then you must at least complete the Primary objective. They reward you with all kinds of parts to play around with and honestly, you'll just have to see the rest for yourself :)			"

Newtonian physics and 100% customizability mean you get exactly what you want, with whatever parts you have on hand. Fun time-killer, definitely worth checking out. :D			"

								Curator Review: Indie Game Developer Mirko Seithe brings us another foray into the realm of Action RPG with some construction simulation aspects. Taking place in space, BossConstructor offers unique gameplay in the ability to build your own space ship. Collect parts from space battles in the campaign and take them into your own space where you can experiment. BossConstructor shines in its' Evolution modes where you can create a ship then sit back and watch the AI alter it over time. The survivors move on and the losers get destroyed. BossConstructor offers fun and unique gameplay. The only major drawback is how long it takes to learn how to fly the ship, but after you put in the time to learn this game receives 7.5/10

												This game is a tiny little gem with the potential to become a huge diamond on steam. The concept is extremely simple: Here's a bunch of parts. Make them into a functional ship and try to stay alive long enough with what you have to get more parts, so you can make more ship on top of the ship you had.Later on you can make ships that make ships, and even ships that make ships that make ships that make ships (that make ships). Xzibit would be so proud !The variety is fairly basic but near limitless. You start with very basic things in very basic settings but this soon spirals out of control into a giant frenzy of floating MissingNo type ship designs.There is sadly no real ""story"" mode, but exploration is the closest thing to it. It's a solid part of the game and well executed albeit a bit lacking in variety at times.The ""alternative"" game modes include an infinite mode, a ""darwin"" mode, where you pit your ship design against extremely similar ship designs and see which one comes out on top, then that one gets put against others, and this cycle continues until there is an all efficient ship design that trumps all others. Very interesting :DOverall, this game is amazing in terms of how much potential it has, and overall is highly recommended to people with high nostalgia of Raptor, R-type, and other such games with the most imposing boss class enemies of all times, since you can basically make your own.To be entirely full disclosure-ey, I've had this idea to make a game like this, where you make a giant boss enemy and wipe the universe clean of life since i was about 11 years old, and this guy nailed it (props to you sir.)I very much hope to see this one grow into the beautiful title it deserves to be. So many other DYI ship designers tried so hard but this one looks like it'll go places. 8/11 !			"

								Boss Constructor combines a lot of elements from various games and creates a really decent title that I would whole heartedly recommend to everyone.In essense this game is:-part FTL (random level progression and instadeath)-part ship builder (scavenge parts from destroyed ships and attach to yours)-part space trading game (occasional random ore and trader to buy/sell stuff)-part intense 2d battle simulation with Netwonian physicsIt's still in early beta, but already has a very stable build with tons of variety and gameplay. Can't wait for the final release!Check the video review for more info:

								I really like the concept, but I didn't enjoy this game. I didn't play long, but long enough to realize most of my playtime was frustrating because I was fighting the user interface and control scheme. I also couldn't figure out how to purchase new weapons/solar panels for my ship. I couldn't tell which things persist between missions and which don't. When you load, it's where you left off before starting the mission, but apparently when you edit your ship, that's saved outside of missions...I don't know. Very confusing. The ship building UI is a jumbled mess of buttons, and I can't figure anything out. This game needs to be simplified. It feels needlessly complex, almost like it's a stream of development/design conciousness. The survey pops up in your face asking what kinds of things should be improved before you've even played the tutorial. Also, the control scheme feels really clunky, at least for keyboard/mouse (my preferred controllers).Neat idea, but I can't recommend this game in its current state.			"

								It looks like its deep and its fun but its not. Its complicated and boring and very 2D. From what I could see most maps have an enemy to destroy and some asteroids to blow up and some space mines. That's it. You just do the same things over and over. You can put your engines here or there and it affects the whole spinning out of control issue. If you'd like you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out things that should be pretty simple or at least explained. The physics are wrong. No space ship should handle this bad.Exploring areas. From time to time you need to explore an area. That means you have to move your ship near some rectangles. They'll disappear. Done! Does that sound like fun? It isn't. Can I build an interesting ship? you might ask. No. Seems like you should be able to build an interesting ship like lets say something similar to one of the big capital ships in Sins of Solar Empire that has many functions. That would be interesting but as far as I can see you can't build anything like that. There are some extraordinary people on the internet. I've seen them at work on Besiege and they can create almost anything of enormous complexity. Maybe they can do something incredible with Boss Constructor but not me. I didn't see much possibility and isn't that what I'm paying for? The game is supposed to make me feel like I can, with my normal abilities create something marvelous using their easy to understand tools. They have totally failed because I cannot create marvelous things and their tools are not easy to understand.Let me compare it to a game that is fun - Lunar Flight. In Lunar Flight you have some sophisticated navigational devices to get you to a floating sphere that needs to be ""researched"". Once you get there you have to use your piloting skills to float within the sphere while the sphere is being researched. This requires skill, which you can learn with some diligence. The result is a satisfying 3D experience because the maps in Lunar flight look fantastic compared to any game whereas the maps in Boss Constructor look like crap and the physics feel so right. Have you ever worked on a monitor that is reflecting things from the background into your eyes? Well, that's what every map in Boss Constructor looks like. The planets in the background look like an annoying reflection on your monitor. On a positive note I think I did read that you can turn off backgrounds. I could say more but...To summarize - Boss Constructor as it is now, sucks			"

												Boss Constructor is essentially an alternation of the design and the combat-test process, be it in a autonomous combat scenario, the campaign world-map or the endless mode. You don’t get to travel in space, explore and trade, so you will not get much out of Boss Constructor if you are not passionate about detailed spacecraft design.Boss Constructor uses a WASD and cursor keys setup for the move/fire controls (or a gamepad if you fancy that), and you can change the settings to include mouse control as well. However, until you get used to the thrusters and the inertia physics, you might find your clunky spaceship a bit unruly to properly control. The placement of the modules can also throw your flying contraption off-balance, even if a small component is a smidge off-center, thus disrupting the symmetry of the design. You will also learn (the hard way) that crucial mods like the thrusters can be easily destroyed by enemy fire if exposed- thus leaving you to suffer in space, slowly dragging your steel corpse to the exit- so you also have to be strategic about the placement of each module. These strict regulations governing inertia, weight distribution, energy and consumption can be very unforgiving and you might create ships that are simply not fun.MORE: http://www.dsogaming.com/special/reviews/dsogaming-bossconstructor-review "

												+ neat concept, but pretty poor execution:- extremely clunky movement either too fast, too slow, unpredictable, too slow rotating or massively uncontrollable- music loops with every mouse or button input back to the start- tutorial more intrusive than helpful, you are forced to build a bad ship to start with, waay too many mechanics trown at a new player to even comprehent how to properly balance a ship at the start- combat is is pretty unpredictable too as enemy ships either are waay faster moving than you, have waaay better firepower than you, or are taking ages to destroy even if you try to aim at the fast moving ships/heavily armored tanks- once you even loose one piece of your starting ship, it is practically game over, oh lost a propulsion, nice you cannot fly anymore, oh you lost a fireball, now you cannot fire back, or your center of gravity is trown off so that navigation becomes a nightmare "

Early Access Review
								I want to like this game, I really really do. The premise is enticing, the bones are... present; but the execution falls flat, even for an early access game. The control scheme and UI are frustrating on a fundamental level, and the absolute lack of control and understanding given to the player renders the game nigh unplayable. Bugs are present as well, and in my fraction of an hour of playtime, I encontered invisible ships, weapons, and projectiles. my weapons would (nearly always) stop firing, or cease to work entirely. I really wanted to sink in more time before writing this review to give the game a fair shot - but honestly, I couldn't bring myself to; and that's a resounding testament to the game's playability.

								I've spent the last hour and a half trying to get it to work, game crashes to desktop if I alter any settings (such as setting it to fullscreen), I've followed all the advice from the developer to resolve the issue that I can find and it has failed.Inexcusable. The paying end user shouldn't be having to research how to get a piece of software to work nor should they be forced to make concessions in their experience (the game only works for me in a unplayably small windowed mode which excludes most of the interface).A buggy waste of money.

								As of yet the interface is terrible, the controls terrible, the gameplay tedious and slow but the premise fantastic and the builder is nice.This game plays like a slow paced three-way-mixed-heritage baby between Borderlands 1 (Loot rarity), Classic Asteroids (Physics simulated 2d spaceships) and Reassembly (spaceship building).I will be looking out for this game hoping to see some exciting improvements.

												Controls are clunky and the gameplay is reminiscent of 1970s ""Astroids"".  The ship building system is overcomplicated for what you get out of it, and damage to your craft unforgiving, resulting in a situation of whoever takes the first damage loses.			"

								For some reason I thought this was 3D... It isn't. I don't really enjoy 2D space invader shooters, and I was hoping for something with a ""Battleship Craft"" type of vessel design, with 3D blocks to use and modules to place. From some promo art I thought you'd be flying over 3D landscapes, but no.I think the sci-fi font isn't very readable, and defaulting to a tiny windowed mode shouldn't be necessary.The name ""Boss Constructor"" seems odd, too. Are we constructing bosses for 1990s side-scrollers?Seems like the developer is trying hard, and good luck, but it probably isn't my thing.			"

								For now game is missing all the fun parts. Game is counter intuitive, shallow, easy, without context. Core is not fun at all. Music and sounds are very noisy and you cannot listen to them more then 15minutes. AI is stupid. Sorry to say that, but if you want to play some fun space shooter with ship building, this is not the game you are looking for.			"

												Game is awesome, like FTL and space pirates and zombies combined. I love the gameplay. However...investing hours into the game only to have my save files become randomly corrupted is a pretty significant issue to be having. I have played many other early access games without this particular issue. Until it is addressed it is pretty pointless to play this game as your progress will be randomly wiped when the save gets corrupted. my save right now simply doesn't even load..it just causes the game to crash. Fix this issue developer ASAP...or watch the game sales crash faster than my saves....			"

												The smallest hit destroys your weapons, leaving you unable to complete all combat missions. A SOFT LOCK. No way to repair ship in game (by mashing buttons)...give it a pass for now.lol someone said to stick to iPad games because i was unwilling to learn the game..it just doesn't play in a fun way. at all. you can soft lock missions with no enemies. that's not on meyou can go combat outfit and be stuck with non-combat missions. just becauseyou can basically have a pure rng game be a pure rng game. why is that fun?your ship falls apart like it's a minmatar ship for crying out loud. and enemies take less damage than they CAN deal to you. missiles do nothing to them but simple blaster shots FROM THEM wreck you.pass.

								8.5/10  It has potential to be a great 2D space game.Pros- beautiful atmosphere and visual effects (after turning off tactical grid in maps) Although ships' design look meh, I never thought that in-game graphic would looks much much better than what I see in YouTube videos I guess it's because they didn't turn off the grid during gameplay.- space looks lively, you can see AI ships do different things in space.- have good amount of contents, and a lot of adjustable options- editing ships is easy and fun like the way I enjoy in GalCiv3Cons- clunky UI, player can't access options menu while playing in a mission. Options are available in main menu only.- cannot restart mission unless you choose to go back to the main menu-  lack of continuity feeling in Exploration mode. I feel like I'm just going through a number of missions instead of exploring space. My actions doesn't effect anything to the game world.I know that Story Mode will comes soon and it will add some continuity feeling. but I'm not sure if the story mode would have freedom complexity as much as FTL or Convoy.

								Just very quickly for now: - great 2D space shooter with emphasis on building your own ship (boss) module by module - caring developer with lightning fast response (next day patch) - frequent patches bringing lots of new and improved stuffIn comparison with Reassembly: - grid based ship editor (simpler but less flexible) - battles occur on separate randomly generated maps (as opposed to Reassembly's huge continuous ecosystem) - ship size is currently rather limited, both by ship editor and by performance I reckon, but impressive beats of doom can be had - broken modules remain broken until the end of battle, forcing the player to adapt to new ship behavior and build their ship to survive these brutal scenarios - this rewards good engineering!I love it already and I have high hopes it's gonna get much better as it has potential to be as unique as Reassembly or SPAZ with its own mix of space shooting/engineering goodness.

												This reminds me of reassembly in a good way.  But it starts up with a survey.  I would probably have liked the game and recommended it, but I can't get past the fact that the game starts up with a survey.  This is shameful.  It's not as bad as an npc trying to sell you DLC, or day one DLC, but it still gets under my skin just enough that I can't enjoy the actual game.  And the actual game is nice.  I wanted more games where you can customize your ship piece by piece and the game does that well.  But that survey at startup just bothers me.			"

								Not sure why Steam is not calculating my time correctly but I have played over ten hours of this game for starters. This game is very unique and has quite a learning curve. As you explore the map you encounter varied entities including friendlies and enemies. You always have the option to fight or flee, and your ship handling reflects its current damage. As you complete missions and defeat enemies, you collect parts and blueprints to customize your ship (of which you can build from scratch or select a premade). All in all for an Early Access Game I would say that this is right on par with where it should be in this stage of development. I am very likely to continue playing and extremely excited to see where this is going to go. I would say give it a try it definately fits into its own little niche!			"

								BossConstructor really shines when it comes to the ship design and flight physics. However, the learning curve is very steep.

												One of the best modular ship design games i ever played.  simple to learn, fun to play.  The different modes offered are very varied and the number of parts to build from is increasing from patch to patch.Please, take my advice and try this game! if you don't like it after an hour or so you can always refund it on steam instantly, but I doubt you'll remember to refund it becaue you'll be too busy battling the von numan death ships :DDD			"
