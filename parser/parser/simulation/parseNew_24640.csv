												Made me rethink multiple life decisions while staring out of a badly textured window. All while being able to remove the little fun things that driving a tram at high speeds has to offer. Like crashing and killing myself.			"

												If you use the word game liberally enough to apply it to this experience, then this would probably be a contender for worst game ever created. 10/10 would install again.			"

												Even thought I loved Train simulator. I do not like this DLC. The graphic is extremly outdated, and the only thing you could do in this DLC Is drive a tram. It's also too expensive, it should be only 4.99 since all you can do in this game is drive a stupid TRAM.			"

												Took me a good while to get myself out of the depot. For some reason I could manage to get moving ever so slowly but only to find myself stopped shortly after. Having not completed my traineeship in tram operation, I will admit I was blinding playing with the levers to see what affect it had on this amazing piece of machinery. After some time I was able to get the tram running, but this is were my troubles developed further. I could not manage to get the tram to slow down, I was locked at 100% power and it was ready to rumble. I managed to operate the intersections and navigate to the first stop, only I never stopped. Those poor people waiting for their ride to work will have to wait for the next one I think to myself. A few moments pass and I have completed some laps of the city, and that is when it happened. To my horror I had discovered that by some act of god I had managed to put myself onto the wrong track, I'm not talking about headed to the wrong destination, no, I was headed into oncoming trams. As I see an innocent tram completing its runs in the distance, I perilously attempt to slow my tram, but to no avail I continue to hammer towards the poor vessel of public service. I am able to see the point as the opposing tram has realised it's demise, it viciously flashes its headlights at me but the time for action has since passed. In a matter of seconds I collide into him at a blistering 70km/h, almost the top speed that my tram is capable of. The collision sends me into a spiral of death as my tram derails and spins more times than a helicopter propelor on tourism flight around Melbourne City, violently throwing me into a concrete wall. The impact was so tremendous that my tram managed to penetrate the wall and merge themselves into one entity, where it would then stay for the rest of time.11/10 would crash again.Let us all take a moment to remember those who perished in the terrible Cabon City crash of 2014.
