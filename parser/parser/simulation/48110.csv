												Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic, isn't a terrible game by any means. It can be quite fun at times and exciting. Unfortunately, the glitches and bugs out weigh any fun this game will give to you. With the corrupted save files, ghost ships etc. But, if these were the only problems with the game, hell, I'd say give it a shot. Alas, it is not. And the problem this game suffers from, is not the game itself, no no, It's the beautiful, glorious, riveting Ubisoft. You've just installed the game. You hit the play button of course! Time for some fun, you'll give the game a shot. A few minutes later Uplay shows up to tell you that, ""Hi! You need to create another account! Along with the millions and millions of other online accounts you already have! Ha ha!"" So, begrudgingly, you decide to make another damned account. Twenty minutes later you're account is set up. Perfect. You've given them the product key and you're ready to play.  Heck, maybe you even liked the game a bit. But a few months pass, you haven't played the game in a while, you uninstalled it because it was taking up room, and you thought, ""I'll reinstall it if I ever want to play it again."" So you get this odd urge to play a game on the high seas, sinking shipping and what not. You click the install button, wait a few, and you're off! Or, so you think. Uplay comes back and says, ""Hi again! Please activate you're product by entering your product key to play!"" Finding this strange since you already activated it once, you curiously do so. Copy and paste, and you're done. You reach for the OK button, you click. What happens? ""Sorry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! This key is already being used by another account! Please contact our AMAAAAAAAZING customer support for more information! Ha ha!"" ~Ubisoft ""Actually ♥♥♥♥ you."" 1986-2014~P.S Get Silent Hunter 3.			"

												This game had so much promise. You can get around the hell of Uplay, but the game is really really, really buggy. And the fact that most mods dont work with the steam version, your just sol. The game is visually beautiful, and there is something inertly great about being stealthy in the sea and then evaiding capture, but the bugs will have you ripping your hair out. Radar contacts sometimes dont work, and you'll be searching for multiple hours real time waiting to run into someone. AA gunners wont attack planes that are VERY relentless, let alone actually kill them. 6/10 times they wont even shoot at the plane when you have the gun armed, manned and ready; and when they do attack, 8/10 times even an experienced gunner wont bring them down.I wanted to love this game so so much, but Ubisoft failed us. There are no updates to the game in over 5 years; the only ""news"" steam has on it was in 2010, and thats just them saying ""hey we have this now"". There is no explination of how to fire torpedos without manually entering eveything in. It took me a min to figure it out--online, not in game--and the way it was implimented was fail. You have numbers 1-3 on your projected torpedo trajectory, and you line up the numbers with the enemy ships numbers. Its really easier to just manually do it, but for new players both are very confusing and there is NO tutorial. Steam says in the description, ""Now, every beginner can successfully command a sub free of confusion."" That could not be any more of a lie. The tutorial is a joke, and you will actually have an icon at the top of your screen always telling you ""use the mouse buttom to look around"". That could just be a glitch i personally have, but either way it proves my points. In SH4, if you decided to not manually everything in, it was point and fire. Which if your a beginner, is fun and easy. It is not fun in SH5 for beginners, unless you take the time to learn manually doing everything.This game could have been fantastic. And I do wish SH 6 would be made; but it cant be made by ubisoft. They will screw it up like they have since SH4. I have not played SH3, but many say it is the best one, so check that out first. The odd of anyone else making a SH game is slim to none, but one can dream.Its really sad Ubisoft rushes everything (i wont even start a Assassins Creed rant) always pushing out the next new product. They put the product out, then once it stops selling, they literatly DO NOT CARE if the game gets buggy, at LEAST in regards to SH series. ""Whats in if for us?"" they ask themself. ""Why update the game when no one will buy it from us?"". Well, thats because you guys released a buggy half ♥♥♥♥♥ game and didn't put the love into it. Thats why I dont love it. If you guy just made ONE update to the game, and cleared up the rampent bugs, MANY people who play this game would recommend it to others. But alas, your Ubisoft, and you dont give a ♥♥♥♥.Sorry for putting words in your mouth Ubi, but you know its true.Edit: I'd like to update this, though it is more directed towards Ubisoft. As aformentiond, I do enjoy SH4 better, it seems more thought out, but bugs are still very much present in earlier patch(s) of the game. After doing some research, v1.5 fixes an issues with magnetic impact toggle not working, which is in my opinion a major hinderence to stratigical gameplay (though not game breaking of course). But you should know that when purchasing SH4 from steam, you are only getting v1.3. In order to get v1.5, from steam, you need to also purchase the DLC U boat missions. This is ridiculous. I have never encountered a game where you need to purchase DLC in order to get a patch that applies to root game. Its really like they are trying to force our hand. I think the general point has gotten across. It definatly will be once you read the reviews for that game, everything advises you to not get it from Steam. Whats really sad, is that I'm actually very tempted to buy the DLC,  I want that update, because honestly this game series is the poster child for sub sims. They basically have a monopoly on it and look where that has taken us, the consumer. Is sub sim a nitch market? Yes. Although I would argue the genre is no more or less a nitch market then 4x games, or survival games; usually there needs to be market compitition for a genre to, for lack of a better word, get better. You need to try and build the game better then the other guy, but with the SH series there was pratically no compitition, which i believe let to SH5 sucking.If only I appied the time I took to write this id apply to my school papers.I'm also quite happy the one time I gave a ♥♥♥♥ to write a review for a game it actually becomes the most helpful, albeit negative review. I hope sometime down the line, I can change this to a recommendation.			"

It should be a sim on a certain level. >>>You<<< can make it happen.**********If you buy this, make sure you MOD the HECK out of it!!!!!!!*****************Still is a moddable platform with an ACTIVE comunity. Check SUBSIM forums!If you can't be bothered with downloading tons of mods or reading through all the threads download the:**Wolves of Steel Megamod**.It includes **Open Horizons II** campaign MOD and dozens of other enhancements from graphics to UI and gameplay. Along these lines, get **REAL NAVIGATION mod** if you want more deph on navigation simulation.Don't be lazy and start reading if you want it to be a good simulator.			"

												This game is an incomplete piece of crap.  Beautiful in theory, its final execution is spectacularly underperforming and inept in almost every way.  More importantly, the host of bugs that leave the final product quality trapped in what should rightly be the early development phase are now permanent, since Ubisoft has long since stopped providing any fixes or customer support for it.  I don't blame them; no one likes to be repeatedly reminded about their shoddy workmanship.  On the other hand, they shouldn't be asking money for it either.Thanks to insanely die-hard fans of the series, there are numerous mods available online to improve the game.  Still, you shouldn't have to clean up someone else's mess.  Stick to SH 3 and 4, two really nice games for this genre.			"

												Getting the game to work on a high end windows 10 PC might test your patience, it will not run out of the box. First hurdle is the old and no longer supported Ubi game launcher that will give you a message that the servers are not available. Save yourself some time by uninstalling the launcher, and download Uplay from Ubisoft. (which looks like a simplified version of the steam app)  Then you might get as far as the intro movie (without sound) which after the game just crashes out of existence. Apparently, a fix is going to the executable of the game and change properties in cmpatibillity to stop high dpi scaling (this is all described in the steam community pages) All in all I still have to play a single minute of this game, but the experiance of the last hour trying to get it to run justifies this review: 22 euros for a technical runaround on a game that seems terribly implemented for the way Steam delivers games. Honestly, Steam (and everyone else) would do itself a favour of staying clear of Ubisoft games. Unless you like to mess around with game files, save yourself the trouble.			"

												So there we were on our merry way to South America by way of the Straits of Gibraltar when the Sonarman picks up a contact on the hydrophone. A fleet of enemy warships are closing in and are unaware of our presence. ""Easy prey"" me thinks, so I order the sub to snorkel depth and have a looks about. Sure enough, a whole convoy has just sailed into my path. I ready the torpedoes and aim for an easy target. I fire four of them, thinking I will hit more than one ship. Two torpedoes are duds and a third misses entirely. The fourth one, however, is a brave little torpedo and he keeps chugging along. He misses the majority of the convoy and it looks like mission failure. But a little past the convoy is another ship that happened to stray off from the others. My brow is sweating in anticipation as I watch. It's quickly closing in on the target, but too close to tell if it will hit. Then it happens. The enemy vessel explodes in a cloud of smoke and fire as the torpedo strikes it on the starboard side. The ship is destroyed instantaneously.What was that? Suddenly our sub is rocked by something big. The hull is breached and water starts spraying through the rivets. The engine room starts flooding. It appears that the rest of the convoy has discovered us and are bombing our location. ""Dive!"" I scream and the crew reacts immediately. ""Give me more depth!"" The sub slowly starts descending to 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 86, 87, 88 meters. ""Stop!"", 89, 90, 91, 92 meters. ""Why isn't it stopping?"" I yell. ""I don't know"" the Chief Engineer replies, ""We can't control it Captain!"". Rapidly we decline, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 meters. It looks like we're about to sink, but by some strange miracle the sub starts to steady itself at 101 meters. The crew and I wait and listen to the bombs being dropped from above and echoing off the hull. The engines are stopped and the crew works around the clock to stop the flooding and fix the hull breach. Everything is starting to look good and we wait.Hours slip by and the enemy fleet has not eased up on its relentless pursuit of our sub. We have in affect ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the entire Royal Navy. The Sonarman is continually reporting contacts and it appears that they are circling our location. We start up the engines on battery power and rig for silent running. We release decoys and make heading for the nearest friendly port in a desperate bid to escape the attacking fleet. It's no good. The enemy can track us anywhere we go. The ship is stable and the leaks have been fixed, but our batteries are running low. It would be suicide to surface with the enemy circling us like sharks at a feeding frenzy.The batteries finally give out and the sub sinks to the depths below. There is no good ending to this heroic tale. Somewhere in the Mediterranean sea, beneath the murky waters, lies the brave men of U-Boat 260.10/10, would die again.			"

												This is a fun game but requires heavy modding in my opion to make it work. The game does crash for me after an hour of gameplay before I found subsim.com and got the mods to fix the game and make it actually play and work. In theory it is an expansion of Silent Hunter 3, but this is Ubisoft here they have been failing the PC community for a decade now. This game I luckily only payed $4.99 for and in my opion this is the correct price for any and all future Ubisoft PC games since they. Seem to call a half finished port/game a fully functioning product without much optimization except to get it to running on there computers since Yves Guillant, probably had a say in this game for those who don't know. He is there CEO and made up a ridiculious theory how 93-95% of all PC gamers pirate there games and steal from him and his company and the game developers everywhere. He got the brilliant idea back in 2008 which is where uplay came from to as he puts it will fix the piracy problems of his games and should put an end to the 93-95% number he made up. If you want to have fun playing submarines play either Silent Hunter 3, or 4. The last great games in the Silent Hunter franchise even the 1st and 2nd, are still fun to play to do this day I keep an old. Computer I built that has a 1.5 GHz Pentium D processor and 512 MB of RAM. Along with a 8800 Geforce GPU, just to play Silent Hunter 1, and 2 because it still has Windows XP.			"

												Aircraft never attack (doesn't make much difference since you can never see them and point your flak guns at them), they never added the destroyer escort feature, never added u-boats other than the type 7, never added...I could go on about all the stuff the manual says the game has but doesn't. The game needs heavy modding if you do decide to buy it. The only improvement over SH3, albeit very small and buggy, is the addition of missions other than  ""Patrol C5"".			"

												Way too many issues out of the box.Moving past the Uplay issue (Hint: install Uplay beforehand, have an account ready), which is annoying but not groundbreaking, I still can't recommend this game. On Win8.1 at least, had to uninstall every 2008 edition of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable just to load past the menu, as it would just crash upon loading into the game. I don't know why it was that specifically, but thanks for the heads up, internet. Do your research before calling it a day.The vanilla game itself feels considerably rushed. Fewer subs, poor AI, graphical glitches out the wazoo.Sure, it looks nice, but the changes from previous games are, at least initially, disorienting if you're coming from an earlier game. It might seem petty, but remapping all the controls to fit in the finnicky 'walk around the sub' mechanic (which is admittedly a nice touch) screwed with my muscle memory for at least an hour. Managing to get my sub glitched inside a larger ship thanks to time compression didn't help either.It does a couple of things right for casual players though. Having a toggleable map might take away some of the challenge, but it does wonders for situational awareness. Crew management is, for the most part, a non-entity, which for me personally is a... semi-welcome change from SH3, but again removes a lot of the challenge. Instead of rapidly throwing crew members from room to room to min-max their rapidly decreasing energy in SH3, we get running around the submarine talking to the senior officers. At least, I think that's the intention, but you never seem like you're forced to do it. Morale doesn't increase or decrease at a noticeable rate, except when you botch a conversation for the first time.AI crewmen can't be set to fire the deck gun or AA gun without you expressly selecting a target, which might seem fine for ships, but is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ when trying to pick out planes. And yes, I know sneaking away from the planes is the preferred solution, but if you're going to give us the option, Ubisoft, why make it so darn difficult?Honestly, some of my gripes would probably fade away over time, but I don't believe Silent Hunter 5 is a product worth investing into, especially not for the asking price. If you can get Silent Hunter 3 or 4, do that.			"

												I've been a HUGE Silent Hunter fan. Even played the orignal 2D game. However no matter how much I want to I can not recommend this game to anyone. I have modded this game front and back and it doesn't matter. This is arguably the most immersive silent hunter game however the immersion is contantly broken when the bugs come out and ruin just about everything. Want to try and enjoy the game? Well your going to have to download a MINIMUM of 10 mods just to get the game into a playable state. The only thing this game does right is the graphics can be pretty amazing. However you can get the same graphics with SH4 and have a polished and enjoyable experience.Casual players should definitely stay away as there is no more ""auto-lock"" the only way you can score hits now is if you learn how to do it manually (which is actually harder than SH3/SH4 as they removed the useful interfaces) or you just start spamming all your torpedos and hope one hits. The community is amazing and they always have been however even the hardcore guys like Subsim are having a hard time justifying playing this game over SH4 and SH3 which are both without a doubt much better and polished games. The devs have completely abandoned this game as well so there is no hope that it will ever be fixed. Been about 5 years since release and still a heap of trash even with all the community support. Run silent, Run deep around this game.			"

												Update 06/2016If you allready bought the game and want to make it playable, there is a comunity of people that did what ubisoft should have done, fix some of the bugs. There is a file patcher that fixes some of the issues of the game. This is a *MUST* if you intend to (try to) play the game. See here:http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=214687http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=205620After you patch the game, its still garbage! lol. You need aditional mods:http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=203711After all this, it becomes useable.Again, shame on you ubisoft, for having others do YOUR job.Original review:Garbage. Dont waste your money.I didnt have any problems getting the game to run (Windows 7 x64). Just logged in to my ucrap account and activated it, and it worked fine.Then, After (trying to) play this trash for a while, i spent several hours researching & downloading mods to try to fix the COUNTLESS bugs and shortcomings on it. I then spent 13 hours (past the 2 hr steam refund time) testing mods.Even the Stadimeter is broken FFS! even THAT needs mods to fix it.14 (yes Fourteen) mods later, this thing is somehow usable (NOTE: ""usable"" is not the same as ""fun"" or ""good""), but still nowhere near to SH4, and LIGHTYEARS away from SH3. Its more of a brainless ""action"" game, for people who think their head is only there to put on hats.Shame on you Ubisoft, for releasing a product in this state.Bottom line:If you...- Dont mind spending a few hours researching and downloading mods to make it usable- Never played a SH game before- Are NOT (repeat, NOT) interested in anything regarding a simulation but rather a brainless, unrealistic ""action game""- Are willing to sacrifice playability, realism, strategic play, historical accuracy for ""eye candy""- Think ""Das Boot"" is a brand of shoes- Want to play with ""helpers"" on (e.g. automatic torpedo targeting)You *might* find this thing... ""Ok""But if you want a decent uboat game/sim, Get Silent Hunter 3. Or at the very least, Silent hunter 4.			"

												Unlike the brilliant Silent Hunter 3 and 4, Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic suffers from an identity crisis. One that holds back what could've been a fun game. I went into this expecting something inferior to 3 and 4 which, realistically, you can't top. The problem with this game is that it tries to do two things and fails at both. 1.) It tries to be a Sub Sim and 2.) It tries to involve the player more in the setting. It fails at both.The game takes a new approach to the series and allows you to wander the vessel as you please. This could've worked amazingly well to sucking you into the experience, but any and all effort to do that is squandered. It's painfully clear that Ubisoft Romainia had Das Boot playing on a loop through out the entire development process. It could've been done, but it never is. While you can interact with the crew, never once do you get anything out of it other than gameplay choices. Not once do you hear your young radio officer mention his wife back in Munich or some where and how he misses her. This could've been a pretty artfully crafted experience in that regard, offering a less than jingoistic view of war that doesn't hit you over the head with its simplicity. But, that's never done. Turning Silent Hunter 5 into an artistically crafted game could've been done and, sure the core audience would've been alienated and upset but I could see them coming around and enjoying the experience either way.Now, more damning still is the sub-sim aspect of the game: It's gone. Lazy is an understatement. Gone is the more realistic area based damage model that represented actual damage and, in its place, we have healthbars. Yes, health bars. Ships tend to take an obnoxious amount of damage before sinking. In addition, everything is dumbed down and automated. They took the sim out of the game all together. With that additional simplicity, surely that must mean more content given how much easier it would be to add boats. Right? Maybe even some wild stuff, like Seehunds? No, you got the Type VII. You get 3 flavors of Type VII. Now, don't get me wrong: the Type VII is the iconic boat of the U boat flotillas, but that's essentially one single play style. There's no tiny but nimble Type II that offers you a unique challenge with its strengths and weaknesses. There isn't a wonderfully obselete boat like the S-18 and S-42 that can given you the enjoyment of having to work around its short-comings. There isn't even the satisfaction of using the badass incarnate of a Balao or Type XXI. You have 3 variants of Type VII and that's it. On top of that, the game is lazily put together with men staying on conning towers as subs dive and even running on the decks of ships as if nothing happened while they're slipping past the 50m maker in depth after being sunk.So, in short, it's a game that tries to dumb down Silent Hunter without adding in anything else.In the end, of the 3 games on modern systems, Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic is the weakest. Sure, it looks great, but that's it. It's actually a lot like dating. Silent Hunter 5 is a model. Sure, they look great, but they aren't very fulfillling. They don't offer much other than looks. Silent Hunter 3 and 4 might not beat it there, but they'll stimulate you so much better. You'll find them to be infinitely better companions. It's not a necessarily bad games, but it suffers from not even half-realized ideas.It will not endear itself to fans of the series all that much. Sure, some will pick it up on sale and mod it. That would make it decent, but the core game itself is just poorly executed. Fans of the series and subsims will leave due to the lack of depth when compared to the previous. Newcomers might pass on it due to the lack of excitement. Despite its forsaking of its roots, it still possesses that slow and calculating tension that Silent Hunter does so well. This will bore most others.In the end, I can't recommend Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic. It's half-realized and lazy. Those looking for Sub simming goodness need to get 3 and 4.			"

												DO NOT BUY the Steam version of SH5.1. It doen't run from Steam, but has to link to a UPLAY account from Ubisoft.2. You don't get the latest version, but have to manually patch to v1.2.3. v1.2 still has many broken features4. You can only fix the broken features with an updater that is incompatbile with the Steam version of SH5.Buy the DVD version.  Yes, it is $20 instead of $10, but I consider this $10 dead money.Shame on you Steam, and shame on Ubisoft.			"

Dont care about many people complaining about having to create Uplay (Ubisoft) account, just go on the Web and create yourself on account, Steam have nothing to do with that. Ubisoft have their own rewarde system, sepret for Steam. If you can't create on account, still get it somewhere online, this game is awsome.p.s.

I really wanted to like it and have walked away from it a couple times hoping they would fix the bugs of this game. Well after the 5th time of trying it again I'm giving up.

												Oh boy. Now, I love sub sims, I love world war II, I love pretty much everything that is in the theme of the game. It had promised so much, and I was expecting quite a lot. And, for the first part, ( Uplay was giving me a tough time, but you can get past it. ) it was a very good game. BUT. There are things that completely ruin this game.A. Sometimes if you sink a ship, it doesn't count towards the mission. This is so frustrating, especially when you hunt a battleship.B. Aircraft never attack. Though, you can never hit them, so... Meh.C. Bugs, bugs, bugs, beside from A, it can completely ruin the game,So, overall, if you want anything good, download hell's worth of mods. I, unfortunatley, can't, so this game is sorta destined to sit on the shelf and dust. But, of course, I've seen other people play it, and with mods, this can become what it promised to be. So save your money unless you know how to mod correctly ( And no, it isn't workshop compatable. That's why it's hard to install mods. ) I've played 99.5 hours. So. Final verdict?WITHOUT MODS, VANILLA: 3/10WITH MODS: 10/10So either prepare yourself for a hell of a lot mod installing, or just don't buy the game. Vanilla, it's at least worth even 7.99 tops. Maybe 9.99, but that's just me.			"

												This game is so disappointing after the previous installments. Visually it is great. Sound, great. The basic missions, good. But the mechanics of the game, the UI layout, the controls are just so sloppy and bad that it makes handling the sub so tedious and frustrating. There are annoying bugs as well and the gimmick of walking around as a captain in the 1st perspective, while very welcomed in theory, can get annoying when trying to desperately descend and ascend ladders. I would only recommend this game if you are prepared to mod the hell out of it. Luckily there is a very big and dedicated modding community. With the mods, yes, this game is worth playing. But playing it plain will just make you realize how much you're missing SH 3 and 4.			"

												Now I don't have any experice with these glitchs and game breaking bugs as they have never happend to me and my 40 hours of game play. The game runs smoothly and I've never had a problem with my saves. Other than that it runs fantastic and is pretty difficult at times. Tbh I'm not sure if it's because I have a Uplay account prior to this and understood the hoops to jump through to play the game with out modding it or any of the fussy stuff keeps saying in the comments. Maybe It's the fact that my computer is as old as most of the kids in elemetary these days who play COD on late nights till their mom tells em to gtfo.Either way, if you're looking for a bit more immersive Sub experice then get this one other wise just get the safer purchase of SH4. 8/10 Could have added more varity to the whole ship and better communcations with other subs.

												The game runs fine with no modding for me, but I just can't enjoy it because of the bugs and design flaws  in the game.  The most frustrating one for me is the time compression which will get stuck and slam you into port regardless if you have travel mode set or not.  The other major glitch is that the game does not record kills properly so you can't achieve mission objectives and you ""fail"" said objectives.  There is a major glitch after the second campaign (if you fail it) which prevents you from continuing onward unless you restart the game and reload.  There are just too many bugs.  The game itself is missing elements like complete crew promotion and command and control within the sub.  As captain you have to personally man the deck gun, flak gun, etc. despite issuing orders to your officers.  This game is graphically pretty, but it lacks the substance of SH3.			"

Also, you can walk around the sub and talk to your crew members. However, if you want a game that's finished, SH3 is considered the best and SH4 also has a decent number of fans.			"

												Bad. Very bad game. Though the graphics and the first person concept are pretty good, the game flaws in too many things. The compass only covers 180º, something very annoying in combat because you cannot order high variations of the course. You cannot order to cease fire to you deck gun, so they will waste all the ammo, etc... And what's that thing of the ships health bar? Is this an arcade? If you have a tanker in flames all across the ship, do not think it will sink or explode, you must hammer that ship until you finish its health. Then i guess the fire is just ornamental... Those are just SOME of the high flaws this game has. If you like a submarine simulator, buy Silent Hunter Wolves of Pacific, it is a way far better game...			"

												Maxium Underwater warfare. Silent Hunter 5 is an awesome and good game, i love the story or should i say 'stories'' as this game is going over a wide area of events that happended in WWII, which makes it fun to play as you can take part in those events, i dont like that you are bound to a time and date to have completed each objective because i mostly like to just sail around and explore and maybe sink a ship once in a while, but that was removed in this installment as you will automaticly lose the mission when the times expires or if the target is still alive after that date.However there are some bugs in this game i will type down here:- it can be a challenge it self to climb the latter inside the U-boat as you need to stay in the precise area where the ladder is, (for me i need to stay right beside the pipes that is beside the ladder before i get theoption to climp it, and that doesn't make sense when i should normally stand infront of it?)- the same for the ladders out side they do the same things.- Sometimes torpedos wont fire before you reload them back in Germany i dont know why but suddenly the last 2 may stop and wont react.- You can use the Main cannon on the U-boat and hit the same ship 10 times in the same spot and it will still not take water, even through you can see there is a huge hull into the ship.- and enemy gunners on ship cant be killed. but they can sure harm you One Huge con about this game is:IT USES U-PLAY the worst Launcher ever made, next after Games for Windows LIVE and origin.What i dont like in this one is the Physics and destructions, in Silent Hunter 4 i could destroy so much of the ship that it sank extremely fast. in this one i can hit a few places and see a hull and it still takes the same amount of water in as one hull did.And i miss the point where enemy aircraft where more active and patrolled more, and actaully attacked me like in SH 4 Awesome features but with huge Cons:- You can upgrade your U-boat which is extremely awesome, but the problem is you dont have time for it, i tried sail back and upgrade it but i failed all 3 missions because of the days it took to sails back install it and come back to the area where they might be last seen.- You can buy 3 different skins (through Acheievments) but the skins are cool, and with a little bit of searching in the Main folder you can actally make your own skins and implant them onto her (the U-boat because ships, planes and cars are always refered to as a Women or a She, you learned something new today if you didn't already knew that). - You control a extremely nice modeled version of the: German Type VII U-boat which for me is my favorite one even today. (but it could had been cool if they added more models of diffferent U-boats from Germany so you exspand the experience a bit, and Sh 4 had a few different models you could chose between)overall i would recommend this even through SH 4 is my favorite as SH 5 still needs some of the things that SH 4 had.

												At the time of this review, I have logged only 1.2 hours of gameplay. And, that was enough for me not to enjoy the game. It has a good idea, but it wasn't executed very well, at all. I love the Silent Hunter games. {I really enjoyed the 3rd one the best.} But, this just wasn't good. The fact that ships have health bars should be all you need to know about this game. It strayed away from simulation, and is more arcade. And, a poorly made arcade, at that. I hate that this was the direction the Silent Hunter game went. But, for right now, you can get the game for $10.00. So, not much to lose, you might like it, but if you like the other Silent Hunter games, you probably won't. And, if you watched a video on YouTube thinking, ""These reviews can't be right, it looks good!"" It isn't. Trust me, I was one of those people.			"

												This could have been amazing. It could have raised the bar, so that twenty year old Sub Sim's weren't the current goto contemporary simulator in the field. But Ubisoft Poland dropped the ball by removing everything that made Silent Hunter great. There's no level of customization of crew and equipment anywhere near the older versions. There's no developing your crew, or betterment of your men, instead you get derpy yellow ! quest giver's without quests who just repeat the same lines about their family, and usually bug out and insist they have something new to say but repeat the same thing. This could have been great, the graphics are really good for it's era, even still, but the let down is in the depth and the missions. You'd think removing ALL the customization and RPG aspects would have been to allow them to add more missions and more game depth, but nope. Oh, and all versions are censored German versions where nothing historic will be depicted on your otherwise authentic U-boat.			"

												""How bad can it really be if I mod it heavily to fix all the problems?"" I thought.Even when modded (I'm using The Wolves of Steel megamod), this game is garbage. First of all, you can't properly mod the Steam version of the game. Secondly, the game tends to CTD at the beginning of patrols, or any time you've left a busy harbor. You have to save, quit, and reload the game to try to prevent it. You get skill points for crew. After upgrading a skill, it'll sometimes get ""forgotten"" and you will have lost a hard worked for skill point. You can only ever command the one U-boat: Type VII. When you get bored of walking up and down your boat a few times, you'll tire of never being able to trade in for another type. While the graphics are somewhat improved, the joy of better graphics is more than offset by the bugs you'll encounter. The only excitement besides stalking merchant ships is having warships zoom in from over the horizon and circle your position for hours despite everything you do to hide. While I was no fan of Silent Hunter IV, it's graphics were great. While Silent Hunter III is over a decade old, it still has better world depth and stability. The series is in desperate need of a new game, but this wasn't it. If you're in the mood to torpedo a ship, dust off a copy of SHIII. Save yourself the frustration and tears.			"

												The game is broken, pretty much everyone knows that by now. There are mods out there that fix most of the bugs, but there are a few headaches when trying to get them to play nice with Steam. If you're willing to deal with the bugs that remain even with user mods, get the version on Uplay, fewer headaches to deal with.			"

												I waited until the price dropped enough to take a chance on a game that missed on the reviews a couple years ago.  But SH3 doesnt work on Windows 8.1 so I had to try it.  Well, I'm disappointed in it enough to want to through out this crappy Windows 8 and install my old XP 64, just so i can play a decent WWII sub game.  I thought that by now the mods and patches would've made SH5 at least a halfway enjoyable game....not nearly anything to even try to explain to you....I'm just disappointed that the developers ruined the once fantastic franchise.

												First, let me just say this right off the bat...Silent Hunter 5 in UNPLAYIBLE in its current state on STEAM.That being said, it's a great game one you mod the hell out of it. Fixing the game and adding more realism. (Real Nav mod)Sadly the STEM version of the game is very difficult ,almost impossible, to mod because of the mandatory encryption of the .EXE file.My suggestion if to find a hard copy of Silent Hunter 5, or a non-DRM digital copy from another digital distributor. Then head over to http://www.subsim.com join the forums there and mod away.Wolves of Steal is the current Mega Mod that fixes the whole game.			"

												Ok so lets do the Positives 1st:Its a really Pretty game with nice models and beautiful Enviroments.The game is Dynamic:Ships sail around and theres a chance you might run into them while theyre sailing,Air Patrols are also dynamic in that they occur randomaly,theres also dynamic weather and storms although the game seems to favor slightly stormy weather more than anything else.The missions seem ok and all with their goals and overall the game seemed fun.Now lets look at the negatives....Sadly all the above is rendered moot as the game is broken and buggy-i completed the 1st mission and begun the 2nd when i realized ""hey my ships i sunk arent counting even though im in the right area!"" Also alot of times unless you restart the game after you end a patrol the request mission button will not be clickable so you cant start the mission!  i could go on and on with the negatives but if i did i would be typing for hours.So to sum it up unless you want to try out some mods then i recommend either going back to Silent Hunter IV which has a lot less bugs or going back to Silent Hunter III considered to be one of the best and last good Silent Hunters!

												I really tried to like this game but it was unplayable from the start. Right out of the gate it wouldn't even load because UPlay reported that some Ubisoft service was down. I finally worked around that by downloading UPlay from Ubi's website and launching it that way. The tutorial in this game is horrible -- it shows you how to shoot at surface targets that don't move. It doesn't enable control panels that you're supposed to use during the tutorial. At no point does it teach you about diving your submarine, how to operate submerged (i.e. running out of oxygen, depleting your batteries, etc). The first mission brief after the tutorial asked me to choose one of two missions and neither one was available to select on the map. After restarting the campaign a few times they finally showed up so I selected one where I needed to sink some merchant vessels. While on that mission I surfaced my submarine but the game thought I was still submerged (even though I'm walking around on deck). Because the game thinks I'm submerged my deck crew won't come up topside and my CO2 is continuing to accumulate. After sinking a few ships I check my mission status and find that it has not recorded any of my kills as progress towards the mission goal. I spent more time restarting, saving/loading, and searching forum posts for workarounds than I spent actually playing the game. This is not even an alpha game at this stage.			"

Ubisofts last update broke the single player campaign, the game doesn't recognise when you complete mission objectives making it pointless to even try, which in turn ruins a fundamental part of a WWII U-boat sim. Ubisoft has been selling this broken version of their game for over two years now and dispite many complaints have done nothing to fix this game breaking issue.			"

												This game is great, excellent graphics and very smooth playing. The only problem I have run into is the targetting system for your torpedoes, they dont always go where you want them too. One drawback is running out of torpedoes, just because these old subs did not carry very many, so when you run out, you must head back to your base and refit because so far no other german ship will refit you in the open waters. So depending on where you are, it could be a very long trek to refit. But there is a feature that lets you speed up the game and does cut down on your travel time, but when you do this the enemies can pop up right in front of you and next thing you know you are getting blown up, been there done that lol. So whatever you do, do not turn up the speed of the game and walk away to have a cigarette or eat dinner, chances are you will not survive. Also, keep checking with your dive officer of the depth because I have dove and hit the bottom and was killed. The minimum specs on this game is a little higher than what is needed, my first shot playing was with a core2duo 1.8ghz, geforce 9500gt, win 7, 3 gigs of ddr2 ram. The game played just fine with that setup. I recently upgraded my processor to a core2duo 2.5ghz and went up to 4 gigs of ddr2 ram, the rest stayed the same, and it did not make any difference in game play, still played smoothly. If you like sub games you will love this one.			"

												REALLY REALLY dissapointed. I loved SH2 and 3 back in the day (Even Destroyer Command).  Played SH4 a bit but got frustrated with similar problems in that as well. Now several years later I thought I would try SH5. OMG, a day of trying to play whilst scrolling through Subsim forum for fixes and mods. Tried several mods to no avail, the game is so messed up with little bugs and huge ones (like not registering kills all over the place). The game is not really playable unless you want to spend a week fine tuning mods! Such a shame as I REALLY wanted to like this game. The little experience I have of it between the campaign/game breaking bugs seems good. The torpedo system seems like it needs a bit of getting used to, but I like it. Having the map open whilst in Periscope mode for example, is good. Alteration of course on map is simple, but great. Lots of great ideas have been ruined by a crappy mission tracking system imho. However, there are too many of those mission breaking issues that it makes it a huge waste of time to play. Games like this need patches, and Ubi seem to have given up on this game years ago. Too soon after it was released.			"

												This is an excellent submarine simulator, but being an excellent simulator is always a two-edged sword.Combat is fun and wel modelled, and the graphics are pretty. Wreaking havoc amongst enemy convoys is incredibly satisying, but getting to the battle in the first place is a very tedious process. The game does include a time dilation feature, but the autopilot will have serious difficulty navigating at higher speeds, unless you're in deep open water. This game will appeal to hardcore simulator buffs, but if you're turned off by the idea of spending hours just finding something to shoot, this is not the game for you.Also, this game requires a internet connection and the Ubisoft online launcher to play. When I buy a game through Steam, I already have a layer of internet DRM. I don't appreciate it when a title requires me to install a second internet DRM launcher to play it.At the end of the day, while I enjoyed wrecking convoys, the time it took to find and intercept the convoys plus the extra Ubisoft DRM has prevented me from picking the game up again after my initial binge.

												I have heard a lot of bad about this game but have enjoyed it so far.  My first silent hunter was number 3 and then bought 4 and the uboat expansion. uplay has only given me 1 problem but the auto saving in this game helps if you forget to save on your own. I do enjoy being able to walk around your submarine but i still wish it had shotcuts to the different positions for faster reactions.( I bet mods have put that in). In my opinion this game is easier and harder then the other silent hunters. easier in that in the hours i have played I have not experianced 1 dud torpedo and a lot of my kills are are only involving 1 torpedo, unlike the other games were it mostly takes 2 and 3 for the bigger ships. but it is more challenging in the part were there are many more destoryers in this game in my opinion and do a fairly good job at hunting you down. also a trillon planes off the coast of brittan that bomb the crap out of me. For me this game is great without any mods, and probably better with them. but like I said the only parts about the game I dont like is there is not any postion short cuts and your flack and deck gunner crews are almost pointless and you should do it your self 100% of the time.

Sadly, this game does NOT live up to the high standards set by its predecessors.The main flaws include the following:Uplay DRM to play the game.Game-breaking bugs and flaws that will sometimes prevent you from even progressing, or on occasion, will reset your progress to a much earlier point.-Examples of this include:  -When opening the periscope view the game instantly crashes to desktop with no crash dump, report, or warning.  -Some enemy units will disappear in full view of the player without explanation or warning.  -Certain story objectives are not acomplishable due to the game not tallying kills properly.The main reasons to enjoy your time in this game:All gamebreaking bugs aside, the game looks beautiful, and is a good platform for mods (assuming you are allowed to, I wouldn't know as I have only played the stock game).The mechanics from the old Silent Hunter games are somewhat present, but the game is much easier than it's predecessors.Overall:Don't buy this game, buy Silent Hunter IV or Silent Hunter III "

												Ok so i looked at this and i thought, man i used to love silent hunter 3 I'd Love to play that with better graphics and hopefully more stuff. If you to are thinking this do not buy this game. It looks so much fun right? I was even like well you have to walk around the ship thats abit annoying but i'll get used to. However after loading it up i quickly realised that the invert mouse function on this game does not exist, I know this is personel preference but if you use invert there is no way you can use normal i think it's a brain thing (i'm making that up). But anyways thats pretty standard for any game these days specially a game claiming to be a simulator, People actually look up by pulling there heads back. Well as you can see i'm quite salty about that (naval pun hur hur). There are some features that i liked and thought were really cool like the sonor and closing the doors to get better sound and things like that. however this game just wasn't fun or user friendly. You cannot swap quickly between your stations so thats means if your below deck when you spot a ship you have to run climb the ladders to the top, Actually know that you can climb from the bridge to the deck to find the gun. You cannot see the deck gun from the bridge only the AA gun at the back, So it took me like 20 minutes to work out where this ladder was and that yes indeed this sub is fitted with a deck a gun. I know some of you are thinking this is simulator thats what you do and if thats what you want then this is game for you. There is an officer to talk to that can send men out onto the gun and give them funky orders but well well that does that leave you doing staying below decks counting the potatoes. There are many mods that will fix this game and make it fun i'm sure but it's not on the workshop the mods didn't seem to hard to figure out but more hassle than i fancied. If i buy a game i dont really want to have to go the extra mile to make it fun. my advice is get Silent hunter 3 when it's on a super sales and live with the graphics and actually have funAnd its Crashes More than the Waves on Rhyl Pier			"

												This game is very good sub sim , feels like a better version (graphics/environment/) of SH3 BUT only with few mods on , so if you are willing to spend a few hours to set the game its worth it. (Mods are not with steam but applied through JSGAME).The raw game is NOT a sub simulator when it comes to make an attack, it feels very arcadish.I personally haven't experience any crashes since Uplay fixed their things (2015), according to some reviews I read the game is ""buggy"" I can tell you that after 250+h I have not experience any bugs.If you want a U-boat simulator and willing to spend 1-5hours to mod it this game at 10$ CAD is a really really good deal.You can find mods here http://www.subsim.com/ "

												As mentioned, this game is great if you are ready to give it some time and install a ton of mods to make things work, and add some realism.I can't remember the names of all the mods I used but there's a ton. One of the best is a mod that changes the damage model, so that ships can burn and sing long after you hit them.I wouldn't tell anyone to buy this game and try to play it out of the box. Ubisoft did not give this game enough attention. If you want a WW2 sub sim, this game (with mods) is still the best you can get, sadly. "

												(First review, so cut me some slack here)  First off, like many others have said: This game is unplayable in its' current state without mods.  There are glitches galore and it takes away any immersion you would have had.  However, once you install mods (I recommend the Wolves of Steel mod highly!)  it becomes extremely enjoyable.  Wolves of Steel fixes the majority of issues the game has and it runs smoothly without crashing.  The only issue I found was that when loading a save you won't be able to interact with any equipment without going up or down a level in the sub, which isn't an issue unless you accidentally lock yourself out of the sub and are unable to open the hatch.  Also, a couple of the tutorial missions aren't compatible with Wolves of Steel and will crash the game when you run them.Ratings:Vanilla: 2/10W/Mods: 8/10-10/10 depending on mod coverage. "

												Many sub simulator fans say SH5 is the worst of the series, I would agree to that. But with many of the mods and mod packs, this can become on of the best games in your library. I would only really get it to get some of the mods that do things such as : Increase Historical Accuracy, Acctual German Voiceovers, New UI's, New Textures and Sound Effects, and Increase Crew's AI efficiency.I would reccomend subsim.com , as it is probably the best and most reliable mod websites for 3,4, and 5 and many other games			"

												IntroThis is my first review on steam. But we all start at some point ... :-)Btw, English is not my mother tongue (but German), but to have a global reachout I decided not to do ""German first"".I bought SH5 nearly a week ago and after about 10-12 hrs of playing I am already bored and disappointed.Also pointing out that I am playing hardly more than 2 hrs a day overall. First some pros:Good atmospherte overall. The languages in speaking and subtitlles (German/English ) do not match always exactly, but its good enough for me. The U-Boat does perform as I was used to it in SH3 and the different settings allow for pro players (doing the math) and amateur Captains as well (simply aim the target, give some orders). A good feature was done by assigning points to the crew. Guess that pays off in later missions.Now some cons:There is an intro but overall you are guessing what to do. Not the navigation or attack, but the standard navy procedures.When do shallö use the radio? What orders shall be given in which order to do it properly?As I did not serve the navy (doing my time in the army) I am not familiar with that but basic military knowledge telles me that there are some procedures for every step you to :-)The missions are quite strange. (I admit I stopped early, so maybe I miss something her). You are ordered to sink specific tonnage or ships but even if you do so in many cases I wondered why it did not count. I ended up ignoring the mission orders and huntng as I seemed appropriate.Also strange that you need to walk to each station to give orders yourself. I expected that you should be able to give orders more easy.And finally - although most ships do show the battle scars afetr being hit by torpedo or gunfire, the big ones dont. (transporters, carriers), or I simply have a bad hardware.Overall I would not recommend to buy that game now. Maybe some bugs might be fixed in the short term, but as long as mission controls and order controls are not clear this is justr giving you frustration.			"

												Let me just preface this by saying that Ubisoft are idiots for forcing their crappy DRM into a Steam release. Delete the Ubisoft Game Launcher crap that it installs on your computer because it's not going to work. You need to go to download UPlay instead and maybe even do a couple other things. As long as you're willing to potentially spend about 20-30 minutes on google trying to figure out how the hell to get it to work it's a pretty good game.Sinking enemy ships with manual targeting on High Realism/Full Realism is very gratifying once you figure out how to do it. The new UI isn't that great and is a bit of a pain to get used to but being able to walk around your submarine and interact with things directly is pretty neat. If you're a stickler for historical accuracy there's a website called SubSim that carries a lot of mods that do things like improve the game's graphics and give the Germans historically accurate flags. Y'know since swastikas are apparently illegal in some places.All in all pretty decent game. There are worse ways to spend $10.			"

												When someone asks me about my favorite RPG I tell them that Silent Hunter 5 is my fave. Why? I mean it isn't wizards and warriors running around. But hey your crew does kind of level up. You do get phat lewtz and new gear. But the main reason I say I enjoyed this game the most as an RPG is that when you play it you can really dive into the idea of actually being a submarine captain. How so? Well you can play it entirely from the first person, so you can really immerse yourself in the situation. I've found myself more involved with my crew and my current situation in a game of SH5 than any of the big studio rpgs. I mean sure I couldn't walk around the ship and then romance each crew member after a mission, but hey you still start to project things onto them by the end of a campaign.Anyways, pretty great game.(By the bye, it does say I haven't played it. I played the heck out of it on another account then picked it up via steam sale on this one too. So hey.)			"

												Uplay ruins this game. It's more DRM that sits on top of Steam, and locks you out. I have come back to play this after about six months, and forgetting my login means I can't play it. I finally get back into my account, and they say I don't own it, even though I've played this specific copy before.I wish Steam wouldn't allow them to pull this garbage. Uplay is just like Games For Windows Live, pointless, intrusive, and poorly designed. Skip it entirely. The game itself is glitchy and needs use mods to fix it, just like Silent Hunter 4. Not enough time was put into this game. Also, Ubisoft wants to store your save games, so once they decide to stop supporting this game you can't login, let alone play. Let's stop supporting these guys.			"

												Why did you make a super complex game but offer no tutorial other than ""hurr aim torpedo shooty shipy""? Why is this like Spore where you have to do everything? Why do I need to use the deck gun manually? What's the difference between HE and AP shells for the deck gun? They seem to be the exact same thing. Why do I need to run to the bow of the ship to use the special torpedo ability, then run back to the command deck to fire it? Why can't I just use my officer's intercom to ask him to use his special ability? Why was the game released in this condition? AND WHY DOES IT TAKE 3 TORPEDOS TO SINK A ♥♥♥♥ING CARGO SHIP? IT'S LIKE THE SMALLEST ONE TOO.			"

												Remember everything that you loved about the Silent Hunter series?  Good, hold on to those memories, because this game has got none of that going on.In a sad attempt to make things more ""cinematic"" they force you into a first person mode through the entire game.  Want to check your map?  Walk to the map room.  Want to check periscope?  Walk over to the periscope and push a bunch of buttons.  Want to make a lightning fast surface raid on an unescorted convoy? Tell helm to surface, manually lower periscope, climb up two ladders through the conning tower, open the hatch, climb out (to find two other guys already up there, somehow), climb back down the outside of the tower, walk over to the deck gun and manually fire it.  Uh oh, an enemy destroyer appeared?  Need to crash dive?  Walk back to the tower, climb up the outside... yeah, you get the picture.You're not the captain.  You're a crewman.  In fact, you are every crewman.  You are running that entire submarine yourself in a room full of animatronic mannequins.  It's like being on the wrong end of some u-boat creepypasta, the eternally damned captain on a ship full of ghosts or something, doomed to repeat the same dull sequence of needless actions for eternity.This series peaked at 3, nose dived at 4, and now at 5 has finally come to rest at the bottom.  The graphics have never been better and the gameplay has never been worse.  I could go into the details on the bugs, the incomplete features, the downright wrongness of so many of the games dates & stats, but I don't feel like writing another sixty paragraphs nor should I have to.  Even if it wasn't your typical Ubisoft pile of spaghetti code it would still be a thumbs down just for having such flaccid gameplay to begin with.			"

In nutshellSilent hunter 4 is better (buggy) investment, but do not buy steam version of that either. Community has given their best shot to fix what Ubisoft couldn't on that also. Many still say that SH3 is the best choise but personally I have not tried that so can't tell. Fact however is that silent hunters in general are still the best subsims out there untill some better game developer takes over.Why?- Buggy game which Ubisoft won't update and/or fix. Even some instruments are broken. With or without mods it will crash to desktop in some point and most likely ruin your mission while doing that.- New interactions with crew are a joke and they have removed crew experience system from this version.- U can move ""freely"" inside the sub in 1st person view, but it is like walking in a pipe and after a while you get really annoyed to the fact that they guy isn't going where u want him to go and end up using ""SH4""-style quick shortcuts again. In other words - useless feature which pretty much was the thing they used to sell SH5 and all it gives you is more bugs.- Horribly slow mod loader system.- Requires Uplay which is waste of your computer resources.+ Great modding community which has added so much content and eyecandy to the game. They have even created some unofficial bug patches to the game, but they wont work with steam version and still won't fix the game entirely. SH4 has wide variety of mods also and IMO they are even better than those available for SH5.			"

												In a word ... ""BORING"". You will spend 95% of your time searching for non-existant enemy traffic. You can sit for 12 hours just outside a major port waiting for some traffic in or out, but there is none. The controls are terrible. Do you want to put on 10 degrees of port rudder ? Not going to happen in SH5 ... you can have 5 degrees or full rudder and that's all. No compass (seriously), wth is up with that ? I spent my years (irl) flopping around the ocean watching the horizon go up and down. I'm quite sure that's not entertainment. Buy SH3 instead, its actually fun. (PS. They can't spell Inverness either).			"

Never save near a sub. Don't get on the hydrophone with a sub near by. - STILL, you randomly crash to desktop. This games loading time is up there with CIV5...I kept on going though because I REALLY liked the game and put up with the random crash nonsense as well as minor in-game bugs...Then you realize that there is a group of very dedicated modders (via subsim forums).

LETS MOD! The game will be 9000 times more epic and not crash all the time weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!WRONG.After about 15 hours, I learned the ins and outs of modding SH5. I tried 2 different popular megamods. Random crashes STILL. Also it should be noted I have never had a worse modding experience. There is tons of information on subsim forums.

												  Dont be afraid to buy this game. It is the best U boat sime ever made and I have been using it for years and the curent Steam version is as stable as U can expect, it hasnt crashed on me or shown any nasty bugs for tha last 4 hrs of play sence I reinstalled it (been playing the DvD version for a while). I play several other games that require Uplay and that has given me no problems eather. It runs great on my AMD 6 core with 8Gigs of DDR3 and a GTX 750.   The game designe is brilliant! U have the wholes scope of the War for the Atlantic in both 1st person captains view or birds eye tactical view. The only noticably anoying bug is the one that has the Uboat starting underwater when U load a game in dock, but thats just cosmetic. other cosmetic bugs abount in the 1st person view but that is to be epexted from a game with this level of complexity.

I love the feature how you can walk around the U-Boat and see everything. A lot of people were saying the game crashed after the intro but that didn't happen, I played the game for about 6 or 7 hours and it didn't crash.

												This game is a great game, but that is not why I'm downvoting it.I played a total of 6 hours, which were packed with fun. And that's where it started.UPlay has, for some reason, made it to where I can press ""Launch"" and it will promptly load, but no launcher/the game will not appear. To be honest, it's not worth to get this game on Steam, due to the failings of the UPlay system interlocking with Steam, and how poorly it does so.Aside from these errors, very little did I notice anything I didn't like.Game: 8.5/10Game w/ UPlay - Steam interlock: 4/10			"

												This game is great. This game is buggy. This game is the cake without icing. This game is worth a purchase.  If you have the patience for simulation games, this one is a little bit of a lighter load to carry and can be mastered quite easily. The bugs will rear their ugly heads from time to time, most are merely amusing. Like the torpedo explosions that send ships flying hundreds of yards vertically upwards. Some will frustrate you to no end, like missing mission specific ships.Overall, if its on sale pick it up. Remember, the more people who buy these games means Silent Hunter 6 has a greater chance of being made. These types of games rock, but this one just rolls.			"

												No as the base game is a serious step backwards from SH4.  Lack of subtypes, no addons that expanded the immersion like SH4 had.  Also 'crew management' in SH5 is you running around talking to each of your crew about their family and what they think of the war just to get them to operate at a nominal level, then when the feces hits the oscilator YOU have to run around manning the deck gun/flack gun or whatever piece of equipment you want operating at full efficency.All that said you can mod the holy crap out of it and get a good experience and mabe even overlook the Uplay insanity, however that is not the base game and does not deserve be considered when recommending or rating the game that was sold.

Then you've found the right place for you! Silent Hunter 5 is bursting with visual flavor, making it one of the more stunning Simulators out there. water and lighting effects are suberb, and the team took a real dedication to the detail inside your submarine. But after long hours of watching circles and triangles cruise around maps, only for about 15-20 minutes of actual Wolf hunting action; it does get a little dry at times.

												Silent Hunter 5 is just another unfinished, rushed-out money-raker among hundreds of major titles we've seen over the last 5 years or so. Gaming industry standards have sunk to an all-time low, the rare exceptions are those games developed by individuals or partnerships who dedicate their lives to a single game/simulation, and listen their customers. It is now common place for a game to either be released unfinished and dumped, or unfinished on the basis that customers are are then held duty bound to throw more money at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ franchises to buy DLC which may or may not eventually transform the buggy half-arsed game into something enjoyable, let alone useable.Terms such as ""Sandbox"" and ""Open World"" are meaninglessly bantered about, while there's usually nothing sandbox or open World about any of it. Your ""deep and immersive experience in this totally sandbox open World"" is nothing more than a numb-brained hand-holding exercise. Run down this path, the enemy will have a silly red icon floating above its head, whereupon you have to crouch like this behind that object and shoot it with that gun .. through that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rock.Oh how close SH5 came to being one of THE most Sandbox and Open World RTS games of all time. What better platform could there be for stealth and strategy on a grand scale, than a Submarine simulation/game. I know, I know; what defines a simulation. I guess it's what you make of it in your own mind, with your own imagination.Anyways, after 38 hours of not really going anywhere or doing anything much, beyond repeating the 'tutorial', I finally managed to transform SH5 into a gorgeous challenging immersive game. Realism and Graphics Mods to a final count of 35 via SubSim, in a very specific order. By God you Modders are worth their weight in Gold!Bearing in mind the importance of ""order"" when it came to installing Mods, I then set about numbering them in the event that I would at some point need to reinstall them. At this point I Zipped them away, and uninstalled/deleted those Mods from the MODS folder created in the game's directory. This, in order to test reinstallation of the working Mods I'd put together.Considering SH5 is an unfinished ditched product left to rot, Ubisoft have in place an utterly pathetic bull-headed protection mechanism that now won't even allow me to read the game directory. Installing Mods is out, obviously.Silent Hunter 5 is now ""LOCKED"", and cannot be reinstalled. Ubisoft GET A F.....G GRIP! This is an unfinished discontinued buggy old game ffs.Ubisoft are still churning out unfinished buggy ♥♥♥♥♥, of the numb-brained hand-holding type I might add. They are a bloody disgrace, and are a sad indictment of many of today's gaming franchises.			"

												I only played this game for a about 30 hours or so give or take... but I believe if you love the game.. get the non steam version and get the mods,, I never have got the modded version or the non steam version of the game,but so far,, I mean the only thing I notice is that if your crew spots a submarine,, don't take the hydrophone station and listen for it or your game will instantly crash.. I will probably make another review of this game when  I play it.. I'll let you know how buggy it is (major bugs) for now I do not recommend the steam version,, unless ubisoft decides to patch this game again for steam in stock version.. it's funny I notice with the final patch with silent hunter 3 that it crashes from time to time and also if you press the buttons on the crew management to move the crew automatically it crashes it you press the cruise mode button a couple times,, when you get mods for it it seems they fix the problem at ease as compared to the developer... isn't that funny... So I hear this game is the best with mods.. but to my knowledge you cannot get mods for the steam version.			"

												Do you sometimes sit in your bathtub for hours reenacting famous WWII subarmine battles? Do you love spending long hours confined into an elongated metal tube with dozens of other men? Then you've found the right place for you! Silent Hunter 5 is bursting with visual flavor, making it one of the more stunning Simulators out there. water and lighting effects are suberb, and the team took a real dedication to the detail inside your submarine. But after long hours of watching circles and triangles cruise around maps, only for about 15-20 minutes of actual Wolf hunting action; it does get a little dry at times. But if you're a simulator fan and love some eye candy, she's definitely worth the price.			"

												If you buy this game, be prepared to fight two wars at once; one against the British and the other against the game controls and interface. The latter seems to pose the greatest threat.  Silent Hunter 5 reeks of a game that has been rushed out the door in order to meet a deadline. The game is no more finished than an early beta release, but is being sold as a completed project. That's unfortunate because this game could have been a gem.Missing are some of the basic controls you would expect in a submarine simulator. For example, you have no way of checking your depth under keel. This remarkable oversight would have sent every sub in WWII to the bottom, literally. There is no way to adjust game controls such as mouse tracking speed. This is incredibly frustrating since the tracking speed while in first person is incredibly slow. The AI is unpredictable and often just plain stupid. The safety of your home port is the most dangerous place in the game, as friendly ships will slam right into you with no attempt to avert the disaster. This is especially prevalant while time warping. You have to always save the game before time warping, otherwise you will find you ship destroyed due to the game's failure to pull you out of time warp when there is a danger (as it is supposed to do). Once my time warp was ended with the crew screaming about damage that had been sustained to the ship. That's not unusual. That happens all the time when the game fails stop time warping. However, what was most interesting was the fact that my boat was inexplicably on dry land, well inland.   The graphics are, at times, absolutely gorgeous. It's to the point where I think the developers spent way too much time working on the graphics and didn't have enough time left to work on the interface. Fortunately, there is a modding community out there working on the countless bugs. If you choose to buy this game, you will need them. I'm just sad that this game, which is actually fun and interesting, was shoved out the door for the sake of a quick buck. I would only recommend this game to hardcore submarine or WWII enthusiasts who don't mind tweaking and modding the game to get it working halfway decently.			"

I had even requested a refund but have now cancelled that request..I read on forums how to figure it out so I thought id try and save some of you time by informing you just to download the Uplay PC app from uplay website...

												Silent Hunter 5 is just another unfinished, rushed-out money-raker among hundreds of major titles we've seen over the last 5 years or so. Gaming industry standards have sunk to an all-time low, the rare exceptions are those games developed by individuals or partnerships who dedicate their lives to a single game/simulation, and listen their customers. It is now common place for a game to either be released unfinished and dumped, or unfinished on the basis that customers are are then held duty bound to throw more money at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ franchises to buy DLC which may or may not eventually transform the buggy half-arsed game into something enjoyable, let alone useable.Terms such as ""Sandbox"" and ""Open World"" are meaninglessly bantered about, while there's usually nothing sandbox or open World about any of it. Your ""deep and immersive experience in this totally sandbox open World"" is nothing more than a numb-brained hand-holding exercise. Run down this path, the enemy will have a silly red icon floating above its head, whereupon you have to crouch like this behind that object and shoot it with that gun .. through that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rock.Oh how close SH5 came to being one of THE most Sandbox and Open World RTS games of all time. What better platform could there be for stealth and strategy on a grand scale, than a Submarine simulation/game. I know, I know; what defines a simulation. I guess it's what you make of it in your own mind, with your own imagination.Anyways, after 38 hours of not really going anywhere or doing anything much, beyond repeating the 'tutorial', I finally managed to transform SH5 into a gorgeous challenging immersive game. Realism and Graphics Mods to a final count of 35 via SubSim, in a very specific order. By God you Modders are worth their weight in Gold!Bearing in mind the importance of ""order"" when it came to installing Mods, I then set about numbering them in the event that I would at some point need to reinstall them. At this point I Zipped them away, and uninstalled/deleted those Mods from the MODS folder created in the game's directory. This, in order to test reinstallation of the working Mods I'd put together.Considering SH5 is an unfinished ditched product left to rot, Ubisoft have in place an utterly pathetic bull-headed protection mechanism that now won't even allow me to read the game directory. Installing Mods is out, obviously.Silent Hunter 5 is now ""LOCKED"", and cannot be reinstalled. Ubisoft GET A F.....G GRIP! This is an unfinished discontinued buggy old game ffs.Ubisoft are still churning out unfinished buggy ♥♥♥♥♥, of the numb-brained hand-holding type I might add. They are a bloody disgrace, and are a sad indictment of many of today's gaming franchises.			"

If you know how to make it work good on you. And no, do not install mods or other programms to play this game if you are newb like me.

												On April 5 of 1940, a VIIB German Uboat codenamed U155 was sent to hunt British Convoys in the North Atlantic.The journey was treacherous. Along her way, U155 encountered many British Aircraft, who out of Mercy for her crew, never attacked U155. The courteuous Hurricane Pilots flew over U155 and refused to attack. U155 sailed on.On the morning of 12 April, U155 spots a large convoy in the North AtlanticAfter firing a Salvo, U155's Captain orders a dive to 150m to avoid detection by escortsU155 loses control of the dive. Despite the Captains Orders, U155 continues to dive past 290mUnder such immense pressure, the pressure hull is crushed and U155 sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic, with all hands lost. "

Apparently you have to hunt through Google and Steam Forum pages to fix the problems they have created( Crashing on logining into Uplay), sadly Uplay is the only way you can play this game.... so thanks but no thanks This is not the ""Silent"" Hunting I envisioned when purchasing this game. I have therefore removed it from my Computer and it will sit as nothing more than a trophy in my steam Library. I prevented 15 friends from purchasing this piece off **ap. I can only hope many more reading this will also prevent the urge to play Uplay's games without actually being able to login into there producted game.Save your money for better games that have nothing to do with Uplay.

												I've logged a lot of hours on this game, so I hope what i've got to say doesn't fall on deaf ears here.  Suffice to say, its worth the purchase, so long as you are committed to modding the game and spending some time getting to know the subsim community.  If you're not up for that, you're not prepared to be a successful submarine sim captain.  All this game will give you is grief. On the other hand, if you take the time and install the mods (which is more fun than you might think), you're going to be rewarded with an experience so memorable and immersive you'll be hard pressed to find the same sort of satisfaction in other games.

												If you are really into detailed Simulator games like I am, I would definetly recommend this game for you. It is one of (if not) the most detailed submarine games i have ever played. And the live action first person view as the captain makes you feel like you're really there in the depths of the ocean Silently hunting merchant and military vessels alike. The controls can take alittle while to get used to if you are not really into strategy, but it is definetly worth getting to know the controls. Nothing is more satisfying seeing an enemy ship go up in flames after waiting for your torpedo to hit it's mark. I give this one a 10/10			"

												Silent Hunter is a long standing series and many say the best of the WW2 subsims. #5 is back in the u-boats. (#4 did US subs in the Pacific). The game play is familiar and excellent. The 3d ships are a joy to fight among. See below for a critical issue fix.When the game first came out it was among the first to have must-have-internet and that time it was avoided by alot for that. That was years ago and constant internet connections are now very common. That was a factor in my waiting until now to play.The crew intereaction for the time was innovative. Though now in 2016 with the same one line comments it seems a bit dated. Seems to lag when docked with the lighting and the people. This is on a good gaming rig of 2016. I could only imagine how buggy that would have been in the early years.Not sure even if there are tutorials but Im sure there alot of guides and lets play now. Ive sub simmed alot so even managed to fuddle through a manual TDC (torpedo data computer). If you haven't done one of those before you definitely need to have a tutorial, guide or video watch.The critical issue warning is that Steam and Uplay don't connect well. There are some guides and this is a quick one I did.1) download and setup SH52) try playing and if you get a Uplay error thats their internet connection service3) Goto Ubisoft, set up an account, download Uplay and install4) Have uplay logged in when you next try to start SH5Thats what worked for me.On a scale of 1-10 id put things over all at a 6.5 compared to modern options. Still playable, fun and a neat setting.Got it now as part of the Xmas sale and for an onsale game Id rate it 8 out of 10.  Very functional though the few hiccups tend to break my immersion at times.

												i really can say that the game needs to have a couple of things patched which probably wont come but ive personally found that the game with the addition of realistic ocean water V11, high def realistic interface v1.0, and Deep atlantic green give the game a beautiful look and also with the UI mod your controls all become streamlined to make play way easier than stock SH V. on purchase just be prepared to follow these start up steps. DO NOT LAUNCH IMEADIATELY AFTER DOWNLOAD! go to https://uplay.ubi.com/#!/en-US/ and download uplay before launching the game. also make an a ccount with http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/downloads.php?do=file&id=2748 and download the High def realistic interface it seriously helps streamline the tools and makes access to everything easier.(might note that the tutorial isnt going to teach you any thing so skipping it will help) also because it causes a bug with the first mission. the only issue i have so far is the game randomly crashes when i am playing sometimes i get farthur than other times but i think it has sometyhing to do with either uplay or running on windows 8.1 but i can treally complain since i save regularlyThe video just goes to show you what the game can truely look like:

												I do recommend this game but with a MAJOR Caveat. It Can be a pain in the butt to implement.I run windows 8.1 on a pretty powerful gaming PC Bought this game as part of a package deal with SH3 & SH4  Both of those work great right after downloading.  SH5 can be a dud. It REQUIRES an internet update program be running when you launch the game (at least once) That program has caused problems for countless people. (Really, I didn't count them!) I've watched the game in you-tube let's play videos and would really love to try it but so far all attempts at remediating the problems (even following long checklists on subsim.com) have given me no joy. I did FINALLY get the game to play. All I had to do was...Report problem to Ubisoft and plead for help there and in the subsim.com boards, then...1) Uninstall the Ubisoft Game Launcher from the Control Panel2) Go to Program (x86) folder and deleted the Ubisoft Folder containing the Game Launcher Folder3) Run Registry Cleaner & Reboot the system4) Down-load a new Game Launcher from here:http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/675733-Ubisoft-Game-Launcher-Download-Forums5) Reinstall the Game launcher6) Go to the Game Launcher folder & Open the folder and go to the 1st Game Launcher .exe application icon and run as administrator (disabling the proxy option)7) Enter my validation code and got an ubisoft screen with Play Silent Hunter 5 prominently featured in the center .8) Go to the Steam/SteamApps/Common/SilentHunter5 folder and Rightclick on SH5.exe then choose Compatibilty Tab then set the X on ""Disable scaling on High DPI) worked like a dream. (just for good measure I also ticked the box about ""run as admin"")Easy Peasy! Now why didn't I do that right the first time?As to the game-play itself. Life aboard a submarine was tough. This game simulates that. Many may find gameplay to be repetetive at points and at other otherpoints very uneventful. If you're like me you may get just as much enjoyment out of watching others play (hopefully with the boring bits cut out) as from playing it yourself.			"

												This game is only for those with good computers, or are patient, as I downloaded this (I had loved these games in the 5th grade) and it took awhile for it to get set up, but it took me to Uplay. I was like, wut da heel. I made an account and whenever I log on, it crashed. But, don't fear, If you download the Uplay launcher from their website, all you need to do is put in the activation code once logged into the launcher, and you can launch it off of steamI would suggest a later version if you like the whole U-Boot sim thingy and don't like a lot of work			"

												It has some very nice elements to it and the graphics look good, but it also has a whole lot of bugs, some silly, and others just annoying. You  can mod it up but that may stir up more bugs. The most annoying to me is where the tonnage bar on the campaign map may not fill after you sink a ship. I haven't been able to figure out why this happens, I originally thought it had to do with mods but now I'm not so sure. I don't know how many other people have this problem. The ability to walk around and interact with the crew is nice though and the controls may not seem as intimidating to beginners as some of the others in the series. If you are willing to push through bugs then you will probably enjoy this it is a good game otherwise and has a large modding community.			"

												Once I figured out how to sync Uplay to Steam to SH5, arrgghh, this game is fantastic.  If you always wanted to see what it was like to captain a Uboat here's your chance.  Be bold in the beginning of the game and get your crew all perked up cause your gonna need it.  Allied ASW tech makes the life of a submariner no easy task.  German tech gets better but doesn't quite keep pace.  Learn to be patient later in the game.  II want to play this multiplayer with some peeps who will help run a good Wolfpack.  Once sub goes in first and tries to get a kill.  All the escorts will give chase.  The other subs now prey on the undefended herd!!  Come get some.Sneaky out!!			"

												Worthless.   Can't even get it to run tight on a 4 GHZ sytem with very high end video card and 16 gb of high speed ram.Even getting to a point where you can get into the game requires some doing.  First you run it in steam then it runs an install an install fore uplay.  You run it again from steam and it runs an install for the game and opens Uplay, which then doesnt have the game int it, you close uy play and click run in steam, it then opens u-play but not on the pager where installed games are, so after finding that tab you click play, and it runs another install in u-play, opens steam with the game code, and then opens uplay again....so you can cut and paste a code.  Followed by the game starting and downloading something from the publisher, and the thegame starts with a hortribly acted movie.  so you start a campaign and want to actually start and the steam code message is covering up the steam button, after figuring that out and starting the campaign the game trys to start acampaign and on a high end system with an ssd array, about a minute later you kill the game because it still hasn't setup the campaign ans actually let you play.TWO THUMBS WAY, WAY,  WAY DOWN.

												Its honestly nowhere near as good as the previous games. Its incredibly clunky to use, has plenty of bugs, is a resource hog (at least on the GPU), and I honestly couldnt play it much simply due to how clunky and hard to use the controls were. Finally, while it had options to make it more realistic, it seemed quite arcadeish at times. That aside, giving you a first person view, crew interaction, and pretty damned good graphics was pretty interesting and cool. It dosent make up for the negatives in my opinion though. Now, mind you, this is all made off of few hours, and I quickly changed back to the older, more superior versions.			"

Suffice to say, its worth the purchase, so long as you are committed to modding the game and spending some time getting to know the subsim community.  If you're not up for that, you're not prepared to be a successful submarine sim captain.  All this game will give you is grief. On the other hand, if you take the time and install the mods (which is more fun than you might think), you're going to be rewarded with an experience so memorable and immersive you'll be hard pressed to find the same sort of satisfaction in other games.

												This game is just awesome! you can even attack the US and Canada, you can go anywhere in the world, you are not restricted to stay near England and Germany, you choose how you attack that is why I love this game and another thing I like is that you can walk around Inside your U-Boat. I have encountered no bug so far and the game is fantastic, I do not know why people hate it so much. whoever is reading this, the price is just great, go buy it for 10$, now!			"

												Once I figured out how to sync Uplay to Steam to SH5, arrgghh, this game is fantastic.  If you always wanted to see what it was like to captain a Uboat here's your chance.  Be bold in the beginning of the game and get your crew all perked up cause your gonna need it.  Allied ASW tech makes the life of a submariner no easy task.  German tech gets better but doesn't quite keep pace.  Learn to be patient later in the game.  II want to play this multiplayer with some peeps who will help run a good Wolfpack.  Once sub goes in first and tries to get a kill.  All the escorts will give chase.  The other subs now prey on the undefended herd!!  Come get some.Sneaky out!!			"

												It has some very nice elements to it and the graphics look good, but it also has a whole lot of bugs, some silly, and others just annoying. You  can mod it up but that may stir up more bugs. The most annoying to me is where the tonnage bar on the campaign map may not fill after you sink a ship. I haven't been able to figure out why this happens, I originally thought it had to do with mods but now I'm not so sure. I don't know how many other people have this problem. The ability to walk around and interact with the crew is nice though and the controls may not seem as intimidating to beginners as some of the others in the series. If you are willing to push through bugs then you will probably enjoy this it is a good game otherwise and has a large modding community.			"

But they are patheticly incorperated into this game...The ""Dynamic"" Campaign is a joke....Even after several patches I noticed bad AI from both my crew and other ships....I found a Battleship upside down without escorts....  which suddenly began to fire on me and proceeded to sink my sub....Even with the Mods from the excellent and well developed modding community, this game is just awful.

												I do recommend this game but with a MAJOR Caveat. It Can be a pain in the butt to implement.I run windows 8.1 on a pretty powerful gaming PC Bought this game as part of a package deal with SH3 & SH4  Both of those work great right after downloading.  SH5 can be a dud. It REQUIRES an internet update program be running when you launch the game (at least once) That program has caused problems for countless people. (Really, I didn't count them!) I've watched the game in you-tube let's play videos and would really love to try it but so far all attempts at remediating the problems (even following long checklists on subsim.com) have given me no joy. I did FINALLY get the game to play. All I had to do was...Report problem to Ubisoft and plead for help there and in the subsim.com boards, then...1) Uninstall the Ubisoft Game Launcher from the Control Panel2) Go to Program (x86) folder and deleted the Ubisoft Folder containing the Game Launcher Folder3) Run Registry Cleaner & Reboot the system4) Down-load a new Game Launcher from here:http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/675733-Ubisoft-Game-Launcher-Download-Forums5) Reinstall the Game launcher6) Go to the Game Launcher folder & Open the folder and go to the 1st Game Launcher .exe application icon and run as administrator (disabling the proxy option)7) Enter my validation code and got an ubisoft screen with Play Silent Hunter 5 prominently featured in the center .8) Go to the Steam/SteamApps/Common/SilentHunter5 folder and Rightclick on SH5.exe then choose Compatibilty Tab then set the X on ""Disable scaling on High DPI) worked like a dream. (just for good measure I also ticked the box about ""run as admin"")Easy Peasy! Now why didn't I do that right the first time?As to the game-play itself. Life aboard a submarine was tough. This game simulates that. Many may find gameplay to be repetetive at points and at other otherpoints very uneventful. If you're like me you may get just as much enjoyment out of watching others play (hopefully with the boring bits cut out) as from playing it yourself.			"

												Is this a bad review of the game? Not Really, I have not actually seen the game running yet.  I have however, seen the Uplay launcher pull several updatdes, and now it crashes every time. First, the Steam download took 4 hours, I can live with that, the game was like 3.6GB. Then lauching the game, the launcher needed a huge update. Then the game pulled 5 seperate patches, each with a different file size. Then Uplay needed an update, and when that finished I had to create an account. (Note: In the end, I just want to play the damn game, I don't want to have to join some cheesy community group.) Oh wait - my letters and numbers password required letters and numbers so I had to try again, and after several tries I got it to accept one. And now - (drum roll) the launcher pulled yet another update and now it crashes every time I start it. I previoiusly bought SH3 and it seems OK, outside the 10 year old graphics, I was just trying to get the better looking game but alas it was not ment to be...			"

I recently got the urge to play it again but didn't remember what Uplay account I used. It took several day to receive a reply from Ubisoft support. I have always given Ubisoft the benefit of the doubt but after that fiasco I can say with a certainty that Ubisoft is the reincarnation of Hitler. I will most likely never purchase an Ubisoft game again.I am only giving the game a thumbs down because of the people who were involved in its development and maintenance. That being said, If you can handle Ubisoft’s stupidity and enjoy simulator then by all means pick it up.			"

												Silent Hunter is a long standing series and many say the best of the WW2 subsims. #5 is back in the u-boats. (#4 did US subs in the Pacific). The game play is familiar and excellent. The 3d ships are a joy to fight among. See below for a critical issue fix.When the game first came out it was among the first to have must-have-internet and that time it was avoided by alot for that. That was years ago and constant internet connections are now very common. That was a factor in my waiting until now to play.The crew intereaction for the time was innovative. Though now in 2016 with the same one line comments it seems a bit dated. Seems to lag when docked with the lighting and the people. This is on a good gaming rig of 2016. I could only imagine how buggy that would have been in the early years.Not sure even if there are tutorials but Im sure there alot of guides and lets play now. Ive sub simmed alot so even managed to fuddle through a manual TDC (torpedo data computer). If you haven't done one of those before you definitely need to have a tutorial, guide or video watch.The critical issue warning is that Steam and Uplay don't connect well. There are some guides and this is a quick one I did.1) download and setup SH52) try playing and if you get a Uplay error thats their internet connection service3) Goto Ubisoft, set up an account, download Uplay and install4) Have uplay logged in when you next try to start SH5Thats what worked for me.On a scale of 1-10 id put things over all at a 6.5 compared to modern options. Still playable, fun and a neat setting.Got it now as part of the Xmas sale and for an onsale game Id rate it 8 out of 10.  Very functional though the few hiccups tend to break my immersion at times.

												It does not even start. When you try to start the game, it looks for update and then you get ""service unavailable"" Steam doers not even help you fix this issue, when you go to help it just says Ubisoft is the company.... good luck.What ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is this?			"

												awesome game never was interested in submarines untill I played this. :) :) You can make the difficulty so that you prefer it, 100% realistic or maybe just 10% realism. Just what comforts you.  Also possibilty to mod (and there are some great mods out) so this game will never die. You got many freedom in the objectives, you can do almost anything you want!			"

												I can't even play it. Ubisoft decided it was best to develop ""Uplay"", a Ubisoft-branded Steam-ripoff. You can't play this game without logging in with Uplay. Even if you then begrudgingly try to make a ♥♥♥♥ing Uplay account, the ♥♥♥♥ing program just dies in front of your eyes before you can register a ♥♥♥♥ing account.Really, Ubisoft? Extorting my ♥♥♥♥ing email so you can send me ♥♥♥♥ing newsletters each week is more important for you than me actually getting to play the ♥♥♥♥ing game I ♥♥♥♥ing paid you for? Die in a fire.			"

												Really good Submarine Simulator, One of my favorites. This installment is easier for newer players and the graphics are Much better than 4. Lots of things to do and very involved. Great game.The downside to this game is that it is EXTREMELY BUGGY and you will probably encounter several problems before you can even get the game to work properly. If you can get past that you'll be fine.			"

												I do recommend this game but with a MAJOR Caveat. It Can be a pain in the butt to implement.I run windows 8.1 on a pretty powerful gaming PC Bought this game as part of a package deal with SH3 & SH4  Both of those work great right after downloading.  SH5 can be a dud. It REQUIRES an internet update program be running when you launch the game (at least once) That program has caused problems for countless people. (Really, I didn't count them!) I've watched the game in you-tube let's play videos and would really love to try it but so far all attempts at remediating the problems (even following long checklists on subsim.com) have given me no joy. I did FINALLY get the game to play. All I had to do was...Report problem to Ubisoft and plead for help there and in the subsim.com boards, then...1) Uninstall the Ubisoft Game Launcher from the Control Panel2) Go to Program (x86) folder and deleted the Ubisoft Folder containing the Game Launcher Folder3) Run Registry Cleaner & Reboot the system4) Down-load a new Game Launcher from here:http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/675733-Ubisoft-Game-Launcher-Download-Forums5) Reinstall the Game launcher6) Go to the Game Launcher folder & Open the folder and go to the 1st Game Launcher .exe application icon and run as administrator (disabling the proxy option)7) Enter my validation code and got an ubisoft screen with Play Silent Hunter 5 prominently featured in the center .8) Go to the Steam/SteamApps/Common/SilentHunter5 folder and Rightclick on SH5.exe then choose Compatibilty Tab then set the X on ""Disable scaling on High DPI) worked like a dream. (just for good measure I also ticked the box about ""run as admin"")Easy Peasy! Now why didn't I do that right the first time?As to the game-play itself. Life aboard a submarine was tough. This game simulates that. Many may find gameplay to be repetetive at points and at other otherpoints very uneventful. If you're like me you may get just as much enjoyment out of watching others play (hopefully with the boring bits cut out) as from playing it yourself.			"

												I absolutely love this game. Everyone seems to hate on it but i really enjoy it. It's deff not perfect and the UI and controls are a little annoying but its satisfying sneaking up on convoys and sinking them. There are a few issues:- Controls are weird- Ships don't sink even if you put multiple holes in them they seem to have some sort of health bar little lame. i put 2 big holes into a destroyer its hole rear was in the water up to its stacks but was still alive and able to shoot me. It didnt sink over time.- Time dilation makes me crash into things every so oftenI'm going to try some mods but it seems there extra steps you have to take if you own the steam version. It's a cheap game i'd recomend getting it if you like these sort of things.			"

												This game, with freely available Mods installed from subsim.com, really brings home the tensions and flavor of operating a UBoat in WWII.  It is a Fantastic game (as you can tell from the number of hours I’ve played).   But be warned: this is way more than a ""torpedo game"".  You have to survive getting resupplied by sailing thru enemy blockades and patrols, learn to conserve torps by using a deck gun, learn to recharge your limited underwater batteries , learn how to navigate and compute target speeds and course angles, and learn various evasive maneuvers against the  threat of Airplanes, Destroyers, Sonar and Depth charges.  Some of these skills you learn by watching YouTube vids, some by asking others online, and some from the school of hard knocks.  In this regard you can Save and Reload your game to try different engagement scenarios, which is what I do till I perfect the best possible strategy.Out of the box, the game can be played in a simplistic mode, and everybody starts there, but the real thrill comes from learning to take more control of your boat and the little things that make it work efficiently.  This is where the MODs come in.  They can enable things and actually completely transform the game into a serious UBoat simulation.  Principle among skills you’ll need to learn is how to aim and angle a torpedo for real (and there are plenty of YouTube vids that cover this).  The torpedo has its own gyro compass and you can “program” it to turn in almost any direction except directly around and hit your own sub.  Mastering the TDC (Torpedo Data Computer) is key, and  its faithfully recreated in the game.    With it, in the midst of a convoy you can now target and fire at a number of different ships in seeming rapid fire, without turning your sub, as soon as the torpedo tubes are reloaded.Watching your torpedoes propel forward toward their targets can be nerve wracking.  You can watch them zoom off toward their predicted target intercept locations, but sometimes you can't wait to verify a hit... because You’re too busy setting up the targeting solution for your next target while they're enroute.  Thank goodness, you can speed up, slow and even stop TIME, so you can work out what has to be done and in the right sequence.  There's some work involved here which develops into a Confident Skill.  The game becomes addictive then.  There's a big disappointment if some of your torpedos miss, a huge feeling of satisfaction when they all connect.Can’t say enough about the game really.  If you’ve ever had a secret desire to run  your own Submarine, this is definitely it.One last thing, the sea and sky simulations are really beautiful, and I sometimes I take a break and just “ride” my sub on deck and watch the clouds, sunsets, and storms.  Cameras can be moved anywhere, inside or outside the boat, in the sky, even underwater.   Some of the images you get look photo real.  Very very beautiful game. Hope this helps.   "

												Pros:-Beautiful graphics-Arguable better (simplified) manual targeting system than SH3-Time compression is significantly faster than SH3-More Missions-Ability to move around the subCons-Bugged to the point where the game is essentially rendered unplayable-User Interface not as friendly as Silent Hunter 3 where everything was centralizedFinal Verdict:This game had so much potential to be the best Silent Hunter of the series. However, because the game is so bugged, and they seem to have no intention of fixing this broken mess, this makes it that much harder for someone to enjoy the game. It should be a criminal offense to release an unfinish game, as its tantamount to selling a defective product.Unless you are extremely dedicated to fixing this game yourself via modding: Stay. Away. If you are really curious, go ahead and see for yourself. You have been warned. "

												Some nice ideas and graphics are ok, but it is buggy as ****. You will face a nice first campaign but it might happen pretty fast: you are not able to proceed because of a bug in mission saving. It is unbelievable how many times I needed to reload and even restart the game so the real accomplished mission stats where ""approved by the game"". Like others said before me, the developers do not care about the players at all. Ridiculous: you need to use ubisoft launcher with login etc. in order to play the game you bought here. A waste of time!			"

												Didn't even bother trying to play this un-modded, but even with the Steel-whatever-it's-called mega mod, I found it to be buggy and annoying to play. I don't think it looks any better than SH4 which I considered to be pretty great. Don't buy this. Get SH4 instead, or even SH3, both fantastic.			"
