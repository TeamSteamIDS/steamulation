												Surely this is mislabled and supposed to be Early Access.The team has addressed they are working on several fixes. :D on the edge of my seat.The Pro's & Con's----------------------------------Pros1) Colonize Mars!2) Can mine ice!3) The game starts!4) Mo ! gotta love Mo!Cons1) Video settings are currently limited. It shows other resolution options, cannot select them however.2) No real way of setting a base beacon. (Hard to navigate sometimes without compass or anything.)3) Resources are in the same spots everytime.4) Cannot ""Layout"" your base. You click build and it setups the construction plot for you.5) Game breaking bugs.6) No way of ""Free look"" Cannot select groups of people. Have to tab to each one to check their vitals.7) Crew often get stuck walking in place when traveling.I get it #SmallIndieDevTeam. This seems to be an acceptable excuse because, I hear it all the time.For me however this game really does play / feel.. Early Access. I do not recommend this game in its current stage..			"

												This game kinda sucks, poor graphics. It needs more interactive parts, like customizing your base to where you want the modules. Maybe more settings and upgrades per module. Its too simplistic. This game needs large mudules and possibly building that out can build when you reach a certian research level. Eventually all your crew will die. This would be a lot better if we could build to the point of a self sustained community.suggestions-Drilling rigs for underground mining.-Larger maps, with customizable rovers.-Getting to land and choose build locations.-possible multiplayer up to 4 players.-upgrades for each mudule. like air and food production. (types of foods, calories per type of food.)-space station to transfer goods and colonists.-building for the surface.This game is extremely limited.This game has a lot of potential, but the graphics and game play is severely behind the times.

												Very interesting and fun simulation experience, but not without a share of problems.The problems themselves are though just minor inconveniences that might start to annoy you a bit.The biggest problem is the movement of the astronauts and how they decide to get stuck in the martian geography, spin around or phoboswalk near these problematic areas. Also the rover that you can get in the game to help exploration, a goal that it definitely succeeds at, has controls that make you want to go back to Mass Effects Mako.Even though these minor or not so minor problems are there, it doesn't change the fact that the game itself is interesting to say the least.Gameplay is quite basic as  you order Astronauts around to collect resources and data from points of interest so that you can build different modules to the colony and get more funding from Earth.Seems a bit odd that humanity has finally reached martian soil and the bureaucrats are still there to halt the funding process.As you build different modules  you unlock new research options for the colony.In example building a Agriculture module gives you the ability to make food and perform biological sciences.Performing the sciences gives you experience points to allocate to the appropriate research tree, giving you mostly passive abilities to the colony. I.e less food consumption or something else.There is a lot of promise in the game and I definitely recommend taking a look at this when a sale comes around.If you wish to see some gameplay then do take a look at my video below.

												PeriAreion is as flawed as can be. The outdated and ugly graphics are easily forgiven since it's not a game that relies on them. They're perfectly serviceable in fact, everything's easy to identify and that's all you really need. The animations are stiff and awkward, but you know what your little colonists are doing outside the base at a glance. There's no base interior, which I'm thankful for, and the UI for controlling colonists within the base is decent enough.The problems with the game all arise from a feeling that the developer didn't quite know what they were doing. You can tell they studied and researched what's required to colonize Mars, but I find it hard to believe they did the same regarding game design. The control scheme belongs in a 90s game; you can only ever select one colonist at a time and your camera is stuck on that colonist. You can't move the camera around, only just spin it around your unit. This means that if you want to send your little guy over a hill, you first need to send him to the hill side, then on top of the hill, then over it. You have to hold their hand the entire way. There's no easy way to send them back to base either, making managing more than one at a time a pain. Not hard, just annoying and sluggish.The game also comes with one of the worst tutorials I've seen. It's functional, entirely functional, but it teaches you next to nothing. Camera controls; sure. How to left click and right click, how to sort through your little dudes, how to enter and exit the main module, how to give them jobs inside of it. Done. It didn't tell me how to get ice though and, in half an hour or so, my colonists all died from dehydration.Before that the base was a mess anyway. I had to find out that bases needed maintenance only when one of my colonists got CO2 poisoning. At first I thought it must've been a life support issue. I built a tech module which was supposed to give electricity and life support to the whole base, but it changed nothing. It was only when I flipped through the manual that I learned that you need to build a Geology module to do maintenance. At this point, the CO2 poisoning had gotten much worse with that colonist and developed into a broken arm. A few moments in a freshly built medbay would surely have saved her, but I had run out of sulfate at that point, so no go.The sad thing is this game has plenty of cool ideas. Colonize Mars? Dude, yes! Managing a small team of colonists, building a base that'll grow big enough to receive even more. Doing research, exploring on foot and in a rover, surviving the harsh environment. All of this sounds fantastic. There's just not a game to go with it. I hate to say it, but I can't recommend this game to anyone. It's set at $15 USD right now, but I don't think I'd even suggest you check it out if it was free. Sorry. :(			"

												I loved this game when I first started playing it, but then I had one of the workers die because she got stuck on a rock. everything I tried didn't work. I had the rover out and i had four workers working out of it 2 could rest while 2 worked and it worked great till the rover broke down and i had workers stuck in it because ( and this is the funny part it said the ground wasn't level but it was sitting on level ground, before it broke down and the workers were getting in and out of it.)  so two workers died who I couldn't get back to the base and then the other two died when i finally got the rover fixed they got stuck on level ground and died I couldn't do anything about it I even tried hitting them with the rover. it seems like all you do is repair repair repair. achievements don't pop when you achieve them, When you know you have gotten them. I have probably played this way too long trying to give the game chance after chance but a few of my friends gave up on this game 2 hours into it because of the constant glitching going on. I would rather recommend eating dog food out of a can before indulging 1 hour on this game. I have had nothing but glitches going on since day 1 but I really liked the game and how it was put together it was a challenge also because one system would fail right after the other and if there was a storm going my workers couldn't go out and gather resources to fix the problems I mean dang come on with the glitches and poorly done camera operations (oh yeah there is no free camera to move around the map you need to use the tab to switch views on all your people) there is the middle mouse where you can turn the view of the camera angle but it's worthless. I actually really tried hard to love this game but it was just really hard.  I do not recommend this game.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=560882315http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=561008776http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=562142595 "

												EDIT: The developer sent out an email to backers telling us that there has been a significant overhaul of the game and asking that we give it another shot, so I've done so. According to the update, there's improved graphics, a UI overhaul, and a greatly improved research tree. It's been so long since I played that I cannot comment on how improved things are over the original, but I'm still not able to recommend the game.In this version, you still send out colonists and wait for things to happen. But it's still plagued with a series of strange design decisions that make it difficult to play. For example, the camera is attached to whichever colonist you're currently directing. You can rotate the camera, but that's about it. This makes it incredibly difficult to send your colonists to do things far from their current position. The developer also improved interacting with modules, which is nice, but I still have to send my colonist out in the atmosphere if I want to move them from one module to another. What's the purpose of connecting tunnels if the astronauts don't even use them. Lastly, the sound levels are far too low and in game sounds are drowned out by the music. I could probably fix that with the settings, but I didn't feel compelled to look.At this point, I'm still confident that this is not a game for me. I still wanted to like it, which is why I backed it, but I cannot recommend it to anyone without another major overhaul.-----------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEWI backed this game on Kickstarter as I was excited for a colony building simulator, particularly one that has some scientific accuracy. What I ended up receiving, however, was disappointing. The graphics are decent, but nothing special. As others have noted, the gameplay is simplistic: Put your astronaut to do something and wait for it to happen. There doesn't appear to be much to the research tree either. I was particularly disappointed when I ordered a new colonist and they simply appeared outside my module, standing in space suit.I wish the game was better, I really do, but I cannot recommend it in its current state.

												I really like the ideas behind this game but I have to advise against spending 15 euros on it right now if you're expecting a stable and clean game. But if you want to support the team behind it to make it better, please do pay. I did. First I felt bad about paying for this but if giving money means improvements then I don't mind. I hope it happens so I can change my review. Good luck guys :)			"

												Quite an update. I'm into space and I enjoyed the hell out of this. The update handled a mess of usability issues and improved the graphics. The challenge is the game, not the UI. I couldn't help but imagine the book/film ""the martian"" the entire time I was playing.I liked:-Colonizing mars-Lots of characters to pick from-Real science-Several landing sites-Updated graphics-UpgradingI'd like:-Better camera controls-Some way to see the resources of each character without cycling through themSuper Recommended			"

												I've played this game for few hours and I'm not impressed. The game looks like something I'd played 20 years ago. The control is the biggest flaw in this game. The astronauts are constantly get stuck. There is no resources in the map and little support from earth, which make every launch a sucide mission. If you like space sim and have fun with it, I would suggest you get another game like Sol0: Mars colonization or something else (I think I bought that for $4).My final thought.....this game is not worth it.

												I originally received a copy of the Periareion for being a Kickstarter donor and I believe that this updated version of the game is quite an improvement.The art and graphics are much tighter and the game play seems to be a lot smoother. In my original copy of Periareion my crew members kept dying. So far with the new version I have been able to keep my astronauts alive, but I have only been playing CASUAL. Have to wait and see once I get into the high levels.Nice job TBA team.This game is also a great tie-in to National Geographic's Mars series as well as the movie, The Martian.			"

												PeriAreion is a complex survival game on the surface of Mars.  This game does a great job of getting all of the practical science aspects correct.  The creators have done their homework as far as understanding the actual challenges to creating a living community on Mars.  The movement and visuals in the game seemed to flow very well.  There are a lot of variables to consider in order to ""win.""  For this reason, I would say this game is a little more difficult than most games are.  One of the main benefits to purchasing this game is that the developers are very responsive.  They want to create a game that the consumer likes and improve the game accordingly.			"

												This game is more about learning about Mars than actually playing. Just not very fun. The bugs ruin any small enjoyment you might find. Even after multiple patches the colonists still get stuck in the terrain. There are constant issues using the rover in that they either can't exit....or once they do exit they can't get back in the rover. I sent a couple of colonists half way across the map to explore and dropped one off to mine a node. The other I sent a little further to check out a photo Op. He can't get back in the rover. It just won't higlight no matter where I click. He just walks around the rover and underneath it as though the rover doesn't exist. I tried saving and returning and even though I can TAb to the rover I can't manage to get my astronaut back in it. He's in for a long walk home. I would ask for a refund except I paused it for 90 minutes to watch a movie and now I'm over the time limit.			"

												An ugly Unity game. That doesn't bother me, but the interface is also pretty bad. I could live with that, but it's also very buggy.  Really annoying, but I could soldier through because of the interesting subject if it wasn't also real time. So I have time limits while struggling with the bad interface and buggy things refusing to work. When the rover stopped taking people because it was ""full"" without anyone actually on board I had enough. Just left the game running for the cards.The sad thing is that I kickstarted this thing. For less than the current Steam price, but it still stings. Could be that they'll eventually fix the bugs, but I don't think this is enjoyable enough for me to revisit.			"

This bug was never fixed by the developers and according their own words they don´t have intentions to fix it at all. This make the game unplayable and very frustrating for the players. Thus save your money and DON´t BUY THIS GAME unless one day the developers change their minds and finally fix it.			"

												An eye-opening game!I've thought of colonizing Mars as something we may do, later on, somehow. I'm sure they'll figure out how to do it. After playing this game, now I can see that colonizing Mars really is something that we can do. I feel like I can join in on the discussion on colonizing Mars, or at least listen and understand more of what people are saying; understand what's needed, and what the concerns are. I feel like I understand the kind of life the colonists will have, on Mars. After playing this game, my whole view of Mars has changed: it's another place; not all that different from Earth, but without any oxygen, which is kind of a problem. For the first time, I could imagine myself on the surface of Mars, and felt like I could feel what colonists might really experience there. I'm really glad I played this game.From a gameplay perspective: colonizing Mars, is a lot different than playing Sim City. There are different challenges than in other games in this genre. Decisions are much more critical. If you go short on a resource you need: you could easily die. In other games, you can often go short on a resource for a while, and be fine. Not here. When I started losing power without realizing it at first, it lead to a very tense few moments as I struggled to overcome the problem. Then all my colonists died, when I could not fix the problem fast enough. It's something that could really happen on Mars. You have to search for the future problem and fix it before it can become an emergancy, deciding what is and what isn't going to become a majour problem is what really makes this game.It's an easy game to pick up, too. I played without the tutorial, and felt comfortable, fast. I think almost anyone could play this game, and it's truely a great experience for everyone to have. I'm glad I played this game, and I think you will be, too. :)			"

												Take to the red planet with this gem.This game drops 4 astronauts on the red planet in one of 4 (for the moment) regions. Order your people to gather resources, investigate anomalies or other points of interest, extend and maintain your facility and order new people and / or resources from Earth.The interface is simple but effective, don't crowd the screen or intrude with the way of the actual chores / jobs you need to perform. The way the developers chose to build / extend your base leaves much to be desired, as you can only order the construction of a new module and then just assign an astronaut to perform the construction, but you don't get to decide where and how, or even have multiple astronauts speed up the process. This is all fine since it isn't about building a base on Mars, and with the statistics for the astronauts present, which range from temperature, oxygen, general health and radiation, as well as the environmental problems you'll have to cope with, such as landslides, dust storms and the increase in solar radiation during daytime, you will have your work cut out for you.And therein lies the problem that at least I have with this game; It feels a lot like work and there is too much on rails for a game like this. The developers have seemingly tried to compensate by using rendering methods that appear to do a whole lot in terms of making the game choppy and laggy at times, but when you just look at some of the models and effects from say dust storms and such it really doesn't justify such a load on the GPU compared with better graphics and smoother gameplay in other similar projects.On the other hand, there is not a single catagory this game falls in as it really is a simulator of building and maintaining a base on Mars, with all the reasonable problems you could imagine we would face.Definately interesting, not sure if a lot of people will enjoy this game given the limited freedom though.

												This game feels like it is in early access. My colonists are constantly having pathing issues. My achievements don't unlock after I reach the goal (even simple ones like have 7 colonists). I can't even tell if I recieve supplies when I order them (the money is spent, but upon arriving it says I received things like parts and water when I clearly didn't). My research doesn't seem to be having any impact (such as reducing resupply time by 50%, it still takes 3 minutes everytime). None of anything in the game is explained well (such as what the character stats mean or how to get missions). My colonists don't refill their air supply when working inside the colony, only when visiting the starting pod. Well,I also foundout that while they are in a rover they automatically get full air, so it is actually more efficient to stay near a rover indefinitely. Lots of little things that don't break the game, but don't seem like they are working.Then there are the game breaking problems. Once my tech module seemed to be malfunctioning,but no matter how many times I repaired it I still couldn't use it. I did get it to work in the brief window while being repaired, but then nothing again. I fixed this by upgrading the module, but this would kill mywhole game if it was my food that had this problem and I didn't have the resources to upgrade it. Another problem I have is that even though I can save my game, it doesen't seem to remember where any of my people were when I saved. I come back to find my researchers and miner's arbitrarily wandering around my base. This is particularly problematic because the miner's were far afield with rovers when I left. Now to even my rovers back I would have to run them all the way and hope I don't runout of oxygen for them.This game has tons of great ideas and potential, but nothing seems to be fully realized or working perfectly. Unfortunately   this is not an early access game and I don't forsee these large numbers of problems fixed.			"

												I really enjoyed this game for the first hour of play, but after that, I'd seen all there was to see.  It's fun but but has no depth.    I know it's a cheap game, but for the amount of play time you'll get out of it, it's just not a great deal.			"

												Pathfinding is not great. You can't tell characters where to go and what to do unless it is within their line of sight, so a lot of the game is micromanaging each colonist. More seriously, the final structure you need to complete the game spawned on top of a construction site for another structure needed to complete the game, making it impossible for me to complete the building project.  Despite these serious issues with the mechanics, the game is fun and I would recommend it if you can get it on sale.  "
