												This game is gorgeous. Let's get that out of the way first- it is absolutely stunning. And with about three hours put into the game and 100% of the achievements obtained, it's a good game for achievement hunters as well. If you're looking for a pretty game to sink a few hours into, then you could do worse than Sparkle 2 Evo, especially when it's on sale. The sound track ranges from the advertised 'relaxing' to 'wasps in eardrum' noises that made me check my speakers, but that may just be a matter of taste.It's in gameplay itself, and execution, where the game could've been great, but turns out to be just mediocre. In the beginning you're presented with the idea that eating certain types of food within the game will change the way your Spark evolves. This could have been very interesting, with different tactics for different branches, but the only difference in the 'food stuffs' is color. So yes, you can eat a non-meat fish. Maybe it's swimming algae. Even with the vivid color scheme, it can be difficult to tell which of the more advanced creatures correspond to which color without some trial and error.Finally there's the 'boss battles'. The bosses do not fight back, and one of them barely moves- victory consists of slowly nipping suicidally-depressed mega-fauna to death. But hey. It's pretty.			"

												Several others have reviewed this game and said it's based on Spore. I presume they are referring to the very first stage of a Spore game which is just a mini-game. To be accurate, Spore (2008) actually copied flow (2006). Flow was originally a free flash game and was part of the creator's masters thesis.Yes, this game is VERY much like the game Flow on the PS3. But it is not the same game nor created by the same people. The mechanics are largely the same but this game goes for a more complex evolution where there's three different kinds of food (instead of 2) and you have to eat a LOT more to increase your creature's size.You get to look at the creature's stats as it grows and guide them by eating different types of food.If you enjoyed Flow you'll very likely enjoy this game. It's graphicsa are very vivid and colorful. It's slow paced with no set time limits or precise goals, so it's good for just chilling out. There's a few flaws like having to hold down the left mouse button constantly but you can use the keyboard to control it. But really it's quite enjoyable, especially if you are into playign zone/chill games "

												This game is very beautiful! It has 2 modes - single player or competition (against the AI). Single player can become boring very fast, because all you do is eat a certain amount of food (orbs) to finish the stage. Competition mode is fun because the AI actually challenges you and you can only go to the next stage if you win against the AI. But it also can become boring very fast, which didn't happen to me considering the game only has 14 stages and 2 of them are specifics to get achievements. The controls are easy enough most of the time. It can be a little frustrating depending on the evolution of your spark, but easy to manage. The game leads you to believe that your spark will evolve in different ways based on the type of food (orbs) you eat. That's not true. Not only the evolution of your spark is the same no matter what you eat, but you can't actually choose what to eat (not in competition mode at least, since you gotta beat the AI). You can choose what to eat in single player (the game only requires you to eat the necessary amount of food of at least one color), but it makes no difference whatsoever. The game is not worth the full price, but for 90% off I say go for it. You get trading cards and 22 achievements in a few hours. I didn't regret buying it. I suggest you watch a video of the gameplay though, just to be sure.			"

												A fun little game that i had a good time playing. Very cheap, so it is expected for it to be short and sweet. You play as a small bug, that swims around picking up elements to evolve yourself. The more you eat, the bigger and more advanced you become. It is worth the cheap price for a short, but decently entertaining experience.For the achievment hunters, it took me a total of about 3 hours to gain 100% achievments.			"

Sparkle 2 Evo is a casual artistic evolution simulator. Start as a microscopic larva and build your way up the food chain as you evolve based on what you eat.Pros: Graphics are absolutely gorgeous. The game captures the transparency of actual microscope observation, while bathing it in a rainbow of colors. Your stats and appearance changes depending on whether you eat carnivore, herbivore or omnivore matter. You get to confront other microbes in a speed and twirl competition, trying to eat out its weak spots while avoiding its head until it's the only thing left. Music is calm and soothing.Cons: There is no behavior difference between your prey: the exact same creatures simply exists with different colors, making you wonder why a herbivore would eat fish, squids or other animals. You can't die, the extent of risk you face is getting pushed back up one level of depth, or getting a light red glow in the screen if you cannot be pushed up any further. Little replay value: there's a set number of levels with no randomization. There is little complexity over your evolution, and you might accidentally eat matter you wanted to avoid.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itThe game might look and sound exquisite, but there is little more to it. A few hours is all it will take to go through the entire game, do every level and max out your evolution. As it stands, Sparkle 2 Evo doesn't offer enough for me to recommend it.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Sparkle's primary draw is its immersion. Graphically it is a simple but gorgeous aquatic landscape, accompanied by a lush ambient electronica track, which changes as the levels change. It offers some incentive to finish the level quickly as the tracks, as ambient music is apt to do, can become somewhat repetitive and tedious. Movement and speed controls via mouse/keyboard are basic and intuitive, though game controller support would have been appreciated. Gameplay itself is very much a rinse and repeat, but the boss levels and species customization are fun. If Forever Entertainment chose to, they could pump in a few more updates and expand the look and feel of biomes, additional music tracks, and co-op options which could really add to the shelf life of a game like this. Still, I was very pleased. Fun game to chill out to, minimal learning curve, immersive environment, and a solid value at its curent price.			"

												The game feels extremely incomplete, a pale copy of spore's first phase while being much more empty and confusing. The ""controlling one's evolution"" part is a big lie, there is no customization. The fights are slow (and you can't get damaged) and the whole game feels painfully repetitive. Graphisms is the only nice part of the game, but cannot hide the emptyness of the game. A big loss of time.			"

												This game is a nice calm, casual evolution simulator. The graphics are amazing and the controls are rather simple, as diablo 3 / Torchlight 2 player I had no problem whatsoever using only my mouse for more accuracy.You are a little sparkle and have to keep eating to evolve, you can evolve 3 different creatures at the same time. Which is alot of fun. The Music is very calming and the graphics are amazing! Spore players might as well like this game as it is the same as in the beginning of spore, only with better graphics and they never go on land.I got this game on Sale for only 49cents. And I think I never had so much fun on a 49cents game. Also for Achievement / Perfect Game hunters: This Game only got 22 Achievements which you can unlock whilst you playing and exploring the game. Therefore It is very easy to get a perfect game in it!For Tradingcards fans: This game has cheap Trading Cards.Either Way I recommend this game for everybody as it is only very cheap and is alot of fun!

												Sparkle 2 Evo is basically a PC version of Fl0w for the PS3. It's exactly the same in that you're a creature that has to work its way up the foodchain by eating food and enemies that are smaller than you. You'll eventually grow bigger allowing you to eat bigger enemies. Like Fl0w you'll be switching back and forward between 'scenes' trying to find where the food is located. Even the graphics are in the same style. You could say it pays homage to the PS3 game but in my opinion it's just a shameless carbon copy of it. But since we PC gamers are lacking a proper Fl0w I guess this will do nicely in the meantime. It's the only reason I'd recommend this really.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												This a great little game, you could say it's one of those hidden gems.Although the playtime isn't that long, the visuals and music is incredible for a game that (most of the time) only costs 1$You play as a small microorganism climbing the evolutionary ladder by eating one of three microelements:-Red which makes your Sparkle (as your species is called) faster and more manouvrable, however at the cost of eating speed.-Blue which makes your sparkle more balanced in the way of movement and eating speed but sadly looking quite uninteresting.-Green which makes your sparkle incredible at eating with the highest eating speed and a skill that makes your mouth about 5x bigger, however it isn't very fast and his turning speed also ins't too great. However the green sparkle is in my opinion the best looking sparkle.As you grow more and more instead of eating stationary microelements you start encountering species, most of which have ways of stopping you eating them often in the form of a slow trap. others take a long time to be fully eaten and until they are they will keep pushing you a level upwards if you touch their head, and others are relatively peaceful but require you to find a way into their body to eat their guts and finally decapitate them.Each stage of evolution your sparkle evolves visually, at first growing longer and developing a type of sac to show you its road to the next level by the size of it, after that it will grow jaws or in the case of the omnivore it will grow even longer, after that evolution truly branches and  every sparkle will go it's own way, i will not spoil this because they look too beautiful to explain.Though the levels are few (there are only 14) there are 2 optional boss battles, The Squid-Worm and the Octury.The Squid-Worm is a large worm that requires you to eat all of his segments before eating his head, not too hard but it looks great and it's a fun way to show yourself how far you've come in your mad dash to become the top species in the sea.The Octury is a humongous octopus that will make you eat all the glowing orbs on it's tentacles before entering it's head and devouring it from the inside out, though -once more not very challenging it's a huge monster that is great to look at in comparison to your little sparkle.This is a great game and if you like Flow or need something relaxing in your library i definitely reccomend you to pick it up, it's very cheap and there are even trading cards to be gained.

												Sparkle 2 Evo is belonging to a series of games with Genesis and Zero, where you're taking the fate of a little sparkle in your hand. Your goal is to make him evolve and reach adulthood. To do that, your little guy can eat microelements, that will determine towards which category he will fall.Indeed, while you don't have any control over the DNA in itself, you can choose to eat only a single kind of element or juggling between them, knowing that when you're leveling up, you can change your form and by doing so use a special ability.You can be a carnivore (by eating red elements) with a sprint as special power, a herbivore, with the possibility of eating elements away from your mouth (for that, you should search green elements) or an omnivore, with a repulsive ability (the blue element will be your best friend).However, through different worlds, you're not alone. You can find octopus, fishes, etc.. that you can eat. They're also belonging to each color: you will find blue, red and green fishes for example. You're generally alone in the world if you choose the casual mode and your goal is to eat one element until none is left. You can choose to continue to explore the rest of the level, which will allow you to level more.But you can also enable the competitive mode, where other sparkles, controlled by the AI, will fight you for dominance. Your only way to win is to ensure that you ate more elements than them. When you win, you can clear the level as in the casual mode.My great regret in that gameplay is that I don't have a real control over DNA. I can't choose the elements I really want. The only way to do it is to eat only the microelements and when you're in competitive mode, you can't really choose to avoid some elements if you don't want the AI to give you time.Also, some enemies tend to swap layers, with a resulting chase being difficult.The graphics are beautiful. You're really in another world, with bright colors. And the soundtrack is really relaxing.  It's fitting to that deep world.Anyway, Sparkle 2 Evo is a game, despite its flaws, that is very entertaining. If you want a total control over your sparkle and have quests, you should orient yourself towards Genesis. If you want just a sparkle without any goal, without any worry about being carnivore/herbivore/omnivore, head for ZERO. However, Evo and Genesis are the best in the series, so, you can purchase it without any problem.			"

												Evolution is a concept that interests me and I'm sure a lot of other gamers. Sparkle 2 Evo looks like it should be the real deal, but sadly, it's nothing more than a glorified game of Hungry Hippos, if you know what I mean. There's very little strategy to it. It's just a race to see who can gobble down the most of one of three different types of nutrients that turn you into a herbivore, a carnivore, or an omnivore. It's not really any kind of fun and the evolution aspect has no depth.			"

												Sequel to Sparkle Zero, this game features new things such as deciding which way to evolve your creature. You have three choices, Herbivore, Carnivore, or Omnivore. Each of these are represented by a colour found inside in the game.Just like Sparkle Zero, this features a evolving system around your creature, that starts out weak and evolves based on what it eats. The original game and the third are as follows..Recommended for some fun and achievements which are super easy to get and cards!			"

												It's a pretty good game. It's also simple to understand: Eat, grow, eat some more, rinse and repeat for all the levels. The difficulty doesn't really increase, but the areas become larger and there are more elements to collect in each level for completion, as well as a larger array of different kinds of life as you progress. You don't die, but there is a ""Competitive mode"" that times you and pits you against other critters (controlled by AI) like yourself, all trying to gather as many resources as fast as possible before time runs out. That mode isn't fun, but I just turn the option off.Overall, I recommend because it's easy and relaxed, and I had fun with it. Only issue is that it's repetitive once you've done it a single time, so nothing really feels new. It's worth buying at discount, but probably not full price.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo's interesting art style at first drew my attention. Upon inspecting the achievements I could not turn down an easy to complete game as an achievement hunter. In the same night that I bought the game, I completed the game 100%  in around 3 hours.During the course of the game I was not sure if I was expecting more or if I was expecting too much. The mechanics of the game were fairly basic and never evolved a whole lot. There were some interesting levels and others felt like they took too long to complete. The use of layers in the game suits it very well and they used that quite effectively at some points while at other times it felt like there should be layers when there weren't any at all.The mechanic of eating is simple and the evolution based off of that feels somewhat lacking. I did not feel like I was ultimately challenged in different ways because of these changes. As such, the level of difficulty was not remotely close to challenging in my experience. At times, I was not even sure exactly on what I supposed to do in some of the boss levels. Even when I did figure it out, it felt like it took unnessesarily long to wait for the boss to be interactable.So was this game worth it for the amount of fun? I don't feel like I wasted my time due to the achievements I decided to get, but I personally feel like something is missing. I'm not sure what that is exactly.			"

												Not worth the price.I downloaded this game not knowing that it was a lousy port from Android and iOS systems. The graphics show that it isn't native to PC and any resolution larger than 800x600 is going to show every pixel. People have described this as ""not a game"". They are right. But unfortunately it isn't great as art either. I bought it for $5 on sale and I don't think it is worth even that much, at least with how they described it. If they listed this as a port and not as an ""artistic non-game"" I might not feel tricked like I do. I don't know what kind of gameplay other's have experienced but I was unable to evolve my creature, and that was the only interesting thing about this game that would have redeemed it. The soundtrack is awful, and I also don't know what kind of people were saying that it was beautiful and entrancing. It's cheap sounding and doesn't sound at all professional on a decent set of speakers (which I'm guessing is due to the upscaling from iOS to Windows). I think I didn't play this game for more than 20 minutes and I'm already tired of it.			"

												Actually I don´t really know what I expected. I saw the nice graphics and read something about ""evolution"" and thought ""yep, that sounds like a fun game!

I hoped there would be a chance of manipulating the genes, and really have an influence on how your organism evolves but all you do is swimming around in a sometimes kind of psychodelic looking environment (with some kind of coral-structure in between) and search for green, blue or red coloured things your organism can eat. Usually after 5 minutes in a level you have to search for them a lot and maybe I´m short tempered but after 10 minutes I think it´s super annoying. Other people might call it relaxing but I see no point in searching forever for dots. Just to do the same thing in the next level again.I´m not saying it´s a bad game but if you want a game where you can DO something, where you can ACTIVELY evolve and influence something ... go look somewhere else and don´t be fooled by the genre-tag ""action""!

												Sparkle 2 c'est pas vraiment, vraiment un jeu.C'est plutôt un simulateur d'Homer Simpson, l'humour en moins.Bon ok, c'est joli, c'est poétique et les musiques sont belles.Mais il n'y a aucune profondeur de gameplay. Vous devez juste manger toutes (ou pas) les petites boules de couleurs et les créatures aquatiques.Ne vous laissez pas leurer par le ""choix"" donné de votre régime alimentaire. Être carnivore, herbivore, ou omnivore consistera seulement à manger les animaux de couleur rouge, verte ou bleue.C'est un peu comme si un végétarien refusait de manger des fraises parceque c'est cruel, mais ne serait pas contre un bon steak de croco à l'occasion.Bref Sparkle n'est pas mauvais mais pas forcément bon non plus.Jouez-y si vous voulez vous détendre, ou procurez-vous la bande originale et installez-vous dans le canap' avec un bon bouquin, ce sera tout aussi efficace.L'affreux.

												Great game to waste a few hours on, as you can see from my 5 or so hours on it. It was a good game, but unless I missed something the game lacked a bit of story line. Here's a list of my pros and cons about the game.Pros:- Good time waster- Great Value- Compelling gameplay. (I mean come on! You get to eat things and evolve!)Cons: - As I said before, unless I missed something it lacked storyline.- Levels I think 11 and 12 got a little tedious.Not really Cons:- If you like underwater travel, this game is pretty scary.- I almost crapped myself a few times from randomly being nommed on. - You evolve into things that make you go NOPE!Overall, this game was a solid game. 8/10 would swim around eating giant squids, and going in bellies again.

												If you remember the game Flow, then you know this game already.  You are a small sea creature. In the game I mean, I'm not suggesting that you are actually a small sea creature, unless of course you are, which is just fine too.Um, anyway, what you do as this creature is eat things so that you grow larger and evolve.  There is no danger or risk, you just eat as much as you can before the other creatures do, much like a trip to the buffet at an Overeaters Anonymous convention.The graphics are pretty, fluorescent translucent sea life drifts about, waiting for your ravenous maw, and soothing music, such as is played at the bottom of oceans, gently caresses your ears.  The whole experience is kind of like being at a rave where someone secretly replaced all of the Esctasy wth Valium.  I thouroughly enjoyed this game, short as it may be, even though I've never even attended a rave, taken Valium, or eaten a jellyfish.			"

												This game is a missed opportunity. I really hoped from the looks of it that it would be a souped up version of the Micro-organism stage of ""Spore"" -- which was insanely fun and attractive but not complex enough. Sadly, this game is even less so. There are really only three creatures you can be, and while you ""evolve"", it doesn't seem or feel important. You get bigger. This game could have been so much more. I know the price was a steal, but for as good as it looks it's more sizzle and less steak.			"

The music sets a relaxing ambience as you battle for survival.Gameplay----------------------------------Basically, it is a collection game against the AI with an timer. It plays fluid and simple and very straightforward. The graphics and the music is what its all about and it does a great job at that.Verdict----------------------------------A very relaxing and fun game if you need to calm down from your recent rage quit or have a couple of minutes to waste.

But you can make a new character and choose different paths to take. You can also play a mode where you are against an AI character. The way I played it was i leaned my chair back, plugged in a gamepad, and relaxed when I was playing.

Just for Relaxing 3 Hours! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I must say I enjoyed playing this ""game"" (I am still not sure if we should call it this way). It started like ""let's just try this one"" and finished about 3 hours later with the very last boss battle. Problem is this game seems like unfinished!You are supposed to ""evolve"" but after playing for 3 hours trying to figure out the way it worked, I gived up. Let's put it very simple: you just collected colored bubbles and if you get a lot of one color your ""animal"" will change its color and shape. That's all. No real evolving. No real challenges.Game is very easy (you cannot die!), music is unobtrusive and the world is colorful (but requires a hell of a PC at the highest setting). So it's easy to get hooked in.But after 2 hours you will still be wondering ""and now? is this still the tutorial?""... Game itself gives you the response: ""this game is supposed to let you pass some time, it has no real objectives"". Looking at the achievements you will also realize that you have just finished it. Well, thanks for your honesty. Since it's honesty time, I'll unistall you right after clicking ""post review"".Best played with X360 Joypad or MouseRecommended Buy Price < 3$Score 6/10 "

												According to the in-game help, Sparkle 2 Evo has only one goal: To fill your free time and make it fun. It definitely filled my free time although I'm not so sure about the fun part. Soothing music helps to set a relaxed mood while searching for food to eat and evolve. Oh...and there's pretty colors too. Cheaper than LSD, Sparkle makes for a reasonable substitute.			"

												I have purchased this game on the one year anniversary, and 90% off a cheap title was an offer I could not refuse. The game is very fun. It consists of a casual simulation of an evolving life form you control that floats in water and tries to feed itself in order to evolve. The gameplay mechanic is somewhat reminescent of Spore's first stage. The graphics are dreamlike and the art style is impressive, the music sets the ambient rather well and the gameplay concept, although so simple and basic, manages to captivate you for a good few hours. Difficulty wise, the game is incredibly easy but it is meant to be a time-occupier (waster is innapropriate in this context), not a competitive game, although you have that option. While the game is fun, it lacks a few concepts that would have greatly improved it, and it kind of bugs me in a game that is concentrated on evolution: the lack of creature customization, as the creature grows soley based on what type of food you eat, and the lack of an endless mode, where the level is randomly generated. Other than that, it is a great game to spend your ""Im so bored"" time, and though not perfect, a great indie title.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo. The second part of the ""Sparkle-trilogy""; a series of so called ""Evolution simulations"". I own all three included ""games"" and I want to review them all. I have already recommended the first, no, the ""Zeroth"" (don´t know whether this word exists) part, because of it´s epic looks. Previous point is basically the mark of all three games; epic visuals but, well, questionable gameplay. Evo comes up to those too, but with some changes which disturbed me in some ways. So now I am heading to describe the game a little.There are just three aims in Sparkle 2 Evo: Eat, grow, evolve. That´s it. So for this nothing changes. And here comes the publishers´ ""clue"": Competetive mode. Yes, that´s as hillarious as it sounds. You are ""fighting"" against an AI in matches lasting WAY too long. The one eats more stuff ""wins"" and if that´s you, you´ll unlock the next stage, which is basically the same as the previous, just with new colors and soundtracks. Wait, there´s annother way to obtain your progress, next to competetive mode: You can also eat EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF NUTRIENS on the ENTIRE map. Because of the ""innovative"" controls, that are as precise as my aiming in CS:GO, (trust me, you don´t even want to see me using the AWP) that can easily take you 20 minutes of your precious lifetime. Okay, just joking, but not lying. Annother negativ fact are the ""enemies""... They CONTAIN the nutrients you need to win the level, but there´s always just one way to get them. And if you fail by half a visual milimeter, you´ll be pushed into annother layer of the ""Abyss"" (that´s what the game-world is called) over and over again... Unfortunately your AI oponnent has better luck with that.The only two things GOOD about this game are the visuals, as usual, and the fact you get the soundtrack for free. It´s not a extraordinary good one but at least a nice deal to compensate the EULA, which only says ""No EULA, just have fun""...Is there really need to discuss about this anymore?What I had almost forgotten to mention is, that Sparkle 2 was developed by other guys as Sparkle 3 and Zero were. They didn´t do a bad job (in relation to the other two games) but they also didn´t really make it better. As for normal, achievements are gained by progress and evolution isn´t only useless but also it does only depend on what color the food you eat has. Yeah, pretty much like in the other games. Sincerely, Titanic21; 21th December 2016; 9:12 pm; CET. (Just don´t take me too serious as for this review. My opinion is honest, but the rest is not.)			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is a casual game. You are an ocean dwelling creature. You eat and grow. There are basically 3 colors of food. Which color you consume the most will determine the type of creature you'll become:- red (carnivore)  => you'll move fast but eat slowly- green (herbivore) => you'll eat fast but move slowly- blue (omnivore) => medium movement speed and medium eating speedAt first red, green and blue blobs just float in the ocean and you eat them to practice the movement of your creature. In later levels, you'll encounter other sea creatures in a variety of shapes but basically you always need to stay away from their head (or they will push you away) until you've eaten what parts of their body you can eat, and then go in for the kill by eating their head. You can play the game in two modes: competitive mode (default) or 'casual mode'. I strongly suggest leaving competitive mode on and only switching it off if you find the game too hard, which isn't very likely. You see, the game gets pretty easy once you figured out how it works. You start at the top layer' of the ocean. You will see radar 'pings' in red, green or blue telling you in which direction there is food of that color. When you don't see any pings anymore, you go down to the next layer and look at your screen for radar pings. Again you hunt and eat until you don't see any pings anymore, then you go down to next layer and so on. If you want, you can focus (more) on one type of food to become your preferred creature type (carnivore, herbivore or omnivore) but in my opinion that is something better left for casual mode because in competitive mode, it's better to just eat everything you find.The graphics are very nice. The music is very subtle and fitting. The Steam Achievements are easy to complete (you'll most likely complete them before you complete the game, unless you happened to miss something). It's a nice game to play for a few hours but don't expect something it's not. Don't expect a twitchy action game or a puzzle-like game that will challenge you for dozens of hours. If the game looks like something you might enjoy, I recommend giving it a go, especially if it's on sale.			"

												This game is a weird mix of the early stages of Spore and flOw from the PS3 were you play a creature that evolves by eating different coloured orbs and you move on from stage to stage buy eating enough of them and improving on your creature. Mostly played in the games casual mode and when doing that the games really goes super casual and was an alright passtime while listen to podcasts and music. For me it was never more then a timewaster.Most achievements will be thrown at you for simply progressing and the only stuff that will take some extra focus is beating the two bosses in the game and both of them are things you simply can't fail on...you just need to spend enough time on them to figure out how to beat them. Very easy game to complete.Time to 100%: 3 hours			"

												Interesting game but still feels somewhat static. (Don't expect Spore Cell Stage nor Flow)As someone with a great intrest for evolution and with a weak spot for every game that tries to simulate evolution I had to try this game. At first sight this game reminded me of Flow (awesome game), and not as much of the Spore Cell Stage as others where saying. If you're expecting a game like Spore, don't buy this game. Due to the beautiful and original visuals the game feels wonderous, mysterious and very alien. But nonetheless the first few stages of this game are very boring and confusing (imo). You're really waiting for stuff to happen, but instead you only get to eat blue, green and red balls untill you ate enough of them to finish the stage. After eating enough of these balls, you'll level up and you're creature will change it's form, but that doesn't really feel like evolution.After a few stages of boringness other creatures start to appear you can eat, even bosses you can eat and defeat. This was quite a (positive) surprise to me. At this point I realized there was atually some challenge to this game. See, throughout the game you've got a 'nemesis' who will try to eat as much as it can, just like you, after you or you're nemesis has prodominemntly ate most of the food in that particular stage, one of you will win. I think that is pretty cool and original.What's also a cool aspect of this game is that your creature will gain all kinds of stats that will improve your creature performances, I haven't played around with that much so I don't wan't to say to much about it. But I think that is part of the game that is meant to be the evolution part. I feel like this game needs more polishing, it just doens't feel complete. I would like to see more evolution aspects and more challenge, that isn't repetitive.  "

Was it worth the money? Well, yes and no. Yes - because the game looks good and it's core concept is fun. No - because it gets repetitive fast and the mechanics are chaotic (went through 8 levels before figuring out there are skills you can activate). Overall - it is up to you, this game is not gonna amaze you but can fill out a couple of hours. For me it is on the edge ... but I do end up recommending it if you find it on a sale.			"

												This game plays fairly similar to the first stages in Spore, but offers a longer timeline and deeper immersion in the microscopic evolution. I haven't progressed to far, but the options for replayability seem pretty limitless, which is important to me in a game. The artwork is elegant and aethestically pleasing. The sound is sufficient for the game. While the controls are not the most intuitive the game plays well anyway. I bought this with a badge coupon and think I will get more than my moneys worth for it. Likely, I won't spend whole weekends playing, but I'll likely be popping back into this game periodically to get some relaxing gaming in.			"

												Imagine a scenario where you and your best friend went to an all you can eat buffet, then your friend made a bet on who could chow down the most before the restaurant ran out of food. Except the buffet is not a buffet but a pond, your friend is not human but your exact clone out to ruin your day. Rinse and repeat this for 15 levels and you will get a pretty accurate picture of what this game entails.Honestly, it was fun for the first hour and mildly relaxing, but then the repetitiveness mounted quickly after. Controlling your evolution seemed great on paper, but it mattered little in terms of game play. The same goes for the varying types of creatures you fight before devouring, they look nice on screen but that’s all there is to them, since you can’t die any form of strategy was immediately thrown out the window.The two boss stages felt tacked on as well, almost like a prove of concept rather than a sequential part of the experience.Get this in a discount sale only, not even if you’re filthy rich.

												I'm not sure about this one - it's pretty and useful for filling up those random little time gaps, but it doesn't really get one invested.  The gameplay is pretty much hunting for various bits of food and gobbling them down.  For the perfectionists, the gameplay is hunting for various bits of food of the same colour and gobbling them down.The 2 boss creatures are pretty cool once you have them figured out - frustrating until you do figure them out.Works well on a touchscreen device.Did I enjoy the game? Yes.  Is it worth the price? Yeah, I think so.  Will it be on my top 10 list for the year? No			"

Relive your mis-spent youth of tripping out on lsd and magic mushrooms with this - its cheaper and safer and really good fun.It is basically a snake game wherre you eat other stuff to make yur snake grow bigger and nastier until you are the Apex predator. It is a great concept using very old and unoriginal gaming techniques to create a slightly newer more psychedelic experience. Relaxing and not at all stressfull in anyway its a great little program to while away the odd 30 mins here and there and also is awesome for little kids to play too - (my four year old loves it). "

												Looks better than it plays.You can either choose normal mode, which lets you win the levels when all of 1 color are eaten, or competative mode, which is basically trying to eat most of everything on the level before the AI version of you can.I didn't feel like the colors were explained very well, as you usually ended up eating a bunch of creatures in the game, regardless of whether you chose the green 'herbivore' or not.So basically you just swam up and down in the levels trying to find your favorite color, which could get frustrating as sometimes the creatures you needed to eat would swim outside the map. Also some of the creatures of the other colors (one of the slugs I think) would sometimes carry your color, but not flash to show it.3/5			"

												This is a in between game. With in between I want to say it is a good time waste if you need some relaxing fun. If you are a powergamer, this game isn't for you. You'll fly through the levels without much thought and won't even see the fantastic artwork that the designer set the game in. You'll try to evolve, get bigger and the largest critter in the pond. But don't mistake this game for a ""Spore"" spinoff or something even related to it. You'll grow by eating other life, and you have to be careful to not be eaten yourself. If you want a Spore-like game, buy Spore, but leave this game alone. It is more an complex and animated version of a circle of life sim, and it is very casual.The artwork and the music have drawn me into this game, the simplicity and reasonable learning curve of the game were some interesting things. And it was at the time I bought it very cheap. When you buy this game and want to play it, take your time and play it slowly. There is so much to discover, see and hear. Alone the soundtrack is marvelous and fitting for the game.			"

												Beautiful evolution simulation, depending on what color resources you eat, your organism will change shape and acquire abilities. There are around 10 levels available, and each level is filled with resources and other organisms you can eat. At first I thought that you just eat everything, but it's best to eat one color resources, so you evolve further. Green resources make you bigger and slower yet you can eat faster, red ones make you move faster yet reduce your eating speed, and blue ones are in between.Game is fun little time killer that is around 3 hours long with easy achievements. Only thing required to play is mouse and ability to see three colors (red, blue, green). If you get grossed out by bugs and crawling things with tails and tentacles, then check in game footage beforehand. Otherwise it's nice little game.			"

												(I've received this giveaway key from Indiegala long ago and forgot that I even had the key there....huh....)Welcome to the Microorganism: A vore game.I originally opened this game blindly and without even knowing what to expect from the trailer.  I was pleasantly surprised to see what Sparkle 2 Evo had to offer.  It's a plug-n-play title simply about devouring other organisms.  The best part about it is how beautiful the graphics look from the microorganisms to the subtle smoke some enemies emit.My biggest complaint is that one of the ""bosses"" is rather vague with the controls and that the enemy AI is pretty dumb most of the time.  I also didn't know any real benefit between elements as I just ate all of them blindly.  This game is also pretty quick to finish within just a few (2-3) hours and the replayability is low unless you want to play casually.Is Sparkle 2 Evo worth the purchase?  For $5, it's a bit pricey for what you're getting.  I would say to wait for a sale, when you'll find it going for approximately $0.50.  It's short, cheap, and an easy 100%.8/10    I'd rate it higher, but I'm afraid a microorganism ate the rest of the score.			"

												This is such an amazing little game with beautiful graphics, soothing music, and simplistic gameplay.The tutorial is short and covers the basics but problem I found out is that in later levels the game leaves you to figure out how to continue to grow by eating the blue, red, and green item things from other much larger organisms which is not a big deal but a little annoying that the tutorial didn't cover that fact.overall great game if you want to relax but remember that in later levels eat other enemies as long as you can see the little organism things somewhere on their body.

												I went in EXPECTING a smart-phone game, and since I paid a ""smart-phone game price"" while it's on sale, I can't say that I'm disappointed at all. I loved Spore, and yes, as so many other gamers have pointed out, this is quite exactly like the first 15 minutes and stage of evolution in the creature/4x game Spore.I had hoped the music would be something that would surprise and impress me. But it's some of the most, mellow, ambient of all the mellow ambient music out there. And that doesn't have to be a bad thing, but there just isn't as much variation as I'd have hoped to hear.The visuals, to me, are really impressive. It feels like yesterday I was playing pop-stations and tiger handhelds trying to wring a few grams of enjoyment out of them. Now I'm playing a game that looks like the closest thing I've played to what I always expected ""virtual reality"" (in a wire-frame style) to look like. I really like it's look.The gameplay is a little numb, but no more so than say PacMan, and I loved PacMan.I have hit a bug in what little time I've been playing though. I didn't expect to find any, but since the controls are a little bulky feeling and I can't get the ASDW to work, I often barrel right into obstacles, and I accidentally buried my little guy into what I guess was some kind of paralyzing jellyfish thing that was caught in a whirlpool with the tide pushing me further and further into the jellyfish. After about a good minute and a half of me anticipating some kind of glitch out of where I was stuck, my little germ rocketed up and appearently clear out of the level. Everything raced by and once it finally slowed down, it turned around and restricted my movement to normal speed and only back towards where I came from. I waited about 5 minutes but never made it back to the play-field before giving it up for the time being.Get it while it's on sale, I might've been a little unhappy with a typical purchase of Sparkle2Evo, but as demonstrative games go, this one is a decent enough piece of eyecandy that I've so far enjoyed.

												Fantabulous game. I enjoyed it but i wish there was some more explanations to certain things. I also wish there were a way to evolve your creature differently. It seemed that each type of organism always had one outcome. They all ended up being things that looked like a centepide, moth, and a mosquito. If there were a way to perhaps combine the elements that were used the most, that would be wonderful. Another thing was the gene lab. It seemed logical yet i couldn't dicipher how to fully optimize my creature. It also would have been cool to have mutations. Perhaps somehow having two heads or being a carnivore with the ability of one of the others. Add some randomness to the game. Also was there ever a first one? If not, I'm looking forward to a second one. :D

												Beautiful evolution simulation, depending on what color resources you eat, your organism will change shape and acquire abilities. There are around 10 levels available, and each level is filled with resources and other organisms you can eat. At first I thought that you just eat everything, but it's best to eat one color resources, so you evolve further. Green resources make you bigger and slower yet you can eat faster, red ones make you move faster yet reduce your eating speed, and blue ones are in between.Game is fun little time killer that is around 3 hours long with easy achievements. Only thing required to play is mouse and ability to see three colors (red, blue, green). If you get grossed out by bugs and crawling things with tails and tentacles, then check in game footage beforehand. Otherwise it's nice little game.			"

												(I've received this giveaway key from Indiegala long ago and forgot that I even had the key there....huh....)Welcome to the Microorganism: A vore game.I originally opened this game blindly and without even knowing what to expect from the trailer.  I was pleasantly surprised to see what Sparkle 2 Evo had to offer.  It's a plug-n-play title simply about devouring other organisms.  The best part about it is how beautiful the graphics look from the microorganisms to the subtle smoke some enemies emit.My biggest complaint is that one of the ""bosses"" is rather vague with the controls and that the enemy AI is pretty dumb most of the time.  I also didn't know any real benefit between elements as I just ate all of them blindly.  This game is also pretty quick to finish within just a few (2-3) hours and the replayability is low unless you want to play casually.Is Sparkle 2 Evo worth the purchase?  For $5, it's a bit pricey for what you're getting.  I would say to wait for a sale, when you'll find it going for approximately $0.50.  It's short, cheap, and an easy 100%.8/10    I'd rate it higher, but I'm afraid a microorganism ate the rest of the score.			"

												This game is a yes if it's on sale. It's basically a remake of Fl0w (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(video_game)) but with more levels and stuff (at least compared to the original free Flash version of Fl0w). It's pretty good, I guess, and sometimes it's really pretty. But... it's a little less soothing and and chill than Fl0w was. This game does seem to do more and be more than Fl0w, but it's just lacking that same feeling of Fl0w.Overall, it's not bad, and I can recommend it to pass the time. But, for those of you who are expecting Fl0w, just be aware that you might not quite be getting it with this.			"

You'll get bigger, advance though the 30+ levels and have a better time doing it than you'd think. The controls are easy, just a mouse button and a few keys.An interesting twist to this game is the multi-dimensional element. You have to consume species on 1 plane and then you can trigger dives to navigate to another plane. Pretty fun idea that is easy to control.

												As many others have said--Sparkle is gorgeous.  Unfortunately, the gameplay is one part pac-man and one part screensaver--there's no risk and therefore no challenge; you can't be harmed, you can't die, you can't lose your progress and nothing tries to hunt you down or harrass you.  I understand that there's an element of ideology here, and I respect the movement toward peaceful gameplay (like the freeware Floating Point); but that model isn't well-matched to a game ostensibly about about predation and survival.The idea of branching choice-based evolution--which could have been outstandingly interesting--seems to have been implemented as a hard three-path trinary without significant middle ground between paths.  From what I can tell, if you spend two hours as an exclusive herbivore and switch suddenly to a carnivore diet you don't develop small carnivorous features; you just morph directly into The Carnivore Model for that level of gameplay.I was hoping for a dreamier, more abstract kind of Spore; Sparkle didn't deliver.

												I got this on a sale and mostly bought it for Steam Cards, but it turned out to be a lot more fun than I expected.It's essentially a relaxing bacteria simulator where you play as an evolving organism collecting elements of various colours in order to evolve yourself. The game features a competitive mode and various levels of achievements and has hours of (albeit repetitive) gameplay.It's a perfect casual game and for the price I can't complain.

												I got this when it was dirt cheap, I had less than one dollar in my steam account, and I still had money left over afterwards, and then it was worth the buy.At 4.99, it is not.It's similar to spore's cell stage, but with none of the complexity of Spore's very simple creature design, all changes are cosmetic and happen automatically.  But the cell stage and this game are different, so i will try and avoid comparing them.  As for the gameplay itself, it's very simple, move the creature around, eat colored pellets.  The colored pellets change how you look.  There is little to no variation between eating the red pellets, the green pellets or the blue pellets besides how they make your creature look.  Sometimes other creatures have red pellets attached to them, but since nothings stopping you from just eating all three, there's no real point in chasing them down unless you're looking for specific designs or trying to follow a specific route, which still, has no effect besides design.  The hitboxes for the environment and for creatures is kind of strange, it always seems bigger than the actual image.I'm not really sure what it's supposed to be.  I would say it's a time waster, but it has a specific amount of levels and isn't engaging enough to make me lsoe track of time.  I would say it's a simple puzzler, but the 'puzzles' only consist of figuring out how to get food from other creatures, and is optional.  I guess it could be called a relaxer, but I never really felt relaxed the entire time, the music is the only bit pointing towards that, and some of the tracks aren't built towards that idea at all.I guess the game looks nice, but the charm is short lived, andthe art style can't hold up an entire game when everything else seems to be lacking.

												I got this on a sale and mostly bought it for Steam Cards, but it turned out to be a lot more fun than I expected.It's essentially a relaxing bacteria simulator where you play as an evolving organism collecting elements of various colours in order to evolve yourself. The game features a competitive mode and various levels of achievements and has hours of (albeit repetitive) gameplay.It's a perfect casual game and for the price I can't complain. Definitely recommended.			"

(Ooo, oooo) This game kinda feels and looks like spore tho, but only the good part when you eat and grow and collect other beings to become the beast in the sea. Honestly, good simple fun. Start small, get bigger, dont get ate now, some cells are larger than the player. With a multielement setting and dna customizations, your ""itling"" is yours to love and grow.

												I suppose one of the developers was playing Flow and got briliant idea ""Hey, lets make the same game, but better!"". And they did.. Unfortunately, this one is not better. It is not even as good as the first flash version of fl0w was back in 2006 or so. And that one was free.. Controls (mouse or kb, no pad support) are not responsive, everything moves annoingly slow and there are no real enemies or anything that would give you a challenge. Most of the time you just slowly swim around and eat evolving pills or harmless creatures. Even two available ""boss"" encounters are boring as hell.I've made myself to finish this game, just to see how will my ""sparkle"" evolve and I really regret it.If you really want to play game like this and have not tried Flow before, go and play Flow. If you've already played Flow and are looking for something just like that, go and play Flow again. Sparkle is not the game you are looking for.			"

												This game is an iPhone port with forgettable music, bland/repetitive graphics and confusing game mechanics. The first 10 minutes were fun but that's about it. The controls are frustrating and there's a cooldown at which you can absorb species (the little orbs) so you keep going past them and then you have to go back all the time.My advice is to look up gameplays first unless you are familiar with the genre, if you buy this game after looking at the screenshots you might be disappointed, because the game does indeed look fun until you are in control.There is litterally no challenge in this game. It's super easy, I have never lost a level in the ""competitive mode"" and I finish the game entirely. About 2 hours of gameplay to finish the entire thing. I do not recommend this game, I find it really boring.			"

												Forgive my lack of words to describe this game, other than ""extremely lame"".I was hoping for something similar to the creature phase of ""Spore"" just expanding upon the idea a little but was bitterly disappointed.There is no Evo(lution) whatsoever in the gameplay of Sparkle 2 Evo, only the graphics change slightly (they do sparkle nicely though). Also it does not make any difference, whether you play as carni-, omni-, or herbivore, other than having to collect a different colour of food bits, that lie around the map, doing nothing. You can't attack your opponent or have to protect from him, your playable little worm does not gain any traits and so every level and the goals are pretty much the same every time and the whole thing gets repetitive and boring incredibly fast.Don't be fooled to buy it only because it's dirt cheap while on sale - that doesn't make your time spent on it more worthwhile.

												Very similar to Spore's first phase in which you're a micro-organism swimming around in goo looking for food, and while that section wore out its welcome only by the time it was over in that game, that is entirely what Sparkle 2 Evo is about.Maybe if you're the type who wants to mull about within something that looks visually interesting, this game'll be for you, but there's very little going on from a mechanics perspective, and what is there becomes dreadfully dull very quickly.The price-point is cheap, but there are better games out there to be had for cheap prices nowadays.

												While this game isn't bad, persay, i  didn't do anything especially interesting to keep me playing for more then a half hour at a time. The visuals are some what nice, if not a bit painful to look at after long periods of time. The actual gameplay consists of playing as a long serpent-like creature that swims around and eats certain food items to gain a specific trait. In the end, it feels like the cell stage in Spore, only a bit watered down. For five bucks, there are much better games. I might reccomend it if it goes on sale, but even then, a game like Terraria when it goes on sale is almost always going to be a better purchase. "

												Do you remember Flow, the old game that was intended as part to demonstrate an idea by the authors about how humans can enter workflows where productivity is effortless, and how work environments should be designed to avoid interrupting that Flow? It was a simple, enjoyable pac-man sandbox that was meant more to make a point than to really be a full fledged game. They did not charge for it.Well, Sparkle 2 Evo is a more fleshed out version that game, for money. The problem is that they completely missed the point. This game has objectives that can act as sources of frustration, and like discrete levels that interrupt gameplay. That isn't neccessarily bad, you don't have to take too much after your inspiration, although I'd argue in this case it was.Is it a good game? No, not really. It's definitely fun enough but the fact that they somewhat missed the point of what they copied does make for a somewhat worse experience than what you'd get if you just googled ""flow in games"". However, it's not a bad game either.The music is quite decent, but the main thing the game has to recommend it is how it looks. Sparkle 2 Evo is a decently pretty game and being pleasant to look at seems to be a large part of the point of this game.If you're looking for any kind of challenge, don't get this game. This game exists because of a few goals added on to a design for a sandbox with difficult that was totally determined by what the player chose to pursue in real time.In the end, I'm recommending this game because there's no ""meh"" option, and because they took the effort to port it to Linux. Along with the price, that sways the balance toward ""recommend"".			"

												A complex game on the surface, but most of this complexity comes from lack of a suficient tutorial. This game is more acuratley described as puzzle than simulation as most of the challenge from this game comes from finding out how to eat the creatured strewn through the play area. Evolution in this game is a very loose concept and doesnt seem to have any permanant or even significant effects. The action in this game is almost non-existent, with ai opponents which in no significant way interact with you, and serves as what can most accuratley be described as a time limit.			"

												SHORT VERSIONPick it up for five euros and have a game that you can whip out for 20-30 minute sessions whenever you want to relax a bit.LONG VERSIONThe art is gorgeous and the beautifully animated sealife is sure to dazzle you at first glance. It comes with a soothing soundtrack to match its visual style. However, the gameplay is repetitive which is both the game's strong and weak point. It doesn't offer anything more beyond what you do in the first level (swim around, eat other organisms, sometimes evolve) but because of that it's  easy to understand and get into. The number of evolutions boil down to three (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore) per developmental stage so there's not much to play around with. You follow the pulsating lights to find food and once you have found it, you feed by simply swimming through it. You win by eating a set amount of food which can get tricky if you are a slowpoke and let other creatures nab your dinner. There are standard, static food such as algae and floating bits of meat but the higher level prey have fun little gimmicks to them. As an example, if you want to consume a baby squid you first need to snip away at its nervous system on the front then the poison glands on the back before it's weakened enough to be gobbled up.The best feature of the game is the inclusion of an optional non-competitive mode which removes the other hungry contestants so you can hunt for food at your own leisure.

												This game seemed amazing at first. A spore-like game. It looked like a beutiful game. Turns, out, none of these things are true. Turns out none of these things are true. This first one might be personal preference: The Graphics. The game has a very confusing layout as it is, and the super-bright colors and odd and confusing perspective don't help much. The game gets old fast, and it becomes more of a challange to figure out which height you are on than the game you are meant to be playing.I give this game a 4/10. Core mechanics are flawed. It has potential, but it needs an major update that will probobly never happen.			"

												This is very similar to the 2006 game, ""flOw"". You start off as a kind of microbe who swims around and eats things. As you eat, your body fills out, and once you're filled out all the way to the tail, you level up and your tail gets longer. Depending on what you eat the most of, you develop different stats and eventually skills. It's a very simple game without much to think about. You just swim around and eat. Some of the things you eat try to fight back, but not too hard.If you like 'zen' games, where the goal is relaxation rather than entertainement, then this is a good one.			"

												First of all, the tutorial assumes you are using a keyboard and won't tell you mouse controls until after you use the keyboard. So not really good for Big Picture users. It also doesn't support a gamepad at all so so much for the relaxing part. I have to be hunched over my keyboard.Next it genders my sparkle as he/him.... it's just a damn microorganism and yet I am still playing a male protagonist. That's when I deleted the game and won't be buying the sequel.			"

												It is described in genre as: Action and Simulation but this game is not really either of these. Nothisg really kills you, so no action in there; this game is no where near simulation. The only part of it that pushes you to try harder is the ai that tries to pick more points, and fater than you. In that regard it's like a racing game, sort of, since when you reach a certain point count, you win. It's really casual, as much of what you need to do to get points is to gobble up as much food as you can, and little strategy or tactics to do that except to do it fast.The other thing that bugs me is the class system, there are the carnivores(red), the harbivores(green), and a blue class i'm not sure about. This game is barely tries to stay accurite to these classes as all of them can gain their colour points by feeding on other organisems. carnivores will often eat inanimate red sphreres too.4One might think that in such a game, where it pretends to simulate an evolution the traits of one class will hold throughout the game... Well this is not the case since every time you level up you might change your appeaence to the other class, seemengly at random. Sometimes the visible traits will transfer to another form, line the carnivore's tail, but it still quite un logical. The only thing that does pass are the mechanical traits, like carnivore's speed, or herbivores agility.If you're looking for a beautiful casual arcade game, this is it.If you're interested in an action, or a simulation, do yourself a favour and pass.

												The game is beautiful and the music is nice, but the gameplay is lacking.  This is a casual game, not meant for people looking for anything deep or innovative, just a little something to waste some time on your phone while waiting for a bus.You evolve your creature by eating either red, green or blue food elements, and the different colors influence how your creature evolves.  These food elements are scattered around the environment and are supposed to evolve you into either a predator, herbivore or omnivore, respectively.  Consuming different amounts of each color produces different visual combinations on your creature, but no change in gameplay.Whether you evolve as a predator, herbavore, or an omnivore, you still guide your creature around eating food elements.  You don't actually become a predator chasing down fast prey.  You never become an herbivore, swimming around to avoid predators.  You never become an omnivore.  No matter what you do, the game is the same: guide your creature around the world eating pellets.  Nothing is hunting you, nothing is trying to fight you off, prey does not illude you, and your competition AI never attacks you, so there is no reason to evolve in any particular direction.Really, the whole challenge is in the controls.  This game was designed for touch screens, and I imagine playing it on a tablet or phone would be incredibly difficult.  I played it with a gamepad, and that made everything too easy.  The difficulty should not stem from the controls.Still, if you're looking for a casual expeience that's beautiful and a challenge on a touchscreen computer, this is all right.  For the rest of us, it's boring and shallow.			"

												I went into this game expecting some variety and cool boss fights. then once I started playing it, I just ended up doing the same thing over and over and over again. maybe Spore's ""Cell stage"" has spoiled me. the idea of genetics was a great idea, until I realized that you cant controll or customize anything. the particles you eat don't even make sense! herbivores just end up eating anything green even if it is a worm or jellyfish... same for the omnivore and canivore. I expected herbivores to at least eat things off of a plant like material. the boss fights are a joke. for one, if you take any damage there is no harmful effect other than you just spiral away a little bit. and secondly, the bosses barely do anything! you just end up doing what you have been doing the rest of the game before that.... eating small colored particles off of the boss until it just magically blows up into a blue slowing cloud. TLDR: everything sounds awesome until you play it and see that it is just a good looking and has worse mechanics than your typical flash game. a waste of money.			"

												This is a game that is meant to be played ""casually"".  While the game has multiple z-axis ""planes"", it is a game largely played on a 2-dimensional field, where you basically just guide your little critter to eat things until you grow up.  There are three ""paths"" to go down, which you traverse through eating colored blobs of three colors. There are two modes.In the non-competitive mode, you basically just get dumped on a map, and get told to eat everything of one color to go to the next map.  There's essentially no way to lose, but to quit, which I suppose is what makes it ""casual"", and it's not like games need to be hard to be enjoyable, but there's no particular story, here, to make the world more compelling without it.  There's some ""exploration"", just to see all the different critters, but once you have seen every level, you've seen everything the game has to offer.In the ""competitive mode"", you have an AI-controlled critter competing with you for food, where victory is measured in hogging more food than the other guy can get.  While hypothetically, this means challenge and desperately trying to hunt creatures for food faster, regardless of color, in practical effect, you can just stay green and vacuum up everything far faster than your opponent, since the extra bits of food from dividing food pieces all count to your total, and you can consume more food from critters than the game expects to count. In general, I could eat several times more food than the opponent, and never once seemed like I was in trouble unless I completely abandoned attempting to eat for a while.  The big choice in the game about which critter to be is somewhat defeated by the imbalance in the practical use of the different criters.  The ""carnivore"" red is quick to accelerate, and gets a ""dashing"" skill to ""attack"" other creatures.  The ""herbivore"" green (and I put ""herbivore"" in quotes because you still hunt and eat other animals, you just want to eat the green ones) has faster eating time (making it so you can eat as fast as you ram through food, rather than skipping over food for a second or so) and has a super AoE suction attack that consumes all food in the area.  The ""omnivore"" blue (which, somehow, eats a different food entirely from both carnivores and herbivores, rather than just eating both in roughly equal measure,) gets a better turning radius and a defensive sound skill that makes creatures flee from it.Hypothetically, in a game where combat mattered, the difference between an attack skill, a defense skill, and a resource-gathering skill might mean something, but since all you do in this game is eat, the herbivore skill is fantastically useful and makes the game significantly faster and less frustrating, while the omnivore defenseskill is useless since you need to hunt critters, rather than have them flee you, and the carnivore dash attack is pointless since the only enemies that run from you do so across the z-axis, which the dash will not go across.  Ultimately, I recommend this game only on sale for the sheer color and fascination of it.  It's odd and interesting, and worth looking at, and on sale, you can get it dirt cheap enough to justify buying it for aesthetics alone, but there isn't enough actual gameplay to keep you in it.  This is a game you can completely ""play out"" and feel you've experienced everything it can offer in just a half-dozen hours.			"

												A game that was heavily inspired by the game flOw.The core concept sounds fun and should be enjoyable, the gameplay is marred by horrid controls and really imprecise movement. You feel like you're trying to guide a tank, not a snake-like organism.Similar to flOw, there are multiple layers you can transit through in each section. Each layer contains various other enemies and DNA strands you can consume. The different types of DNA alter your creature's genome, enabling different characteristics. This concept is central to the game, and quite innovative.The visual design is superb, with great design cues for the various creatures. The environment feels bare, but that can serve to help focus your attention.Music is relaxing and sounds are unobtrusive.With better implemented controls and movement, this might have been a fun game. As it stands, I'd avoid it.			"

It's repetitive, you do the same thing over and over (collect the blobs or whatever of the same colour) and at the end get stuck at the ""boss"" level because of janky camera/organism movement (this game should've been made in 2D, not 3D so that wouldn't be such a pain in the back)Why would you get this?- Uh, on a sale, maybe? Because of the low price?- To look at the glowy, fancy looking organisms and such?I don't know, maybe for the music? I'm sorry but in my opinion the game is too boring to be recommended.			"

												This game is... pretty. Very beautiful and chill, relaxing music. The gameplay is like the first phase of spore which I personally enjoyed a lot but even that was more in depth than this and spore was supposed to focus on a lot of phases and gameplay mechanics whereas this focuses on only the first phase and it doesn't really do it that well. You can choose between 3 different type of sparkles but in reality it doesn't really matter. Each sparkle can eat pretty much everything with ease. You  can't  choose any stats / upgrades and generally there is no real RPG element to eat regardless of there being a level up system.I guess if you want a chill 4 hour experience you could buy it on a sale or with a discount coupon but for 5$ kinda hard to recommend.

												This was one of the first games I've gotten in awhile that disapointted me. Honestly, Spore does a better micro-organisim eat/evolve game. The problem is that despite the level having more dementions, the gameply is very linear. If you've seen the video and read the description, you've half played the game already. Your evolution is essentially random, as you inevidably eat whatever you come acreoss as fast as possible for points, and there is no way (that I found) to modify your creature in-between rounds to say, prune out the junk to try an sculpt the creature you wannted. Nope, only way is to be picky about what you eat, and that wil likely cost you the rounds, as the AI will not be so picky. ... Which basicly turns the game into competitive 3-D Pacman...In a competitive 3-D Pacman sense, it's not bad! I, however, expected more... depth, options, and complexity (at least a much as Spore has to offer) and the concept has potiential, but alas, it's just not there now.That said, it truly is a casual game, and perhaps the lack of complexity is a feature not an oversight. You may enjoy Sparkles 2 Evo, I for one, am spending time on other games.			"

												This is not a game to tax the brain or the reflexes. It's less a game, more a cyberpet with levels. However, there is something to enjoy here. It is calming, pretty to look at and (as I just did) you can lose three hours without notice.Here is the problem. The lack of explanation is a big thing. Not being told what your 'special power' does leads to ignoring it. Activating it requires you to stop moving and double click on the head of your sparkle. It breaks the flow of the game to do that. Would it have been such a problem to assign it to a key? I ate only green and blue food, looking to create a slightly different type of herbivore, but it doesn't matter. You eat enough of one type of food, you level up and turn into that type of creature. I got trapped in red food, had to eat my way out, and changed into a predator. Not satisfying at all.There is a really sound basis for a brilliant game here but it feels like it is still in early beta. It feeds the eye and the ear very well, but your mind goes hungry.Finally, I think it was a boss fight... not sure. A level called the octuary darkness. The control method and view point change in a very strange way. It feels like a bug. Imagine stepping from our universe and into another where up down, left right and back and forwards suddenly meant different things. Like that. Not fun, and not acceptable. If you want to chill out, turn your brain off and just relax (why are you lookikng for a game to play?) this will do it for you. Just understand it is VERY limited. I feel bad not recommending this game, because I enjoyed it, but I got lucky and this is bugged and quite empty.			"

It is kinda boring. When I just began playing it was interesting, I had many different things to eat, but then it told me that I am missing one green ball and I couldn't find it.			"

												Terrible game. Music is annoying, sounds are too. It's a port from a mobile game. Controls are hard and unresponsive. Very repetitive and no challenge or complications at all. For the first 5 minutes of the game,(the most important), the game showed no promise. I played it a little more and the only thing you can do is eat little pills and/or other species. Boring, horrible, stupid, terrible, and all the more.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo Review - Raymond KTIf you're wishing to play a smooth game for whoever gets the most food first, then this is your game.There is NOTHING to do with evolving AT all. All you're doing is going from level to level. I feel like it's a level game, complete this level then proceed, but the worst part about it, is it's BORING! You go around collecting little pieces of food and once you've reached a certain point, the game says ""You win!""Is it wrong to expect certain things from a game? Well it's hard not to when the game resembles the Spore Cell Stage to an almost exact degree. They can't even call this game anything to do with evolution. It is a level game, stay away from it			"

												The graphics are great but all you do is swim around and eat different colored balls. Whoever eats the most wins. At about the 5th level the computer controlled opponent becomes about ten times better and starts eating way more than you. It also starts to get tougher like how the things you eat are placed, like in jellyfish and what not. The game basically has no real gameplay to speak of and no real point other than to waste my valuable time, and is just boring as hell.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Very beautiful, very immersive. Played non-stop when I first got it. Unfortunately, there are a few bugs (minor spoiler):_______________________________________________________________________________________-Some of the levels were marked as ""completed"" even though I haven't even got to them yet. -The boss battle in Octury Deep is literally unbeatable because the game seems to prevent me even touching any of the octupus' tentacles. I understand that you have to use a special in order to descend deeper and become closer to the tentacles, but even when I do, the bulbs are unable to be eaten even though I head for the lowest one first.-Another Octury Deep bug may be using the special in order to descend deeper into the boss' tentacles. For me, I was only able to use my special a grand total of three times (without being able to even descend) before I'm stuck swimming forever without hope of defeating the boss. It required me to exit and restart the battle again, and at one point even restart the game because the pause options didn't appear. I retried many times, but unfortunately, the bug remained. I couldn't progress through the battle.______________________________________________________________________________________Conclusion/TL;DR:Aside from the major bug in one of the boss battles, the game is worth playing. The details are stunning, the controls are pretty smooth, and it overall piqued my enjoyment.			"

												The visuals are fantastic and concept is interesting, but gameplay could be tweaked to make this game much more enjoyable than it currently is. I bought this under the pretense that I would be able to pick ""perks"" for my creature as I leveled up and gathered pieces for the DNA tree. Instead the change is purely visual and picking only one feeding style (herbi/carni/omnivore) doesn't appear to have any major differences over the others. Another thing that annoyed me was that you couldn't be hurt or die. Being attacked by a larger creature simply makes you flee to a higher layer and is more of an annoyance than anything else. I never felt in any danger and overall the game felt too easy. Not a bad game by any means, but it could be much more exciting. 5/10.			"

												6.5/10Beautiful game. Beautiful graphics, beautiful soundtrack. A pleasure to play or even just watch it be played.In terms of gameplay, however, I think fl0w did a better job as a tide pool game. In fl0w, all creatures are made upof edible ""bits"" which other creatures can eat, including the player. This makes the player vulnerable in the same way as the bigger enemies in the later game - get all your ""bits"" eaten, and a bite to the head will be your death. Something like this would have made Sparkle 2 Evo far more exciting. There would be peril beyond just getting pushed up to a higher level.Furthermore, the DNA mechanics could have been made far more influential. Maybe it could be possible to have different physical traits from each of the three pathways. This could be reandomic, or dependent on which color each bar of the DNA gets filled (e.g. one line determines the mouth, another a leg, a bunch for the tail, etc.), or have the player choose. Dunno. It just feels kinda pointless as it is.Finally, needs more levels and different enemies. Maybe make it so certain enemies can only appear for a certain type of food (such as only red & blue fish; have the green fish replaced by algae stuck to the rocks, floating pieces of algae or something that is not a plant fish because WTF).

												A pretty game, that's for sure, but the gameplay is boring and basically also lacking a real challenge. Also, you don't really have that much control over your evolution: sure you could try and eat only one colour, but that means you will just be growing slower than your opponent in competitive mode, meaning you will lose the match. As you make progress you encounter more (bigger) species, but most do not really provide a new and different challenge. They are just bigger, thus taking longer to defeat in the same way you defeat everything: by eating it. This process becomes boring fast, and after about an hour not even the pretty colours and lighting or the soothing soundtrack could keep my interest.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is fun, relaxing and above all - pretty. But it does have it problems. Namely, things you need to eat will occasionally swim off the map. Food will also get stuck inside coral, and unless you're currently the green creature with suction powers you cannot retrieve it. There is also no real danger to yourself - you can get bitten by other creatures, but all that will do is turn your screen red and make your creature swim a level higher.It's more similar to Flower than Flow. But that's not a bad thing.			"

It's not really challenging at all, but it's very enjoyable and the vibrant worlds are a delight to explore. The weakest point is probably the two large bosses, which admittedly can be a bit tedious compared to the rest. All in all though a very nice experience, though admittedly quite short. Though with how much I enjoyed playing through it once a second playthrough is all but assured from me at this point.			"

A pleasure to play or even just watch it be played.In terms of gameplay, however, I think fl0w did a better job as a tide pool game. In fl0w, all creatures are made upof edible ""bits"" which other creatures can eat, including the player. This makes the player vulnerable in the same way as the bigger enemies in the later game - get all your ""bits"" eaten, and a bite to the head will be your death. Something like this would have made Sparkle 2 Evo far more exciting. There would be peril beyond just getting pushed up to a higher level.Furthermore, the DNA mechanics could have been made far more influential. Maybe it could be possible to have different physical traits from each of the three pathways. This could be reandomic, or dependent on which color each bar of the DNA gets filled (e.g. one line determines the mouth, another a leg, a bunch for the tail, etc.), or have the player choose. Dunno. It just feels kinda pointless as it is.Finally, needs more levels and different enemies. Maybe make it so certain enemies can only appear for a certain type of food (such as only red & blue fish; have the green fish replaced by algae stuck to the rocks, floating pieces of algae or something that is not a plant fish because WTF).

												Flow is actually more enjoyable -because- it is less a game . . . for me. This is much more a game, and that is fun, so I can totally see preferring this.But comparing games is unfair in a lot of ways. Unfortuantely, due to both actual cost, and more importantly, opportunity cost (time) -- I'm not sure this game is actually worth the investment.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is fun in some aspects but it quickly gets boring with repetitive gameplay.  The graphics are beautiful and I did enjoy the time I played it however, the game has many bugs.  I encountered one myself and it completely deleted my save file so I have to start from square one and I just don't have it in me.  The game is only $5 USD so it's not that much of a loss.  It's a good game if you are just looking for something casual.			"

												When i bought it i was expecting something similar to flow mixed with chooseable paths of evolution and RPG elements but the game as a whole was disappointing. Now I'm not saying it's badly made or a terrible game just that what I was led to believe was not what i got. All in all it was more of a disappointment but I don't hate it or hate that I bought it (mostly because I got it for less that $2) I just logged a quarter hour on it and don't plan to go back.			"

												Simple game.  Recommended for the very casual gamer.Controls are basic in that it is a point and click to manuever a creature in the direction clicked.Sounds are basic but well done.  Enjoyed the ambient music in the backgroundThe premise of the game is to collect coloured orbs and level the creature up.  The orbs collected determine the type of creature that will evolve.There are two modes; competitive and non-competitive.  Competitive adds an AI that collects the orbs as well.  Collect more than the AI to win.  Non-competitive removes the AI and the goal is to collect all the orbs.			"

												I bought this game because I has a coupon and I must say I rather enjoyed it. Sparkle 2 Evo does heavily favor flOw in mechanics and general design. However, Sparkle 2 does address a few of the issues I had with flOw such as the time it took to eat a group of creatures and the lack of a major change in the appearance of the player creature. There is one thing I will specifically praise:-Visuals. The colorful, almost alien world of Sparkle 2 is definitely one of the highlights, creature design is overall just as impressive.The Sparkle's appearance also actively changes based on whichever color of food you focus on in that evolution segment. Even focusing on one color has dramatic changes as the Sparkle starts out as a small larva and eventually develops wings, legs, and assorted appendages.However, the game is not without its flaws, and they aren't in short supply: -Above all else, the game is relatively short (easily beaten with 100% in 2-3 hours) so don't expect a particularly engaging tale -The collision detection is somewhat off and sometimes the passable and impassable barriers were difficult to distinguish. -The beginning decision, carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore is little more than a ""Choose your color"" decision and overall has little effect on gameplay as your Sparkle can eat all colors regardless of their current forme.Overall, Sparkle 2 Evo is a short but enjoyable title that I recommend if you can get it on sale.

												This was a neat little game that I enjoyed quite a bit.It wasn't much of a challenge, but it did create a relaxing environment through its stunning visuals and soundtrack.My only downside was how short it was. Took me about 3 hours to nab all the achievements. I'd definitely be interested in extending my underwater adventure through any DLC or additional games down the road.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is pretty and relaxing. However, the gameplay is boring at best, the levels are unchallenging and the only decision you make, which is choosing whether you want to be omnivorous, herbivorous or carnivorous, has barely any impact on your creature and its evolution. I was a little disappointed. Still, it was not entirely unenjoyable. In short, Sparkle 2 Evo offers a stress-free experience in a beautiful environment, but not much more.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is nice and slow-paced. If you're an achievement hunter you'll finish 100% of the achievements by simply playing the game. your form changes everytime you evolve so it's great for those who like pokemon-esque games.The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it becomes a little repetetive and there are points in the game when the dive features stop working and you must restart the program.Overall, cheap game with easy achievements and a nice relaxing play-through.7.5/10			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is not only beautiful, but relaxing as well. Its music and art take you into another world that makes you feel like you too are swimming along with alien like creatures. Honestly I would play this game much more if I didn't have to make the choice of either playing game, creating artwork, or doing college work. The price is wonderful, and while it is what you pay for is what you get, I am recommending this game to everyone and their mothers since its just that simple to play and great for all people of all ages all over the world.

												You play as a microorganism. Your only goal is to eat. evolve and level up. It plays similar to the early stages in the Spore game by EA. It's entertaining for an hour or so, after that it gets boring and repetitive really fast except for the 2 boss stages found by the end of the game. I'm playing with the xB360 controller, controls are slightly unresponsive at times. It's easier to play using a mouse. Other than the beautiful visuals and relaxing soundtrack, I have no praises for the game. Overall it lacks any depth and replay value. Only purchase if you're interested in playing something casual and simple.5/10			"

												This is one of the strangest games i have ever played. The only way i can liken it to something is to say it is similar to the game 'Snake' but you cannot die. The competitive mode faces you off against an 'opponent' (i use the term loosely as yourarely encounter one another and the only evidence that there is an opponent is a small bar at the bottom telling you how much it has eaten) Whilst the gameplay is bizzare to say the least, It is oddly calming. In conjunction with the ambient soundtrack and the beautiful (allbeit bright) neon graphics, this game is an escape from many games and offers a wy to 'unwind'. Although i struggle to call it a 'game' as such with 0 storyline  and even the objective of the game seems abstract. Don't know if i can recommend this game either way but i have enjoyed it!			"

												Judging by the included instructions it's supposed to be a carbon copy of flOw - but it isn't, in a bad way.Graphics-wise it's ok, though in my opinion not as slick looking as the aforementioned game's high-contrast monocrome art.The problems are mostly with gameplay and control consistency:It's much slower than flOW (or at least than the ""demo"" that is available on PC) and the layer mechanic is not like in the documentation as far as I could tell. The tutorial is also wrong, it shows opposite key bindings at one point.There is also more visual clutter that has no gameplay relevance, I suppose that comes down to preference though.The controls aren't really precise enough to account for the differences between this and flOw. Since in this game you have to pick between different food and manoeuvre obstacles, I'd expect the turn radius and eating cooldown to be lower or the world to contain more empty space and be zoomed out. Currently it doesn't mix too well.The menu controls don't seem polished, for example ESC works for backing out of some menus but there are screens where it doesn't do anything at all. The equivalent button is sometimes in the top-right corner, sometimes in the bottom-left one. The menus are also slow instead of calm and reactive (but I don't know how flOw handles in that regard, since the PC one doesn't really have any).Finally, the default control scheme isn't adjusted based on locale: If you have a QWERTZ keyboard for example, you have to switch to English or reconfigure it before starting the game. (Which is possible, so this is just a minor point.)At least the music is nice, but it's not memorable by any means.			"

												Picked up this nice little game on sale. Very cheap. Under a buck.You control a ""creature"" and move it around to eat things. You have the option to eat red, blue, or green things. Each one will help shape your creature. Red to make a carnivore, blue for an omnivore, green for an omnivore. Each type has different eating speed, movement speed, and maneuverability. There are 14 stages. You have two options for play. Solo or vs computer AI. In solo mode you need to have your creature eat all of one color of items in a level to clear it. In ""competitive""/vs computer mode your creature must consume more of/all of one color object before the computer controlled creature does.Controls are simple, either point and click with mouse scroll wheel to move up and down in depth, or keyboard. Simple controls, fun to play. The background music is nice ambient music. The visuals are great, lots of transparency and light.It's short, but still very fun for the short time it takes to finish it.			"

Only without that bonding with your creature and the promise of just enough of swimming before attaching legs and carrying on. This is just endless round of swim, eat, swim, eat, swim, eat. Remember changing your life-form in simple Spore-editor? Here it changes by itself, in random time, depending on what you eat. Only thing better than in Spore is the visual design - which is understandable, since Spore was more comic-styled and came out 10 years earlier. Result? 30%, boring after 15 minutes.			"

												Have you ever played Spore? There you start as a bacteria, which eats the smaller ones but have to get away from the bigger ones, until it grows and gets revenge on those suckers. Well, Sparkle 2 Evo is similar to that part of Spore with some exceptions. For example, here you simply cannot die - the worst thing other organisms can do to you is kick you to the previous layer. Also, levels are similar to each other - you swim, eat elements, go deeper, sweem, eat elements, go deeper, level complete, start over. And that makes the game really boring. Yeah, I know it is meant to be relaxing, but it's not - at least for me. When I'm bored, I don't get relaxed - I get annoyed. And that game annoyed me as hell. So I strongly don't recommend it - that stage of Spore is a lot more fun, and there are more stages. Well, if boring equals relaxing to you - you can give Sparkle 2 Evo a try. Or if you hunt easy achievements - you can easily complete this game 100% in under 4 hours.			"

												Nice, atmospheric little game with a decent soundtrack. Inexpensive and good to fill time with, though can be a bit tedious when trying to find that last bit to clear a level.Eat or...be stunned...or kicked up a level. There's no real way to die I could find. The levelling of stages looks pretty much the same regardless of what path you choose. The controls can be buggy and prevent you from getting achievements.Not a bad game for the price but I don't want to spend the time to repeat the game over and over just to try and get the last two achievements. Might possibly install it again later to play but not in a hurry to do so.If I had the option, I'd rank this game as a neutral. I'll recommend this game for the graphics and sound. Not so much for the control bugs and tediousness.			"

												I bought this game because I has a coupon and I must say I rather enjoyed it. Sparkle 2 Evo does heavily favor flOw in mechanics and general design. However, Sparkle 2 does address a few of the issues I had with flOw such as the time it took to eat a group of creatures and the lack of a major change in the appearance of the player creature. There is one thing I will specifically praise:-Visuals. The colorful, almost alien world of Sparkle 2 is definitely one of the highlights, creature design is overall just as impressive.The Sparkle's appearance also actively changes based on whichever color of food you focus on in that evolution segment. Even focusing on one color has dramatic changes as the Sparkle starts out as a small larva and eventually develops wings, legs, and assorted appendages.However, the game is not without its flaws, and they aren't in short supply: -Above all else, the game is relatively short (easily beaten with 100% in 2-3 hours) so don't expect a particularly engaging tale -The collision detection is somewhat off and sometimes the passable and impassable barriers were difficult to distinguish. -The beginning decision, carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore is little more than a ""Choose your color"" decision and overall has little effect on gameplay as your Sparkle can eat all colors regardless of their current forme.Overall, Sparkle 2 Evo is a short but enjoyable title that I recommend if you can get it on sale.

												Sparkle 2 Evo is pretty and relaxing. However, the gameplay is boring at best, the levels are unchallenging and the only decision you make, which is choosing whether you want to be omnivorous, herbivorous or carnivorous, has barely any impact on your creature and its evolution. I was a little disappointed. Still, it was not entirely unenjoyable. In short, Sparkle 2 Evo offers a stress-free experience in a beautiful environment, but not much more.			"

												Well... this is a surprise.I've had this game for about 20 minutes at the time of writing this review, but I gotta say I'm already amazed. For future reference, I bought this game during a steam sale but I might have just bought it full price if I discovered it before now.ART 10/10So, the art of the game is very very veeeerrrry good, so much so I would say its the highlight of this game, despite the other features. It is absolutely stunning. I have a decent PC so I immediately turned the graphics up to full, and they do not disappoint. These are some of the best visuals I've seen, with everything from the color-faded background to the transparent 3-D 'walls'. I love these graphics.MUSIC 8/10The music has a kind of tranquil feeling to it, and helps to relax into the game. It flows very well with the gameplay, and the sound effects aren't dominating over it, nor vice versa. There is a very good balance here in my opinion.GAMEPLAY 6/10This is pretty good as well, although its not a revolutionary game in this aspect. I have had fun so far playing this game, and I think I will continue to do so, but the art and the music are the main hooks for me. It has a very similar feeling to the early stage of Spore, but it is the entire game. If you liked that, you would probably like this game.STORY 2/10You are evolving a thing. That's it. That's the whole story. Not that this game really needs a story.CONCLUSION 7.5/10This game is very fun and relaxing to play, and is great if you have a spare 5 minutes to kill.  This game doesn't quite make it to an 8 as I don't think it has the ability to entertain for a long period of time. Also, some of the mechanics in the game could use some refining but that's just me. I would recommend this game, though getting it in a sale is probably best.			"

												Loving the evolutions of all three types of cell elements. The colors and flow feels quite calm sometimes, yet I was quite sad for the levels to be over quite quickly. I still enjoy this game and appreciate the producers who created this game. Thanks guys for making this game, and again I enjoy Sparkle 2 Evo :)			"

												It's a quite nice game, the graphics are colorful and pretty.  I think is easy to get 100% complete in this game, the achievements are not difficult to achieve. In my case I had a little problem with Tutorial achievement, there's a point in it that  my sparkle didn't move so it was impossible to complete it. The game is short and easy to learn.			"

												I'm going to throw a number out there and say 90% of people will get bored of this game after playing it for 30 minutes or less..There are only 3 type of evolution: green, red, and blue. Green is the ""herbivore"" (even though you can still eat animals with ridiculous speed) with a very high eating rate and has a special ability that allows you to suck up nearby food. This is both good if you want to collect ALL the food and bad if you are trying to target specific food.Red is the ""carnivore"" and has a speed boost abilityBlue is the ""Omnivore"" and has a scare ability (it causes microorganisms to run away from you)This game looks fantastic, the music is on what sounds like a 10 minute loop, and the only reason I spent so much time playing is to beat all the levels and earn all the achievements.There is almost no replayability (unless you can figure out the DNA sequence and want to make a perfect organism)Get this on sale when it's $1 if you really want to play it.

												Picked up this nice little game on sale. Very cheap. Under a buck.You control a ""creature"" and move it around to eat things. You have the option to eat red, blue, or green things. Each one will help shape your creature. Red to make a carnivore, blue for an omnivore, green for an omnivore. Each type has different eating speed, movement speed, and maneuverability. There are 14 stages. You have two options for play. Solo or vs computer AI. In solo mode you need to have your creature eat all of one color of items in a level to clear it. In ""competitive""/vs computer mode your creature must consume more of/all of one color object before the computer controlled creature does.Controls are simple, either point and click with mouse scroll wheel to move up and down in depth, or keyboard. Simple controls, fun to play. The background music is nice ambient music. The visuals are great, lots of transparency and light.It's short, but still very fun for the short time it takes to finish it.			"

												Well... this is a surprise.I've had this game for about 20 minutes at the time of writing this review, but I gotta say I'm already amazed. For future reference, I bought this game during a steam sale but I might have just bought it full price if I discovered it before now.ART 10/10So, the art of the game is very very veeeerrrry good, so much so I would say its the highlight of this game, despite the other features. It is absolutely stunning. I have a decent PC so I immediately turned the graphics up to full, and they do not disappoint. These are some of the best visuals I've seen, with everything from the color-faded background to the transparent 3-D 'walls'. I love these graphics.MUSIC 8/10The music has a kind of tranquil feeling to it, and helps to relax into the game. It flows very well with the gameplay, and the sound effects aren't dominating over it, nor vice versa. There is a very good balance here in my opinion.GAMEPLAY 6/10This is pretty good as well, although its not a revolutionary game in this aspect. I have had fun so far playing this game, and I think I will continue to do so, but the art and the music are the main hooks for me. It has a very similar feeling to the early stage of Spore, but it is the entire game. If you liked that, you would probably like this game.STORY 2/10You are evolving a thing. That's it. That's the whole story. Not that this game really needs a story.CONCLUSION 7.5/10This game is very fun and relaxing to play, and is great if you have a spare 5 minutes to kill.  This game doesn't quite make it to an 8 as I don't think it has the ability to entertain for a long period of time. Also, some of the mechanics in the game could use some refining but that's just me. I would recommend this game, though getting it in a sale is probably best.			"

												Not a very good game if you are looking for a game that lets you have more freedom when customizing your creature. It only lets you have three choices, which are herbavore, omnivore and carnivore. Then after you level up, your creature either changes to a new type of creature or gets a tiny bit bigger.4/10			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game all the time, but I'd only get it when it's on sale. It's definitely a different game, but far from a good game. The first problem I had with this game was the lack of explanation. It told you the basic idea of the game at the start and immediatly threw you into the deep end hoping you'll figure it out by yourself. There were multiple hours acrossed a few days where I had no idea what to do to progress further in the game. I finally gave up and looked up some form of help, which thankfully there was some in the steam guide section for the game. The gameplay itself is really simple and fun once you figure the game out.The graphics on the other hand are amazing. It reminded me of geometry wars. The design for all the different species and environments took me by surprise each time I saw them. So TL:DR pick this game up if you can get it really cheap, otherwise I'd wait.			"

												When they mentioned ""Dreamlike visuals"", and ""Immersive music"", they weren't kidding. When I got this game, I didn't realize how much of a unique game this was. Sparkle 2 Evo totally blew all the other evolution-tree type games out of the water. If you are a casual gamer, or you simply enjoy music, you will love this game straight from the tutorial. My only wish is for the game to be longer, as I finished the game and got every acheivement in about 10 hours of gameplay. My advice: take it slowly and enjoy the view! It doesn't hurt to have a good pair of headphones on hand for the great music!			"

												I usually don't do lengthy reviews on games, but this is one that interests me.Sparkle 2 Evo is a game where you eat stuff and grow. That's pretty much it for the concept. There are different things you can eat, which would be herbivore food, carnivore food, and omnivore food. No, they are not called plants, meat, or both.It's a pretty laid back game. In my experience, there really is no way to lose. The opponent AI is pretty dumbed down and moves at a snail's pace. There isn't much else to the game other than: eat, grow, repeat. It really doens't make much of a difference what you choose to eat either.If you choose to be a carnivore, you move faster, but you can only eat one thing at a time. If you choose to be an herbivore, you move significantly slower, but you can eat more things in an instance. I still have yet to figure out what's different about being an omnivore, since it's basically the same as being a carnivore.You basically pick red, blue, or green. Sound familiar?The control scheme is a bit weird. It's functional, but it's weird. You make incredibly wide turns and you'll find yourself running into walls a lot. At least with keyboard/mouse controls. You can pick either keyboard or mouse. I have yet to try out the controller, but I've heard that's what this game is meant for.At points, the game will just seem to drag out. You'll be searching through each layer several times once the level starts to run out of food. You don't win until all the food is eaten (in my experience), and since the opponent AI is slow and often idle, this may take a while. For as far as I've gotten, there really is no sense of urgency.Overall, I wouldn't know what to give this game on a 1-10 scale, but it's relaxing, and it's dirt cheap. If you've ever wanted an expanded version of the first stage in Spore, here it is.			"

												After the first 30 minutes it starts to get a bit boring and the music will bug you. I don't see anything too unique about the bug you grow either (tried picking blue and green). The experience until then is nice though, and the style of this game is unique and worth supporting. It's at .49 cents now, and if you spend 1 hour with it, that's something. You'll get annoyed searching for food eventually.			"

												Stuck on 2nd level.  Couldn't find the last blue microelement.  I followed the blue ripple but the blue microelement wasn't way where to be fiound. There are no level indicators to know your depth. After 1/2hr of serching gave up and I wonder if the rest of the levels are hide and seek.  Boring.			"

												I'm going to start right off the bat saying that I agree with other players of this game, it isn't for everyone. I snagged this game for 74 cents. The game itself is simple, you are an organism that goes around in the level eating other microorganisms to level up all while competing against an AI. The more you eat, the more you grow. Hands down, the graphics are gorgeous. The game is beautiful, especially when you get your organism to a high level. Even running it at ""Good"" settings in the launcher, I was shocked. Everything is so bright (except for the first few stages of the game, which have a darker yellow-brownish kind of background). The gameplay is debateable. Some find it boring, others find it good. People argue it's boring because you only get so many options for leveling and there isn't much diversity in power. This game has a casual tag for a reason. I think it's good enough given the games length and cost. Don't go into this game thinking it's going to be as epic as Skyrim or something. It's gameplay is simple and calm. (Though when you turn your organism into a bottomless eating machine, it's fun to sprint around killing other organisms and steal them from your opponent!)The music: awesome, though it all depends on your taste of music.In a nutshell, the game is as good as it's going to get. The sights and sounds are amazing, and the amount of action you are going to get in this game all varies on your playstyle.Overall: 8/10, would eat again.			"

												When they mentioned ""Dreamlike visuals"", and ""Immersive music"", they weren't kidding. When I got this game, I didn't realize how much of a unique game this was. Sparkle 2 Evo totally blew all the other evolution-tree type games out of the water. If you are a casual gamer, or you simply enjoy music, you will love this game straight from the tutorial. My only wish is for the game to be longer, as I finished the game and got every acheivement in about 10 hours of gameplay. My advice: take it slowly and enjoy the view! It doesn't hurt to have a good pair of headphones on hand for the great music!			"

  Sparkle 2 Evo  Sparkle 2 Evo is a very slow progressing game, it allows you to relax and enjoy the every level.I really recommend this game, especially after a day of work or college. You can really relax and chill out after a big stressy day, and I enjoy replaying levels to chill out for longer.The game is really beautifully designed and the music is very relaxing to listen to, Would be cool if you released the soundtrack on Steam. I hope a Sparkle 3 game is made, if it does I'll buy it as soon as it comes out. Maybe add a progressively hardening sandbox mode, so we get to evolve it multiple times. Maybe also have an option when you evolve or level up to add parts to your creature, like possibly like this: You have evolved, choose you evolution part:  Claws (+1 Damage) Shell armour (+4 Defense) Stamina (+2 Speed) Thicker Skin (+15 HP)Good luck with any of your future games,   -Spectral_King			"

												Picked up this nice little game on sale. Very cheap. Under a buck.You control a ""creature"" and move it around to eat things. You have the option to eat red, blue, or green things. Each one will help shape your creature. Red to make a carnivore, blue for an omnivore, green for an omnivore. Each type has different eating speed, movement speed, and maneuverability. There are 14 stages. You have two options for play. Solo or vs computer AI. In solo mode you need to have your creature eat all of one color of items in a level to clear it. In ""competitive""/vs computer mode your creature must consume more of/all of one color object before the computer controlled creature does.Controls are simple, either point and click with mouse scroll wheel to move up and down in depth, or keyboard. Simple controls, fun to play. The background music is nice ambient music. The visuals are great, lots of transparency and light.It's short, but still very fun for the short time it takes to finish it.			"

												Remember first phase of Spore? Well, this is it, all over again. Only without that bonding with your creature and the promise of just enough of swimming before attaching legs and carrying on. This is just endless round of swim, eat, swim, eat, swim, eat. Remember changing your life-form in simple Spore-editor? Here it changes by itself, in random time, depending on what you eat. Only thing better than in Spore is the visual design - which is understandable, since Spore was more comic-styled and came out 10 years earlier. Result? 30%, boring after 15 minutes.			"

												A relaxing game of ""eat the coloured bubbles"", with the occasional ""avoid the enemy, then eat it"". Sparkle 2 Evo has you playing as a tiny, crystaline organism, that slowly evolves into different forms based on what colour(s) you eat. Red turns you into a fast attack-type, green turns you into a slow defense-type, and blue is a mixture of both. Your looks, abilities, and speed all change depending on what you choose.While enjoyable, this game is very casual, and more of a stress-reliever than anything actually competitive.

												This game is fun at first and it's cool that you can evolve and all that, butafter playing for a bit, it becomes apparent that things are not as customizable as they seem, and its polish only seems to exist at the surface level.Also, it becomes quite repetitive after a few stages.			"

												Sparkle 2: Evo is one of the prettiest crappy games I've ever seen. It looks so nice and sleek, the design is all shiny and beautiful looking, but the gameplay itself is terrible. You basically swim around with clunky controls (which where the developer's intentions, mind you, but they're a little overdone and can just be down-right infuriating to use) and eat small pieces of food. You either eat red, green, or blue, to become a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore, respectively. But it doesn't really matter, since you can't control evolution anyway, you basically change shape for a few levels then you just stay the same from what I can see. You can't modify your creature like in SPORE (which this is clearly a ripoff of), there's no real fights or anything, you basically can just swim in misshapen circles and try to eat the tails of enemies without hitting their heads, and you just clear the food out from level to level. Yawn! Sparkle 2: Evo is sometimes frustrating and always very boring, which is a real bummer because it looks so pretty.4.1/10			"

												Swim around and eat everything you can find, which in this case is different typ of orbs (green, blue and red).The colour of the orb doesnt really matter much and no matter what direction you want to take in the evolutionary tree you can still devour, and get points for, any type of orb. The differnt evolutionary forms you can evolve to isnt all that different from eachother to make them intresting or wothwhile.The best tactic seems to be: just eat everything you can find in order to score as many points as possible and win. If you wish to specialize you will actually find yourself at a disadvantage as you will struggle to find orbs of the right color.A really dumb game.			"

												The graphics look neat but you will quickly  tire of the game.  Here are a few observations:1.  You can't really die.2.  You have to eat a full set of colored ""pelets"" to proceed to the next level (red, green, or blue).  This is fine however before long, there are different sized pellets and different animals of the color you are going for.  Some times the small pellet counts towards completing the level, other times it does not.  Same with animals.  Eating some helps to progress while other times that same animal does not contribute to level progress.Am I upset I bought the game?  No,.. I spent $0.49 and played it for about an hour.  If I can get one hour of game play for every dolllar spent on Steam, I consider it a good deal.  Spend $20 = 20 hours, spend $1 for 1 hour.  So in this case I hoped for 30 minutes and am happy I spent an hour on the game.Any more then $1 and I would pass on the game.q77 "

												Aesthetically pleasing, ambient soundtrack, reasonably priced and sufficiently interesting to keep you engaged.This is a great budget title and well worth every penny.  There is a degree of personal investment in getting your creature to keep on growing, there is also a that bit that just wants to collect 100% of the sought after items.  If you are looking for a game that requires little thinking, will fill some spare time and costs next to nothing, look no further.			"

												A very nice Flow-like game with pretty graphics, cool music and awesome creatures. Seriously, the herbivore player creature was my favourite. Huge + for the option to switch between relaxing and competetive mode. The AI is buggy though, it was stuck on two levels but I didn't try restarting it, maybe it doesn't happen that often. Experienced one minor graphical bug but that's about it. I love the idea of developing different traits based on what you eat.As a fan of the ""Flow"" and all games alike, I totally recommend it.

												This game looks amazing, but for the gameplay, not amazing. You eat stuff and grow, and thats all you do, I got stuck on the controls, and I couldn't seem to figure them out, they are so wierd. If you dont care about gameplay and only about how the game looks, this game is for you, but for someone like me who needs both to be good, graphics have to look somewhat nice and story be good. I do not recommend. If there is a major update and improves gameplay, I may take a look at that, but I dont think thats going to come. For me, Waste of Money.			"

												A nice little means to pass time if you like those ´food chain´ type of games where you eat anything and everything to grow bigger so you can eat even more stuff. That may not sound appealing to some people but in all fairness, I don´t think this game was made with the purpose of raising excitement. The game does look beautiful and that´s probably it´s one strong aspect because it lacks depth in everything else.The game is supposed to induce a sense of relaxation but because of all the swaying motions and camera view I found it more nauseating than anything else. For that matter, it´s a good thing there´s only 13 levels which can be played through within two hours. Two more levels if you´re planning on going for 100% achievements.. in which case I must warn you that one of the two extra levels is almost impossible to beat with the keyboard & mouse because of some apparent bug that causes you to get stuck in empty space. Either use a controller or switch to one for this particular level and it should be fine.Maybe a fun game to pick up on a sale but because of it's simplicity not worth full price in my opinion. The only thing that could justify the price would be the 'pretty graphics' but if that's what you want out of a game, you can do much better.			"

												There has been some controversy regarding this game, but let me try to shed some light on the situation. Firstly, it takes a special kind of person to like this sort of experience, as it is not combat related, rather it focuses on the more raw and wild aspects of life. You are a tiny sparkle trying to evolve your way into the big leagues, and while this game may appear simple, it is rather complex. The gameplay is not actually as repetitive as one may first believe, but it is in fact exciting to see how different your creature becomes with each mutation. The art style is unique and beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing and as mentioned before the creature evolutions are well thought out (and frankly a little freaky XD). That being said, this game will come off as boring to those who enjoy a more fast paced experience, but for people who want to sit back and relax to detach from the outside world, this is the perfect remedy. Enjoy my fellow sparkles ;PCrazypeep>^)			"

												Maybe this is meant to be a ""zen"" game, but I found it far too aimless.  You are a shrimp-thing that eats red, green, or blue round things.  Which colour you eat more will decide on your special ability.  Sometimes, you have to eat the pieces off of other lifeforms, by chasing them around and biting them in the butt (yes literally).  You have to eat all the pieces of at least one colour to complete a stage.So far, it seems like you cannot die.  If an enemy bites you, you get kicked up to a shallower depth, then you dive right back down to try again.  There is no win or lose, there is only a waste of time with no reward or satisfaction to be attained.			"

												The game was nice and colorful until the squid boss level. God f***ing christ, devs f***ked up the camera and contols there beyond any possible playable level. I started feeling myself as i'm back in 199x, playing some cheap♥♥♥♥♥monkeyd 3d  sega port, with camera behaving as a drunk bear inside russian tank on Red Square. Forget about swiming where you want and attacking what you want - the game will lead your helminth wherever else but the place you pointed. If you want to have somewhat good memories about playing the game - DO NOT try the squid boss level using mouse and keyboard - use gamepad, it's the only way to finish the level without ragequit.

												Sparkle 2 Evo was a game that i found myself to not enjoy on first sight, however as the game went on, i found it very relaxing and entertaining in a sort of way. It is a game that you could easily sink 1.5 - 2 hours in, It consists of the main animal (thing) of eating other blobs to grow, which later you would begin eating other animals aswell. This was entertaining as i (personally) haven't played any of the other games that are based on eating smaller animals to grow, etc.It had beautiful, consistant graphics and each new animal and background i discovered all shocked me, as they really were beautiful. However, it is not a game i would see myself playing again, as it just doesn't seem like one of those games you would play over and over.I rate it a 8/10.			"

												This is kind of a meandering game in which the objectives are not terribly clear. And, unlike Flow, it's clear that the game was written with actual objectives in mind.So, that makes this game a poorly executed knockoff of Flow, which was/is an excellent game. I do not generally mind copycat games, especially if they at least bring something new to the table and are executed at least as well as the original. But, while this game does bring something new to the table (you are what you eat) its poor execution leaves it a pale imitator rather than an evolutionary innovator.			"

You can pretty much kill everything (even bosses) without them being able to hurt you, it contributes to the ''lay back and chill'' feeling of the game but if you're looking for a challenge then don't get this.
