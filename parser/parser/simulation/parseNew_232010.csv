												day three on the road. trucking is fantastic. it gives me time to think, time to reminisce and time to consider my future. just me, the road, and my truck. the three of us come together, dancing through europe, following each others' steps, without saying a word. neither the road nor the truck try to put me down, argue with me or lie to me. we understand each other, we co-operate, we accomplish. i have not felt so whole in all of my life.day seventeen. i've had some disagreements with both the truck and the road. we've had fallings out; it seems as though the feelings were not as mutual as i had hoped. 3 or 4 minor collisions in the last fortnight have put our relationship on the rocks. the truck hums its engine ignorantly, seemingly unaware of the perturbations it has inflicted while the road says nothing. the road feels a guilt it isn't willing to face. we move forward - scathed, but optimisticday thirty-two. i lost my job. i am driving home. the road is ignoring me. reversing in a truck is ♥♥♥♥ing hard			"

												Pros: -You simulate trucking across Europe- Much more efficient for lower end PC's- Fairly realistic in game mechanicsCons: - Doesn't have a 2 after it's nameOne may ask, ""Why the heck would I want a game simulating Trucking in Europe?"" and to that I must say, why the truck not. I mean unless you live in Europe and your profession is trucking, when is the next chance you'll truck across Europe?Another great question that may come to your head is, ""Why buy Euro Truck 1 when I can get the much more polished Euro Truck 2"" and to that I say, Why not both? You get the instant classic that is Euro Truck and its much needed sequel. And with most fans of the Euro Truck Series, I can assure you'll be anxiously waiting for the third installment of the Euro Truck series. If you aren't convinced to buy this instant classic for you and your family (who am I kidding you won't share) there is nothing else I can say to convince you!14/10 Keep on trucking friends			"

												Bought in a bundle, this is worth the buck or two spent especially if you have an older PC to play it on.  ETS1 was a great idea and has been improved with the release of ETS2.  Pros and cons of this game...Pros: Graphics not bad for its day and you can play a short run in 10-15 mins.  While getting in accidents, speeding, and running red lights gets you penalized, you can also play the jerk driver cutting other drivers off and hogging two lanes (which is almost a necessity if driving via keyboard).  Hint for new players--get your hazardous cargo cert ASAP so you can make more money faster.Cons: A careful study of the road map shows this game was unfinished.  Back roads all over Poland, a few in Germany, and none anywhere else.  When driving around, you see several overpasses that were likely intended to be used for backroads, but were left unconnected to anything.  There are also loads of no-go zones in the cities, where AI vehicles can drive, but you cannot.  Another minor complaint; the physics of the truck in a cloverleaf turn allow for too much drift and jackknifing the truck is easy to do, even at low speeds.  I have learned to go real slow through these.I am looking forward to playing ETS2, but if you have an older PC and/or a light wallet, you should give this game a whirl.			"

												I originally purchased this game around the time that the sequel - Euro Truck Simulator 2 - was getting rave reviews. So why not buy the sequel? Because it was priced ten times more and - reviews aside - it seemed doubtful I would enjoy a game where I tediously drove a truck down highways avoiding traffic hauling cargo. At least, I thought,  the first game would give me an idea if I could even stomach the genre. And if it did, well only then would I consider paying the price for the sequel.I was surprised out how engaging this game was. Perhaps because it stood in such stark contrast to all my other driving games (the Need For Speed series, Burnout Paradise, and similar), but there was something very relaxing  and enjoyable about driving between the lanes, making a point not to speed (much) and slam into other cars. It was almost zenlike. The graphics might not be particularly impressive but they got the point across, and the AI of the other cars was pleasantly non-aggressive. Figuring out the best routes to take and what cargos to deliver was not particularly challenging but it was relaxing, and a welcome change from the ordinary.Sadly, that's not enough to sustain the game, at least not for me. Having advanced three tiers and played over twenty hours, the lack of variety is increasingly noticeable. All the highways and cities more or less look the same and the challenge is flat throughout. So while it was a wonderful ride up to this point, it wasn't enough to keep me playing until the nominal ""end"" of the simulation. However, it /was/ enough to get me interested in the sequel, which apparently adds extra content and gameplay. And since that was the whole point of my playing this game in the first place, I consider it time and money well spent.			"

What is Euro Truck Simulator?Well to put it in perspective, it's more of a huge downgrade from Euro Truck Simulator 2. Although it maybe a downgrade for what Euro Truck Simulator 2 has, this is the first and older version of this game from SCS. These are also the makers of 18 Wheels Of Steel Series.What do you do?Well, in a nutshell you just drive, and deliver cargo to point A to point B to make cash. Is it the same as Euro Truck Simulator 2?Honestly, if you have a computer to run Euro Truck Simulator 2, you would be better off getting that, than rather this. Euro Truck Simulator is more a downgrade as it's dated at this time and age. It  was the first European based simulator for trucks. The map is less detailed, but not where it's terrible, it was good at it's time when it got released. There are no custimizations for your trucks, and less trucks to buy for yourself. The map size also is cut down compared to Euro Truck Simulator 2Is It Really Worth To Buy Then?I'm not saying this game IS bad, it's just very dated. It's really based on how you like your games. I got this game in the past because I used to play it when I was younger, including the previous titles that SCS have made. I was also unable to run Euro Truck Simulator 2 with my old laptop, but now I've upgraded and have not touched this game since.If you were like me in the past, having issues running Euro Truck Simulator 2 this could be a good alternative for you to get by. It has the key features to what Euro Truck Simulator 2 has, but it's just less detailed and minimal.For a rating scale 1-10, it's a solid 8/10For a direct link to ETS2, this link: If you want a Review based upon ETS2, Please feel free to read my other review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/coo400/recommended/227300 "

												I really like this game. While I don't have the best computer, and my trees literally look like cardboard cutouts, it's easy to overlook that because the gameplay is just so... relaxing. This is what I used to play GTA San Andreas for... The mindless trips down the highway and through the countryside. I really like the realism in some aspects of the game, for example, - When it rains I was pleasantly surprised I could use my windshield wipers to see better. - You have to sleep.- Your have to fill up your gas. You get fines for:    - Running red lights   - For speeding   - For not having your headlights on at night   - And for driving on the wrong side of the roadWhile there's no radio, you can add your own music which is kinda better, because I don't want to listen to hicksville music lol.It also works great with a controller, although you still need to use the keyboard for some functions, although maybe there's a way to configure them that I haven't discovered yet.Overall, this is simply really relaxing. I like how it isn't competative, and I can't wait to earn enough money to upgrade my truck. :D			"

												As a person who has been a flight simulator addict for going on three decades now...  ( I cut my teeth on a green screen IBM bootleg copy of Pilot trainer circa 1988 )  I have often been skeptical of the 'ground runners.'  Trains, racing cars and boats all have the same singular fundementle flaw on the virtual stage.  Primarily that no matter how much you REALLY want it to be true, you are NOT going to get a realistic perspective view of ... well ... ANYTHING.  Land and city scapes will always be a generic  reflection of what you just saw and are about to see again.  SO; having established my rational for skepticesm, what am I doing here?  To put it plainly.  I'm cheap and my entertainment budget can be bought.  In short for $20 I got the whole euro-truken-paint joben collection.  You should too, hopefully here is why....Pro # 1.It's Europe and there isn't a freken war going on.  Well okay...  Actually about 2 thirds of Europe.  Sans the Balkans half of Italy and 1/3 of Iberia.  If you like Scandanavia.  You are officially S.O.L.  Rather Ironic in fact, considering that no less than half of the riggs you use in this series are models made in either Sweden or Norway.  Back to the point.  See something of the great old country without having to shoot it, dog fight over it or deal with Hitler or Napoleon.# 2. Beautifully simple.  Elegantly addictive.  I honestly went into this game with little if any knowledge of truck driving and after 6 hours that passed by like 30 minutes, I not only know something about the actual life style, I can also add that it was fun doing something curiously different than trying to beat a bunch of crazies to a finish line.The one and only con I can come up with, is that the technology of it's day DOES let it down somewhat.  However; as I mentioned before I got the collection so I expect the second edition to be a bit more advanced.  Not only graphic wise but the over all control experience.  This first one is the best to learn on.  If you can get comfy with this one then you can graduate to more complicated challenges.Jim "

												I really enjoy this game, even though people may think it's boring to keep driving back and fourth to different cities to only drop off cargoes in order to gain more money. Although there is less cities to drive to, I still enjoy it. I love the feeling to be able to drive properly, and have played 20 hours within 2 days due to being obsessed. I'm not saying the game is perfect, hell, the second game might not even be perfect (can't buy it since I have a Mac) however it still is fun.I am quite big on graphics, and I have to admit this isn't so bad. The trucks/cars both look great and so does the interior of the trucks. You can either drive on manual or automatic which adds realism, and so does the various types of weather, time, and the rules of the road. Sound doesn't seem to be much of a problem, it has realistic car, weather, truck and engine noises.Having to deliver more and more in order to gain more money, does take a lot of time. But this leads to the game being more addictive and actually worth it. However, if driving back and forth for a while isn't really your thing, this can become a problem, though I ensure it wont be when you actually try it out, and even better, unlock more places.One thing that has annoyed me while driving around on here is how stupid the other drivers are. They either go the wrong way, beep at me when I am not doing anything wrong, and/or randomly brake when there was no need to which leads me into hitting them, which leads to me having to pay for hitting them. Adding pedestrians or animals would also be something which would make the game better (no I do not want to run them over)Another thing is how the cities are extremely small, and only have up to 5-6 roads, which is bad for when you want to explore other places other than the highway. The sound is good, but not so great. It sounds like I'm driving ontop of the truck rather than inside (might be because the windows are always open for some reason) and the radio does not sound like it's actually coming out of a radio in the truck.Honestly, I love this game even though it has some flaws which I have to live with, however those are probably fixed in ETS2. I recommend this game if you either have a older computer, have a Mac and cannot buy the second one (which is my case) or have a few cash left or is low on cash to spend it on this. An overall 6/10 from me.			"

												The old truck simulation game. If you want to see Spain, Portugal or Rome, buy this game. The graphics are okay. And even you can buy your first truck using the 100,000 Euros but you need to buy the C Class. The small amount of money of the truck is the Runner (Renault) C Class that cost about like almost 95 grand (95,000 euros).My disapointments of this game are:Only four different trucks. Swift (Scania), Runner, (Renault), Valiant (Volvo) and Majestic (Mecedes Benz).UK, France and Germany has only three citiesSpain and Italy has only two citiesPortugal, Poland, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland has only one cityThis is the best truck game if you live in Spain, Portugal or Rome.

												SCS Software specialised in making truck simulations from its humble beginnings back in 1997 with Hard Truck. From then on in, it concentrated on the American theater with its successful 18 Wheels of Steel series. This game, Euro Truck Simulator is the first of its kind hauling cargo throughout Europe and whilst it has the same feel as its cousin 18 Wheels of Steel, the simulation experience is not quite there as it does feel a little arcade. And if it wasn't for the career objectives, I probably enter this game into an early retirement.The gameplay length is pretty much unlimited as there is no official ‘end’. You can literally go on forever however even the most dedicated truckie sim fan will eventually want to give up. However the game cleverly designed career progression chart, where you need to complete certain tasks to raise the ranks from being a novice to the master trucker. Five ranks in all and designed in a way to get the maximum usage for this game however it does take some considerable time to become the master. And because there are many feats (achievements) to earn, it provides you more reasons to play it so if it wasn't for those I'd probably give it a flick a lot sooner.Full review here - http://www.gamespot.com/euro-truck-simulator/user-reviews/2200-12543344/6 / 10			"

												Why do I like it? I have no idea. It's just a mindless task of driving a truck. You are driving a bloody truck through Europe. It's strangly addicting. If you're wicked bored and want something to pass time with, get this. If you want an exciting game with fast paced content and excitment, skip it.			"

												you can use turn signal and hazard lights, TAKE THAT GTA. 10/10Seriously though, I bought this game on very low sale (first simulator game since Flight Simulator from 2002) and I am pleasantly surprised by the graphics quality. On High Graphics, it looks like somewhere between Arma 2 and Arma 3, if that helps. The HUD is great, controls are easy, missions are well-explained. ONLY complaint is the lack of music, but you can add your own, which I will def be doing. If you want a solid simulator, I recommend this.			"

												This game is pretty fun, very relaxing. The best way to play is to throw on a podcast or your own music and cruise around doing jobs. Some of the best features include how easy it is to run (I'm playing it on my laptop instead of my PC and it still runs nicely and looks decent), plenty of areas to work with, a fair variety of trucks, and lots of different things to ship around.However, many of the areas are locked behind pretty big prices, making it pretty difficult to expand beyond your few cities you have access to when you begin. As well, some of the well-paying jobs are locked behind inspections that are expensive.Overall, if you're looking for a pretty fun and relaxing game that you can pour some hours into then I'd say get it on sale. You will be investing a lot of time so keep that in mind. Oh, and a controller or steering wheel would make driving a much more enjoyable experience.			"

												Within the first 5 minutes of playing a new game I got crashed into by a car and was charged a sum of money for apparently crashing into them, at the end of the trip. During the trip, I made a little pit-stop just to refuel my truck and the rest of the journey was bliss.Got to my destination delivering cheese.Dropped the trailer off....Only problem was: it took me at least 7 or 8 minutes to disconnect the trailer from the rear of my truck.Took another job, this time delivering yoghurts.Got crashed into again, this time by a fellow truck driver. I'm guessing people don't like the name on the side of my trailer. Either it's that or people just feel the need to crash into trucks.Eventually dropped the trailer off, and this occasion took me only about 30 seconds to disconnect the trailer.To be honest, about 6 months ago, I wouldn't have thought I'd be reviewing Euro Truck Simulator in a serious manner. But really, these first 45 minutes of gameplay have been pretty decent. There is a realism to the game and it truly reflects how badly British motorists drive. Let's just hope I don't come across a similar amount of bad motorists in France or Portugal.+ Hilarious and surprisingly not frustrating, even though I worry if a lot of the motorists have eyesight problems.+ The graphics are good for the time the game was produced, in my opinion.+ The game has a sense of realism (which I've previously mentioned).+ Engaging and a little atmospheric, too.- Being cut up and sideswiped all the time. Damned blind drivers...11/10			"

												Great game to play, very realistic. Unfortunately the game doesn't really have any story dynamic. The only objective you have is to make your way to different customers and transport their goods. The lack of story allows the game to get very dull very quickly. I needed to set a self goal for myself to fully upgrade every truck and unlock every neighboring country, then that would be the finale of the game. Regardless of the lack of story, the game itself is quite entertaining for the time it was made.			"

												The predecessor to the amazing Euro Truck Simulator 2, this game is pretty great in its own right.While it doesn't possess the graphical fidelity and scope that its younger brother has, Euro Truck Simulator 1 nevertheless features a detailed rendition of Europe and it's still a relaxing driving sim. It has some nice music as well, especially when accessing the game's map. The only real complaints I have about ETS1 involve the flawed physics engine; the engine itself can be fairly glitchy.I would recommend this game, especially if you can't afford ETS2 and still desire something similar. I'd also recommend it if you're interested in seeing how the series itself has progressed over the years.			"

												Now that ETS2 is out, there's no real need for this game. I'm all for nostalgia - I mean I prefer classic Tomb Raider to new Tomb Raider, PS2-era GTA to GTA V, Worms, Crash, Sonic and all of them, but ETS1 has nothing going for it, even on its own.It's just not realistic at all. Neither is ETS2 from a realistic business management perspective, but it has all the right features, with at least the basic tools available. It lets you get on with driving around taking your loads all over the EU, with expansion packs unlocking more and more areas. What really does ETS1 have?It was good at its time, but I'm not recommending it now because ETS2 has more to offer. Yes it's more expensive, but it has a lot more realism to it. Plus it's got an extremely popular unofficial MP add-on mod that you can download for free. You can play with people from all over the world, be it Europe, America and so on.			"

												This simulator is awesome!If you love simulator games and this goes on sale I would recommend this to you!One thing I do not like about this game is the fact that you have to save a lot of money to visit another country. This feature could've been done a little better...It's a little hard to get a large amount of money and everything in this game costs a lot; the values could've been a little nicer- BUT I DO LIKE THIS GAME!- The handling is nice, feels like a heavy long vehicle!- The cities look perfect- The Roads are well-built- The Graphics look good!I'd Recommend saving a little more and getting Euro Truck Simulator 2 as it is a lot better as you could guess...But if you are unsure if you like simulators or not and this is 75% off, this is a good test!..

However dont expect too much for a game which was realesed in 2008, obviously the technology wasnt as advanced today, this game is simple in a way which theres basically 3 objectives: 1. dont crash, 2. be efficient with your fuel and 3. get to your chosen destination with no problems.

												Drive drive drive! All I can say really! Ity's one hell of a challenge to get the hang of your vehicles controls at the beginning. The stearing has to turn farther than most games to do a sharp turn and using a mouse and keyboard makes for inaccurate turning. I recommend if you wish to play this game to its fullest that you own a steering wheel for the PC or a controller so you can slowly eas in and out of turns.I recommend if you enjoy driving around but it really isn't much more then a truck driving simulator.

It also will run perfectly on low spec computers (much lower than recommended on the store page), so would be a perfect solution for getting your trucking fix on a laptop.Unfortunately there's no Linux release, but this game plays perfectly straight out of the box through WINE.If you haven't played ETS2 yet I'd highly recommend buying it before this. If you're looking through SCS' older work, I'd highly recommend giving UK Truck Simulator a go too.			"

												As a person/entity, having played the threesome of Euro Truck Simulator 1, Euro Truck Simulator 2, and American Truck Simulator, I can honestly say DO NOT buy this game. Instead, buy Euro Truck Simulator 2, or American Truck Simulator. Here are the places where the game shines, and when it flops in execution:Pros:- It is a good insight to where the series of Euro Truck was going.- Consists of Europe, which is quite large on its own.- A variety of trucks, almost similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2.- Cheap  - Easy to obtain the game- Easy to pick up, easy to put downCons:- Poor sound engine- Poor physics engine- Overall confusing option menu- No modding scene  - Lack of multiplayer (TruckersMP)  - Lack of proper Workshop support- Cheap  - You get what you pay for- No radio station connectivity, as seen in Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator.If you are genuinely curious, try it. This review shouldn't stop you from wanting to try it. But I advise against it, due to ETS2 being $22 and ATS $20. There's already the bulk of Europe in ETS2, and the rest is available through DLC, which isn't wallet burning, and ATS is still being developed, which I find very interesting as time goes on. Personally, I bought this game out of morbid curiousity, due to not owning ETS2 myself. It became extremely awkward as there was no sound apart from the truck/lorry I was driving. I do only have 0.5 hours on this game, but that's all you really need to experience it. Any one is better suited buying ETS2 or ATS.Play it or don't, your choice.			"

												Good and relaxing game to play although it lacks some major features of its great successor ETS 2. (i.e. real career mode) Nevertheless I like the idea of this game and I enjoy driving across Europe delivering the goods, almost feeling like a trucker myself.At the start of the game you choose your starting country and will be able to buy your own truck. You will then begin to make deliveries for the local industries to earn money which you can spend into upgrading your truck (like better fuel consumption) or buying trading agreements for additional countries as well as obtaining certificates for being egilible to transport specific wares.If you don't like games where nothing spectacular happens then this game is nothing for you. It's quite the opposite in fact and probably this is the major reason for me to like this game as it is something completly different than what I normally play.			"

												I'm going to be completly honest here: this is my first OWNED(and no I'm not a pirate) Truck Simulator Game.By the recommendation I like this game a lot! I even went out of my way to sell some of my items to buy the game!Pros:Good alternative to people who are poor and don't have a computer to run Euro Truck Simulator 2 or American Truck Simulator. (Funny enough I have a GTX 1070 FE in my computer)This game still holds the basics of every Truck Simulator game! You go ahead and do a certain task and you have money to buy another truck.Has a decent selection of trucks (As far as I can tell).Cons:Pretty dated graphics (Even for 2008).Pretty dated in general.The map is not as detailed as the other two games.Conclusion:I recommend this game if you are short on money in your steam account and just want to enjoy a classic! Honestly if you haven't played a Euro Truck Game and you're not the type of person that has steam cards flooding then this is a great game to pick up!			"

												Honestly, This game has made a huge impact on my life. Positive and negative. Lets start off with the positives. I got to drive to a down, and run people down on roads. I looked through the mirrors too much and crashed, but it was a very fun experience. Now the negatives. My friends don't like me anymore, my parents disowned me. But I'm a trucker, my dream.10/10 would ruin life again			"

												Even though this game hasn't got a number 2 after it. its still as good you can see the improvements in euro truck simulator . But this game lacks the sat nav so you have to use the signs to get to you destionation. I cant really grumble at this game because ETS2 doesn't run that well on my windows tablet but this game runs perfect no lagging and no crashing im so pleased i can play this on my tablet. This game is for the low end pc and thats perfect.			"

												I'm going to be completly honest here: this is my first OWNED(and no I'm not a pirate) Truck Simulator Game.By the recommendation I like this game a lot! I even went out of my way to sell some of my items to buy the game!Pros:Good alternative to people who are poor and don't have a computer to run Euro Truck Simulator 2 or American Truck Simulator. (Funny enough I have a GTX 1070 FE in my computer)This game still holds the basics of every Truck Simulator game! You go ahead and do a certain task and you have money to buy another truck.Has a decent selection of trucks (As far as I can tell).Cons:Pretty dated graphics (Even for 2008).Pretty dated in general.The map is not as detailed as the other two games.Conclusion:I recommend this game if you are short on money in your steam account and just want to enjoy a classic! Honestly if you haven't played a Euro Truck Game and you're not the type of person that has steam cards flooding then this is a great game to pick up!			"

												Euro Truck Simulator is a 2008 truck simulation game created by SCS Software, using OpenGL, set in Europe. The player can drive across a depiction of Europe, visiting its cities, picking up a variety of cargos, and delivering them. Over 300,000 copies of the game have been sold in Europe. Its followup, Euro Truck Simulator 2, was released in 2012.Players choose their starting country, from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (V1.2 & V1.3 only). Initially players only have access to their starting country, except if it contains less than three cities. In this case one or more adjacent countries will be accessible as well. For example, starting the game in Italy or Switzerland, you get connection to the other for free. Then, players choose their first truck with a budget of €100,000.After this, players can start taking jobs from various fictitious companies and delivering cargo to various cities in their starting country to earn money. This money can then be spent on a new truck, upgrading the current truck, expanding the business to other countries and obtaining a license to drive flammables and chemicals.			"

												This is by no means your conventional ""good"" game. It features shoddy controls, irritating AI, eyesore textures, and a painfully bland rendition of Europe.Which makes it all the more frustrating how gratifying and addictive this game is. It doesn't add up. It shouldn't add up. But my God, this amalgamation of truckery engrains itself in your every being. Beware, and don't say I didn't warn you when you end up blowing all your real-life money on caffeine pills and truck stop breakfasts after playing this.			"

												This game will make you feel like you are on the road for long stretches of time... watching the daylight and weather and scenery come and go, pulling out of truck stops in the middle of the night, and rolling into town as the sun is rising.There is a pretty serious time commitment here for such a simple game. Things like truck upgrades, unlocking new territories, and hazmat licenses are expensive relative to the amount you get paid for driving. You will be doing a lot of time-consuming long hauls to get a halfway decent truck and open up a few countries.My recommendation would be to load some music files or even audiobooks into the game folder so that you can listen to them through the truck radio, or at least have something going in real life while you play. Otherwise you might get bored before too long just sitting there forever keeping your truck in the lanes... since you're not actually getting paid for it and all. But if you can find a way to multitask it can be a relaxing and fun time.			"

												Don't buy this game. At first it was a fun little Simulator game, but after my first time playing it things only went downhill. I first took off 1 shift at work, then another, then soon I had to start sucking♥♥♥♥♥♥to pay for my Euro Truck Simulator addiction. My wife left with the kids and I only just realized it after I went to the fridge and noticed I was out of pizza rolls, and mountain dew. Thankfully I pee in the 2liters I saved up so I still have drinks for a while. I turned my living room into a Euro Truck because I purchased a rig and placed it into my living room in order to immerse myself even more. But overall a pretty good game I would have to rate it an 8.5/10			"

												I'm 80/20 on this game. I bought it because it is very similar to 18 Wheels of Steel:American Long Haul. It's a good game to pass the time if you're bored and just looking for something to do. I can only play it for so long before i have to take a break from starting to nod off (I could never make it as a real truck driver). But all in all i rate this game an 8/10. The cab of the truck (if you play in first person) looks pretty good detailed, not a lot of choppiness! Good potential in a game for being the first version. Good enough potential that ill have to get the second version just to try it out and see what they updated. Cant say anything about it as i do not have it yet but the time will come.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator is very fun to play when you just want to relax. The easiest way to play is with a USB steering wheel, but it is OK with mouse and keyboard. It's a nice way to just calm down after a tough day, because you don't have to have your full focus on it. This is really nice because you can do something else while you are playing without loosing anything from it. I recomend this game, although I have heard that Euro Truck Simulator 2 is much better, so I would check that out too.			"

												A great game to wind down and relax with once you get in the rut of things. Managing a giant trailer becomes second nature within the first few hours or so. Just gotta worry about fuel, sleep, and your destination, which is understandable if you forget, I did a bunch of times. A good option if your computer can't run Euro Truck Simulator 2, otherwise just get ETS2. No need to waste your time with the first.			"

												This is an amazing game! My friend introduced it to me, and i cant stop playing it! The road trips are great, and the graphics are great! If I had one suggestion/complaint, it would be that the other cars never follow the rules alot of the road. Half the time i had an aciident, the other car had rammed into me. That would be my only complaint for this game. Overall, its an amzing game, and I'm very glad to have it!			"

												First off, if you want to play this game with the keyboard, you'll be disappointed. You need some kind of wheel for nice smooth turns, otherwilse curves will just be a bunch of corners. It's also difficult to drive a straight line. I am using a vintage UltraRacer PC handheld wheel and it works great.Graphics are very good, and the game doesn't miss a frame on my system:i7 6700 4GHznVidia GTX 960 using DirectX32GB RAM4K resolutionThe challenge of this game is having patience. You have to make quite a few runs to advance your certification and to expand into other countires. I don't mind this since I prefer games a bit more on the relaxing side.While realizing that most drivers are idiots, my only wish is for a little more realism on the part of the AI traffic. A car or truck will stop short in front of you for no apparent reason. Don't tailgate and you'll be ok.I recommend this game if you are into simulation. I must emphasize again though. DON'T buy this game if you have no intention of using a WHEEL. You'll only end up complaining and writing a negative review for a game that deserves better.			"

												When I first came to Europe, I have quite a fear in driving around. Coming from a left side steering country and different sides of traffic along with the all new environment and different language, I don't feel really confident in driving in Europe. One day, I have to drive... So instead of driving an actual car and tried it on the road, I picked up this game. I drove in the Europe highway, coming and out of the different city, enjoying the scenery, listening to the local radio, bumping to the car next to me... After a while I got more confident. But does it help me with my actual driving on the road? Well of course not, instead I just rent a car and start driving even though it scares me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time in this simulator.

After a while, I started to take fewer and fewer jobs delivering cargo IRL and started spending more time in Euro Truck Sim. Soon enough I quit my job altogether to play Euro Truck Sim all day. My wife divorced me, but who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ You don't have a wife in the game so why would you need one in real life?

												Driving a truck in reverse is probably one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life.Well, what can I say? If you ever wanted to drive a truck across Europe, then this is for you. I mean, there's not much else to say, it's just like real life itself. Frustrating, annoying, boring, tiring, and what not. Then again, that's life for you, so this game is quite accurate when it comes to that.The experience is way better if you use your own music, you can drive around listening to Rick Astley, for example. That's something that can't be outdone.			"

I spoke to someone who drives trucks for a living across Europe and when he saw this game he could not believe just how realistic it is.The only things missing are the ability to pick up hookers, visiting the glory holes in trucker rest stops and any sense of entertainment or fun.The one thing that really struck me was how similar all the European countries look.  At least it will save me travelling in real life because now I have experienced first hand what it is like to drive from one continent to the next.  The biggest thrill is when you've carted enough apples and other commodities around to be able to upgrade to a better truck, like a red one.

This game is the best game I've ever played. Fallout? God no. Fifa? Suck a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Euro Truck Simulator brings the harshness of driving a truck straight to your computer screen.

												Euro Truck Simulator, is only but the best driving experience game you can play! The world is massive, I find my self playing for a few hours, end up getting tired and then sleeping for about 10 mins! This game is uber realistic! My only complaint would be there is no truck modifications you can buy like rockets or a spider drone! But from that, the territory you are in is realistic, the road and buildings are based upon real places. I would recommend this game to everybody!			"

												Euro Truck Simulator Review:It is a very good and unique game one of the best simulators in my opinion however it is very confusing and almost 75% of the features were not told to you in the tutorial it would also be a much better game if they added in a satnav/GPS system in as its pretty anoying and hard for some people to locate the selected area when they have to keep looking on the map as its too hard to tell from the road.Compared to Euro Truck Simulator 2 which I paid £26.99 & I paid £5.99 for Euro Truck Simulator 1 I dont think there is a massive difference in gameplay however i do prefer Euro Truck Simulator 2 but after playing Euro Truck Simulator 1 I regret buying Euro Truck 2.I would overall rate this game 65/100.Should deffinetly try it if the game ever goes on sale, but its still worth it if you like this kind of game/ if you like simulation type games.

												Euro Truck Simulator is a fun and hillarious simulator game with good mechanics to freshen the game up. The game includes vast locations and great jobs to deliver cargo, wood, etc. The driving is flawless and you will need a lot of money to keep up in the game because once you are broke it's game over. The graphics are good for it's time and they still kinda hold up. I recommend this game to any simulator fans and driving fans because the drving is great. I give this game a 8 out of 10.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator is a fun / relaxing game where you drive a truck around. Expand your area of influence by purchasing rights to a country neighboring yours, and choose carefully between paying for upgrades for your truck or buying a new and better one. So why would I say such good things about it and give a ""NO""? Simple: Everything Euro Truck Simulator does, ETS2 does twice as well. And then ETS2 does a lot of things the original does not. Such as having an in-game radio allowing you to listen to Euro Truck Radio. Sure it's a bit more expensive, but well worth the price difference.			"

												I'm not going to make this game out to be something it isn't. Euro Truck Sim is a half-baked idea with potential.While the premise is cool, the gameplay is surprisingly shallow. Get Euro Truck Simulator 2 instead.			"

												Unless you genuinely want to drive trucks for a living, don't buy this game. I bought this as a joke game, to laugh at how unfun it was, but ended up just having no fun at all! It's not the games fault, it's mine. Just take my advice. Listen to everyone else, don't buy it unless your a truck driver..			"

												It does not matter if your a gamer, a truck driver, or both. If you buy this game, even for the cheapness, you WILL bang your head against the wall, regretting your decison. This is the most boring peice of crap I have ever purchased. It needs to be free to play even though it is so terrible anyway. Top speed of a truck? Guess. Oh you think you can modify it to go faster than a bugatti veyron? Nope, youve spent so much money running people over, dinging cars, and paying for gas that you dont have enough to buy a frickin fruit roll up. I guess it looks very good at first, athsteticly, but please belive me and do not buy this game.			"

												I have been play ATS for a while with my Logitech G2 controler and it works great.  However, with this game when I hit the breaks, it goes into reverse.  I did not like that at all.  Hit the gas and its auto shifts, which is fine but still to stop the truck from reversing you have to hit the gas.  Ok. that does not seem right and its completely unnatural to drive.  Please transfer the ATS control information into Euro Truck Simulator so I can give this a thumbs up.  Unless I missed a download.  Please let me know.  So far I like the game and really wanted to try it out.			"

												In my opinion, this isn't the best game. Unless you really like trucks, then it's the most amazing thing since sliced bread. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest it.Here is what I think of it.The controls aren't greatIf you perfer the inside view and have it on low graphics you can't see anything when the sun is shining your wayIt's extremely hard to not crash into anybodyIt's pretty hard to control all togetherYou can hardly see what you need to on most of the camera views (ie, Red lights, other cars, ect)And In the one place you SHOULD see the important things (gas, speed ect) you can't. That being the inside view. I myself perfer to have a simulator feel like you are actually in the scenerio, this game being truck driving I'd imagine you would be inside the truck when driving it. Maybe it was just because I had low graphics on? I don't know.Sorry for going on a minor rant at the end but yes. Thats my review. What I'd rate it? 3/10. Isn't the worst I have seen but in my opinion, still pretty bad.			"

												I downloaded this because it was on sale and, frankly, wanted to have at least one of these titles in my library for the pure comedic effect. If you want to do the same, don't do it with this version. Go for Euro Truck Simulator 2. In-fact, once Euro Truck Simulator 2 becomes, oh, seven years old or so, replace that recommendation with Euro Truck Simulator 3, or whatever nonsense they've added after ""Euro Truck Simulator"". These games incite cackles from friends, and a quick jaunt is fun enough, but, considering the appeal is already pretty low, you don't want to have outdated graphics on-top of it. And, if you haven't reached driving age yet, maybe just ignore my review altogether. I can see how this might be fun for someone that hasn't yet experienced the torture of sitting behind a wheel for hours-on-end.			"

												Fun in theory, horrible to play in actuality. Impossibly bad controls, gravity-free physics (seriously, you tap the key to turn and your truck swerves violently across four lanes of traffic). I also couldn't get any music to play (that could've been an error of mine though, to be fair).It could be me, not being a PC gamer by default, but it seems you need at least three hands to operate fluidly. You need one for directional control, one for the mouse, and at least another hand for the wipers, horn, lights, gears, etc.I loved the idea, it seems like it SHOULD be one of those games that is relaxing to play, no real rush, quite pretty in its own way... but no. It's infuriating. The slightest twitch makes you lose your trailer, or gain an offence.I overturned my trailer (which was detatched from my truck) at one point, paid out almost 1800 Euros for help, and despite my money going (leaving me with no money for petrol), my trailer remained on its side until I rammed it back up the right away (which of course gained me offenses etc).2 might be better. I might get the demo. Wouldn't bother with this one, though.			"

												Oh god! This game is sooooooooo boring! I'd rather call it a simulator of simulator. Want to buy/play it? Consider those:Pros:- you drive a truck - which is not as easy as it seems - although all you have to understand is how to ride back.- the time of driving from one city to another is shortened (as the route too)Cons:- Boring! Nothing happens during the game except some small car axcidents (and do not expect them to be phisically real)- All the entertainment is to crash others on the road or listen to your-own-prepared radio (with OGG files)- You cannot use lots of buttons available in the track- No CB radio - come on!- You should stick to the law (speed, lights), but in the end you just pay the bills for not driving correctly. There's no police to hunt you down. Also no speed checks, and the speed is not corresponding to the law of the countries you drive through.-  Lack of customization for the trucks.- UI is so useless...Short: DON'T BUY IT!			"

												I'm really not sure how this got to be popular. The driving feels far too heavy to be enjoyable, even for a simulator, and there are so, so many bugs in the physics engine and the AI's control of their vehicles for me to avoid running out of money while transporting goods.The AI change lanes as fast as the cars on the freeways in GTA: San Andreas did - i.e. faster than your lumbering starter truck could ever hope to. They do so even when you are in the lane, which forces you to slam on the brakes lest you rear end them, leaving their car totally uninjured (i mean, really? we had destructable car models years and years ago) and immobile in the middle of the freeway. This often causes pileups as although your brakes are terrible, the AI's brakes are worse.The character model is horribly dated, even for 2008 - while your truck is quite a pretty piece of graphics, the character driving it has a grand total of three different animations - ""turn left, turn right, not turning"", and they jar horribly if you're viewing the vehicle from the front.It appears to be very, very quickly churned out by a junior company for a driving school, not a full fledged trucking game which I hoped.I heard the sequel is better.

												I would recommend people to try the ETS2 Demo and or buy it. It is a better upgrade, this game the truck drifts around corners like it is on ice. You have to over correct the steering. It seems that the driver is 24/7 drunk. Fuel lowers after 2 km and finding a place to sleep after 15 minutes. I am just going too write this off as a 3 dollar loss.			"

												Well programmed, does what it promises to do. There is a major flaw however: driving around virtual cargo is no fun at all. Added to that, the roads and the scenery hardly depict the real world. Short routes, unrealistic cities and bland graphics which are repeated at several sections in the game. Might be passable for young children, avoid if you are looking for a driving sim.			"

												Really borning game without much content. It's driving from point A to point B. Hardly any traffic to deal with, no cops instead you just get fined once you do something wrong. Speeding tickets constantly if you get far enouhg ot buy a faster truck, also headlight violations when it's not even dark out. Also, no time limits on the shipments, makes getting fuel and getting rest pointless, you just stop by one on your way to the drop off point. Literally the only things you can do with money is Buy faster trucks, or buy countries so you can travel even longer.  The most exciting thing that happens is when it rains. Probably one of the worst simulators I've ever played			"

You can sometimes get away with a few soft bumps on another vehicle. The speed limit detection is terrible. Once I got fined for going at 30KMP in a 40KMP speed area.3. Needs to be a bigger selection of cargo and some sort of drawback to transporting volatile goods.4. The ability to transport goods into another country is too expensive.			"

												I am really disappointed.Bartle's game referrence:Achieving: pretty much to deliver and achieves to obtain! 6/10.Exploring: once you see one - you'll see all. 3/10.Activity: no comparsion at all or any kind of competitors. 3/10.Socialising: next to no social interactions, only horn. 1/10.Bottomline: this game is great if you want to try such gameplay for the first time! Hurry when you want, buy country road passes and deliver loads of cargo on different slightly ugradeable (in vanilla) trucks!This game have a long life. But it is still laggy-buggy and, well, pretty boring due to low game mechanics in it.Pros: it runs on office notebooks, it can use steering wheel.Cons: grafic effects are worse than in russian truck game of 2002, gameplay is boring due to only one option - drive, no RPG elements, only very simple grind, no any half-hidden locations to explore or use. No easy way to see achieves... (culled) ...and even more: engine does not stop when you stops on gear.Lags: when I try turn head to look at mirrors this game becomes laggy. Much more laggy than PayDay2!Bugs: when I try to change settings in-game, the game fail textures, text, other output. But still works. And for the finish: in logs was found pretty awesome line:  ""syntax error in (/effect/eut/water/r2xx.atifs) at line 43 - token [,]"". Syntax error, Karl! It was still unfixed up to 22.11.2015 (day of this post).			"

												All the negative reviews are true and I agree with them all. I have owned this game about 3 years and have not played it mutch, about 16 hours, which was 16 hours to long, To find out  after 16 hours of game play and barely make enough money you can't buy more trucks and hire more drivers for the area you can cover. EPIC FAIL. I own 3 other tuck simulation games and this one is the worse. I doubt I will buy Euro Truck Simulator 2. Basically they are selling poor { junk} games with the ooooo  and aaahhhh factor of he truck graphics whick are not all that great.			"

												First time i've seen a game that gives me problems with vehicle steering. The steering controls do not work properly. They are defaultly disenabled. I constantly have to enabled them and even when i do enable them, it doesnt register. Even though they recommend a gamepad or steering wheel (i do have a gamepad - logitech, and ps 3 controller) i cant get my gamepad controls configured because there isnt even a keystroke command assigned to for ""steering left"" or ""steering right"" in the first place. So all i have done this past 0.5 hour is constantly restarting the game and moving the trucks forward and backward. Sometimes the steering would randomly work with just keyboard option. Save your money instead and get euro truck simulator 2 maybe.			"

												As a casual player who doesn't really play casual games, I can only think of a single reason to play such a game: The Scenery. But this game has none.  Everthing seems the just same. Details are poorer than driving games 10 years older than that. Different places are hardly distinuishable, cities are really sparse (ie, in Switzerland there is only Bern, in Italy just Rome and Milan), and when you visit them, they just look like small villages in the middle of nowhere. Perhaps that's what a truck driver sees, visiting only the industrial areas of citiies, but, even so, not once I experienced the magnificence of observing a really large city from a distance.Music is inexistent; still no radio stations available after 4 hours of playtime, so I had to open an external music player to listen to while driving. Controls are not satisfying either (quite clumpsy), but perhaps I'm using the wrong truck.To give you an idea about ""role playing"" part, I have to repeatedly drive between Bern and Rome about 15 times, just to unlock a new area, in the hope of seeing something barely different.From the trading aspect, there are no real choices: Just sort the missions and take the one that gives the most money. Taking short missions is not a clever choice imho, due to the time lost during long manuevers inside ""cities"".Besides the relatively prototype idea, nothing interesting.			"

												No.seems more like a money milking game then any other.the graphics are poor, the whole experience is sad and the maps are unreleastic and not very enthralling.to avoid.I you want to drive slowly through a city, get GTA4/5, pick a truck and drive around slowly with that. dispite GTA not having 1st person perspective, the immersion factor is still 1000x better than this ""simulator""ps: Brussels is made up of more than 5 streets.

												I love Euro Truck Simulator 2 its great buy that one instead. This is game feels like a Beta for ETS2. The steering is terrible. The towns are far apart and the the scenary in between towns is dull and boring. Also add to that no GPS, no auto parking the load and the diesel trucks that you drive around feel like toys. Its just not very much fun to play. Buy Euro Truck Simulator 2 and skip this one.			"

												I relished at the thought of driving a truck across Europe, but then I noticed that this game is more boring then watching the ""Titanic"" in Spanish after the minutes racked up, the more I wanted to jump off a tower and scream that I like drinking Jack Daniels while ballz deep in a squealing pig, and if I survived I would have to just say ""Thanks Obama"" and accept the fact that I would have to go home and live with this abomination of a game is still in my library makes me cry when I go sleep. But if you like driving a truck across Europe then be my guest.			"

												This game stinks if you expect to play it with a controller.If you want to play it with mouse and keyboard  it will work, but there is too much good stuff out there to waste an afternoon trying to get this to work with a control pad....even if there is some way to make this work with d or x input it wouldn't be worth the time it would take you to figure it out, even if the game is worth a dollar, it isn't worth the time you have to spend to make it work with modern hardware.Avoid.

												I was looking forward to relaxing with Euro Truck Simulator. Switching off my brain and taking to the (digital) open road after a full day of work really appealed.Then I found out how clunky the controls were. Handling is terrible whether you're using a keyboard and mouse or a controller, and frankly there's no rescuing a driving game with bad controls. A beautiful open world can't make up for terrible handling, especially in a driving simulator.			"

But it is fun, and this earns the right to be called a simulator, while still being a game that isn't incredibly time consuming. The distance and time aren't real-time and to scale, but it's a game, not virtual reality. I have yet to encounter issues with anything, which is great. I also reccomend playing this game while blasting ""Highway To Hell."" Good luck, mutha trucka! (See what I did there? No, OK.)			"

												This game and ETS2 are the best truck driving simulators out on the internet.It takes some time to get used to. The game teached you not to just drive at top speed and ram other motorists out of your way.If you have a choice of picking any truck driving simulator game, don't pick Rig n Roll.			"

												SImple curiosity brought me to Euro Truck Simulator; I kinda felt like trying a more realistic/unusual simulator (my only experiences with simulators has been Kerbal and Sim Cities).What I got was pretty much what I expected.  Drive around, looking at environment as you try to do your best on deliveries; small goals with small challenges, that were momentarily rewarding.  The biggest problem I've found has been a lack of detailed roads and customization in your truck.  I'm not saying go crazy, but I never found any ways you could modify or trick out your truck at a small fee.  If they are there, it would have been nice to have the tutorial point you in that direction; this also kinda illustrates the problem with your truck/sleepiness/cargo status.  Didn't really make it clear what the ramifications are of not sleeping, following road rules, etc.Beyond that, its moderately interesting.  I feel like only a select few types of people would get enough enjoyment out of this to legitimize the full price, but at $2.50, might be worth a pick up if you're curious.			"

												So i picked up euro truck simulator 2 about a year and i love that game, I played many hours of it and have enjoyed every minute of it. I have always seen this and i thought it was interesting since its the first entry in the series. Recently they had it in a humble bundle so i seen it and said it was the perfect time to pick it up. So i could only play about 20 minutes of, which 15 of those where trying to set up the control system for my controller. Its bad compared to ETS2, it may be one of the worst games i have ever played. I dont even know where to start.First i was a using  controller but for the life of me i couldn't  turn down the steering senstivite as much as i did in the options menu it had no affect in the actually game. Than i couldnt place look left to right on any joysticks i had to use the mouse which usually isnt annoying but when you have a controller in one hand and having to move foward to move the mouse gets annoying pretty fast. I guess you can say thats a first world problemThe gps menu is horrible, i could follow it and all but its just bad i would rather just get a paper map. The graphics are decent not the best but ok at least to me.The settings to adjust the controls are there but they are very clunky.I would say more but i only played about 20 minutes till i said ♥♥♥♥ it.The one thing I am glad that SCS did was learn from the mistakes of this game and make a great game with ETS2. The good thing is ETS2 is cheap enough to get for those looking not to spend a lot. Which i highly suggest, skip this altogether dont even think about just get ETS2. (Worst game ever maybe a little too far because there have been some horrible games out there) "

												So at first, you start out as a simple small time truck driver who delivers small things at first like ice-cream and what not, then you'll want to get a license to transport bigger stuff, like gasoline, diesel, ect. After a while the game does get a bit repetitious, but the customization options make the game really nice, it nails the truck simulation head on, even if it's boring, it's still achieving what it sought to do. It's also fun to get bored and smash all the cars you see then call roadside assistance for a fee, then go smash more cars. Oh and pro-tip: get gas whenever you see the station.			"

												It may be the older version, meaning it is fairly limited in terms of truck customization and map extensiveness (somewhat limited on total locations), but if you can get past that, its highly addictive, and for those who enjoy a good driving simulator, surprisingly good fun. The low price is also a very good selling point, giving you a pretty well-done, immersive game experience, more than you'd get from just the demo for Euro Truck Simulator 2. A good stepping stone to warm up for ETS2. Overall rating: 9/10, just wish the trucks could be customized a little more.			"

												I have played this game for a while. I like the game. But I would not recommend it. Unfortunately, it's boring. It contains so much less content than the newest game, and it also lacks any punch or interaction other than turning on the lights, putting your parking brake on, and looking at the map. I understand there's not all that much more interaction in the newest game but there's SOME. Some that this game lacks. If you're going to buy this game, don't. Wait until ETS2 goes on sale.			"

												Not as good as some of the truck simulator games I have played this one really felt like it was lacking in features and the controls are not very good nor responsive. Though it had some neat ideas like you can buy access to new areas and do more ""cross country"" stuff for more money. Also has speed limits which was kind of cool though it was kind of mind numbing at times too I felt like it was lacking real options not to mention it seemed like everything always looked the same it had no defining features as far as mapping went which was kind of disappointing. All in all while the game wasnt great it was playable and if your into just driving around the speed limit dropping off cargo then this game would be okay for you. The controls feel like they are lacking.However im sure if you used one of the steering wheel hardware it might be better.			"

												I've also played the second one and knowing that this one is it's predecessor we can all expect this one to be much worse, and it is. much worse. its just so boring driving from one city to another. every main road/highway looks identical and with the truck you have you have to drive for about 10-15 minutes which feels like hours. Even the main cities such as Berlin or Amsterdam all look identical; just a few roads (which some of them are locked anyway) leading to a freeway. Graphics are not too bad for a 2008 game. Another bad thing is the trucks, from what I can remember you have 4 truck brands which are not even licenced trucks so they have a fake name and you can't even customize them, all you can do is just upgrade the engine which will make the truck a bit quicker or upgrade your fuel tank so you can drive for a longer distance. would not recommend, you'll be better off getting the second one which is actually really good			"

												Very casual and relaxing. Choose a brand, go deliver some goods, earn money, buy better truck, unlock other countries. No need to hurry, just drive decent. The cruise control is awesome...Nice virtual Europe (i really miss Scandinavia though, being from Denmark) But I like this... It feels better to control, than ETS 2... More arcade... Easier, I guess... I like the navigator better, the trucks are steady, there are lots of little things that I enjoy more than in ETS2. I love the simple way everything is handled, and gives you a good overlook. The message-log is awesome, miss that in ETS2. And you can visit Rome and other cities that are not in ETS2...But ETS2 is prettier and bigger, and you can hire drivers to work for you ... And it has a Scandinavia DLC - So I bought that too ;)Graphics in ETS1 are descent though... Perhaps a bit too much copy/paste, some roads are too alike. The countries and cities could also have been more different looking. I would have liked a few more (and bigger) cities ... I could NOT find any mods for this? The interior of the trucks are bad, you can't see the speedometer when turning the wheel, realistic, perhaps but annoying. First I got tired the first few hours of the game, but it gets exciting once you've done a few runs, and can upgrade. It is difficult trying to get enough money... It can be very repeteative, and the first trucks you can afford are very slow... When I ALT-TAB, I have to save and load to get the game to work. With steering wheels, the game is twice as good :)The short review: More arcade than ETS2			"

												Its okay, but after playing Euro Truck Simulator 2 this game steering is slow. But the trucks look way better strangly in the first one. This game requires more skill than its sequel, instead of gps's like the first you use the map, wich is more hard in some cases but i would recomend this game. But it you had the money for the 2nd you should get it.~CaptSqui♥♥♥♥ushy			"

												This is one of the most frustrating games ever. The graphics are total crap, the controls are not user friendly and it took me 10 minutes plus detatching my trailer 100 times before I finally got to load it in. Whenever I'm on the highway going as fast of my can with the cheapest startout truck that uses all of your money the cars ram into the back of me and I lose money every time they do that. I had to spend a good 30 minutes going somewhere to drop off the gargo and I end up losing more money than I made. I'm never playing this again.			"

												Had a road trip from Glasgow to London and didn't realise how low I was on fuel. I was 2 minutes away from my destination... Then came the hill! I forced my truck up the hill and was going at full-speed (which for my terrible truck was 15 Mph). I had almost no fuel left and the drop off point was straight ahead... I was shouting and chanting and I made it. I was given £500 for the trip and then £200 was taken off of my total due to taking 3 days longer than I was meant to. ""Ok"" I said to myself as I scrolled down the list of money added and taken off my trip. -£100 for incorrect light usage... -£150 for driving on the wrong side of the road... and finally -£100 for going through red traffic lights and crashing... I had lost £50 from this journey. I felt awful. I took the next load of items and began to drive off... Then I ran out of petrol. Another was of money lost. This time it was £1000.  But seriously, this game is pretty awesome. 10/10 from me and is definately the best game to irritate the hell out of you!			"

												As a game, I enjoy Euro Truck Simulator, it's nice and comfy to drive across country delivering goods to people to make consumers able to consume (but that's not part of the game, so don't worry about it).  But what I do have a bit of an issue with is the AI...  The AI in Euro Truck Simulator drives aggressively.  They honk if you're not going top speed the moment a light changes, they constantly want to pull in front of you (and then apply their brakes), they want to apply their brakes also if you happen to change lanes and are now behind them.I was driving southbound from Belgium to Paris, and checked my map, I needed to make the next right turn.  But there was a merge from another highway onto the same highway I was on before the right hand turn.  Oh boy.  So another truck hauling wood turns in from the right and for whatever reason doesn't merge, but he makes sure to keep SAME SPEED.  I speed up, he speeds up.  I slow down, he slows down.  What an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  So I brake rapidly and pull into the lane behind him at 60, he slams his foot on the brakes, and bam, rear ended him because this guy did not want me to get where I was going with my cheese.Yelling profanity and quit the game.10/10, will truck drive again later.

												This game is surprisingly pretty good, especially if you're bored and can't decide on a game to play. It's also pretty relazing, driving through the countryside. However, one thing that I'd like to point out, is that there is no auto-save. I was hoping there would be some kind of backup save system, but there isn't. Not to say that this is really a bad thing, but just remember to save fairly frequently. My computer just crashed, and I lost all my progress since last night, which is a total of about 7 hours... Still a highly recommended game, especially if you don't have a good enough computer for the second game, or if you're just too cheap to buy it.			"

												If you are looking for something to pass the time for a bit, it's an okay game. Honestly, I would invest into getting ETS 2, because it's much bigger and involves building up a company, which actually has a story to the game. The map is so much bigger in that game as well. Again, this was a good starting point, so I would get it if you want to get something cheap. An even better suggestion for all you Americans out there, wait until next month (or so) for American Truck Simulator to be released. That's sure to be awesome.			"

												I guess this is a fantastic simulation of driving a truck across Europe, at least in one regard: within the first hour or so, I felt the same degree of boredom that I can only assume truck drivers deal with on a daily basis. The game consists of maneuvering a huge, slow behemoth of a vehicle through drab, repetitive highways and crowded, narrow city streets while observing all the rules of the road and remembering to fill up with gas and stop for sleep. If you can tolerate repeating that task over and over until you've earned sufficient money, you get to buy a bigger, shinier rig so that you can -- drumroll please -- continue doing the same thing some more!Trust me, it is precisely as monotonous as it sounds. Stay away unless your real life is so overflowing with excitement and intrigue that you need the most boring of games to unwind to every night.			"

												At first I was a little sceptical to buy this game, but it was on sale when I bought for a cheap price. And I have to say, I it's not as bad as I thought it would be. In Euro Truck Simulator you are thrust into the shoes of a truck driver in his own buisness. It takes a little to get the hang of it but it is surprisingly addictive. Yes, it does get boring but overall its a fun game to play. Is it worth it when it ISN'T on sale? Eh.... not really. If you really want it just get it, but if you can wait, wait until it gets cheaper. Overall it's a challenging game and an entertaining one.			"

												For a game made in 2008, this has a lot of playability. Just like ETS2 but more simplified and to the point. Unlike in ETS2, you start with buying a truck, unlike the quick jobs in the sequel. A lot of things are different. All you have for roads are motorways, city streets, and buildup areas. There's no country roads, but I like it because it is simplified and more direct. One thing I don't like about this game is that the steering is way too jerky; there's no accelerated steering, meaning the longer you push the button, the more you steer. This problem can be fixed with a controller probably, but I haven't tried that yet. Also, dat menu music. It gets catchy, and I like it!All in all, if you like ETS2, but if you are poor as♥♥♥♥♥♥or have a crappy computer, this is the game for you. It captures the essence of ETS2 and puts it in a package that is small enough for everyone to like.Also, get this game whilst it's on sale. I got this game for $2 USD; dat's cheap!			"

												Had a road trip from Glasgow to London and didn't realise how low I was on fuel. I was 2 minutes away from my destination... Then came the hill! I forced my truck up the hill and was going at full-speed (which for my terrible truck was 15 Mph). I had almost no fuel left and the drop off point was straight ahead... I was shouting and chanting and I made it. I was given £500 for the trip and then £200 was taken off of my total due to taking 3 days longer than I was meant to. ""Ok"" I said to myself as I scrolled down the list of money added and taken off my trip. -£100 for incorrect light usage... -£150 for driving on the wrong side of the road... and finally -£100 for going through red traffic lights and crashing... I had lost £50 from this journey. I felt awful. I took the next load of items and began to drive off... Then I ran out of petrol. Another was of money lost. This time it was £1000.  But seriously, this game is pretty awesome. 10/10 from me and is definately the best game to irritate the hell out of you!			"

Sucks that there are only a few trucks (that look like garbage trucks) that you can buy in the beginning BUT you can get more trucks as u progress. You learn geography and you learn about a trucker's life! It's a REAL simulator, if you crash, don't have headlights on at certian times, run a red light, or go on the wrong lane you get fined!

												It's not terrible, but it does lack the polish and refinement that a good game should have. Controllers are not turned on by default, and need tweaking to the settings to get working smoothly. The mini-map is awkward to follow with symbols regularly being obscured. The tutorial, for instance, instructs you to navigate to a symbol on the map which you won't be able to see, as it is hidden under another symbol. Warnings and dialog boxes are enormous and obscure your view, and menus can't be controlled with a controller or keyboard, only with the mouse. More importantly, the game-world lacks variety.Cheers to the developers for trying something out that is different and potentially quite enjoyable, but I wouldn't actually pay money for what feels like an unfinished ""concept"" game.

												Despite the year of this game that was released, some old games throughout the years are worth the time to play. With what I'm going to tell you is, if you have the time and patience to play then this is your type of game. Not all of us have patience for a slow-moving truck, but that's pretty much the same for reality and this simulator grants you anything that is implemented. There are various ways to control your truck and how to drive it too. You can have a top, side, forward, bumper view when it comes to driving from place-to-place. Surely though be careful if you do play this game. There are downfalls where if you have many accidents you will be charged and if you do not meet the estimated amount to pay for your damages then it's game over and have to start over with a new truck. That's what I learned anyways, I made so many bad turns and signals that crossing the wrong way towards oncoming traffic also gives you a fine! I was, however, waiting to see if you would be chased down by an officer for slamming into other cars various times and nothing happened yet. xD			"

												A much simpler game than its famous sequel, there are far fewer roads to drive on, the map itself feels much smaller, truck selection is far more limited, and many gameplay features were added in ETS2. Overall the sequel has improved on everything except one thing. That one this is optimization. ETS1 runs far better on max settings than ETS2 does on minimum settings.If your computer is not very powerful, I would recommend getting this version over ETS2. This can run well on effectively any computer that can run steam. It also is less than half the price if you are on a budget. If you are not on a budget and have a good PC, ETS2 would be a better buy at this point, but if not this is still an excellent game that is worth getting.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Euro Trcuk Simulator is a driving simulator game developed by SCS Software, the same people behind the 18 Wheels of Steel franchise and the Bus Driver game along with many other simulation gamesA bit of history as to how I knew SCS Software and why I love their games, I orignally discovered SCS Software's games with 18 Wheels of Steel, a trucking game which took place in countries all over the worldI loved the game so much that my family relatives would always get me an 18 Wheels of Steel game for Christmas or my birthday, all the way to the last game in the series titled: 18 Wheels of Steel: Extreme Trucker 2 which ended my love of the 18 Wheels of Steel seriesI also played the bus simulator game known as Bus Driver and both the 18 Wheels of Steel games and the Bus Driver, I now own all of them on retail, however you can now buy them digitally on SteamNow with the history lesson out of the way, let's go onto Euro Truck SimulatorEuro Truck Simulator takes place in the lovely continent known as Europe where you can drive and deliver items to all sorts of companies across Europe. From the United Kingdom to Germany and from Italy to France and so onThe game is extremely relaxing as you just drive on long highway roads travelling from one country to another. However, the game does also penalize you for driving incorrectly such as going the wrong way, through a red traffic light, driving on the wrong side of the road, hitting a car or a truck, no indicators, speeding and so on. So it's not all relax on the busy streets of EuropeYou deliver all sorts of items from food to livestock to hardware and big bulky things across the European landscapes and deliver it to your next port of call. The game is extremely easy yet oddly satisfying, relaxing and a huge time wasterThe game's graphics are okay but do show their age. Euro Truck Simulator came out in 2008 and uses an older engine that SCS Software uses on their games. I know because some of the graphical options, sound effects and even music is recycled from SCS Software's other games of the time such as the 18 Wheels of Steel series and the Bus Driver game which came out a year before in 2007This may put off some people but for me I don't really care for graphics, however, if you want prettier graphics than I highly recommend the sequel, Euro Truck Simulator 2 or it's American counterpart, American Trcuk Simulator which has prettier graphics and better A.I.When it comes to the recommendation of whether or not Euro Trcuk Simualtor is the game for you, if you like games that are simulation games and likes games where you just drive around and deliver stuff, then Euro Truck Simualtor is the game for you, otherwise, don't even botherIf you are going for graphical fidelity, I would highly recommend Euro Truck Simulator 2 or American Truck Simulator as they have prettier graphics, better A.I. and more content. If you want to have the SCS Software collection of games, then by all means, start with Euro Truck Simulator DRIVE SAFE!   RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Still a great game after all these years. I enjoy this game very much it brings back the nostalgia of a simple game. I personally enjoy the first ETS(Euro Truck Simulator) versus ETS 2 & American TS. What makes this game really great is that it's not overpolished. No stupid Speed violations every mile. Not really graphic intensive which is a plus for me. The only thing it lacks is a few bugs in the AI vehicles and Lack of time constraints to make it fun. Overall it's in my top 10 games! Would suggest this game to anyone into realism and quality.			"

												This is the first driving simulator I've bought and I will say, it is very unique in a good way.It is not a game, it is a simulator and with that in mind it ticks most of the boxes for realism.Graphics are not great by todays standards, however, it will run smoothly on older PCs and low spec laptops.It can be stressful (just like real truck driving) with an emphasis on obeying traffic laws, fuel consumption, maintenance & damage of truck etc..I like:The level of detail for cockpit view and the realism of controls - (headlights, wipers, cruise control, shifting through the gears)Playing your own music collection through the truck stereo.Day/Night, weather and traffic.I don't like: The repetition of long hauls on mostly boring highways (but it is a simulator!)You have to play for hours and hours to earn very little cash (and spend your profits wisely)Addictive, satisfying but stressful.*I use a keyboard and mouse for controls but would recommend using a game pad controller because the keyboard is very difficult for steering and throttle accuracy.

												I like the driving aspect, moving around from city to city in your own truck. Makes it feel really realistic and bringing in a sense of fun and adventure. My only problem with this game is the jobs. I find it insanely difficult to put the trailer into a warehouse, thus not making this very playable. I still like adventuring and if it came to me, that's what I would normally do.Meh, this game is alright. 6.5/10.Still gets a recommend from me due to the adventure aspect.			"

The tiredness aspect is interesting. All in all, it is a VERY good simulator game.Rating: 8/10Necessity: Must-have for simulator lovers, reccommended as a library staple for everyone else.			"

												Since I have connections to the trucking business, I had to try this one.A pretty old game, with decent looks, that is running fine and not heating up my laptop too much. What else to ask :)I like sim stuff, so I know how to value that meditative atmosphere where you need to concentrate on the task and just go along the designated route. And this is perfect game for that.Sure, a lot of things need to be improved and I will later see if second installment of this game has those things. Roads and junctions could be more complex, weather conditions could vary a bit more, and options for time progression should be adjustable (so if I want to drive real-time, why not?). But if you want some distraction from the dail troubles, a game that will not give you too much stress and where you will be satisfied when you complete a little task, give this game a try.			"

												I guess this is a fantastic simulation of driving a truck across Europe, at least in one regard: within the first hour or so, I felt the same degree of boredom that I can only assume truck drivers deal with on a daily basis. The game consists of maneuvering a huge, slow behemoth of a vehicle through drab, repetitive highways and crowded, narrow city streets while observing all the rules of the road and remembering to fill up with gas and stop for sleep. If you can tolerate repeating that task over and over until you've earned sufficient money, you get to buy a bigger, shinier rig so that you can -- drumroll please -- continue doing the same thing some more!Trust me, it is precisely as monotonous as it sounds. Stay away unless your real life is so overflowing with excitement and intrigue that you need the most boring of games to unwind to every night.			"

It's cheap and I agree with others that it should be checked out at least once.			"

												At first I was a little sceptical to buy this game, but it was on sale when I bought for a cheap price. And I have to say, I it's not as bad as I thought it would be. In Euro Truck Simulator you are thrust into the shoes of a truck driver in his own buisness. It takes a little to get the hang of it but it is surprisingly addictive. Yes, it does get boring but overall its a fun game to play. Is it worth it when it ISN'T on sale? Eh.... not really. If you really want it just get it, but if you can wait, wait until it gets cheaper. Overall it's a challenging game and an entertaining one.			"

												If you are looking for something to pass the time for a bit, it's an okay game. Honestly, I would invest into getting ETS 2, because it's much bigger and involves building up a company, which actually has a story to the game. The map is so much bigger in that game as well. Again, this was a good starting point, so I would get it if you want to get something cheap. An even better suggestion for all you Americans out there, wait until next month (or so) for American Truck Simulator to be released. That's sure to be awesome.			"

												Optimization is not the best, but it's ok.Control is very difficult to handle compared to his successor (Euro Truck Simulator 2).The dashboard is well defined and looks great year and realized the game was released.When a GPS is able to work, but another feeling when you're trying to find the road that takes you to your destination.It is sad that though the game is still played by many people,but he doesn't have a multiplayer mode ... or doesn't make one.The trucks have its own emblem, they have another emblem as the cars of the famous Grand Theft Auto ... it is very very sad.Initially, I wanted to not recommend this game due to optimizations that is not so good and that the trucks did not emblem original manufacturer, but I changed my mind and I can say with hand on heart that I recommend this game because it is very awesome.

												I have never had a game like this. A game that is relaxing up to a certain point. I like driving and this game is a lot of driving. I also received more tickets and moving violations in game than I have had in real life. Also I can't park a trailer to save my life. Regardless of my terrible play I still think it is a pretty good game and would recommend as a way to relax and waste a few hours listening to music or podcasts while trying in futility to park the truck up to the dock, not crash, not run out of gas, and following traffic laws.

												This game is surprisingly pretty good, especially if you're bored and can't decide on a game to play. It's also pretty relazing, driving through the countryside. However, one thing that I'd like to point out, is that there is no auto-save. I was hoping there would be some kind of backup save system, but there isn't. Not to say that this is really a bad thing, but just remember to save fairly frequently. My computer just crashed, and I lost all my progress since last night, which is a total of about 7 hours... Still a highly recommended game, especially if you don't have a good enough computer for the second game, or if you're just too cheap to buy it.			"

I find myself after a 14 hour day of driving still firing this game up to drive some more. I guess you could say I love my job! Anyway, there are some weird things about the game... you drive on the wrong side of the road and all that jazz but those Europeans are always doing some goofy stuff.

I only put about 20 minutes into this game before logging off and going to the local drivers testing center. I told them I wanted to get my CDL license. They asked me if I had practiced, as I would likely not be able to pass it without some practice. I told them I had played Euro Truck Simulator for 20 minutes. The lady didn't really know what I was talking about but let me take the test anyway. I passed with flying colors. Would recommend this game!			"

												Even in the recent Steam Sale, I can't afford for Euro Truck Simulator 2. But since this is cheap, and could even run on a old computer, I say this is still a great game to start you off to Euro Truck Simulator 2. Decent gameplay, but friends could ask ""Why are you playing this?""			"

												Back in 2008 (just after 4 days of game released) I was 8 and purchased my first game.I was played Hard Truck series on my very early childhood,this game was my first HD game and also European trucking simulator.When I first entered,I didn't believe my eyes.That interiors,that environment,was very fascinated me.All these combinations was excited me.Now,in almost 2015,sequel of this legend Euro Truck Simulator is expanded but this game still best for me.And when I saw my game on Steam,I smiled for myself.And when the christmas discounts came over this game,Got it...Legends never die.. Get it if you love SCS Software,get it if you love Euro Truck Simulator franchise ;)			"

You can drive in berlin or some thing in this game hows Euro truck 2 gonna beat that. Despite the inferiority of Euro truck 2, the Euro truck 2 sub-reddit is blooming with posts. menwhile im all alone posting gifs of trucks almost hitting people on the Euro truck sub-reddit and their arent even getting any looksies or comments. I post good stuff, its funny, like real funny not like ha ha funny, like the real deal.			"

												Day 1: I started in the cheapest truck i could afford. Going down the freeway at a blazing 3.2 kmph, I hurried to deliver apples that apparently had no experation date. What was in these apples, why are there no people walking around, how did paris get so small? these are all questions I ask myself as I careen toward the ditch off the side of the road due to fatigue and lag spikes. How is driving an 1000 pound vehicle on a freeway thats as narrow as Hank Hill's urethra so soothing. So, As I lay there burning in a heep of scrap metal with a lime green finish, I say to myself.                         10/10 would lag off the friggin road again			"

												I like the driving aspect, moving around from city to city in your own truck. Makes it feel really realistic and bringing in a sense of fun and adventure. My only problem with this game is the jobs. I find it insanely difficult to put the trailer into a warehouse, thus not making this very playable. I still like adventuring and if it came to me, that's what I would normally do.Meh, this game is alright. 6.5/10.Still gets a recommend from me due to the adventure aspect.			"

												Not as easy to play as ETS2. The steering controls when using a wheel are a bit more complicated(but still achievable) and the economic system can be more challenging...(I keep running out of fuel and don't have the funds to call for emergency services). Still it's one of SCS software's earlier projects so it's not exactly as polished as ETS2 ..for example two major drawbacks are the inabilty to set the FOV or adjust your seat to get a better view in cab view and you cannot tilt the camera down in exterior view like you can in ETS2 making driving in that camera mode just as challenging.

												Basically a good truck simulator game to check and out and get your feet wet if you can get it on sale.  I played this for a little while until Euro Truck Simulator 2 came out and was glad I bought this first at a really low price just to be sure that I would like it.  It introduced me to game mechanics which proved useful when I got into the second game, plus this game was easy to jump into and just have fun without being overly complicated.  After playing Euro Truck Simulator 2 for a while, I came back to this game and still liked it, although the steering controls are definitely ""bouncy"" and ""floaty"" compared to the second game which is much more refined.  As I say, this is a good game to check out if you are not sure if you would like this sort of thing or if you want something that is easy to get into, or just have a low-end system.  Recommended.  It does have Spain and Portugal which are not in the second game as of this writing in December 2016.			"
