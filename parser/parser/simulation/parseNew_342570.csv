												WTF even is this?• Bounce off the ground like a dodgeball.• No bullet travel time, its like ghosts. if its under your recticle it dies.• Planes can just rotate left and right.• no gravity, you can just fly straight up, until you hit the skybox.• only about 2 square km map at its biggest.• graphics and sounds from 1990, my old iphone had games with better graphics.• random plane sounds when the map is empty.• arrow keys and A/S to shoot. No mouse/Joystick options, the description lies.• Not even going to get started on the MASSIVE P2W structure of the game.• Broken English.TL;DR: The dev's accidentally the whole thing.			"

												This is not a good game by any means, The gameplay is abysmmal and doesn't allow you to even decelerate. The Ai targets are just pinata's and are by no means competent. The mission design is lackluster and is just Go here and destroy moronic Ai and the missions barely last 5 minutes. The grinding system is pretty much a looting system to get materials and drops  and is confusing towards new players with no competent tutorial (Doesn't help that the translation is awful.). The game also crashed steam on boot-up the first time and just feels incompetently made.Steam has better Flight options with DCS, and if you want arcade style just get the Blazing angels games, Secret weapons over normandy or even heroes over europe. You also have warthunder if you really need some F2P flying.			"

												UPDATE: Following this negative review, the developers of this game have gone out of their way to personally harass and to add me here on Steam, repeatedly trying to add me over three times before I actually had to block him; I'm not even kidding: http://imgur.com/XNpB3r3Trying to start out in the menu inside this game is like trying to manouver a chinese university blocked child porn website in korean at a resolution that's three times lower than the minimal supported one for your monitor and once you achieve the infallible feat of actually getting a game started, you'll be pleasantly surprised to know that your right hand has generously been cut off to remove any chance of having actual sensual controls with skill-based aiming using the mouse and instead, it has been replaced with a dual-wielding keyboard setup as you are also supplied with constant, forced ""tutorial"" or ""explanation"" pop-ups that also feature the noise of a 12 kilo type-writer being taped onto your head and stuck on loop going CLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICK for every single letter that appears in the middle of your already limited-view screen as the game slowly but surely renders 15 A4 papers of tutorial instructions.In short, you should only play this game in order to find out why you should avoid it.

												My goodness. This game is so bad, I don't even know where to start!-Launcher is ugly as hell.-Don't know why you made the controls keyboard based. There's something called a ""mouse"". And with a game that requires aiming. It's best to use the mouse.-Whenever text is being displayed in-game. It makes the weirdest sound that can ever be projected towards your ears, it makes you want to firmly grip your ears and rip them off.-Game is definitely focused way too much on P2W-English is horrible.-Your plane bounces for no apparent reason...-Controls feel awkward and makes no sense whatsoever.-Not allowed to slow down the plane-Payment is required to join games... Great F2P game. *clap clap*. /sarcasmOverall, I've had more fun trying to play with a Chinese finger trap with a man without hands. The only thing this game is useful for is to teach you the difference of bad games and abominations. (This being the abomination obviously). Seriously, I pity my computer for having to install this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game is an insult and a waste of time even if it's ""Free"". Just making this game free is putting a bad name towards all the other F2P games. Don't waste your time installing this. I played 7 minutes of this game and I already uninstalled it(Good thing that works at least). And I can safely say that this game is literally one of THE worst F2P games I've ever experienced.Developers of this game, what were you thinking?!			"

												After downloading the supposed game via Steam, and then using a very concerning patcher application that managed to minimise all my other windows and applications (talk about intrusive) to download and unpack and install yet more, the complex malware system these developers would like you to throw lots of money at managed to first crash several applications I had running, any clicks on the ingame announcements immediately opened Facebook pages in Internet Explorer (is this 1995?), and when I finally attempted to get away with my soul and quit it, it took Explorer with it.If you ever wanted to explore the fine line between a videogame and a virus, this here is just the tool for it.Please don't run it outside of a Virtual Machine or similar sandbox. The experience isn't jolly. You have been warned. Tread carefully, or better yet don't tread at all.			"

												Life is short, and some games aren't worth your time. Like this one, posing as a F2P flight arcade on the WW2 events.Other reviewers are right, ""Heroes in the Sky"" feels like it was made about 2 decades ago. The visuals, the sounds - all gives you those long forgotten feelings, like from ""Red Baron"" or even ""Knights of the Sky"". Only those games were top-notch hits at the time, and HIS looks like their imbecile child. Plus you have f2p inventory and common grinding/draining the wallet procedures, and a very-very lame HUD/GUI, both in skies and on the ground. Especially on the ground.The only viable reason to download this obsolete-before-its-birth-piece-of-junk-code - is a single achievement, which the game gives you for the very first move in the game - char creation. But, honestly, downloading 2Gb of junk code just to get one achievement and delete the game right afterwards - I personally grade as kinda low move.Anyway, my mark for ""HIS"" is 2.5/10, as well as the title of the most ""un-amazing"" f2p game I've tried for this year.

												this is the worst flight game i have ever not had the pleasure playing. simply terrible. first of all it seems to be a ios port. secondly the graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor and you can only change resolution. the ui and menu for the game is weak at best you will always be wonder how to get out or how to get to the shop. the game provides zero help on how to do this. the control system for the game starts out with the arrow key to fly which is really hard to use to i switched into mouse control as soon  as possible. there are also game pad controls but i didnt even bother. the in game missons are way too easy i was squaded up with a random guy who was play the end game missions while i was still ina biplane. it didnt matter because the enemy ai just flys strait at you and fires. there is no crzy dog fights or any thing. the historical point of the game gets thrown out the window when i realised that the first biplane you get has dump fire missiles (im not even joking) .  if you really want a decent flying game that has skill and is still fun dont come looking here just uninstall this and goe get warthunder it does everything way better			"

												I want to like this game, trust me i really do, but the controls are too strange for a aircraft pc game (like you fly with the arrow jeys and you use weapons with the A-S-D keys) the combat is made far too easy and can be glitchy, i mean like, you don't even have to hit the target to actually deal damage, I can't play this game in full screen and there are no graphics options menu, also has DLC that costs almost 70$ at full price, and most of all and i don't even know why the flying ♥♥♥♥ should i pay (ingame cash mind you) to be able to join games! i mean, isn't the point of making a free2play mmo is that so i could play with other people for free and without hassle??so i will say again that i really, Really, REALLY want to like this game, but i just can'tso until this game is *fixed* and improved, and optimized, i can't recommend this game anymore than i recommend eating your own pile of turd*new edit* also note that i am also not that big a fan of simulators, i completeley understand that this game wasn't meant to be realistic at all, but i have played a game with similar control system to this game, namely it was called Heroes of the Pacific, it was and arcade world war 2 aircraft game, i liked it but idk about you, you control flight with WASD, fire machineguns with SPACE, launch bombs with B control your squad with 1234, it was pretty much like like this game, but it was better and more polished			"

												Just a short review about this game :PROS :+ Gameplay+ Plane avatars. ( Anime girls avatars. )+ Plane models.+ Historical events. PROS/CONS :-/+ Graphics CONS:- Lanuage Interface.. ( All I see is full of Korean and German language. )- Servers, Crappy servers.. Bring back the OLD HIS!- Poorly created game. ( Missing units, Buggy places and etc. )- Pay to win game. - Anti - Cheat software.. X-Trap.. Just no.- Updates.. Worthless updates.. Just new Anime girl avatar(s)? Really? No fix or what?- Physics.. Bouncing plane.. That's cool.Overall :- If you wanted a better game than this. I'd recommend War Thunder.- The developers are greedy especially the Charge HIS$. 1,000 HIS$ for 99.99USD$? Seriously. I could buy the Premium 4 - 5 times for like 50$ or less.. But the Premium isn't worth it cause you still have to buy (Suprise Box Key) In order to get your daily login bonus.- And Developers, Rather bring back the old style HIS or upgrade and fix every SINGLE bug on every missions and many more.- And to high levelers who thinks this review is damb. ( Make your own review mates. )- The game had the potential to become famous. But after the Korean Developers owned this game. It became worst. It's like this game is already a trash.3 / 10 P.s : I'm niko1222 Level 106 ( Allies ) and Quixii Level 121 ( Axis )  "

												Initially, the game intrigued me because I'm a big fan of combat flight simulator games (I played MS Combat Flight Simulator 2 & 3 religiously for years). However, after installation I realized that downloading this game was a horrible mistake.Why you ask? Here is a short list:1. Absolutely disgraceful AI2. Absolutely disgraceful physics3. Tree of life?4. Going into the multiplayer area reminded me of 2012 Runescape Grand Exchange5. Absolutely disgraceful controls6. Although I'm not one to nitpick at graphics... These were over-the-line terrible. This is 2015, not 1995.I hate to say this about games, but I would not recommend even downloading this to your hard drive. It isn't worth the time to uninstall.

												Pros:-The game is easy to play and does not require any knowledge of how planes fly.-No external control device needed, only keyboard is used.-Easy as f*** (so far)-Arcadey, think World of Warplanes with the physics removed almost completely.Cons:-Has no flight model whatsoever, the planes handle like figure skaters... With no ice skates.-Graphics are terrible. Think 'pile of grit' then add some dirt and you have HIS-Sound is irritating to say the least. I've stopped playing it for a good 10 mins now and can still hear the 5 second music loop-The keyboard control makes it hard to aim-Can't do a loopdy-loopOverall, a fair game that requires the right state of mind to play and enjoy. Your opinion on how flight games should be will greatly affect how much you enjoy this. P.S. The tag 'simulator' needs to be removed because i'd be damned if this were a simulation of not only flight, but WWII in general. "

												I saw this game and figured, well I really like WWII, enjoy flight games, and it's free, I guess I might as well try it. Boy was that a mistake. To say this game is a simulation game is an insult to even the worst flight sims out there. You have two directions of movement. Up and down, Left or Right. Essentially you only have Pitch and Yaw. They attempt to make it look like you have roll by automatically in the direction your turning, but that's it. Also, you pitch stops at the 180 degree mark. You can go straight up or straight down, but you can't do a loop of any kind. So basically you can't preform even the most basic of combat manoeuvers. In other words the controls are very basic, which you would think would be a good thing for a casual game, but it goes against even the most basic principles of slight. As far long term gameplay and progression, I really can't say much as I never intend to play this game again. Seriously, if you are interested in a free WWII flight sim, go for Warthunder. Much better graphics, much better controls, basically much better everything. And you can even drive tanks too! Seriously guys, avoid this one like the plague. World of Warplanes is significantly better than this, and that's saying A LOT!			"

												Alright. I am stating my honest opinion here.The game sucks. You just fly up till youre bored. Maybe the stalling makes it some more realistic. Great music. Can listen to it all day. Also, the controls are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Who even uses the arrows anymore?!War thunder is after all a better choice. This game is just for slower computers.			"

												-Free malware-Terrible graphics-Terrible controls-The launcher was already bad 20 years ago-No support of the so-called ""mouse"", it might be useful for aiming, you know...-The English is probably either translated by Google Translate or by the first, the best person they found-There's an accelerate button that almost triples your speed in the blink of an eye-...This game is so bad that it'll make you laugh at how bad it is.If you're interested in a game like this, give War Thunder a try.

												this game still has the same issues as before like quest that isn't working properly, from the look of it they only bother adding new stuff but never bother fixing lots of issues that gamescampus barely fix and some function doesn't work and lots of item or blueprint doesn't have proper text description, basically they rush this game to be release early. they should mention that this game still in alpha or beta stage or something. the game lack of support but still fun to play to waste time hopefully the patch they release improve the game even a little bit as time goes but i had feeling this game won't last if they just focus on adding new stuff instead of fixing the problem.---------------------------------------4/1/15after the patch, the game gotten worse there is no more steam server its global server host by jc planet. alot of bug still persist like not gaining exp and etc.			"

												More cons than pros here, for sure. You want to like it, but controls are horrible. Mouse feels terrible. Joystick is worse. Keyboard is a joke. Upgrading your plane and weapons is super expensive. Their Gear lab is a joke. Their Gear lab success rate for upgrading weapons is super low.  There's too much content in-game. Too many missions. The Raids are super hard, because the enemies HP is set super high. A lot of hackers spying and malwaring players PC's. 0 game support. The developers hate talking and interacting with players in-game. I think it should be in American hands/owners, Korean owners are terrible with customer care.There's actual players here that can send you bugs/viruses to your PC; Through to your computer. Honestly; Online gaming is the Worse. No, honestly. You're better off playing game consoles: XBOX, PS4 etc.  You won't have to deal with two-face, manipulating, lowlife, homosexual hackers constantly.  ;)       No, honestly.			"

												This game is so bad that it is just a game for me to watch and laugh. First of all, if you crash into anything, you voice off it like a rubber ball. There is no bullet time, and aiming is easy. it's plane graphics and models are redicilus, and fly like a space ship. This game is for if you have a bad computer and want to run something, or if you are  just beginning to look for good flight simulators, in which case this is more of that one shady arcade game in the back of a drug store. If you want a really good flight sim, go for War Thunder or DCS world, but those require beefy computers or gaming laptops, so if you are some kid on a chrome book and think you can run anything cause your Minecraft is decent, good luck.

												People say this game sucks, and it's bad in almost every way. It is...quite bad. But it has it's moments and is fun only with friends. Killing is very easy and the game is very simple. It's a game that was most likely ported from a phone, but it was enjoyable while it lasted. It gets old very quickly. :/10/10 can play like a Russian in Warthunder.			"

												EDIT: This is a day after my initial review. The Steam version is worse than the original version, and their website is formatted so badly, I thought I was at the wrong place. Seriously, that is NOT English (even if you do set it to America/UK) This was fun when I was 8 and had no other games to play and was a F2P scrub.(Original): I remember playing this game back when I was in elementary school on Windows XP. I even invited some of my friends to play with me. I had 2 main characters, both high levels. Then came along more realistic simulators, WoT, World of Warplanes, and the most popular (and my favorite), WarThunder. Comparing this game to War Thunder is like comparing the 1998 Half-Life to Portal 2 or Counter Strike:Global Offensive; it's dated, but it doesn't stop there. When I was younger, I didn't notice all of the horrid mis-translations(or just bad grammar) because I knew no better. The gameplay is either a tad interesting or boring out of your mind. You can play with up to 4 online players (friends, or an open lobby) or by yourself in a mission that has bad AI with the standard guns you get in the game, which suck. Somtimes you can pickup drops from enemies witch go into your inventory, which you can use to upgrade or build equipment or IS equipment, that being said, there is a rarity scale for items. On the topic of Missions, there are 8 chapters, each of them holding about 20 missions each, with (almost)the same exact enemies. You can also participate in online tournements, where a LV1 person will sometimes glich into existence and TAKE OUT YOUR TEAM OF WELL 'EXPERIENCD' LV70s FOR SOME REASON(because there are supposed to be level gaps in the tournement lobbies you can participate in).Not much else to say. It's like WarThunder, it has squads n'stuff and you shoot down other players sometimes.P.S. To get my old account back, I had to install the online launchers game over the Steam version so it would give me the option to login on startup. Good example of a game where I don't want to give it a good or bad rating, but I'll say this: try it, and read the bad aswell as the good reviews and decide for yourself.			"

												What in gods name actually is this......First off do not download this. Please, do not give it any kind of notice.Second let's get off to the story of why i wanted to play this and my sudden realization that... This game... Is a let down.I downloaded this just today after being reminded by a friend about HIS. I seen the reviews on here (because that's the first thing i do to get an idea of the game, free or not.) and it was mixed. Most of the top 30 reviews were saying it was crap. I didn't believe them and boy do i regret it.The game's screenshots will fool you completely, the graphics (just in my short time of gameplay after an ungodly long patch) looked like they were drawn with crayon and put as graphics. The gameplay is horrible as well, leveling up is worse then in WoT or War Thunder (both better games than this) and i have over 100 hours on both and am still in low tier in game.This game also screams, pay to win. Daily prizes are bought with a key (not sure if it's every day you have to buy one or not.) just with that alone you think ""Why?"" Oh it gets much worse. The community is pretty much dead and devs really don't care (All they care about is having more money than Donald Trump.) This game shows how much the Devs hate the English language or something because it is completely broken, i can barely understand anything. You can't exit the game without Alt + F4 (Yes i am not kidding... as of this review i can't exit without Alt + F4)You can probably get the message by now, that you should stick away from this game. Just in the patch alone i felt my life slowing draining from me, even more so trying to PLAY the game. Go play War Thunder, World of Warplanes, World of Warships or World of Tanks, all of these games are a better choice then this.			"

												If you are looking for an easy to play casual ARCADE third person flight shooter then this is for you. It has a steep learning curve for those that have short attention spans, the game has depth if you know what to look for. I highly recommend that you use a joystick if you a flightsim junkie you should have one. The crafting/upgrading is a little hard to get use to but try stuff and you can get some great gear. Unlike WoWP and War Thunder you don't need to buy space with real money to continue playing (I know I have over 100 planes in WoWP) It's lacking in the PvP department but if you like running missions it's great. I played this game years ago when it was under GameCampus and it just was released on steam so you shouldn't think thi is a new, prolly 8 years old or so. Some of the sound effects are bad.But all in all if your tired of the Ramtards in Warthunder and World of Warplanes give this a try.			"

												HIS is a very misunderstood game. When in first came out in the late 00s it was a novelty, there wasn't another game like it. However it was very niche, and still is. What you need to remember is that this game is nothing like World of Warplanes or War Thunder. Those can loosely be called action simulators. HIS is a third person action shooter with a world war two aerial combat theme to it. THere is next to no relism except for the names of the aircraft. It has its flaws. The graphics are retro in a bad way, the sounds are as well. You really have to be interested in dogfights and arena combat games to get the most out of this. Its good point is that it is fun if you go into it with an open mind and no predetermined expectations. The only thing HIS has in common with Warthunder is the same as what Assassin's Creed and Dead Space have in common. They are both games.			"

The menus are confusing too, it took a while to for me to figure out how to get past them. My suggestion is to play Warthunder, it has better graphics, gameplay, and a lot of planes to chose from.

												What an utter piece of garbage.  The game played in Window mode with no possibility going full screen,  There was no Settings menue in order to change graphics, and the full screen button on the Wondow itself was grayed out.  Planes fly by use of Keyboard arrow keys,   No Mouse nor Joy Stick.  The planes will only roll to a 45 degree angle, and when tried to loop, the plane would only go to a straight up angle and refuse to stall.Then the Prolouge of going from a peaceful Mail plane to a fighter plane is utterly ridiculous and hackneyed.'Ell, World of War Planes is a thousand times better and that one leaves alot to be desired.Install the game had a number of errors will the instalation would stop and Had to start from scratch till it finallt installed and ran.

												Summary first:This Mess can hardly be called a game, it makes you wonder how it got through Greenlight.Usually i wait a long time until i write a review, this is an exception. The Graphics are from the late 90s era, the translation barely comprehensible and in German its even worse with Umlaute not displayed, words cut off and not displayed at all. The gameplay is pure arcade, point at it and it dies. I critisize it cause the game is bold enough to say its a simulation! Missions are pure fictional bulls.hit together with any stats your plane might have.Controls are a mess, you can switch them to mouse but then you got no control of your plane anymore.In the middle of your base is a fuc.king cristmas tree - no a MAGIC TREE !!! And on every page are countless links to their store where you have no choice after a while but to spend lots of money in, but wait it gets better: You cant actually buy what you want there, no, you buy boxes that MIGHT contain what you want so you play lottery for your real cash and dont think that one ticket is cheap no way! It is the most bold, twisted and disgusting Pay to Win System ive seen so far.Oh and i was trying to figure out how to quit this crap game for at last 10 mins until i gave up and killed it via Windows Taskmanager. Great work there too Devs!			"

												Alright, so I downloaded this game to see if it really was as bad as the reviews said. Never before have I wanted to uninstall a game just after opening the launcher. I got in game, Arcadey-feeling flightmodels with terrible control mapping. Not even to mention the graphics which look like a old playstation 1 game.If you're looking for a flight game, play war thunder. It's probably better in literally every way than this crap.			"

												Graphics that look like they were drawn on a napkin, hitboxes the size of small houses, controls that work about as good as eating tomato soup with a knife, and the inability to customize certain controls. Giving this game a 1/10 is GENEROUS, and the fact that they have things that you can buy with REAL money, and the game is STILL this bad is mind boggling.			"

I play warthunder religiously, i decided to give this a chance. it didnt even deserve the chance. Pro: another ww1/2 game. Got me excited.Con: has the mechanics of pacman. im not even exadurating.

												OH MY GOD in the first few seconds i knew this was bad.the controls are unintuitive and if you turn too strongly in any direction (up down left right) the camera will have some sort of spasm and fall miles behind the plane.the combat would be unimpressive for a ps2 game and even though i know that this supposed to be arcadey and non realistic but there is a fine line between intresting arcadey hadling and just straight up awful design in the control and combat area. this is because:> there is no bullet drop> i managed to destroy a hot air balloon from 1500m away (??)> the AI is... well... lets just say 'questionable'> you do not want to even see the floor in this game (unrelated but the resolution just amazed me so much i had to comment)to end this, i must say if i was IGN and being payed a lot of money to say this game was good i still wouldn't.Now this is IGN so that is saying something...NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME			"

												So i want to talk about something, when i see everyone say how crap the game is and that WarThunder is better, I WOULD agree, but I'm not. The reason is that this game was made years ago, long before WT (War Thunder) was released. It may have been released on steam in 2015, but if you go to their official site the game was made longer back. Around the time the game was released, the graphics it was at were... semi-good. So you cant really compare this to WT. But i will say yes WT is better graphics and such, but this game was one of my favorite childhood games. I may only have a few minutes played on Steam, but in reality I have around 500-600 hours. So before you have around 20 minutes on the game for playtime just so you can write a review, actually TRY to play the game and not just s*** on it, and do remember this is an old old game, so the graphics are gonna be bad. Also its an arcade kinda game so of course the mechanics of the game are gonna be weird.			"

												This game is just as fun as I remember it being before the steam release. Please don't pass this game by it is very fun to play with friends and is just great overall. That being said you are going to have to settle for how the graphics are now because this game is from 2006 or 2007. Please dont let this game fall through again it can really be fun if it is given the proper player base and if you like arcade controls this is definately a game for you.Pros:1. Most of the playerbase is nice2. Graphics are not as bad as people say3. Arcade controls are easy to master4.Quick progression to later planes (you can stay on biplanes if you want though)5.Good coop gameplay and if you dont like coop you can put a password on your game room6.Earn way more than you spend on repairs (better than some F2P games in this respect)7. Axis and Allied airplanes and three subfactions out of each factionCons:1. May have to watch some youtube videos to fully understand some features2. Graphics (only here because im letting public opinion in)3. Sometimes takes players a long time to ready up4. Sometimes you get kicked from a room for no reason whatsoeverIn my opinion the Pros of this game outweigh the cons by a lot but ill allow you to make your own decisions and choose whitch games you like/ don't like for yourselves. Seriously though this game deserves a better playerbase so it doesn't start to die again. People need to see past the graphics and see the awesomeness of the game thats behind that bunch of pixles. Really every game ever made should be treated without the stupid graphics bias that comes with modern games I mean some games now hit a little too close to reality and that is not what gaming is about.Gameing is getting away from reality if only for a little while because while gaming you become the person you choose to be and I hope that everyone chooses to be themselves and treat others and new or old games without bias and give them all the benefit of the doubt. Thank you if you read this whole post/ reveiw and I hope this helps you decide wether to get the game or not.			"

												If you are looking for a laid back plane game, this is it, it isnt high graphics with realistic anything, just very simple fly and shoot missions, campigns and pvp. When I say arcade, it`s not even a joke, if you are looknig for realism go elsewheres, if you are looking for a simple to play game with a large option of planes to pick and play with just for fun, shotoing down planesi n various missions, then this is for you. In short if you are just looknig for a fun laid back game, this is for you, if you are someone expecting it to be a game competeing with War Thunder then you need not even look causr this is nothing like it aside from world war two planes. The missions are 1-8 players going up agaisnt various air and ground npcs with various objectives. Leveling in this game isnt bad, but being free to play they do tempt you with items you can buy with cash to give you an edge, like any other free to play game does. The plane models arent horrible, once again this game is arcade in almost every sense, controls are other keyboard, mouse, or controller and are very simple. You can swamp out various engines, propellers, armor, and weapons on ANY plane you have and is only limited to the type of the plane and your lvl. Personally i love this aspect cause no plane is the same, except outward apperances which soon may also change. Over all it is just a funny arcade war plane game, notihng like war thunder so if that is what you are expecting then you wont like this at all. Very simple game with various things to do from leveling, getting planes, modifying planes, and doing missions. This is a game for someone who doesnt really have a lot of time for say fifthteen minute long missions and just want to play for fun, yes you can put hours into it, but the leveling is fairly quick and missions typically are quick and easy, not all of them seeing how they all differ. Not high graphics so you dont need a fancy gaming computer to run it. I would reccomend this to any casual gamers looking for a simplistic game that still has vairous things to do and can play for a couple of hours and you feel like you`ve made progress.Also something to mention, this isnt a new game other than it was revived, was originally around in 2010 but GameCampus who orignally had it leased/rented which came to an end and now is owned by these guys.

												Alright, what can I say about this game. First things first, it's a plane game, probably blindingly obvious, but it's what TYPE of plane game I need to adress. I can easily say, it's not a simulater, those tags are lying to you, it may TRY to be realistic but it's just not. The controls are awkward and clunky, and you CAN bind the keys, but for some reason you can only bind a FEW of the keys. Now onto gameplay. It plays actually alright, although most of the mission are extremely easy, even with only 2 players, but the game runs alright. I definetely noticed a LOT of problems, unlike games like War Thunder (I'll be comparing these 2 games a lot) you can't actually do loops, or rolls, or really anything that involves you flipping over. Also most planes/blimps are not physical, weird but true. There is custimization, but as far as I can see, the custimization doesn't really affect the gameplay. Now, the menus. Their clunky and jumbled and the main menu is an assortment of buildings from a top down veiw (kind of like Kerbal Space Program except executed poorly) and there is this weird... club penguin kind of thing were instead of from the top down veiw your in your plane and you just drive around the place and can select the buildings from there, but I don't know why anyone wants to do that. Something else I want to point out is the graphics are like microsoft flight simulater back in 2000! It's not even close to comparible with War Thunder or World of Warplanes.I gave it a 4/10, a bad thing about this is it released itself in the time of War Thunder, and World of Warplanes, it really doesn't have a place here, nothing here can compare itself with any of those games. I recomend instead of coming here and scraping the bottom of the barrel, you go out there and get War Thunder or World of Warplanes. I guarantee you'll have a better experience. I know this literally JUST released but currently at this state, you just can't compare it with anything. A valiant effort certaintly, but definetly nowhere near good enough.			"

Its just a bad war thunder clone. Nothing special about it and really bad AI as enemies which actually never even hit you. I would not recommand it at all... download something else instead like funny cat videos....			"

												For those all of you think this game is like 1990 graphics and some typos, true thats true. But dont forget..  Graphics arent matter. Its what gameplay. Sure gameplay was clonky as hell , but when you got used to it welp you can do all this and also since the Rewarding system is great out of charts, of course some materials is confusing. Theres some 2011 users who had played this game before they know war thunder... does war thunder has BF 109 B or Dora? Incase some weaboos WT user want to say : You never played war thunder before dont compare!""Dont say i never played War thunder before, im level 40 in WT. Don't believe check my steam. ""But i say to developers Fix your typo and some confusement in your description. im giving it 5/10 because of some typos and confusing gameplay.And also devs its time for you to UPGRADE your graphics since graphic loving weaboos think its some sort of incomplete game of yours HIS dev.Anyway i think i liked it because before i knew War Thunder.

												Review by Pinkamena: This is the best game i've ever had the privelage to play... I had put a lot of time into it, when my family was going through some hard times, and my parents were constantly having medical issues... My father has open heart surgery, and my mother had cancer... Shortly after the worst of it hit, the game was canceled... I was devestated, even became suicidal, as i had nothing else to keep my mind off of the situation i was in... However, i recovered, and went on to help other suicidal people get over their problems. When i found out the game was back, i was so happy i was in tears... As for my conclusion to the review... To those haters out there, its not a ""serious"" or ""hyper-realism"" game, its an arcade styled flight combat game, meant for fun, not for all of you morons calling yourselves ""mlg pro"" or whatever. If you don't like it, fine, but don't ruin it for everyone else who actually likes it. And don't make a bad review, it just makes ya look bad.			"

												Okay, let's get these facts straight and true:- HIS/HITS is NOT designed to be a SIMULATION at ALL.- There are controls for mouse, Gamepad, and Keyboard only. I have personally verified all 3- This game is by NO MEANS P2W, I can NOT STAND those PoS games that are (WoT/WoWP) -There is a full screen mode, it is in the settings, so try and actually LOOK AROUND for what you are complaining about!!!Most of the negative reviews are by those who simply hop in for 5-10 minutes, find no outright eye-candy, and come in with undue bias towards anyhting remotely non-SIM.!!! So far, EVERY complaint listed by the top 15 Negative Reviews are non-existant, or outright clouded by wrong expectations.Now for the review:  HITS is a game GREAT for those who are looking for a fun, laid-back MMO based on ~1930s-1950s aircraft, whether Prototypes, Paper Planes, or ""normal"" military aircraft. This game is by no means a looker, but is well optimized for laptop users and those with aging desktops. Hell, I can run it with my backup Integrated GPU on my spare laptop with no lag. (2.5 GhZ OC)The game is somewhat faction based, with you being a PMC allied with either the Axis Nations or the Allied Nations, with you being able to make a character for both factions if you so choose. You get 3 Nations aircraft, regardless of which ""Nation"" You choose, in addition to Gunners [Heavy Fighters] and Bombers, [Dive Bombers, and traditional level-flight types] and these trees are quite fleshed out, and, if they continue bringing in aircraft from the Original HITS, there will be many more.The economy is quite easy to adapt to, and is partly player driven through trading of just about everything (Recommended way of buying things outright) and requires not a single dime of your $$$ to enjoy. All you can buy with real cash is minor details such as nose art, or minor other details for your aircraft which offer anything from 10% increased EXP to 10% Increased Drop Rates for missions. There is no Premium membership [!!!!] and nothing is more than a few $$ to buy.Cons:-Some questionable translations, though if you speak Deutsch it is fine- Minor text issues on item drops, but is easily negated.- Ok Graphics, but not designed to be a showhorse of such.Overall, I would rate at 8.5-9.0 out of 10.

												At first when I saw all the negative reviews, I didn't want to download this game, but then I saw a positive review saying that the game isn't meant to be realistic or like war thunder in any way. So I thought: Well since most of the negative reviews hates on the game's flight models and stuff, and the game isn't supposed to be realistic, and it's actually supposed to be an MMORPG but with planes, I decided to give it a shot. Here are the pros and cons:Pros: - Easy to learn         - Don't have to pay to win or to have fun         - Tons of planes          - Tons of missions         - Missions can be played in co-op, or alone         - PvP and PvE modes         - Can run smoothly on any computer         - No lag          - Easy to level up         - Easy to get new upgrades         - Not a grind fest, making money and getting unlocks and rewards is quick and easy.         - Lots of parts and items to upgrade your plane with         - Storage warehouse for un-used items         - Tons of Quests that gives you bonus rewards         - Extremely detailed tutorial quests to teach you how to play the game         - Fun to playCons: - The game's graphics look like it's from 1996          - The damage model is just a simple health bar, no individual components that can take damage          - Can't do barrel rolls or loops          - No plane engine sounds          - All guns sounds the same          - You can fly through enemies without taking damage          - Only 3 different death animations for planes, 1: The plane's engines starts burning, and a wing breaks off, and the plane spirals to the ground and explodes. 2: The plane's engines starts burning, and the plane spirals to the ground and explodes. 3: The plane doesn't burn or anything, it just spirals to the ground and explodes.          - No throttle control Overall I find it fun to play the game, even though the controls and gameplay is really simple and easy, and the graphics are from the 1990's. It just feels fun to play, and there's a lot of content. Even more content than some AAA games. It has almost as much content as War Thunder. Lots of maps, planes, missions, weapons, upgrades, and so on. If this game had tanks like War Thunder, then I would say they have the same amount of content. It's still a great game though.Long story short: Great game, great fun, tons of content, no grinding for money or levels, you should totally try it out!			"

It toke a bit of time to get use to it.-Gameplay:  I feel like the gameplay works but requires some thing like leading your shots ever so slightly-Glitches:  I didn't come across any execpt for the occasional texture glitch and wirds having random symbols instead of letters.

You 'll get a lot of fun with this game.It is arcade style and more PvE and it is a good thing to make those quests.Of course you will have to go through some hours of gameplay for understanding all the game can already offer.And next updates will make the game even better.When i see all those bad reviews from users with less than 30 minutes of gameplay, I'm telling  me they missed something.It is not in 10 minutes that you fully understand how the game is working.

												Finally... If you loved  1942, 1943: Battle of Midway and 1942:Joint Strike this is it, this is what you have been waitining for and its way better than on your old Commodore 64 and u don't need any quarters (at least not intially). While being able to hit adverseries that are vaguely in your sights seems odd, the Road Runner cartoon physics puts this in its own aerial combat context. While is obvious that the devs meant this to be fun and irreverant, they therefore put the struggle and difficulty in using the awkward control system, I'm sure if I use my old Track Ball the fun can only get increase exponentially. DCS/IL2:BoS=No, RoF/WT= NO,   Wile E. Coyote in a Biplane loaded with ACME missles= YES!!!!!!!			"

												Alright so there are so many people posting negative reviews who have no idea what they are talking about. Look the game is not new! It is a steam release of a game that has been around for a few years. I started playing HIS when is came out a few years ago and it is a great ARCADE game!!! I am a licensed aircraft mechanic by trade and play all games involving aircraft. I love War Thunder because it is an amazing SIMULATION aviation game. I play HIS because it is a fun ARCADE aviation game. HIS has a lot of aircraft that were experimentals like the Vought XF5U (Flying Flapjack). Warthunder does not have many experimentals. Basically, if you come into this ARCADE flying game and expect it to be like a SIMULATION game you are in the wrong place. I personally like the item, upgrade, and skill systems in this game. It is a relaxing way to pass some time with airplanes. Please stop trying to compare it to games that are not meant to be its competition.			"

												Heros in the sky is a plane based shooter which is for me a really enjoyable game, people may have a different opinion to mine but i believe you should atleast give the game a try,  Their are many problems with the game which is really sad because if the developers can actually put some effort and listen to the community before posting the game on steam then this game could of had so much potential,another problem i have with all these other reviews is that barely any of them gave this game a chance and put less then an hour of gametime to determine the rating of the game which is stupid and just plain stupid. you are also comparing this game to war thunder which is just stupid too because war thunder and heros in the sky are 2 completely different games and i have played 10+ hours of war thunder to see the differences.this game may not be for you but just give it a try, dont listen to the other idiots who slap a 1/10 for this game without playing one hour which is really disapointing. please give it a try.

												A video review I also made:


YouTube™ Video: A Look At: HIS (Heroes In The Sky) For Steam 

			Views: 68		

			A review-kind of video that gives you a decent look of Heroes In The Sky, a very underrated arcade flight game with WW2 planes.		

This game does NOT deserve the negativity it gets!To make things clear:-This is not a new release, but more like a revived game since it came on steam.-It's a pure ARCADE game.I am already facepalming at the amount of negative reviews I am reading here on steam, people comparing this game to War Thunder?WT is a simulator, this is an ARCADE game, which is like comparing apples and pears.I have also seen people putting cons for this game as ""unlimited ammo"" or ""no wind effects"", which is even more cringe worthy to read.Only because this is an arcade game doesn't mean it's a bad game.So I have played this in the past before it was on Steam, and boy have I missed it and I'm happy to see it back since it's great fun!The graphics are, since it's an older title pretty outdated, although the models of your own plane look suprisingly decent in my opinion.But the gameplay is where the good stuff is, that is, if you like arcade games.You get to fly in WW2 planes that fly fast and are really manouverable, aka, that fly really arcady, hence again, I keep stating this is an arcade game at it's purest.You get to do little compaign missions of events in WW2, either alone or with a group of friends. After getting ranks in missions you get exp and cash and unlock harder difficulties for each single mission. On each mission you also get a rank like D, C, B, A and Ace, which gives some replay value if you want to get high rankings.Not to mention there are tons of quests per mission that will grant you additional exp and ingame cash.You research different planes in tech trees from different countries. You can make up to 3 characters in the game, and with each character you can either choose Allies and Axis. The Allies consisting of American, Russian and British planes, and the Axis consisting of German, Italian and Japanese planes. Each country having their own tech tree.Then there are also different heavy fighter and bomber tech trees.After you research a plane, you buy it, and will always be able to select your previous planes if you so desire. You will never lose any of them.The upgrades of planes are universal, as in you get Engine1 and Gun2 on your plane, then switch to another plane, that same Engine1 and Gun2 will be equipped on that plane.There is item crafting that you can make with spare parts you get from rewards during missions.There is also PVP, however I haven't played that yet since I prefer to just do coop missions with friends.The best thing about this game is in my opinion the feeling you get when you just mow away a group of planes with your machine guns or rockets. Highly unrealistic, but very satisying, and acceptable since it's an arcade game.All in all a very fun little arcady WW2 plane game with a lot of missions to do either alone or with friends, constantly upgrading weapons, engines, armor and other stuff while trying to get higher level planes. Definately a good time waster if you want to put your brain on 0 and just shoot down hordes of planes, either alone or with friends!I'm very sad to see all the negative comments it gets, or the stupid comparisons to War Thunder. It's not comparable.Play this if you want to mow down enemies with your brain put to 0 and have a laugh with some friends.If you want to have a more realistic experience where strategy is key, then yes, I suggest a game as War Thunder, but i'm not saying that one game is better than the other, because these are not comparable.

												Hey why would anyone compare this game to Warthunder? This is an arcade game! And being around 5 years old it is great. I played it a few years back and I loved it, I'm really happy to see it on steam now. If you wanna see them going down like OMG and in BIG numbers, try this. It is really fun to play with friend and get down a whole crowd of bots down.  It is also gret fun if u got a joystick.			"

												This is the single worst game masquerading as a flight simulator I've ever played.  Broken english fresh out of google translate, impossibly overcopmlex and labyrinthine menus on top of godawful graphics straight out of a mobile game and dull, uninspired gameplay with a pay-to-win game structure... the only thing I unenjoyed was hitting the 'uninstall' button, which fortunately, worked just find.

												Ok first off if you are looking for a FLIGHT SIM THIS IS NOT YOUR GAME! Secondly this is an OLDER game! Now that I got that outta the way HIS is an arcade style flying game that has allot of random stuff to it and yes I have played it before it came to steam... it has a large selection of planes and is free to play and you really dont need to pay money to get good stuff in this game you just have to grind a bit... the graphics are good for a game that I think is more then 5 years old... I can run it on high graphics on my work laptop if that says anything. You can make a (Guild) Fleet, you can squad up with people or friends and play the cheap story line through. When you get into the higher levels the more challenging and fun it gets... its just getting to the higher levels that will take you a minute... I recommand if you are going to play this game start by sticking with one country and one line on the plane tree to conserve points! So you can upgrade your planes as you go along... sell the junk you don't need to gain money... and shoot everything that moves... if your into the PVP thing is kinda fun until you run into someone that spent some real money then you might die... if your looking for a fun game to play on the TV with a controler... you could try that... I think of this game as a ramped up version of an old classic 1942! If you keep that in mind when playing it and not looking for another War Thunder... or a super flight SIM then you will like it... and its not a time hog game either you can play here and there and relax and come back to it later. There are still a few bugs in the game with text and things game play itself seems to be pretty smooth... I couldn't find a voice chat in game and it is kinda of a pain to the exit the game... you have to CLICK CHANGE SERVERS (FYI) then click exit... (hint hint devs put in an exit button) Give it a try its free and fun and can pass the time as a new airplane shooter game on steam. I'll update this if I find anything more relavant.			"

												Heroes in the Sky,Is an old(er), arcade flying game with an MMO community geared towards the asian market. That's something that can be felt throughout the enitire game.Translations might be a bit off, buttons might be placed in at a weird position and the overall feeling is not that of the regular Steam game.Does that mean Heroes in the Sky is a lame game? No, not at all. The thing is that you should know what you get before you even start playing.You get an easy to master flying game that presents the user with mission that beome harder and harder to complete throughout your tour of duty. Most of the later missions should only be completed in a group (Co-Op), because they got split objectives scattered all across the map.The graphics are good enough for a game of this age and everything runs smooth.A big no go for me is the pay to win style that gets across on the later missions. At some point you're not able to fly anymore because you spent all your energy and the only way to refill that energy is through buying some items or by waiting 24 real hours. And that's just bad.But, on the other hand, that's what Heroes in the Sky is all about, like with any MMO; trying to get your money.Until you hit that ""we want your money"" part; you'll be having lots of fun with the many different planes, weapons and missions. So, if you like a nice arcade flying action game with Co-Op/ PvE and PvP; Heroes in the sky might deliver you some good old skool fun. "

												Heroes in the sky seems to be a pretty old game, but the gameplay is still decent. I don't know much about it besides that it obviously seems to have been made quite some time ago. It has similar gameplay to War Thunder, though I feel War Thunder is overall the superior game. I am certain there are at least some people who would prefer HIS to it.  If you think HIS (Heroes In the Sky) Looks interesting I would recommend trying War Thunder as well.  While this game does feel a lot older, it still has ""ok"" gameplay.  I probably wont be playing it much, but I still figure I should put this recommendation out there, as its not bad at least from what I can tell.			"

												Its a wonderful alternative to those who want to play War Thunder, but are put off by how PVP-centric and hardcore it is. Heroes in the Sky is, from my currently playtime (I'm lv 15), a more arcade-y PVE game, where planes use Hitpoints instead of  the complex damage system in WT. The game can be played entirely with the keyboard, and all in all the missions seem pretty fun, even if I do feel like the developers are subtly making the Germans out as evil (I play as the Axis)The graphics are definately kinda bad, but if I had to place a year on them, I would say the game looks like an Xbox 360 game from around 2005-2006, which isnt too horrible, but not great compared to War Thunder. But the real draw of the game, if you ask me, is the wonderful Engrish that the game is FULL of. This game was made by asians, and it becomes apparent instantly when you read the descriptions of the game, and the in-game spelling/dialogue. All in all its funny, and a + from me.			"

												Depsite the lame-excuse-of-a-fighter-pilot AI, slightly (depending on congnitive ability) confusing Gui, the Bizzare controls (try turning on mouse controls= trippy as heck), cheesy textures, and the MEGA COFFEE GRINDER aspect of the game... I actually like it. SURE I can't see the end of what I'm typing when trying to chat with other people. SO the fighter pilots are easier to kill then killing an ant whith a magnifying glass. I simply think about the fact that this game is simply suffering from alpha blues (idk if i used that right). Maybe an update will be put out fixing these problems. I played this game up to the point where I am ready to fall asleep, but I do hope these problems are buffed out. FOR NOW I'll support it.			"

So this is really a great light on the whole ""**** YOU WORLD OF WARPLANES"" idea without the long to load launcher and unreasonable ethics on balance. Despite low graphics (Which I don't care about) this is nice, casual airplane combat game. Except that some of the plane parts are overpriced and the premium shop doesn't make sense.9.5/10			"

======Citizen's Review======From what ive seen This is a Mix Of Warthunder/World Of Warplanes in that its Action/Arcade based and your usual Asian MMORPG except this is centered around planes (Duh) This is one of those mmos that you can Pay to win in,Especially when theres a Overly large paystore with tons of experimental planes and more or less items.Im giving this game a positive review based on my experience with the game.Not what the graphics look like blah blah blah all that whiney Entitled little American stuff.(Yes im looking at you ben)heres the usual rundown.====Pros====Theres tons of planes and lines to progress ,Fighter,Bomber,Gunner(Attacker)etcMultiple nations and their collective subnations to use aircraft in (ex Allies=American and British)Fast arcade based action that dosent Result in a Endless turning war(Play World of Warplanes and you would know)Tons of missions and Quests to do.An open world Runway where you can drive your plane around and Socialize.The Premium Planes Are All Unique in that most of them were either Prototypes or blueprints and/or were never flown.item Creation and a crafting system for aircraft related items like weapons.No bias in this game.Item Storage.Leveling is Decent and not half inpossible. unlike Grind based games where you have to research then buy, whereas in this you just reach a level then buy.Graphics are Ok and anything can run it.====Cons====Controls are wonky and you might need to adjust them in the Options.The Games Original language is Korean so theres going to be Some Translation errors here and there.Most of the player base is koreanMinor Sound issues when shooting down planes.The UI and Menus Are Everywhere.Music is blaring loudOverall if you can get through the minor inconviences its actually a really good game8/10 Not The best but its good for what they did with it "

												Now, before you make an assumption that I am 'just another twit who doesn't know the game', be advised that the time is just my Steam. I played this way before it was on Steam, immediately before school, etc, etc. I'd make an estimate of at least 50 or more hours spent.This game is, to me, a good example of an arcade. It is not meant to be realistic; that would be for the simulators, like War Thunder, World of Warplanes, or DSC World. It is not meant to be realistic; it's meant to enjoy the murdering of your enemy as you spam machineguns and missiles (which are mildly seeking).Those who complain about the graphical aspects...it's graphics suck. I will be blatantly honest, they are flat, and at times, they suck. The people do not look realistic. For all sakes, it is from 2007, and graphics aren't everything. That's like watching pornography for the good storyline. You are enjoying the gameplay...for all sake, people play Minecraft, Terraria, and others, and they do not have the best graphics. To me, that is just a plus...means my PC can actually run it.I think this game is bombarded by twits who do not understand the concept nor the time; it was 2007.11/10, I will continue to play.EDITOK, so I've played it for a while and...this game is not the one I played before. Lemme explain.There are multiple errors in the game. First off, and most apparent, is the grammar. This might not be such a great issue...but as I said, I played it before. The Gamescampus version did not have those issues, and changing what is clearly a done job to a worse job is not good. In addition, in the Axis tech tree, certain Japanese aircraft are named in German. That is NOT what you do, and annoying. Again, minor yet was not present in the previous version.Next off is the 'supply missions'. This involves flying-about and going through floating boxes made of wood. This is random, to me. It's also not fun, because all you are doing is flying. No, that is not good gameplay.Next is the gameplay actions. In certain missions, the GM can choose what they want to do. This usually involves certain class-oriented goals, like 'Attack retreating troops' or 'another target is spotted'. This, this I like. It provides a certain amount of choice in the player's day. However, there is one mission (d*mn me, but I don't remember it) where you can also choose 'supply crates found'. If you choose this, retreating troops appear, and vice versa. This, this I do not like.Next is the AI. Before, it was OK that there was quality of quantity. However, I played, recently, the 'Weapons Testing' mission on Allies where one flies against ME-262s. For those who don't know, these are jet fighters Germany fielded near the end of the war. As such, they suck in a turning-battle, yet are amazing in a run-and-gun scenario. I'm in a prop plane. What do they do? Engage me in a turning-battle where I am guarenteed to win. This is annoying and easily moronic.I also have some complaint on the faction numbers. Simply put, there are more Allies than Axis. This makes it extremely hard to play Axis, and extremely easy to play as Allies. This is something I, personally, don't like.I have come to realize that, while the majority of twits don't understand it, those who do should understand that it was FAR better before, and this is an unacceptable downgrade.

												Do you like pay to wins? Well then this game is for you. This is a pay to win peice of crud.Pros+Arcade stylled combat+decent graphics+Decent options menuCons-Pay to win-When you look up on the Y axis it stops half way through the roll!-Easy combat too easy, way too easy.-Small maps they make it tiny and the airplane too large.Developer notes: this is arcadey make it so I can do a loop. Also remove some pay to win items.Overall rating: 5/10 NOTE: You may notice I only played this for 30 minutes or so. That is becuase their is only about 30 minutes of gameplay and then you get realy bored.			"

												This game is horrible. I highly recommend you pass on this one. The UI and controls are reminiscent of early 90's games, and the graphics aren't much better. No mouse flight control, from what i hear it doesnt support joysticks either. I didn't bother to check because even if you could setup a usable control scheme, the game itself isnt worth the trouble. The UI is as unintuitive and clunky as they get. I don't write game reviews. I have never in years of being on steam reviewed anything. I am dissappointed that I spent the time to download this and would like to save you the same trouble. If you want a good free to play air combat game, go check out War Thunder (they have tanks too)..			"

												Well, I installed the game to see if it was really as bad as the reviews had said it to be. And I was dissapointed.The game, altough pretty lacking and difficult to navigate through, is actually an okay basis for a perhaps, dare I say it, good game. The controlls are difficult at first, and the language selections is for me totally unusable.Also, I'd like to see a bit more historical things, like the corrections of granting you rockets on a biplane. I'd also suggest an actual way of not being able to fly up indevinetely.But, I guess that it does have the potential to become something eventually, it just isn't right now.I am interested to see where the game goes, and perhaps I'll hear from it again someday. Right now, I feel like the game isn't finished and shouldn't have been on Steam. It's in my opinion still a pretty bad game. But who knows?Overall, I'd recommend giving it a try, I got a giggle out of it.A fair trade for the fiveteen minutes of my life that I'm never getting back.			"

												Heroes In The Sky has been around for some years now. There's a lot of things that have changed since when I last played it. Today I returned to it after 4 years and my first thought ""Wow. This game has changed so much."" I can't really say that all of the changes have been good and there's a lot of things that need improving.First of all the language.It appears to me that a Japanease company have taken over the game. This isn't a bad thing however the translations are somewhat sloppy and the text boxes need a big overhaul. The text is scattered all across the interface. In missions the text can be a bit urghh.. It needs sorting out.. And there's a lot to do.InterfaceThings are scattered around everywhere and it's a little overwhelming, especially to new players. It takes a lot of getting used to as well, even for returning players. It may be a wise idea help give the inerface a cleaner look and appeal - everwhereGraphicsThe graphical quality remains the same as it did years ago. This doesn't matter too much but they could do with being updated - higher resolution and quality of images rather than just settling with a lazy 2D look to various npcs that are found in the game. The game could do with 'Borderless Fullscreen' and a 'automatic resolution' detection option for optimal resolution settings.SoundMy only problem with the sound is that there's this HORRIBLE buzzing noise when airplanes get very close. Please remove it. It's not a 'problem' as such but it's uncomfortable to listen to.TradingOh my word... This is more of a community thing but if you're really into trading then you may find yourself facepalming repeatidly when trading with other players... Expect lots of skyhigh prices for easy to get items... By 'skyhigh' I mean 450,000,000 ghems for simple items... To point out.. you get maybe 5,000 ghems per mission if you're lucky... So yeah... If you want money quickly then pick a specialisation/skill and hone it. Make rare items and sell them. Doing so then allows you to buy expensive items.. In a nutshell people don't know how to trade.Premium ItemsI think this is what is going to get the attention of a lot of people so i'll try to add extra detail where possible.To summerise: The game is not pay to win from what I can tell so far. You can use premium currency to aid you in levelling up but there's still quite a bit of work you have to do. You can buy boosters and so forth. Premium planes which can be purchased with premium currency can help you a lot. There's no need in spending loads of money on the game though.$10 or around £6.75 can give you a premium membership which should be more than enough to stablize you and to give you a decent shot at getting your hands on a premium plane. If the premium membership is exactly as stated then It would be something that I suggest everyone gets, however I am unsure how long the premium lasts for, this is something that needs clarification. Premium currency will get you places though however you can get to the same places without it. It is definately not a 'need'.Summary:The game has been around for years, it's about time it was added to steam. I personally had to start from scratch but that's no matter. The game itself hasn't changed too much and there are several issues that need addressing. The game should run very smoothly on a lot of machines are it is not too graphically demanding. However lower fps may be expected on the more advanced mission due to the high npc count in missions.Membership is entirely your choice, I do have a feeling that it is perminant as well. The game itself isn't too bad, however there are plenty of areas for improvement. It's fun to play casually but there's not a whole lot for hardcore players, and those players in particular may be disappointed.Overall I recommend this game because it's fun to play and is a little different compared to other games around. It's enjoyable and with a bit of work from the developers and a bit of community growth then the game will become very fun. For now the game and the community is sleeping like a lot of old games.
