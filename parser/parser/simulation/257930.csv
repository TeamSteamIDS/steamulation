								A perfect example of why early access has a bad reputation. There have been no updates as of the time of this review for 3 months.The game in its present state is unplayable.If you are a fan of this genre, don't buy now, check the game in 6 months time to see if it has developed at all.

								If these guys are still going I think it might be time to white board this project. From one Dev to another1. Run through the bugs and make a list (may need several boards). Forget cosmetic graphics at this time the core programming need the most attention graphics is secondary to all else just look at minecraft and remember they did a lot with 8 and 16 bit graphics, no one builds a AAA game over night2. Don’t be afraid to ask for help the community may have the help you need,  some have already paid to support it. But paid or not the community may be willing to lend a hand to make this project succeed just look at Apache or firefox.Don’t be a rob the builder (can we fix it … no its Fracked) and move on.3. Project Management. Invest in a bug tracker most are open source (free) milestones help a lot and it shows the progress of development to the community and improves communication between dev and supporter. Forums Help but there not the be-all and end-all (Optional) lower the price your rep is bad enough and the slow progress ain’t helping the causeSo at this time i would not recommend buying it but this might change in future (if an update is released before christmas)A few thoughts (mainly to the devs but its general):The motto I develop by is“By small and simple things are great things brought to pass” (got that from a religious door knocker but it works)The big picture looks good but building it, it’s like climbing Everest with your teeth you just freak out and start rocking in a corner saying this is not happening 50 times.Just take small steps and by the time you realise it your half way thereSo frequent small update are better then very long large update as it shows you still care about your project "

[10/24/15] UPDATE: The original developers of Race To Mars (Intermarum) basically abandoned it, explaining that they simply couldn't handle the work and have been silent ever since. Another company acquired Race To Mars (One More Level) and promised that they'd finish production, update it on a weekly basis, and communicate to players about the state of the game.Those were lies. They haven't updated the game weekly, nor did they do it for even one month. It has now beens months since the last update, and the developer has gone silent. DO NOT BUY THIS VAPORWARE.ORIGINAL REVIEW:First off, let me be clear: there is virtually nothing to this game. Beyond the basic buildings that have always been available, the vast majority of mechanics listed in the games description don't exist, with even its most vocal supporters only logging less than 10 hours due to no content. The developers hadn't produced a single update for nearly a year, hinting at some elusive ""massive update"" that they always claimed was just around the corner. That update has FINALLY come out, and it couldn't be any more clear that this is a scam. What's the big change?... a simple UI overhaul. The campaign is non-existant/unplayable since literally only 3 buildings (of the over dozen that have always claimed to be ""around the corner"") are in the game. Well, scratch that--2 of the 3 buildings say ""Under Development"" when you click on them. The 3D world you play within always looked unrefined and sloppy with underaverage visuals, but their one annual update seems to have managed to make it look even more unprofessional. Add on top of all of this that the game STILL contains choppy english, and well...I wanted to really like this game, and I tried to trust the developers at their word, but this ""game"" is nothing more than an empty slot on Steam, attempting to take money from people by tricking them into thinking they're buying a game in progress. It's not. DO. NOT. BUY.			"

								18 months ago I bought it trusting on developers.  But now I is clear that is a waste of time being waiting for updates.  If you check the update list in this game you will see nothing just news lke: ""we are fixing this, we fixed that' and nothing happens?From one dev to other:  Nothing works, nothing is completed, no evolution in more than 18 months, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.Steam should ban companies and developers as you that only take money and do not deliver nothing.  Stop to STEAL money from others.  STEAMERS DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AND CHECK THE REVIEWS AND UPDATE HISTORY BEFORE BUY ANYGAME IN STEAM.			"

								This game seems to have been completely abandoned by its developers, even though they maintain that another patch is coming. It hasn't been updated since April 2014. Time and time again we've been promised a patch at a certain date, only to get an apologetic sob story.Avoid this game. It is unplayable in its current state, and contrary to recent communication from the developer, no update seems to be forthcoming.Edit, June 2015. A patch was released in the month of March. It added a few non-essential things and broke parts of the game. The game is still unplayable. It is not even remotely finished. Avoid this game.Edit, May 2016. This game has received several updates as of late. The latest one actually managed to fix Mac support - it hasn't been working on Mac OS X for several months, so I've had the opportunity to check the state of the game for the first time this year. It is still far from a beta. It is hardly even an alpha. At the current pace I would surmise that the game might be in beta state somewhere in the middle of 2017. Avoid until someone actually posts a positive review.			"

								Meh.  It's not much about space exploration... it's about saying the right things about the environment, and waiting for your engineers to work on things...  The reason that the screen moves... is that because... literally... nothing else does.Someone wondered if this was at all like Kerbal Space Program (which is amazinglly excellent!)... and no.  Not even close.English is clearly not the first language of the developers...  FYI (it detracts from the game).This *could* become interesting... if the developers work a miracle or two.I do wish them all the best, and consider my purchase a donation to the cause of a (hopefully) decent space exploration game.

Early Access Review
								Sadly this game really is early access - so early acces, that it's not in a usable state yet.This starts at the tutorial: The tutorial ends after explaining the interface - and then leaves you alone to find out what you are supposed to do. Out of all buildings available in the game only two or three are actually usable yet, all others only have a ""graphical userinterface not yet implemented""-screen.The graphics are okay, just be aware that you'll never get to see something that isn't shown on the screenshots already: When you click the ""End Turn"" button in the upper right corner a night-day-cycle animation is played, and you'll see this animation quite often.About the game itself: I have no idea. It sounds promising, but the lack of tutorial definitely keeps you from actually playing (unless you like to figure out which technologies in a tech-tree you need to explore to get an actual result).Absolutely nothing in the menus has a comment on what it influences, some menus aren't even translated yet, and the few things that already work don't really do anything - e.g. Prestige-points: You can hold press-conferences, which increase or decrease your prestige in four different fields, depending on your answers to the reporters questions.But that's it - four numbers go up or down, and you have absolutely no idea what the point is. I guess it has something to do with your contracts and how much you earn from them, but for like everything else I'm left guessing.At the end of the day it's simply far too early for this game to exist on steam: Most other Early Access-Games are playable with not all content yet implemented, and a lot of bugs - this game doesn't seem to have lots of bugs, simply because nothing exists that could be bugged yet.Conclusion: I'm looking forward to the game, since the idea really looks promising, but I can't recommend buying this game YET. My recommendation: check again in two or three months, because at the moment you'll be heavily disappointed by spending 18,99€ (or the equivalent amount in your countries currency) on this game.I'll keep an eye on the game and check out if the updates improve it and will update my review.

								I bought this game about a year and a half ago, because I liked the concept behind the game.By now I gave up hoping that this game will be playable in the foreseable future.I hoped that the company One More Level, would keep their idea of small weekly updates and a better communication.Right now this game starts and you can see the launch complex of your agancy and thats it. So there is nothing to do except enjoying the view and the music which you cannot turn up or down within the game.I payed $20 for this game during launch, so i think it is my right to demand better communication, even if they tell me that they canceled the game once and for all.I reccomend not buying this game as it is right now. Maybe when One More Level is stepping up their game			"

								Everyone go back to KSP.  Nothing to see here.  Unless you like to be teased by content just to have it not delivered for months.  I know, I know, this is a game in Alpha, Early Access, blah blah blah, but sadly for all the features this game does have it simply lacks any real gameplay.  You will spend hours researching and working the banking system to give you more money to play with to do.....nothing.  That's right nothing!  No launches are possible, no planes fly, not even as much as a popup saying 'Hey you launched a satilite, good for you'.  I usually don't spend time writing reviews, too many games to play and so little time, however I will not say do not get the game only to be warned that this game has had some rocky beginnings and at this time is falling short of community expectations.  I have had this game since its release on EA in March 2014 and at this time have only been able to justify 6.2 hours of game time.  This is sad because I have several titles that are in fact EA games as well with no less than 100hrs after a year.  So please, if you like the idea that this game brings, please wait give it another year and let's see how it turns out.			"

								Best AVOID.We were promised a Patch for this game on October the 9th (few days away), this was made on the Facebook page. Now approaching 1 month after this promise the developers are not even updating the Facebook page. Nothing has been done with the game since 28th AprilGame seems to have been abandoned, and i will be approaching Steam to see if they can help with this, i gave the developers until the 14/11 to make their promises good, i will be asking for a refund and removal from Steam on this day.Edit: 15/11: I Contacted Steam in regards to getting my money back, and having the game removed from Steam. Will update further when more communications received.Edit: 18/11: Received full refund from Steam, i hope they have spotted the issue with this game and the Developer, and now proactively remove them from Steam.Edit: 30/11: The developers have made a return, promising the patch which was promised back in August. Though back in August the patch was only a matter of days away. Now it is still 2 weeks or so away. The developers excuse is that 1 of their developers has been ill, which tbh these guys have more than 1 person working at it.Also Developers are hoping for Gold release of the game Early 2015, yet the game has no actual content, or even textures.....This set of Developers are taking everyone for a ride, DO NOT SUPPORT THEM!

								I really want this game to succeed. I love the idea, the current level of play is very bare, but I can see where they want to go with it and am very much looking forward to seeing it.And that's what this is right now. Potential. They have had issues with personnel, and their update timings are atrocious (once every month or two at best). They haven't had a patch in a long while, but they have teased a major update that they haven't been able to bring to fruition yet. I haven't lost hope in Intermarum or this game yet, but I can't recommend the game as is. If this game is something you think sounds like a good one, put it on your follow or wish list and keep an eye on it, but don't buy it as of yet. Wait until the next update at least. It's a month or two overdue now. Which leads me into my next point...They seriously need to up their PR game. Weekly updates would be awesome. Even short ones, just a few sentences saying they added new graphics to 2 buildings and tested 3 new contracts. Whatever. Anything to let us know that work is still being done. Something that will keep us even mildly interested. And make the game look less like just another Early Access that went down the drain of development hell.In the end, like I said, it has potential. It's current state is playable (at least, i've been able to launch satellites, but that's it), but is so very barebones right now. I hope to someday change this to a yes and go get it recommendation, but at this rate, it's going to be a while.UPDATE: They've finally released their long awaited ""Apollo Update"". The game looks quite a bit better. There's quite a bit more to do. It's seems to not be abandoned just yet. There's a lot that still needs work. Many of the buildings don't have a GUI or any use really yet outside of required for research. It looks like you can build the buildings, research the technologies and build sapcey things. One significant point to note, the amount of spacey things you can build is ridiculous. This was obviously the meat of the update (along with the graphics and GUI). The number of satellites, rockets, pieces of equipment are extensive. You can go all the way to building a fully sustainable Mars Base on the planet of Mars, it looks like. The one thing I wish they had put into this release was the contracts idea with the NSaAO, but that's not in there yet.I won't change this to recommended quite yet, but the game is playable, with all the research and pieces you need to build a Mars Base it looks like. If this game is something you want or are looking forward to, I would consider getting your hopes up. I'll probably change this to a yes once they get the contract system up and running so that you can have an effective, money-making space enterprise. I'm feeling much more positive about this game now.			"

								I cannot, in good faith reccomend this game in its current state.  I am not thrilled that the developers allowed such an unfinished product to be released for sale.  Most of the building meshes are incomplete, most of the buildings have no functionality,  the tutorial is broken and it is quite obvious that the developer's first language is not english. Normally, this would be a minor issue, but a good portion of the game revolves around simulated text based interviews with journalists.  Your answers affect the prestige score of your company, which as of this build as far as I can tell does nothing.  However,  the mistakes are enough to detract from the game at this point. Some of the very few functional screens remain completely untranslated, which further exacerbates the issue.  Once complete, I believe this game will be fun and well worth its price of $20 if the developer delivers.			"

								As has been mentioned in another review, Race To Mars (RTM) is very similar to Buzz Aldrin's Race In Space (BARIS), in that you play as the director of a space company. In BARIS, the focus was very much the Space Race of the Cold War and beating the USA/USSR to various landmarks; RTM however is set in the 21st Century and has you competing against private companies who are also looking to reach to Mars. I have only played the game a little bit, but it seems to be fairly intuitive as many of the menus do what you would expect them to, with only one or two screens which confused me. Some actions such as launching the first satellite would be improved with tooltips or something else to make the process a little clearer. It is an Early Access game, so there are features needed to be added, and some of the screens either haven't been translated into English yet, or the language needs a little tweaking to make the meaning clearer. That being said, with the ability to launch a wider variety of missions to be added at a later date, I can see this being a game I could sink many hours into further into development.			"

								REVIEW UPDATE 12/27/15It appears the game has a new dev team working on it, but it still lacks so much. Feels about 5% complete, continue to stay away from this title for many years.I purchased this game a few months ago in it's 'early-alpha' (or pre-alpha) version which at that point in time wasn't even playable. I gave it a few months and activated my steam key to try it again, while they have made some progress in the game theres very little content there for you to actually enjoy.To start, out of the 9 buildings that I constructed only 3 of them were available for use. The others haven't been implemented I guess, but it really takes out the fun and curiosity of space when you are so limited with the tools presented. A few of the screens were still in (polish?) anyways they definitely weren't in english so I wasn't able to progress into those screens any further (i recall university to still be in polish). When you build the R&D center you can begin researching various items throughout a somewhat of an expansive tech tree which is cool, until you click research and it tells you that it will be done in 110 months. Once you've started researching there is not progress bar or anyother tool for you to tell when that technology will be completed.I'd give this game another year before its remotely enjoyable. Until then stay away.			"

								Do not give money to this company. They are doing nothing with it. No patches/updates since April 2014.

This one gets reused a lot in different ways of saying it.""I know many of you are angry at us and you have a full right to be.""And my personal favorite as this was the actual title to the update: ""We're still here and we know you have every right to hate us now.""Would you want a game from a company who straight out has to tell you that they are ACTUALLY still working on a game and tell you to hate them for their lack of updates in game or out of game?I wish I had never bought this game, but it was released around same time I really started getting into Kerbal Space Program (a game i HIGHLY recommend) and I'm a big space nerd and had just finished watching a show on Curiousity. So when I saw this pop up on steam I snapped it up. Worse. Decision. Ever.			"

								Steam should evaluate games before allowing their customers to purchase.  There is nothing to do in this game.  I doubt the game will ever finish and the lack of communication indicates their lack of resources.With an overwhelming negative review, it seems unlikely they care. Steam provided the mechanism and opportunity for this company to get ""paid"" for their incomplete and utterly hopeless project. Not only is this game useless, it is a poor reflection on steam.			"

								After playing Kerbal Space Program and Take On Mars, I had high hopes for the development of this game.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product (you see, I can't even call it a game).  It fails on every level.  Save your money, and do not buy into this failed product.  It should be completely removed from the Steam store, and the developers should be ashamed.			"

								I wanted to share this with any folks that were interested in this cash grab named ""Race to Mars"".  When i bought this game i had a jones for some sort of game just like this one was advertized.  It sounded great, then i bought it and found out the truth.  Anyway, that itch for a space program type of simulation still needed scratching so i looked and found what has been my new favorite game for a while, Kerbal Space Program.  Forget about this placeholder for an actual game and give KSP a try, its what the devs promised this to be a few years ago x10.  The mods that are out there add unbelievable depth to an already awesome base game.  I havent been this addicted to a game in a long time.			"

								Just 5 words: Hands off this unplayable ""game"".Based on the artwork/trailers I was expecting an interesting idea of a game. Then - after purchase - I was firstly disappointed of the actual status of development which had nothing to do with the nice trailers. There is an incomplete techtree, lots of ""lorem ipsum"" text-placeholders, no way of generating funds whereas the first buildings as well as research are quite expensive. The only functionality is placing some buildings and watching the sun go up and down until bankruptcy.I know this is an Early Access game and I was really tolerant with all the issues described above because the game idea conviced myself and I trusted the developers to increase functionality over time. BUT in fact there were no improvements at all for over 6 months now. No updates, no communication, nothing! Perhaps my expectations are too high but at least I'm expecting a continous development once a game enters Early Access state at Steam.Don't waste your money for this!And finally some words regarding Steam:Steam-Support only reacts with standardized ticket-answers after my refund-request with reference to the ""long playtime"" of now 3 hours (which is only slightly more than what is refunded under ""normal"" conditions).What I do expect is a mechanism from Steam to kick out inactive projects or developers from the Early Access area. There are great projects in Early Access phase but Steam is a publisher of more or less completed games and not a crowdfunding platform where money is collected for ideas!			"

								I have last version of the game and I don't have mission control like they show in video, so game is unplayable. You can't lanch anything, and do anything useful.There is to much clicking involved, to exit one building you will need 2 to 3 clicks on small x. Also game have a some big bugs, so don't even try to open university.Game have potential, but it is to expensive for early stage and still unfinished in way that it is unplayable. I think that early access games should be cheper in begining and get more expensive as game progress to the 1.0 version. That way early access buyers get some benefits for suporting game development.For now I don't recomend this game, if next update make some significent changes maybe I will.			"

								Race to Mars is most definitly still an early access game, however as ive been watching the news feed daily the new update seems to have released a whole bunch of new aspects including being able to actually play it further than making a few researchs. Many bugs were also fixed and i applaude the developers for putting forward effort and actually caring about the game's ""investors"" seeing as early access games are more like investing than actually playing. I recommend this game but i would say hold out a couple more months until more updates are added, however if you feel the price will raise in the future lingers then i would suggest buying now.			"

A ton of work is done on the design, with tech trees, buildings, visual effects, menus and so on. But this game is not playable. To my knowledge it was never playable.This in in contrast with successful early access games - Kerbal Space Program was playable from the start. It had very little parts, or content - but it was fun. This one is not. Looks like the team does not know how to make a game, or develop a project at all. A pity. I would love to play something like this.			"

								Problems....No tutorial so you have no idea how to get started.The ""Info"" buttons on buildings in the build menu don't workIf you build all the buildings you need you'll go Bankrupt and the game will crashIf you build the buildings as needed you'll go bankrupt and the game will crashIf you only build the assembly building and try making your own parts to build Vehicles you'll go bankrupt and the game will crash.You can't bid on any contracts because there is no way to put in an offer and get anything other that a 0% chance of winning it.You lose money faster than you can make it, its 2.5 milliion every month for building maintenance and you can sell built parts for maybe 200k every few months. Which leads to you taking a loan from a loan shark and going bankrupt and you guessed it the game will crash.I love the thought of a geme that lets you build satellites and conduct manned space missions and colonize other worlds. But this game is not that and it took $20 and a couple hours of my time to figure that out. From what I can tell they have pretty much given up on this game. Hopefully a half way decent company comes by and picks this up soon.			"

								It's really early access. In that statue of development it's not wearth a single cent. Half of the game isn't translated and still in polish, the Game itself is no more then making stupid PR-Events and research (You'll click ""NEXT"" the whole time). There is no option to turn down the volume (and it IS loud). With the preview pictures you'll expect a really good grafic, but beneth the ""Area"" you can see on the screenshots you'll never be able to see something else.95% of that written featurelist is marked as ""Not yet finished"" in the game and you aren't be able todo anything beneth clicking ""research"" with a complete bogus interface and click ""next round"". And in some cases - cause there is no autosafe-function - the game simply looses it's interface and all progress is lost.Really, if you're looking for some space game in a similar kind, get Kerbal, but DON'T BUY THIS PAECE OF CRAP!

Early Access Review
								Okay, I understand that this game is still in alpha, and it looks to have a ton of future potential. However, at the current state of the game, it seems more to me like something I would call ""Pre-Alpha,"" meaning that it is in such early stages of development that it should not be released to the public yet as an early access or Alpha access game. I say this because most of what the game promises to offer is not even implemented yet. There is not much to do besides hire engineers, buy and build buildings that are pointless and take anywhere from 2-12 months to build, have your engineers research things that take anywhere from 20-500 or more months to research and are also pointless. Also, it takes only 2 months to build an entire facility, yet 4 or more years to research the properties of anything, like alloy or fabric? I could do that in two weeks, on my own! Not with 30 other engineers helping me research!Another note: The grammar. The grammar is horrible. However, for the most part they use commas correctly (most people in the world don't), but there are huge spelling mistakes and other, much larger grammar mistakes, as well as careless typos like missing letters or words or extra letters or words. And one of the only two working buildings is not even in English.Overall: The game is crap right now and should not have yet been released to the public. But the game does have very great potential for the future, though not really as a space game. It's mosly more of a political and waiting game.It seems that at this point in production, and the rate at which they are updating (not at all yet), this game will be done in a few years, if not decades if not centuries.

								The creators of this game should read the Lean Startup. They've gotten quite a ways since it first came out, but they're not working near fast enough to have such an early launch of an early access game - this gives the early access opportunity a bad name. I will come back to this game every now and then, and if they alter enough, fast enough, then I'll be happy to give a good review. For now the speed of innovation should be picked up, don't try to make everything perfect, add features and request user feedback, that's how you get a good game, fast.			"

								Unfortunately, the game is not far enough along to recommend it yet.  It says release date is Mar 7, and it's the 13th.  Most of the interfaces I came across said ""Not ready yet"" or something like that, and the tutorial stalled after the first few paragraphs.  I don't have any issues with the models being underdone yet, don't care about the graphics (though they look promising and nice for the most part), but if I can't figure out a nice linear strategy within the first hour, it's too much work for me.  I think my biggest problem is all of the missing UI interfaces though.  The native language is not English, but that didn't bother me so much (it's close enough).It says Upcoming Features: New GUI.  But that's misleading, seems a lot of the UI is missing.			"

								Right now there is not much to do and everything that there is to do takes too much time.  Simple things like research can be reduced with more workers but more workers means more money lost to pay.  Even with more workers research takes a long time making you sit there spamming the next turn button.			"

								Although I have a very small amount of time spent playing Race to Mars, it becomes increasingly obvious that the game, in its current version offers very little. The prices required to actually get any work done are extravagant, the research time takes too long, all the while, you're hemorrhaging money. Most of the buildings don't actually work. And they also don't even have textures implemented yet. This game, I will admit, has amazing potential. I believe it could be something great. But not in its current state			"

								Yay just bought this game and I cant even get pass the start button -.-UPDATE 3/1/2015: So went to look at it again for the first time in ages and was shocked to see an update! With this update I can now actually start a game, however with that said there is still not much to do. You can build things and do press confrences. But, most of the buildings can not be used yet, sadly, and when you talk to the press be carful because once you select what you want to say you can't change it.I hope this is the start of a full game but for now I would say wait do not buy. At this rate I would say check in in a year or two?			"

Aside from researching and building imaginary rockets. 90% of the buildings in the game aren't even usable yet, so you can't organize missions or launch rockets. You can hire people but that's about it because NOTHING is operational. Don't get this. Whatevver you do, don't.			"

								I would not recommend this game at the moment, it's a great concept, and I hope to be able to change my recommendation in the future, but this needs way more development. While Early Access can be great for game devs, this should have been developed a bit more before being released in Early Access. There is no functionality at all at the moment (there was some when I originally bought it a year ago), and the graphics have deteriorated badly in the last few weeks.			"

								I can't recommend this game for now since it's as nearly a prototype, not even an alpha. Be aware that this game was formerly developed by Intermarum studio and that a company called One More Level took over the project. Game developers seem to have no rights of publishing updates or make official announcments of their own, which make me think it's subdisized by a third party company, whose name is unknown. On a final note : way overpriced early access with really few guaranteed that the game go on release with promised features one day.			"

								The game as a great potential but is in a very early development stage. So at the moment, all you can do is build and launch a communication satelite (once researchs are completed you can build it for free, it won't work like this in the final game), but then as Mission control is not implemented yet, you can't do anything with the said sattelite.  I think the game will be great once finished, but if you plan to buy it now, be aware that's there is at the moment around 2 hours of gameplay only, missing many features. Most building are not finished yet and are missing textures, features they will unlock are not available, research tree is not finished and there is not yet restriction on what you can research or not. So it's a long term investment (on the game website, they say the game could be release Q2 2014, but i bet it will be more like at Q1 2015 or later) The more people will buy it now, the higher the chances that we get a really cool finished product, so if you can wait a few months for more features and improved gameplay but have the money, buy it now, it will help it's development.

								Firstl i would like to say that it is an innovative game with the potential to go along way. I like the idea of being able potray a company in the media as well as researching and developing your own goals to acheieve whatever you want in the game. That being said there is defiantely need for further develpoment of the game. 1.The graphics which at the moment are obviously not the finished product.2. The grammar used in notifications, and interviews, needs to be reviewed, some mistakes are basic and others are merely spelling mistakes.3. It may be prudent to feature notifications when researches have been completed other than an email.4. The GUIs need to be developed for all buildings.5. Each of the available researeched items, such as radar, visible, UV, IR telescopes should have a full description available, as it stands the information shown when the mouse is hovered over the items goes off the screen and cannot be fully read.6. It should be clearer how you can make a profit in a business like that, all that seems to happen is your costs go up via research, buildings, or workers. There is no way of showing which research, or contracts will effect the profitability of your company.7. There should be a database made for saving games, it seems there is only one game you can currenty have at a time, so for instance if you wish to play the long game and research slowly while trying to make a profit you can do so as well as having a flip side game whereby you can just go for broke build all the buildings get your colony on mars and hope that you make you profit in the mean time.8. The text size needs to be bigger in the R&D department menu trying to read which research is very difficult. 9. The abilikty to build a satellite needs to be developed and maybe when doing so a brand can be a[[lied to your company that would appear on all of your products, maybe it could be implemented at the start of the game when choosing the name of your company.10. I also think that you should start with a preassembled work force maybe 10 strong with varying degrees of skill, then from there you could choose to develop them with the university or fire and hire or so on. I know i am no game developer and i understand the game is still in its alpha stage, however, you guys have come across a game that i feel has the potential to be an amazing game and everything that i have mentioned is obviously in my own opinion i look forward and am exctied about the devlopment of this game in the future good luck guys. i am neither recommending or not recommending at this stage as it would be unfair on the developer but watch this space.

								Very interesting game. Race to Mars reminds of the old Interplay game, Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space. While that title dealt with real American and Soviet technology, this one looks towards the future of space exploration.In short, both are essentially space program management sims. Not for everyone, so you might want to wait for more features to be added before deciding to buy this game.Note about Early Access Games: read the developer's goals with the game first.

								Probably one of them Best Simulator out there but as you can see (read from forums that is) this game is too early to be released, Lacks almost all the basic steps to play the game and be able to enjoy it.Also it would be good that if you select a country you choose to be part of it would still set the game into English and not Country Language, otherwise you need a subtitle stating the country pick is based on language.No Music, Buildings are limited to the ones that are already complete. Tutorial Incomplete, Lacking Information on almost everything, etc etcI would like to see this game completed one day and hope it would be a success.Good Luck INTERMARUM			"

								EDIT: After several months of waiting an update has finally come out. I'm still on the fence about this game, alot of work was done during the wait, but the game is still not complete. Which is to be expected. They claim that they can see the light at the end of the tunnel and a full release on the horizon. While I now have renewed hope in this game, I am still not holding my breath. Who knows when that full release will get here or what it will hold. Buy this game at your own risk, but definately keep it on your radar. It could turn out to be something great.			"

								This game is far from done. So far it doesn't look like it's going to be anything really great either; it's not that it promises to be a bad game at all, I just don't find the game mechanics to be all that interesting.Despite not finding this game all that great I've decided to recommend it anyway; for one simple reason. The developers are open about the problems they've had and that's worth a lot more to me than a great game, which are really rare anyway.			"

								Race to Mars has the potential to be a grate game , But when you try to launch a second rocket the game always locks-up. Which is very annoying . Look foward to the game working correctly.			"

								Will enjoy the game when it is finished, but in its current state I can not give much praise to it.  Give money to the devs so they can finish the bloody thing.			"

								This game has tremendous potential, but the development is a bit slow.  This can be a good and a bad thing.  Definitely have to have patience with the developers who aren't the best with their time tables.  I mostly recommend this game.			"

								Was that money down the drain or what? And the god awful noise that forms the ""soundtrack"" - even with ""Sound Off"" set in the options. Or the picture that does not stand still for one second but keeps moving around all the time for no apparent reason - there's the one screen - why does it move? And everything needs 4-5-6 clicks with the mouse to actually do anything.Horrible - so far from reasonable to charge anything for it.			"

								DO NOT GET THIS GAME! The updates they now post are insignificant.According to the Polish authorities, they are meeting their legal requirements at the bare minimum. One update a month keeps them from being sued.Some of us waited for over a year being patient... then another year...  and what we got in return, and nice nutsack punch!Wish that did it for us....!DO NOT SUPPORT FRAUD! DO NOT SUPPORT THEFT! DO NOT SUPPORT THOSE WHO RUIN THE INDUSTRY WITH THIS BEHAVIOR! Intermarium and the group who has taken over, shame on you... 3 years and still nothing but fake updates that change nothing.			"

								This game was an amazing idea but the devs just took peoples money and ran. The only updates theyve done in the past 6 months hve been textures. Knowing what i know I wouldnt buy this game for half a dollar.			"
