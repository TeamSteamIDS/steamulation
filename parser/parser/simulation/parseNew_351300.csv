												From what I could experience in the first 10 hours of game play its clear this title has a lot of potential.  The graphics are good without being too demanding so heavy fighting hardly slows down at all, making for some seriously nasty battles.  It feels balanced and the ship modification adds a real personal feel to what I do and how I play the game.  The only time I failed at a mission so far was due to the tricky nature of disabling a ship without destroying it, as you need lasers or boarding drones which turned into a bit of a game of hide in the bigger ship's blind spots.  The learning curve can be a little hard but if you played and loved games like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident, Freelancer & Independence War,  then this game is right up those lines.For the new players, heres a few quick things I learned that were the most useful starting out: Create a group for your ships with ctrl+F1-F4 to make fleet orders easy, else you will have a lot of trouble with collisions and having to give orders multiple times. Double right-click is your friend, it tells your ship(s) to fly in a given direction relative to themselves until told otherwise. Nav points / points of intrest are the best way to travel.  Full of loot?  Just set a point of intrest where you are, then just order your ships to jump to the nearest station.  Its faster than normal speed and your ships WONT CRASH enrout! Turrets are picky, make sure you dont buy a FIXED weapon (instead of a turret) or the wrong size for the mounts on your ship.  Its a costly mistake to make. Repairs are a big deal, so think about having a ship just for utility drones if you dont have any.  They can fix as well as mine for the minerals used to repair your fleet, plus you need them to grab more booty!As with any game, there are bugs and issues to be sure but so far none have been game breaking or even all that troubling.  A few graphics oddities with the tactical view for instance, or autosaves in the system view getting bugged.  Nothing that impacted my enjoyment even a little, so way to go testers and devs!  Compared to some reacent big name games, thats actually saying something, keep up the great work.			"

												The good: - System Designs are well thought out, robust, and add depth to the game.- Concept is great: Squad/Small Fleet in space (been waiting for something like this for awhile).The bad:- The art style falls into that awkward category of games that look old but don't pull it off in some charming way.- Character portraits look like they were made in EVE Online in 2003.- It's difficult to get into without going through the tutorial which is bland and more or less like reading a manual.The ugly:- Precise navigation feels impossible. I can only guess I'm doing something wrong, whether in map mode or in 3d space, I can't seem to get my ships to arrive at the right x,y,z coordinates without major headaches.- Interaction with objects is difficult as well. Non-ship interactible objects seem to be the worst offenders. - NPC Ships can (and will) follow you across the map. While I don't generally mind that idea, it only leads to frustration. One time I was trying to read quest text, and a bunch of little drones were swarming me, so I bolted away, then started reading the text again. They followed and blew me up. Several hours lost since my previous auto save. Another time I had traveled to the main space station. I was docked with it, changing loadouts when I was attacked and destroyed by... Well I have no idea what it was, but it wasn't fun.Final thoughts:- I'd be more excited about the game if it were early access so the ""ugly"" issues could get addressed, I don't feel this game reached the quality level that you would expect for an actually released title. (indy or not)- If you can get over the old-style art and initial learning curve, there could be dozens of hours of fun.- If the game were $10 I'd probably give it a thumbs up, but only for those who are system design nerds and/or are into sci-fi ship management.

												Very deep, very detailed tactical game with very deep, very detailed character, crafting, ship, customisation, mining, looting mechanisms... I liked it. I always waited games like this one... Yes, it is not an AAA game from a big game company... But the trick is that...You cant get a detailed game like this one, from a monsterous game company... They just want suck the money fast, so they create same games, with different graphics and stories, over and over... But, at the end, they are same games...  same details, same mechanics, same, same, same... You can get a game with this detail level, only from a ""dedicated- one person-idealistic-young developer"", and of course, you know the story... The game is so detailed, so good, so dreamy for core players but not for the casual mainstream players... And game will not sold too much, so the developer and the distrubutor have to change the next project to less detailed, more mainstream, more casual game... A great game, not for everyone but core strategy/tactics/RPG gamers.			"

												I been playing the game from the point it came out. It is a very good game. I love space sim's and this one up there. I see great potential. You can salvage ship's. I like looking for them. You can also capture them free money. Or just blow them up cuz u can. U can hire people and send them to there death's for your ship's are worth more then there. Mining easy and it helps on your repairs. You can also build.Like all new game's it has it bug's. But i posted what one's i found and almost immediately i got a response from the Dev. All in all it a great game. I really enjoyed it and will continue to enjoy it.Cannot wait for the add on, tho i know it too soon.			"

												I like this type of space game. I am a big Nexus fan and so far this game is reasoable like nexus for me to enjoy.Is it easy to get your hands around all the control from the get go. Well no it takes a bit of work to figure it all out. Is it 100% polished - ie finding bugs is a chalance. Not quite.However the comunity hub is very active with answers for your questions.Also the developer is online all the time taking feedback and working on improvments.(Note I dont usually even take part in forums - However I'm enjoying this game and would like to see it improve thus I'm actually getting involved.)

The Bad: Bugs, and lots of them.Most of them aren't game-breaking, but they range from annoying to downright obnoxious (e.g., duplicate ""outlines"" when in tactical mode, formation bugs that prevent you from placing ships properly, drones stuck hovering ~100m off your ship that won't return, mods that stop working, repair systems showing offline even when idling at shipyard with no damage, etc.). I did encounter one bug on the final mission that did break my game, and reloading from saves didn't resolve it. GG I suppose. Poor OptimizationGenerally the game performs well, but send out 20-30 drones, or turn on tactical mode with active scan up during a larger fight, and I've found the game will often slow to a crawl. There also seems to be an issue where the game becomes painfully slow regardless. My only recourse has been to save/load which fixes it for a time. Ship ControlIt's VERY difficult to manage your ships properly aside from pausing and issuing orders one by one. The fleet formations don't work very well, and something as simple as jumping to a location or ordering your fleet to follow something will cause untold numbers of collisions, to the point I almost lost one of my battlecruisers during a fight before I realized two of my ships were tangled in a dance of death.The Mediocre: Not Early AccessI know, I KNOW! In the age of early access letdowns, I too hope the next person to say ""this game has potential"" dies in a fire as much as the next guy, but this game does have potential, and if it were in early access I'd definitely recommend watching how it turned out for anyone even remotely interested. Unfortunately, it's in a relase state so I'm uncertain how much effort is still going into it. Mediocre Story/Voice ActingTo each his own here, and while I consider myself pretty forgiving, the story/voice acting are both very underwhelming. The story overall is your typical  save the human species  trope which is fine, but it's telling is mediocre at best.The Good: CustomizationOne of the places this game really shines is how much customizing you can do on your ships. It's almost too much for me, because I got OCD about that♥♥♥♥♥♥ and spent way too long on it. XD Boarding MechanicsWhile it needs a little balancing (boarding and capturing a ship is too easy to accomplish once you figure it out), it's incredibly satisfying to snag a top tier ship in a fight where you managed a lucky hack and if you miss your next hack you're very likely to get obliterated before you can successfully capture the disabled monster in front of you. Epic stuff. CombatThe combat is fun, to a point. It becomes slightly monotonous later in the game when you're fielding a fleet than can wreck an entire zone even if they rushed you all at once. Still, firing a beam of megadeath right through an enemy frigate is absurdly cathartic. Overall I enjoyed it. Sounds/MusicThe sounds and music, while not top notch, fit the theme well and add to the atmosphere. They won't be winning any awards for it, but that doesn't mean they're not enjoyable. GraphicsThis area I considered placing in mediocre, but I can't bring myself to. Yes, it's what you're thinking, it's exactly because the game is indie that I consider them good. There really aren't any issues with them, and while it's easy to make space beautiful, they're still good for what they are.Final ThoughtsThe game could do with some polish and bug fixes. I realize it's just the small (I think one-man) dev team working incredibly hard and I respect that, but that should never be used as an excuse. Besides, I voted with my wallet here, and I sincerely hope the guy behind this goes on to make bigger and better worlds.Overall, buy this game if you're a fan of the genre and are a patient person. Just remember to save often, lest the bugs eat you. If you're on the fence, or are not a forgiving person, either wait til it's on sale or pass on it. Either way I recommend following the team behind it, there's clearly some talent there.Potential FAQQ: ""But why did you put ""the bad"" up front if you're recommending the game?""A: ""Because I want people to know what they're getting themselves into. It takes effort to look past those issues and still enjoy this for what it is.""Edit: Formatting			"

												When i first found the game and played the demo for 5 mins, my first thoughts were ""why isn't this in the top sellers?"" I played EVERYTHING since homeland, and it left me wanting. There was always something missing. When i first started battle, i did bite off more than i can chew. Usually i would just have given up.But i was playing Ceres - so i turned my armor towards the heavy hitters, where it was thickest, moved all power from weapons into engines and systems, and commanded the crew to focus on repairing the most critical parts of the ship, while preparing to jump the hell out of here.I send all the drones to attack, hoping they would catch some of the fire, and took over control of the ship manually - there were heavy slugs incomming, and someone had to dodge them after all. With my mineral resources used up by the repairs, the energy almost out and modules in critical damage, i got just enough space in between me and the bulk of the enemy fleet, to speed up for the jump, except for the pesky frigate that was fast enough to catch up with my ship. But this was one of the possibilities, that i had accounted for.Some hours before all this mess, i was sitting, docked, at the nearest station, browsing through the shopping list for the latest ship AI, that would give me just the right edge. Selling off a large laser, that i was saving for my next ship, i decided to buy the most costly AI - i was a Cyber-mechanic after all, and preferred hacking skills over pure firepower. Who would have known at that time, that those hacking skills would allow me to disable the ship of my nemesis, saving my ship and crew in the battle to come...			"

												I very much enjoyed playing ""nexus - the jupiter incident"" and was very happy to see, that this kind of game has a rebirth with Ceres. Ceres is a very deep tactical game with tons of possible tactics with different type of ships. You  can modify your ships very nicely with different modules and together with the huge amount of possible ships you can try more or less anything you want. Pro:- very deep tactical game.- many different ships and modules/weapons- perk/skills for captains,AI and crew- board, hack or schredder the enemy to pieces- trade, bounty hunt, explore or be a humble miner (to some extent) Con: - trying to maneuver in combat is a bit tricky (micromanagement)- graphics are a little bit old/simple, but i find them very appaeling anyway -  there are some bugs/glitches left, but they are minor.for beeing developed mostly from one coder, this is really great.

												Holy shitballs where do i start. This game is HUGE, by that I mean in depth. Yet it still manages to deliver a huge open world.You are able to trade, Mine, Bounty hunt, Take missions, Retrofit your ships, Hire mercenaries, Captains, Crew, Train crew.There is an entire fleet system mechanics, Formations a loot system and there is what seems to be a very indepth Drone system that I haven't even touched yet... I'm addicted and haven't even scratched the surface at how much depth this game has. For example there is a very fleshed out character progression system in game where experience points can be converted to skills, the system is incredibly similar to how fallout 3 handles this, with each interest having a skill point from 0-100 and then perks for each captain in individual ships of your fleet. It's a fully 3D game with Homeworld esque style controls, However it's more centered on individual ships and the mechanics therein. So far, I'm intrigued by the story.It's got beautiful fleet combat, epic brawls and the combat is very stylised. Some might find it very difficult, So tactics is everything.Only downsides thus far is dated graphics which can improve and the need for more optimisations to allow a lag free environment with lots and lots of individual ships. I might also nitpick about the voice acting which is painful sometimes, But it can improve - Augment. "

												To me the game is like Star Wolves on steroids. If you like this series or Homeworld this might be a game for you.Clearly a single developer cannot deliver a product as polished as an AAA title. But I have deep respect for the effort that went into this game. Ceres demands a non-casual player who has time to get to grips with the controls.A big plus for me is the scalable UI which makes it so much easier to enjoy the game on a big screen.The game looks pretty in 4k in highest settings(Beautiful) and runs very well on my system i7 4790K/R9 390X/Win 10.This is only a first impression I wanted to present to you. I have the feeling a big adventure is waiting for me in outer space.			"

												Honestly cannot reccomend this.  The UI is terrible, the scaling is nonexistant, and the options for changing any of the above are equally nonexistent.It's a shame because this game haas a lot of potential, in my opinion, but its just not polished enough.  If someone waas able to look past the User Interface and clunky, non-intuitive controls, the tooltips that always seem to say 'utility drone' no matter what you're pointing at, the poor movement schema, the terrible missions interface, and the occasional windows that pop up full of norwegian text (I presume it's norwegian) that you can't get rid of, I'm sure its an excellent game.  I spent 1.9 hours on it and never got past the first mission.Refund Requested.			"

												EDITED: A more-to-the-point opinionCERES offers many sophisticated features all in one package; taking ideas from games like Starpoint Gemini 2, Rebel Galaxy, etc and tossing it's own concepts as well.-You have an RPG system for leveling up your ship captains making them feel much more important than simply stat buffs or tag along NPCs.-CERES allows you play with a squad and you have complete mircromanagement and control of every ship in your fleet-CERES features interesting ship controls easily allowing you distribute power between engines, shields & weapons-CERES features pulse scans, complex scans, boarding, drone looting, warp speeding, X,Y,Z plane movement, repairs on different systems, attacks on specific systems (like Nexus The Jupiter Incident), hacking and possession of enemy ships, miningSadly (and I will be blunt about this) the A.I. is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor from path finding to allied and neutral territories not giving some grace period before opening fire after an accident like bumping one of the gun turrets guarding a station.With so much going on in the maps and the overly complex controls (requiring patience to learn) the bad A.I. makes CERES impossible to complete; a conclusion that wasted ten hours of my time to finally come too.Had this still been labled as an Early Access title it would be easy for me to recommend at $15 USD or less but as a proper release it feels like yet another prototype funding for a real deal to be released sometime in the near future under a different pen name.

Posted: October 19, 2015
												I haven't played this too much, but from what I have played and played around with...It's Awesome! It starts off slow because there is a learing curve involved with playing this game. Any hardcore players will love this, while casual gamers will probably have difficulty paying attention for 2 seconds. Afterwards, it gets easy because you get a feel on how to navigate through open space (watch out for those radiation clouds - yikes). There are loads of missions for you to do, ships to hire, missions to accept, items to be bought and sold, commanders to be trained and equipped for each ship where each ship has its strengths and weaknesses. There is a lot of content in a seemingly easy enough concept of a game. I absolutely recommend this game. There are a few problems that aren't really game-breakers, but would greatly improve the game if implemented. 1.) While thrusting through space at max speed, I find going up and down difficult (even though there isn't a up and down in space). Which means it's easy enough to travel left to right, but if I want to get a better strategic position behind a asteroid or to flank an enemy from below, it's quite difficult. I know that you have to hold shift while commanding your ships to travel, but it seems rather strange to me. For me, it would be much simpler and enjoyable to just point and go. Meaning wherever I point in a place in space, I go directly there. 2.) I only played for a bit, and maybe I missed it but I find maneuvering in space combat a hassel. It probably doesn't matter because all of the pirates have homing missles and lasers to shoot you with dead accuracy. But when I was in a firefight with the enemy, I couldn't move and fire my weapons at the same time. It would be nice to be able to fire weapons while going to different position at the same time. If there is a way to do this, or if it has already been done, that would make battles very intense and awesome. 3.) When I first started playing this game, I went straight towards the tutorial. Call me a noob, but I actually want to know how to play the game. Now, I don't have the worst eye sight in the world, but much of the HUD, or symbols and text on the screen was very - VERY small. I found that I would go full asian and squint like I'm staring directly at the sun just to see the text and symbols. If there is a way, or if it's already been implemented, it would be excellent to have resisable text and symbols in the game. Or at the very least, re-write the code to make the display size for the text and symbols at least 4 times larger. This is especially important when staring at hundreds of items in your inventory and you have to grab a magnifying glass to look at your computer screen! Bigger the text, the better! 4.) Maybe I'm a sucker for sound, but I like music in game. Maybe you can come up with some unique songs in a DLC and import them into the game. I have no beef with the tracks that play over and over again, but there needs to be some variety, at least in my stupid opinion. 5.) Lastly, this is a little bug in the tutorial. When I started firing my rockets at the dummy targets, I accidentaly blew a gaping hole in my A.I.'s ship. Because the crew didn't feel like dying that day, they moved from where they were, to inside of the particle cloud. Now, the particle clouds make it so that no one can see them or track them. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for one of the tutorials being how to trade. I couldn't get the ship back into visibility and thus, couldn't do the trading tutorial. This is because to do the tutorial, you need that ship to be available - which it wasn't. Overall Awesome Game! I can see this getting a lot of attention and fame. I totally dig it, and it was worth the money I spent. ""10/10"" - Would hug the producer.			"

												Fisrt off, i would like to point out the short coming of this game:-the control is unintuitive-combat control when involving more than one ship get really tedious -this game is extremely buggy (especially when moving in a fleet, all your ship seems to always collide together unless you set them on the position they ought to be in the formation first) p.s i know that there is a command to rotate the formation in the direction you want but still this does not eliminate the possibility of your ship colliding into each other unnessasarily.then here come the good part:-This is the first time i feel since homeworld that someone get the idead of controlling your own space ship right not the fleet control(that is still buggy), most of the time when you think about space sim you think about something like starpoint germini, freelancer. those are dog fight game, what i wanted was not a dog fight game, what i wanted is a strategy combat game that is set in an open world which allow me to do all the stuff that is plausible in some of the more popular space sim(dog fight) game(since i do not have very good reflex). In this respect, this game deliver fully its potential.-Second, this might not feel as much of a big deal, but the developers of this game is working one polishing the bugs out at a very fast rate(one day after release theres a patch and then 2 days later theres another one). This game is going to be awesome(future tense), all it need is the support the player gives(by buying it of course). Just take it as another investment. Just download the demo, give it a try, and if the game excite you just give the dev money to make one good game.			"

It wasnt a flawless start, there were bugs and glitches but the developer showed how much he cared for this game and worked hard to get fixes out and I have to say, I am very impressed of his work.It feels like a mix of homeworld, nexus and star wolves.I don't know why everyone is expecting a never-seen, 100% bug-free, 1000% polished game right after the release nowadays...this game has huge potential and you really feel how much the developer cares about his game.

												The game's interface is sadly anything but intuitive. When the game seems to freeze but you can still move cursor and interface stuff around, press the space button to unpause, because it has gone into a pause and you cannot do much when it's paused. Te tutorials seem kinda clumsy because of that.Sadly the controls are kinda unpractical and are also seem quite unreactive most of the time (either that or the ship's crew does what it wants and ignores orders as soon as combat starts). The tutorial seems a bit bugged since most of the time it deactivates the control menu and no button press can get it back in, even when the tutorial text says ""press this symbol"".So i guess it may be a bug or some interface error ? I'll check back in a few patches. "

												I am a fan of Space games, and I loved Nexus: Jupiter Incident and felt I would feel right at home here.  For the most part, I like the game, story, and just about every aspect of the combat, strategy, customization, and adventure.  The game is not complete, so I cannot recommend it to strangers unless they absolutely loved Nexus: Jupiter Incident and other incomplete space indie games.  Should this game complete its development cycle and is finished, I believe it would be a great game for space junkies and strategy RPG fans alike, and a definite favorite of mine.  The potential is certainly there, and despite lack of feedback on the bug forums, the game is being patched, and many of the problems I reported were recently resolved.  I will continue to update my review as the game is being finished.Pros:- Good space tactical adventure strategy game.- Story is interesting so far- Ship customization is pretty good, you can specialize and upgrade- Character development matters, and you can specialize- Strategic, I save scummed a few times and strategy certainly comes in to play in most battles- Manage a small fleet, like NexusCons:- Bugs... This is the #1 game breaker for me.  The game is unfinished.  Menus have place holder texts, some of the buttons don't work.  Entire components from the game are just missing.  Ships get stuck, drones fly off randomly, ships blow up suddenly while at port, etc.  However, the bugs that are reported are eventually fixed, so there is a silver lining here.  - Audio is generic, lasers, booms, etc.  Voice actors are hit and miss.  Some are pretty decent, but a lot of them sound like they have a crappy mic recording some stripper from the night club down the street.  If you are using Ubuntu and the pulse audio driver, just turn the sound off.  It doesn't work half the time.UPDATE: Developer patched many of the issues I reported on the bug forum.  I updated my review.  If there was a scale of 1-10 instead of yes or no, I would rank the game a 4.5 simply because it isn't finished.  If the game had no bugs, completed story, and no place holder content, this game would easily be an 8.  I rank Nexus was a 9.1) If you are somewhat affraid of abandonware during early access, walk away2) buy it on super duper clearance if you really want to play a Nexus like strategy game.3) Wait for the game to finish the dev cycle and pick it up if you don't want to risk your money4) This game is definitely worth following.  I recommend following them if you liked Nexus and are unsure.  Kick the tires on it for a while and read the patch notes.			"

It has a Unique way to play a space game I feel more involved in the gameplay  then in other space games and I have played hundreds. The game does not have a step learning curve that some people would have you think.			"

												Not an easy game .... The story is not bad.U need to use your mind sometimes to take over on enemys.The ship control is hard for the first time but after an hour gameplay u will get used to it.An another important thing that the dev still working on this game... I like it :) If u can catch it on sale... Grab it straight !!! I miss some stuff : enemy just shows up.... Not appearing from a wormhole or hyper space... The saving - loading time is a bit long... (No I am not running  this game on  a toaster ) (and an another thing... if u load up your saved game.... Something always changes in the space universe... )It would be nice to sit in the drones and control them from the cokpit. :)More ship upgrades please!! More ""playgrounds "" :)Thank you for updating this game continously!!			"

Deep space rts/rpg with awkward controlsThe game is hard, with a lot of micromanagement (which is good in my book) but the controls are awkward and hard to learn. I kinda liked this game, but I don't think it's for a broad audience.PRO Very deep, a big map, lots of factions. Customisable ships, with tons of options from weapons to cargo bays. Fast paced combat/slow paced game. Lots and lots of micromanagement (which is good if you are into it, like me).CONS Awkward, hard to learn controlls. 'Big' UI, with a bunch of submenus. Buggy. Lame graphics. Ugly 'mechas' (imho). Most spaceships in this game look like metal shellfish. "

												Lots of bugs still, I have a bug where I can't even play the game it won't allow me to create a character. Basically I start new game do the char creation then try to go into the first area and all it does is sits on the loading screen, I have been trying to trouble shoot it with the dev but with no luck sofar hopefully he figures out the problem but at this point I can not recommend the game when its not even playable for me.An hour after posting the above review he got back to me again ""I had been waiting a few days to hear again from him on the bug reporting thread in the forums"" anyhow he figured out that the quotes I had in my name it was redice ""notomo"" were messing up the games ability to create a save he said he plans to change how the game saves so it uses the steam ID instead of the steam name so this will not be an issue in the future. I shortened my name back to just redice without and simbols and now its allowing me to play.That being said I am going to leave this as a thumbs down because of the bugs and probably change it to a thumbs up soon.

												This one man project is probably one of the best examples of how Early Access games should be made.It may not have the most amazing graphics in the world (at least for now, as the game is constantly evolving), but what it does have is an excellent space opera that combines complex RPG elements, real time strategy and fleet management, all in one excellent and relatively cheap title.In essense, this is a combination between Homeworld, Star Wolves, Star Treek Fleet Command and a few other excellent space titles, but combined in such a way that it actually makes sense and is lots of fun to play.But as an Early Access title, you should definitely expect some disappointments, such as for example the currently underwhelming path finding that will occasionally colide you with objects that may even destroy you. Nevertheless, because this is not a finished title yet, I'm certain that by the time the game is released, all of these kinks will be ironed out.So in a nutshell, get this game, you won't regret it.

												It can take a while, but this game grows on you. Trust me, I couldn't stand at first. It was buggy, it felt incomplete, the interface hated me and I didn't feel like I was having a good time. However, I stuck with it, and eventually it clicked with me. This game is trying to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love child of Homeworld, Starfleet Command and Star Wolves, and despite a few quirks, it succeeds. You can see my journey from skeptic to fan here.

												This game has a steep learning curve, buggy and some times opaque interfaces, a skimpy tutorial, and a fair share of quest bugs. However, it is a challenging space combat sim and since there are so few games of this genera I stuck it out, and I'm glad I did. If I have a complaint in the end it's that, having finally mastered the interface and the intracacies of combat, completing a short questline ended the game. I would have liked to explore the outer solar system, meet new factions, and had in general...more!			"

												A very interesting 3D space tactical game for a gamer like me that mixes and matches features from previous games like Homeworld 1 and Nexus: The Jupiter Incident with RPG elements that go beyond the latter and a decent amount of content. The game has quite a few shortfalls though with weird design decisions that won't really jive well with gamers new to the genre, weird glitches that crop up without much rhyme or reason and either require loading a save or restarting the game, a fairly generic storyline that is serviceable but won't enthrall anyone and the graphics are quite dated all told.So why do I recommend it? Well because for someone like me, old salty git who learned how to play Dwarf Fortress because of the weirdness and promise of that game, who likes this type of game more than say Sins of a Solar Empire it is a game worth getting as it is a fairly rare breed. For everyone else there's the free demo available which does give a fair idea of how the game plays in general just be ready for a challenge because this game drop kicks your♥♥♥♥♥often if you don't think about how you approach a battle situation and it is deceptively complex in certain regards.For a less structured and more derpy view on the game feel free to check my first impressions video:

												This game has potential...but it's the same with every game that has potential, it doesn't use it and probably never will. It is bugged as hell and everyone who says it isn't is plain wrong!SKills aren't working all the time, allies are attacking you without being provoked, enemie weapons have unlimitied range even when you can't even see them anymore because of them being thousands of km away...For an alpha or pre alpha state game it would be frustrating but understandable but this wants to be a released title...bad joke!For a pre alpha game the price is horribly overprized...

												As with any early release game, this one has issues.  Steep learning curve, some bugs, clumsy fleet controls, suboptimal graphics, clunky ship designs and turret models, poor tutorial support, lots of areas of game play that are incomplete.  But, remember, its an early-access game.  Of the various space-based indie games of late, this and 'Rebel Galaxy' are the best and well worth buying.  Even in its unfinished state it's better than some of the similar games from large, well-funded operations.  It's the small developers that are willing to risk trying new things if buyers are willing to take a chance on them.  It's an investment, and as with any such, you win some you lose some.    The missions are complex, the scale of the game is huge--which accounts for the learning curve.  Part of the entertainment value of such games is the chance to help in development.  It's being an alpha or beta tester.			"

												Well... First time to buy a game on steam... or maybe to buy this game I came to steam if I have to put it that way.It's quite a fine products although after some patchs there're still naughty bugs around  annoying me but I overcame , simply cause this game was that much of fun.Some different ships and modules to play with - various fittings and play styles.Quite ok main storyline mission - the only downside would be the length of it... finished in around 20 hours. Challanging  game difficulty - It's not mission impossible.. but quite challanging to be honest.. I lost count how many times I became floating corps in space... and the sol system doomed so to speak.Finally.  There're still alot of work to do.  Putting these annoying bugs aside,  I see works need to be done on -Modules refining - man. the cannons and launchers are just cargo killer. eats up so many ammunations in a short while.Utility external slot items - don't let the utility drones do all the hard work.More characteristic ship roles - it's now little bit messy.. and personally I wanna see some Battleship available for players.That's it? for now.Good work and Good luck.

												Originally I recommended this game only to masochists, as it was (IMHO heavily) bugged on release date.Seeing how developer is responsive and caring for his child, I have to change my original stance.It will still probably take some time to fix all the issues (which are getting smaller each and every day), however I believe they will be fixed. Save / load during quests is IMHO not recommended as it may trigger issues.pros- Story is original and doesn't feel generic.- Ships have large degree of customizability (each ship have slots for weapons and internal components which can be fitted as desired, oh the choices, larger weapon which drains more power or more drone bays ?)- Captains, each ship can have captain which increases (or decreases) ship effectivity, Too bad maximum level is 25, here I was hoping for superman and xman combined.neutral- Combat could be really fun when You decide to go tactical instead of buy that battlecruiser and obliterate them all. IMHO game should allow buying/capturing larger ships based on progress to enforce some tactics. But that's just opinion as some of You want to exterminate those little pirate, cyclops or mars forces, dontcha ?negative- All those insects are getting squashed.- Commanding multiple ships in fleet kindof sucks for now, but it's on list of things which will be fixed.- Game allows too many exploits which will make Your gameplay easier however will decrease fun factor. Some principles should be made less tedious (why is moving captured ship so freaking slow while capturing is quite easy ? why ismoving cargo between ships so tedious - drop into space and load by drones etc...)In the end all the bad things are not that bad and You'll get around them, because You will love and hate this game at the same time. After all it's said only those You love can really♥♥♥♥♥♥You off.			"

												Great game. Very complex. Lots of content.The Game:You will be commanding a group of ships through many locations throughout the galaxy. Ships can be purchased, hired, or found in space and salvaged.Ships can be docked at stations througout the game and upgraded with new weapons, armor, engines, etc.All ships can carry smaller ""drone"" ships when they have a drone module. These can be combat oriented drones or mining drones.Mining is an important part of the game. Mining drones are launched to collect minerals and other items from asteroids, abandoned ships and more. Minerals are very important as they can be used to automatically repair your ship with a repair module installed.Ship captains go through RPG style stat progression. This, combined with finding the right ships and upgrading them properly seems to be the key to success in this game.You will be engaging in combat with pirates, scanning points of interest and trading to complete missions.There is way too much content to list everything here. The game comes with a manual. There is an in game database full of lore which also allows you to view your standing with different factions in the galaxy. You can pay to improve this standing if you happen to anger the wrong group.PROS:Aesthetically pleasing.Ship customization.Character customization.RPG style progression for ships and crew.Extensive story with lots of missions.Huge galaxy with many locations and POI.Variety of ships and captains.Voice acting for many NPCs.Tactical ship management and combat.CONS:Low poly ships and space stations.Steep learning curve.GUI is confusing until you get used to it.SummaryCeres is a lot of fun. The game has enough depth and content to make it well worth the asking price. "

Posted: October 19, 2015
												I am going to start this review off with a bit of disappointment and some praise. This game could have been extremely fun. It has so many wonderful things, that you could say were borrowed from other games, that the Dev added to his game, that really brought life to the game.   I love so many things about this game, from the leveling up of captains, using skills and perks (Very similar to Fall Out's skills and Perk system btw) to the ability to hack other ships to disable them, and using drones to fight or just board them and take command of them. You can train your crew, increasing the bonus they provide to your ship. You  get so many options on weapons, and different options for system modules, like drone controllers, cargo bays and different bridges or A.I.  With all these things, you really must be asking, why don't I recommend this game, right? Well in it's current state, the game is unplayable for me. I have literally spent more time in loading screens, saving and loading the game, than I have playing it. The bugs are plentiful, and game breaking at this point. I lose ship modules such as the bridge on my starting ship, and the power plant on the cruiser I purchased. My engines randomly stop providing thrust to my ship, the game decides to turn off my weapons for no reason, even though I have enough power for them. My fleet screen goes blank, so I cannot turn the weapons systems back on as well. The ships refuse to take orders at times, and the game decides to stop auto following a ship you double click on. The drones also decide not to return to the ship all the way, they just sit outside running into the ship, so I cannot launch more, nor do I get the supplies they were sent out to retrieve. Also loading a save with drones outside the ship, often times removes those drones from the game, so you lose them for good.  I wish the game did not have so many bugs, nor such devistating bugs. At the moment, I am stuck between praising the dev for the ingenuity for making such a neat game, and cursing him for frustrating me to no end, causing me to spend more than half my time reloading my save, hoping my ships will follow my move orders, that my drones will return to my ship, that the ship I just boarded and captured, will let me sell it at the space station. I am about ready to give up on this game until some serious fixes come down the pipe-line. I know the dev is a one man show, but that is no excuse. If you can't handle putting out a quality product that is not broken, then don't put out the product at all. You lose the one thing that you cannot fix so easily, and that is your credibility, and right now, this dev is just about all out with me.EDIT 10/26/2015:  Upon the request of the dev, I gave this game another shot, after the most recent round of patches, that he said fixes the problems with the game. I played for about an hour and a half, and it crashed to desktop twice in that time, which was quite an improvement over the last few times I had played the game. But I crashed to the desktop twice, in under two hours. That is much better sure, but it shouldn't be crashing at all. The movement system is still very clunky, and the captains still decide to ignore your move commands sporatically. Well at this point in time, with the bugs reduced to an unhealthy couple, as opposed to a cancerous truck load like before. I can recommend this game now, and if the dev keeps his word to continue to bring improvements to the game, then it should only get better from here.			"

However I can't find this game fun, fleet management is tough you will need to pause,  nagivating is tough interacting with places / points of interest is difficult navigating vertically on the plane... (can you even do it).  Identifying the bad guys I hate being shot by things I can't find or seem to targetOn the plus side I actully like the graphics, the targeting of modules and hacking ships is cool but for me it's just not fun			"

												Its pretty rough. Getting a ship to move to an asteroid is a chore, let alone combat or managing six ships. The recent 1.4.0 patch mentioned that they are casually ""playing it looking for bugs""  and all I can think of is how they could possibly be playing it. You have missing textures, 2 min save times and load times, ships that spawn too far away from the station with not enough power to reach the station let alone be useful... full cargo ships run directly into asteroids and explode, which is an achievement - literally. I will come back to it, because of the achievements but not because I've enjoyed it so far.			"
