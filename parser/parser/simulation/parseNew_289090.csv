												Worth playing if you picked up in a bundle. However, not worth the RRP. It's cheaply put together, has a bad interface and rather crummy gameplay. Stick with the more premium surgeon simulator; it will give you more laughs and has a more responsive control system for overall, better experience. Pro tip: Flip the table and break your robot arm off for half the games achievements in 30 seconds.3/10			"

												A simulator for making tea.  Kind of.  Not quite as difficult as other hand simulator games like it, but also not fun at all.  Swiping the arm quickly across the table and knocking everything off in a fit of rage is probably the most fun thing to do.  Also, very buggy.  Your arm will randomly go all the way through items and then get stuck in them, and other game breaking weirdness with the hand.  Luckily, you don't actually have to complete and serve a cup of tea to get all the achievements.  Except for the last one, which is play (run) the game 500 times, which is just absolutely ridiculous.

												2hrs or less to get 100% achievement status on this one.If you get this game in a bundle, or on sale for $1 or less, consider it worthwhile. You'll get an hour or two of fun out of it and it's even more fun if you get someone else to play and watch them make the same hillarious mistakes you did. Ampu-Tea is easier to get into than Surgeon Simulator and appeals to a different audience, this is definitely a more casual version of the precise control genre--in some ways it almost feels like a short parody of Surgeon Simulator.Your goal is to make a cup of tea to order, as it appears on a randomly generated instruction card. Sometimes you will also need to add sugar, a certain amount of water or milk will be needed, and other times you will need to avoid certain ingredients.Some of the achievements are fun to get as well. I enjoyed clearing everything off and flipping over the table the most. The launch the game 500 times achievement is definitely meant as a joke.The music is okay, there is only one short track to speak of. Sound effects get the job done but aren't memorable in any way. I didn't experience any bugs or stability issues and was glad to find that all features of the game and achievements worked fine.			"

												It just feels like Surgeon Simulator's rejected brother, it fails just miserably at trying to be one of these simulation games. Where should I start? These are some of the worst controls I've ever experienced in a game. I'm not even kidding when I say I've spent about 15 minutes trying to grab a cup to even start the tea making process. Yeah, I know for sure that this is the humorous nature of the game, but it shouldn't be this difficult, and hell, it just becomes annoying and not even slightly challenging. I couldn't feel anything else but disappointment while playing this, it's just not what I was expecting. Graphically, it does look bad too, even on the highest settings. Also, all the meme references shoved in your face feel downright unfunny. Thank god I bought this on sales, and as much as I hate to compare things, you should go for Surgeon Sim if you're looking for a better game overall. Ampu-Tea is a 2/10 for me.Short version for the laziest, like me!+Easy achievements+Music was short but bearable-Horrible controls-Ugly-Fun for 2 minutes-Too many funny maymays-Not worth full price			"

												I was looking forward to a fun spinoff of Surgeon Simulator.  Unfortunately, this was not it.  The hand mechanics are terrible.  The objects are nearly impossible to grasp, and the dropping seemed really poor too (for example, I was finally able to grab a teabag and had it perfectly hovered over my cup.  When I went to drop the bag, the hand decided to fling it instead of just letting go of it).Until the devs clean up the mechanics, I'm going to have to give this a thumbs-down.			"

												This game is basically Surgeon simulator without all the funny parts. You have a table, robotic hand and a few things and your goal is to make a tea. That's all, there is nothing more, just put the things together. Most funny thing is breaking all the items. You can basically finish the game in 5 minutes (well maybe a little bit more, just because the controls are buggy). Definitely not worth 5 euro. Maybe if you find it in sale for 0,5 euro, buy it, because it has steam trading cards and you can get your money back, but otherwise stay away from this.			"

												+ A short laugh with absurd physics, fun for at most an hour- Bad gfx, bad sounds- Feels like a physics engine test- Little to no content- An insulting achievement involving executing the program 500 timesAmpu-Tea is a very lackluster and unpolished game. The first thing you are greeted with after launching the game is a poorly textured language selection screen, after which you are thrown into a room as a prosthetic hand, and tasked with making tea according to the instructions. This clearly looks like YouTube bait and/or an engine test.Comparisons may be drawn to Surgeon Simulator. It involves the same idea where you control each digit of the hand with a separate key and are tasked with fulfilling a task requiring very precise control. The difference however, is that Surgeon Simulator looks and feels more competent, more streamlined graphics, physics, sound and control-wise while also offering a ton of more content than Ampu-Tea.I sadly cannot recommend this title. It first struck me as being incompetent, but what pushed the limit was one nasty achievement involving launching the game 500 times. I am most certainly not exaggerating. The reason why I have a full 2 hours of gameplay on this title is because it took just an hour for my botting script to execute the game another 499 times.			"

												2.6/10 - This Game Is Missing More Than Just Arms!I laughed a few times; but that's all the enjoyment I got from this game. It's like a really short, low end Surgeon Simulator, for the price I would definitely grab something else. The total goal is to make a cup of tea with some prosthetic arms. It's extremely hard and frustrating to grab even a single object! I achieved almost 50% of the achievements in 15 minutes. The highlight of the game is knocking everything off the table in a fit of rage. Overall, satisfaction was low! This game will be filed under ""drain for trading cards only!""

												Ampu-Tea is a little casual game. Let's call it ""Tea Simulator"".You have to brew a perfect tea with a robotic prosthesis. Shortly - it's absolutely nerve-wracking. Even to grab a teabag or a single sugarcube is a torture. The perfect control of this s h i t t y robot arm is not possible. The fingers are always bending over if you grab. Mostly the things slip away or accidently flip. All 3 tea receipts are buggy until you add hot water. Because then no further point of the list will turn into green. The dumbest achievement is to start the game 500 times ... nc.			"

												""Obsessive Tea Drinker"" is one of the dumbest achievements I've done.  This game has all of maybe 30 minutes of gameplay to unlock all the other achievements and no replay factor, but the developer decided to make us open and close his game 500 times just to get this last achievement.  I don't mind achievements that are hard to get or challenging if it is actually a part of the gameplay, but this was just pointless and only wasted my time.  If you play this game and want help getting that achievement, I recommend opening the folder on your computer with the executable file for the game (steamapps) and using enter to launch the game and enter to play (from the launcher that ops up), then hitting alt+f4 at the loading screen once the mugs drop at least halfway down.  If you time this well enough you can accomplish the 500 starts in about 25 minutes or so.Anyways, this game is not that fun and I don't have much to say about the gameplay, because there isnt much to do in the game other than make a cup of tea and knock things over.  Think Surgeon Simulator controls making tea.I'm not recommending it unless you're like me and simply like achievements and games that are not too difficult to 100%...minus the 500 starts one.			"

												My experience with Ampu-Tea...You open up the game and it gives you 'orders' to complete, with instructions. Being that I don't have fantastic control over ASWD controls, and this game doesn't have controller support, I hit F1 to go to 'easy' mode. In hindsight, I'm not entirely sure this made a difference.My first order consisted of five steps. Here's how it's supposed to go- Step 1: Add Teabag.Here's how it REALLY went. Step 1: Spend 10 minutes attempting to use Q, W, E, R, Left mouse, right mouse, and a few other controls to grab the teabag while never actually being able to grab onto it. Break everything on the table, including the cup you're trying to put it into. 10 minutes later.... get angry, smash everything on the table, and get ""EPIC FAIL! YOU BROKE YOUR ARM! BE MORE CAREFUL!"" Splash screen. *ragequits game*Sorry, couldn't do it Ampu-Tea. It's not you, It's me.			"

												I know that the point of this game was to make your rage, but I did not like this game at all past maybe the first 2 minutes. In the end, this is just a quick meme game that is like one of those web browser pop up ads and doesn't deserve more time than the trading cards drop for.The controls for this game are♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't mean that the keys are♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean that the translation of the controls to the arm movements are just bad. The physics for this game is also pretty bad as well. Everything is intentionally made to be bad I'm going to guess in order to make the game as hard and rageworthy as possible. There really is no memorable part about this game, other than the first time you break your arm, the first time you flip the table, and the first time you break something.This game might be more fun if you are playing with a bunch of friends and just want to take turns laughing at how bad they are doing. But aside from that, this game has no purpose at all and it is just a meme game. Honestly, if you are trying to get a game to play for fun, this is not one. You can't even play it well if you tried to (unless you are super patient and decide how to learn this game perfectly for the achievements).Overall, not a great game and I would not recommend this game to anyone unless you just want to make fun of your friends.Rating: 5.2/10Recommend Price: Under $0.20 (for the steam trading cards)			"

Pros:Nice graphicsNice effort in attempting to recreate Surgeon Simulator (which I've yet to play at this point, so I'm going on hearsay here.)Cons:Grab physics are.....really bad.  Sometimes your fingers feel like they have glue on the tips...other times, it's way too difficult to grab a teabag, a cup, or sugarcube.)Objects phase through the hand.  (The cup will fall through your fingers often)On most boots, the table and the silver platter (where you place your finished tea) won't appear, so you'll be working on an invisible table.When you boot the game, you'll think it's broken as you see a waving curtain and hear a tea cup break.   (Press F1 to continue past this screen)I REALLY thought this was going to be a fun game.   I found myself severely disappointed.    This is NOT a title that is worth $5....good thing someone gifted it to me for free.1.5/10

												My Ampu-tea ReviewWhat is Ampu-tea?Ampu-tea is a tea making simulator in which the player uses a robotic arm(hence the games pun on words title.) the keyboard/mouse to control the hand/fingers in a similar fashion seen in surgeon simulator and games with similar control schemes. Unlike surgeon simulator which has plenty of content and scenarios in which you can play on there is only 1 scenario given and it is very basic(making a cup of tea in a kitchen.) there is no other content avaliable after you complete the title.Is This Game Fun?I personally didn't think that the game is that fun and the novelty wears off very quickly this game is probably just for people to mess around on for making youtube videos etc.How Long Is This Game?This game can be completed within 1 or 2 hours however to get the final achievement(loading the game 500 times.) it will take you 6.7 hours to complete.Who Would I Recommend This For?Being personally honest I wouldn't recommend this game at all even at the sale price because there are better games avaliable at the same price such as yet another zombie defence and orion prelude both of which are significantly better and longer than this game. The only time you should even think about playing this game is if someone on your steam friends list gives you this as a joke present.			"

												This ""game"" is, for starters, pretty much a rip-off of Surgeon Simulator 2013, so what little novelty and interest as a curiosity it might have had, will be pretty much null and void if you own, or even seen, that.What sets this one apart from the original, besides the difference in setting - making tea in a kitchen instead of performing surgery in an ambulance - is the execution. Where Surgeon Simulator 2013 is hard to control, this one adds another obstacle - bugs. I have, for example, literally turned my hand into an endlessly spinning propeller by trying to turn it. While this may at first sound mildly amusing, it unfortunately isn't, since the graphics craps out as well.Oh, yes - the graphics. Not only does it look really poor, even if you crank the settings to max, but it lags and stutters so much most of the time, that it would have been unplayable, had there been any play to be had. And mind you, I'm running it on a Core i7 4820K running at 4.6GHz, with 16GB RAM and an AMD R9-290 GPU. I'd hate to try it out on a less powerful system.So my only advice is to stay away. There is little fun to be had here, even if you missed Surgeon Simulator 2013.			"

												Without a doubt one of the worst games I have ever played. Superman 64 was more enjoyable (I own it). I even have Day one Garry's Incident and that game was more playable than this piece of trash. The camera angle is so awkward and bad, It needs to be a first person perspective, not a sideview of a robot arm. I wasted so much time trying to grab stuff with the awful robot hand, only to constantly knock everything over when i grab it or break the robot hand. It has a bunch of terrible memes in it to like *Epic Fail* which describes this game just fine. This game makes me so mad that I actually felt like punching a Siberian Tiger in the God damn balls. -10/10 AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! I paid less than .50 cents and still feel ripped off. "

FINE I'LL SAY ITThis game is SHI-TEAPlease allow me to preface this review by saying: I love hard games and difficult challenges, I really do.  I play Snooker in real life.  I play with mechanical logic puzzles, Rubik's Magic, entanglement puzzles, etc.  I have finished all of the Serious Sam games on the hardest difficulties.  I LOVE A CHALLENGE.  The harder something is, provided it isn't patently unfair, the more likely I am to try to beat it.This game is challenging.  But not in a good way.It is challenging because NOT because it is well-designed, but because: The camera is badly implemented such that you can never really tell where your mechanical hand is going The collision detection is very wonky, meaning that fingers/thumbs on the hand will ""bump into"" empty space Further to the collision problems, things that should collide often pass through each other Moonball physics where everything is very float-y and does not behave as-expected The mechanical hand is made of metal and wire, but behaves like it is made of Silly Putty It is very difficult to get any perspective because of poor lighting/shadows .... The list truly goes on and on...Really what you have here is a troll game.			"

												""Yeah, I know that the whole amputee thing really sucks, so to cheer you up, we decided that you should make all of the cups of tea. All of them. By yourself. With this new arm thing that you haven't even gotten used to and will probably break randomly from light stress. And we'll put all of the cups of tea on a shelf that you'll probably accidentally push over even when the table has more than enough space.""Worst. Job. Ever.Also, that ""500 plays"" achievement thing is just too much. I mean, 100 is too much, but 500? Come on, this game isn't that good and you know it! In addition, it doesn't run offline.All in all, not worth $5. Get it on sale, or in a bundle.			"

Ampu-Tea is drove me nuts.Your mechanical hand is shaking and it will make you shake as well. Your actual hands will become sweaty, shakey and weak. Very hard to manage. Is this the real thing when you get amputated and replace it with a mechanical hand?Surgeon Simulator is harder than this, tbh. Even this is fun to play and very frustating, get this on sale, like I did.			"

Also, I have no idea how to quit the game properly...UPDATE (as of patch 1): Camera angels are terrible. Keeps moving when I am trying to do anything. A stable cam would be great, not like we have depth perception anyhow. Better handling tho, so that's something. Plus, now you can quit with ease.			"

												I honestly have no idea why I play this, I mean it's probably because I'm just trying to get the achievements, or because I'm bored, but when I think about it, the game is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Let's start with running the game, first you get greeted with video/graphics settings then when you hit ""play game"" or whatever it says, the screen is blank with a white banner for some, but for others, you see language options nd the actual intro which is like 5 seconds and the sounds are loud as ♥♥♥♥. After that, you sit there for like 30 minutes waiting for it to verify that the game is an actual copy, so you can't play offline. After that, the game starts instantly and you are shown a blueprint of the controls, and you notice how limited your movement is (You can only move up and down, or rotate your hand and you can only open and close your hand, but two of the fingers are the same key) and that the controls are real♥♥♥♥♥♥ Once you play, it seems fine until you try and grab a mug where you have two possibilities the entire shelf falls off and you have to reset the game, or if you manage to grab a mug, your fingers will clip right through the handle or stick to you. If you manage to get the mug on the table, you have to put in a teabag and water before anything else, or that will be all you need to do sometimes. Trying to get the teabag in your hand is tough because with your limited movement and bugginess of the game, it will keep slipping through your hands (I once got it in my hands, but the game bugged out and everything on my table either fell off or tipped over) then you have to get your mug under the water dispenser, which has a sign tht prevents you from ever being able to put the mug in the right spot for the water. But, most of the time, your hand just falls right off before anything else			"

What the game isApmu-Tea is both a game about tea and a play on words. In the game, you play as an Amputee, who has to make tea. Its a basic concept, but the game turns this concept into a challange. AS the steam page says, the game is literally surgion simulator like, but to make tea.Pros+Game has decent graphics. Not state of the art, but not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ either+Gameplay is engaging. Until you figure everything out and beat the game.+Difficult, but not too much.It is difficult at first to do anything. Want to grab a cup, all the others get pushed off the table and onto the floor. Although over time it does go away as you learn the controls.+Sound/Music isnt bad.Sure the music can get annoying after a bit but the sounds go with the art style.Cons-Not to much to do.The concept of the game is to make tea, and thats all you do. It gets old after a while.-Annoying controls.The controls take a while to get used to, and by defealt they are annoying and difficult to use.Final OpinionAmpu-Tea is a fun game that can occupy a few hours of time. Its a basic puzzle/physics game (in my mind du to difficulty) that is only somewhat worth the price. For the current $5 it costs, I would only reccomend it if you have spare change and dont mind a challange. But if Apmu-Tea is on sale, get it. The game is deffinatly something that can liven up your steam library, and as i've said before, can occupy a few hours of time.			"

AUDIOAnnoyingVISUALNiceDIFFICULTYGlitchyVIBEGoofy AdventureCRAVINGClassicON SALESometimesPROS: Colorful and somewhat humorous. Environment looks nice.CONS: Amputees struggling in rehabilitation may not be the most tasteful punchline a game could be based off of. More importantly however, the game controls awfully. One might say it was meant to be this way, however games like Octodad and Surgeon Simulator control well... Just clunky to the point of humor. Movement in Ampu-Tea however, is sluggish and often unresponsive. Reeling in fingers to grip is so slow that your fingers will push the item out of grasp. Items will also stick to the hand. Physics move the room about even if you're afk. Sometimes you're notified when you fail immediately, sometimes it waits to notify you at the very end.WORTH: This game may stave off boredom for 15 minutes or so, but is not worth full-price by a long-shot. At the time of writing this, it is on sale for 0.74USD, which is fair for a game that honestly doesn't work very well.OVERALL: The nail in the coffin that keeps this from being the average quick n easy achievement game is the ludicrous achievement requesting you open the program 400 times. I wouldn't recommend this.SCORE:3/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Well, this is basically Surgeon Simulator, but instead of killing patients, you are killing it making some nice hot tea, sometimes with sugar, sometimes with milk, sometimes with both, sometimes with neither, lol.You lost your arm in battle and so you were given a robotic arm with which you must try to make your aforementioned tea in hopes of calming down after the stress of losing your arm.Physics based all the way. It's pretty challenging, but the learning curve istn as steep as with Surgeon Simulator. All in all, it's a charming, sometimes frustrating little game that will make you want to do everything. Took me about an hour to get all the achievements exceppt the play 500 times one, but there are scripts available to handle that one in the comunity hub.Anyway, pretty fun. I give it 7 broken tea cups out of 10 possible. The spilled milk and hot water abounds.			"

												I honestly don't know what I was expecting with a PUN-ishing name like that. It has a Surgeon Simulator feel while lacking any real mission besides slamming around objects like a 10-year old after drinking a single can of Monster Energy Drink. Of course, the only thing stopping you from doing this sort of thing forever is how easy it is to break the prosthetic arm and the desire you get after a couple of minutes to play a better game. All-in-all, I wouldn't recommend this if you're over the age of 10.'Nough said.			"

												A wonky physics simulator probably inspired by Surgeon Simulator, but far less charming. Players will have to attempt to make the ""perfect"" cup of tea through the use of a wobbly and unreliable prosthetic arm. There's nothing more and nothing less to the game itself, other than the unfortunate wordplay choice for the title. All in all, it's more of a challenging/frustrating pastime to kill a few hours while you're multitasking than anything else.			"

Fun concept, flawed executionThis is a game where you make tea. You control a robo-arm and must pick up a teabag, put it in a cup, add hot water, then include any other stuff as instructed by a piece of paper, like sugar or milk. It sounded fun to me because I thought controlling the robo-arm would be amusing and challenging to some degree; unfortunately the controls, mouse feedback, and just about everything else actually, are way too broken for this game to be playable or taken seriously.Some of the flaws1) Objects weigh too littleEverything is as light as a feather. So when you even slightly touch them, they start to topple. This includes the hot water dispenser which is a huge bulky object. The ""lightness"" makes it virtually impossible to do anything.2) The mouse is far too sensitiveMoving even 1mm (yes, you heard right - that's millimetres we're talking about) with your mouse results in a HUGE movement by the robo-arm, so much so that it's nigh impossible to move properly. You practically have to ""tiptoe"" with your mouse movement - like maybe 0.1mm or less per move. The same thing happens if you move too fast - the arm will zoom rapidly, knocking down everything in its path.3) The fingers cannot grip properlyForget trying to actually pick up the teacup or anything else for that matter - the hand and its fingers are practically useless - too ""weak"", and most of the time not angled correctly (wrist rotation only works sideways and not vertically). You'll have better luck with one of those claw machines in the arcade.4) Buggy as hellI managed to get a teabag into the teacup by pure luck. It was precariously balancing near the cup's edge, so I nudged it a little to make it enter the cup properly. Said teabag then ""floated"" in the centre of the cup - I made a screenshot of it (check my screenshots). And on another occasion, the British flag on the table got ""impaled"" by my fingers, so I ended up having to drag it around with me.You're better off just smashing everythingWhich is what I did, in total and utter frustration. The game ends if your robo-arm gets destroyed. Thank goodness.			"

												Having gone through Surgeon SImulator, I am Bread, QWOP and similar, I find hilarity in this type of game. However, this particular entry is very poor. The physics are absolutely awful. Surgeon Simulator may have clunky controls, but they feel fairly responsive. The controls in this are sluggish and glitchy and it's more akin to trying to make a cup of tea with a possessed claw machine that sometimes goes through objects for no reason. If you don't want to take my word for it, here's a video of what happens when you rotate the wrist a little too far.

I did manage to make tea after about 30 minutes and that's all the content this game offers. $5 for half an hour of glitchy gameplay is not a good buy.			"

												Clearly inspired by 2013's Surgeon Simulator 2013 (which the developer at least have the decency to acknowledge), this game has the quirkiness and tongue-in-cheek playfulness of that title, but with none of the personality, finese or fun. Robotic limbs are pretty damn bad*ss (one day I really hope we'll see some robotic *sses, too! Maybe I'll even get one myself if I'm real lucky), and I guess tea is pretty decent as well, but here, they really don't blend very well at all.Controlling the robotic arm of a recovering amputee (because they're classy with their set-up like that), you must fulfill the order required to make a satisfactory cup of tea and try your best not to completely wreck the gaff in the process. The arm itself is somewhat unwieldy and very unintuitive to direct, with the motions of the fingers being a particular bugbear. In Surgeon Simulator the controls were laid out in a way that made sense and soon felt pretty natural to use, and the solid, slightly stubby fingers meant picking up items was mostly quick and straightforward. Here, however, an awkward control scheme mixed with long, gangly, slow-moving digits that don't even close properly makes for the majority of the challenge as you struggle massively with picking up anything and wrestling with pretty much every single object you try to interact with.There isn't really much more to the game other than grabbing a cup, putting some items into it, moving the cup around, adding some liquids then placing the cup on a platter. And after you've done that once, you've essentially seen all the game has to offer. You can always smash everything up or flip the table (possibly breaking the arm as you do), but other than that, nada. Depending on how quickly the controls click with you or how lucky you get, you could probably finish this in anything from 10 to 40 minutes (I think I completed every achievement bar one in half an hour), and after that you've no real reason to revisit it since there's nothing else on offer except to retry the task with slightly different orders or quantities of ingredients.More frustrating and annoying than bad, given how little content there is here, and how not particularly fun it is, there's no way I could recommend it at full price, and, if anything, fives euros seems like a bit of a p*ss take if you ask me. If controlling the thing wasn't so unneccesarily cumbersome, or there was more content beyond a single ""quest"" to complete, I'd likely endorse it, but as it stands, it's probably worth something closer to 50c. Though there could be an argument made for it being free. If it's on sale and you just have to see what the fuss is about, maybe it's worth briefly investigating. But in any other circumstances, there's really so many other, better things you could be wasting your time and money on than this.			"

												It's relatively easy to get all of the achievements, the only one being a really huge pain is launching the game 500 times, but that can be done relatively quickly as well, as long as you know what you're doing. The gameplay is okay. I went in, like a lot of people, expecting something similar to Surgeon Simulator, and it is kind of similar, but this game is far more casual. It's still rage inducing at moments, but I was never rageful enough to RAGEQUIT. I keep my cool for the most part when playing games, though, because in the end they are just games. I think it's a pretty clever idea, and it is fun for a while. It's even more fun when you have a friend play it, especially if they get frustrated with games easily. I guess I would recommend this game to achievement hounds and people that like rage games, but given that it doesn't have a ton of replay value, I would only recommend it on sale or in a bundle.			"

												Make no mistakes, I spent over 3 hours trying to actually grab the ****ing mug and just finish the first quest in the game, it was just in offline mode mostly so not recorded I suppose.Why would anyone upvote this game ? forget the fact that its ridiculously hard, forget the fact that its boring so and dull and so hard to control.its simply just too buggy and broken, the physics in the game are so far off, I am shocked that people compared this to surgeon simulator which was the reason I got it actually, and a friend recommended it so lets just say I am never listening to that person ever again. Why I DO NOT recommend this game  Its not fun, its not relaxing or anything, its simply too frustrating not for the fact that its just hard but because its simply broken.You use the robot arm to grab the mug, and you use QWER To clinch the fingers on it, and then they suddenly go past it like you're a ghost or something.Then you spend most of the time trying to adjust the cup/mug whatever so you can put the teabags on it.Then you spend even more time trying to actually grab the teabags which frankly was almost too impossible.Yeah I get it you're trying to be like surgeon simulator with the concept, but couldn't they at least make it work ? So many bugs, that its just ridiculous for this game to exist in a fully released state, but I suppose you'd say there is no helping in a game like this type having bugs ?  yeah some of the physics based games have some funny bugs, this one is just repeating itself every time you try to past the first mission which is to just put the teabag in the god damn cup/mug.Then you will try to lower the arm to get a better angle and with one simple push you'll knock down the entire table and/or the shelf and press F5 to restart.And at many cases if you miss-use it the hand will disconnect and you will lose, or if you're lucky enough to survive that you will eventually break all the cup/mugs trying to just hold them and putting the ingredients in them.The music in the game is good but with this gameplay and what not, it sorta feels like Troll-ish music that is designed to just make you annoyed and frustrated, though you can press M to toggle it.Easy mode and hard mode are basically the exact same thing, except in easy mode you don't have to put sugar and just serve it with the teabag and milk or whatever.And the game does not have any actual content just the first mission as i'v heard, thats really horrible, hell I got 6 achievements without actually doing anything but wave the arm.The dev also has about 3 games on steam, and they're all horribly voted down. why people bought it  I suppose they did so because they figured it would be as fun as surgeon simulator .... its NOT.The price is fairly cheap so it attracted even more people.Its been bundled a LOT of times which would explain why everyone in your friendlist probably owns it, but that does not mean that you must.TL;DR Do what you will, but I highly recommend you not to buy this game, and buy a better title that uses physics in a funny way like surgeon simulator or octodad or whatever. Because this game is simply ... horrible.			"

												Ampu-Tea8 / 10A 3D First Person Tea-er. Use a Robot Arm to make Tea and break everything along the way.... Really Fun. A must own for aficionados. Patience is a must, Add to Cart....Like one of those Carnival Prize boxes where you use a crazy contraption to pick up a prize you want, it is hard until you understand....Controls are precise and have Rules;  remember that you are so good at figuring out the Rules, thus it is really easy once you have understood....Last thoughts: Easy achievements and cards.... 100% achievement is possible guaranteed, and get it on sale....

												You control a floating cybernetic arm and must make and serve a cup of tea. The physics are pretty decent; the game is very obviously inspired by Surgeon Simulator (luckily, your cup of tea can't bleed out on the operating table). There is one song and it's nice, but once it ends, there is just silence other than the whirring of your hand motors. You can change the difficulty level by choosing whether or not the tea gets milk or sugar, but other than that, there isn't much variation in the game play. Once you made a cuppa, that's pretty much all there is to this game.Recommended if on sale/bundled, but NOT at full price.			"

												The concept is good, the set design is great and the sound work is fantastic... There however is where the praise ends.The controls are rubbery and uncomfortableThe button configuration has managed to give me a crampthe grip of the hand is appaulingthe hand you conrtrol looks like something made from legothe movement of the fingers is slow and feels incredibly weakI got sick of my fingers bending back on themselves before I even got the cup of the shelf.I had no idea how to operate the machine to despense the waterThere is no way to re-map the controls to something a little more user-friendly and intuitiveWhat's with the sparklie firefly the mouse is controling?I can't condone recomending a game where you need the patience of a saint to just pick up a tea-bag!The surgeon simulator inspiration sadly makes this seem like a good idea... but after playing and completing a black-no-sugar tea first time (cramps not withstanding) the biggest challenge is the poor control.Had the hand any grip at all, this would be a walk in the park. Or, for that matter, if the fingers met the thumb when picking things up.This game needs some serious work with the controls to make it properly playableI'm already regretting the .60p I spent on it during a sale...Going to try and contact the developer and see if there will be a fix for the weak fingers. if that could be fixed, this game would be worth the money			"

Gameplaymake tea using one hand? wtf? and all the objects in the game acts as if they're weight less, slightest bump sends them rollingControlsthere's a slight lag in input, and there's mouse accelerations, fine movements are pretty impossible unless you're patient.and the hand you're controlling is a left hand, but the objects are placed more suitable for right hands.TLDRthe game is complete BS, it's as if it's made to be a joke.not to mention it's porrly optimized, GTX1060 and it's lagging.... wtfoh, and the music is so repetitive it's annoying			"

												If you're a Brit who really enjoys making a cup of tea without the satisfaction of being able to drink it, this game is probably for you. You could call it an arm simulator because really that's all it is; a strange tea-making arm simulator. It's got quite the learning curve as well, it's very difficult to begin with a takes a bit to master. Depending on how quickly you learn proper control or if you've played a similar game (Surgeon Simulator anyone?) you'll find that even after gaining control over the arm the game will sometimes decide you've broken it. Combined with the utter lack of a story, other than making a stinking cup of tea with about three variations to it infinitely or until the game decides to break your arm whilst simply pushing the button for water or milk. The game overall has a simple look, nothing special but not overly boring. The music and sounds are pretty dull and lackluster, not really fun to listen to or a joy to hear. I would say that the game is quite the ridiculous oddity, but at the same time I'd say you could pass the game up and not miss much. Overall the game is not long, it only took about 2 hours to complete all of the achievements as well as multiple cups of tea. I still find it frustrating after finally being able to make the cup of tea you're completely unable to enjoy it. Buy the game when it's on sale if you really think you have to play it, there are plenty of other games you should pay full price for.☆☆★★★ Overall ☆☆★★★ Gameplay ☆☆☆☆★ Story ☆☆★★★ Graphics ☆☆☆★★ Sounds ★★★★★ Oddity ☆☆☆☆★ Length "

												Please read the whole review before flagging as helpful/not helpful. It's at times like these that I wish Steam had the option for a neutral review.Paying homage to fan favourite and viral classic Surgeon Simulator 2013, Ampu-Tea (LOL VERY PUNNY) is a tea-making simulator. Like SS2013, you need to use both your hands to control a solitary left arm. (Which, in this case, is robotic, and unlike SS2013, it can be VERY fragile. Don't hit it too much on stuff or it will break and you will have to restart the level.) The control schemes for both games are roughly very similar, and this review will be littered with a lot of comparisons between the two games.Unfortunately, while SS2013's controls, though awkward, still had reasonable control, this game practically throws all semblance of control out of the window. You'll be in for a torrid time if you try to grab anything with your hand's fingers. I've tried quite a lot of times and I have to say that I've NEVER, in my 2.5 hours of playing this, successfully gripped or picked up the cup. Or anything else for that matter. I've had to resort to pushing the cup around with my arm then pushing the tea ingredients into/near the cup.Also unlike SS2013, you can only do one thing in this game, and that is to make tea. This makes the game potentially frightfully short, depending on how skilled or lucky you are. All you can change is whether or not you add milk or sugar. There are 2 achievements where you need to add milk and sugar, but after those are done, there's not much point to playing on the harder difficulties.Why did I give this game a barely passing grade though? Because, like SS2013, there is this sense of hilarious illogicality, only this time, it's more subtle. Remember what I said about pushing the cup and the ingredients into each other, with the cup on its side? Well, it turns out that you can complete the game this way if you can really find no way to lift the cup and ingredients properly. Just imagine: your hot water and cold milk exist as orbs. You nudge the cup along and miraculously the liquid orbs somehow land up in your cup. And when you imagine that if this was an actual tea simulator, the tea would have long spilt by now! Oh well, glad to see that it's at least forgiving in that regard.And, unlike SS2013, you can flip the whole damn table if you screw up your tea in epic fashion. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)It's enough for me, at least, to overlook its massive shortcomings. But only barely so.When to buy: I'd recommend picking this up as part of a bundle. Depending on your tolerance, skill and/or luck, this game will either have you ragequit after the first hour, or finish it within 2 and a half (like I did), which means very short gameplay time on average. Actually, scratch that. I'd recommend picking up SS2013 instead. You'll have a lot less frustration (and a lot more laughs).5.5/10Like indie games?

												I can't really recommend this game. While the surgeon simulator inspiration is easily noticeable, I feel it lacks a certain charm to it. The controls feel weird to begin with, and the camera angle doesn't really help. Not to mention that the robot arm tends to glitch out, especially when grabbing objects, which can lead to situations in which your hand gets stuck into certain items, and you pretty much have to restart, or have a lot of patience to get the hand out. This can lead to a lot of frustration, and, even though it's still a relatively easy 100%, when it comes to achievements (it shouldn't take you more than an hour or so), it's still not enjoyable.All in all, I think what this game needs is some more polish. Ironing out some of the bugs, that kind of stuff. Even then, I don't feel I'd actually recommend it, which is why I'm giving it a thumbs down.			"

My playtime: 3.4h (based on steam).Grindy Achievement: Yes (1 achievement; there is a way to speed it up, but it still takes around 1.5h).Optional Achievement: Yes (7 achievements).Difficult Achievement: Yes (1 achievement; can be more or less based on your patience).Developer Response: No (last response is in 12 Jun 2014, i think).IntroAmpu-Tea is a prosthetic hand simulator game to make a tea. Well, actually you can choose whethemaking a tea or screwing things up like flipping a table.GraphicsThis game is using 3D models and while i think that the help image looks great, the other does not. I think that it's still okay for such a cheap game though. I also want to add that the hot water and milk dispenser doesn't look informative enough. I don't know how to use it if i didn't watch a video for it. I even thought that i have to rotate the thing below the button which i think is a nightmare if i really have to do it.MusicThe music has a relaxing tone and is forgettable. I forgot how the music is right after i close the game. All sfxs are used appropriately.The gameI have a trouble in running the game in the first 30 minutes. I even have to restart my PC just to play it. The game will start in a main menu with a language select screen. After you select the language, the game will start. All controls are easy to understand but it's hard to be applied into the game. I don't know that you can turn the palm up and down after a few minutes.Even if you understand the controls, it's really hard to control the hand. Sometimes, the prosthetic will also move by itself (even if you don't move your mouse) after or when you are doing something. The hand itself also can't hold anything (even the hot water paper) and you can only hold the glass after sticking your hand to the glass' handle. Well, you actually can try to do it the other way, but you'll more likely fail to do it. This will become nightmare when you're trying to take a teabag or sugar. Luckily, the hand is sticky enough that the item will stick to your hand when it seems like you are not holding it. I also want to add that the same thing applies to the glass so you'll more likely have a hard time to take it off from your hand.The game itself can't really be completed unless you are patient enough and you'll obviously need to replay it a lot of times. Sadly, there is no reward after you complete the game. After you put the tea in the tray, there is nothing happening which make it seems like you have to make another tea.Pros:- If you think that getting frustated counts as one, so be it.Cons:- No ending- Weak hand- Sticky handConclusionThis is a prosthetic simulator game, although i can't really say that it's a simulator for the said thing because all you get is frustation in doing a simple task.Should you buy this game?No.Unless you want to get frustated when you are playing a game, that is.

My playtime: 3.4h (based on steam).Grindy Achievement: Yes (1 achievement; there is a way to speed it up, but it still takes around 1.5h).Optional Achievement: Yes (7 achievements).Difficult Achievement: Yes (1 achievement; can be more or less based on your patience).Developer Response: No (last response is in 12 Jun 2014, i think).IntroAmpu-Tea is a prosthetic hand simulator game to make a tea. Well, actually you can choose whethemaking a tea or screwing things up like flipping a table.GraphicsThis game is using 3D models and while i think that the help image looks great, the other does not. I think that it's still okay for such a cheap game though. I also want to add that the hot water and milk dispenser doesn't look informative enough. I don't know how to use it if i didn't watch a video for it. I even thought that i have to rotate the thing below the button which i think is a nightmare if i really have to do it.MusicThe music has a relaxing tone and is forgettable. I forgot how the music is right after i close the game. All sfxs are used appropriately.The gameI have a trouble in running the game in the first 30 minutes. I even have to restart my PC just to play it. The game will start in a main menu with a language select screen. After you select the language, the game will start. All controls are easy to understand but it's hard to be applied into the game. I don't know that you can turn the palm up and down after a few minutes.Even if you understand the controls, it's really hard to control the hand. Sometimes, the prosthetic will also move by itself (even if you don't move your mouse) after or when you are doing something. The hand itself also can't hold anything (even the hot water paper) and you can only hold the glass after sticking your hand to the glass' handle. Well, you actually can try to do it the other way, but you'll more likely fail to do it. This will become nightmare when you're trying to take a teabag or sugar. Luckily, the hand is sticky enough that the item will stick to your hand when it seems like you are not holding it. I also want to add that the same thing applies to the glass so you'll more likely have a hard time to take it off from your hand.The game itself can't really be completed unless you are patient enough and you'll obviously need to replay it a lot of times. Sadly, there is no reward after you complete the game. After you put the tea in the tray, there is nothing happening which make it seems like you have to make another tea.Pros:- If you think that getting frustated counts as one, so be it.Cons:- No ending- Weak hand- Sticky handConclusionThis is a prosthetic simulator game, although i can't really say that it's a simulator for the said thing because all you get is frustation in doing a simple task.Should you buy this game?No.Unless you want to get frustated when you are playing a game, that is.

												When I first started playing this game, the weird movement of the hand was enjoyable as rage starts to pour in as soon as you ""screwed"" up something.Then you start to get used to weird movement bit by bit but it's almost impossible to master the hand movement as it is a rather difficult task.With some luck, you managed to make tea. However, I got bored halfway through as there is no other objectives than making tea with an impossible-to-control hand. This game didn't had a great impact on me.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Making-tea Simulation game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are many resolution sizes available.You are able to play fullscreen or windowed mode.About the game.First of all... i can't believe i am playing one of these pay-bait games..  But as expected. The game has terrible control movements. But that is how the game works.. You are playing with some kind of robot arm.. picking up things and trying to make tea. I have no idea how this robot arm got so messed up but it will make your life 10x harder to complete the tea. There are some different difficulties available to have more ingredients and objectives to complete a tea. You can smash up the objects if you really want too or just simply fly out of the level.  Has some difficulty levels.Super repetitive.Music is pretty Meh.You are able to reset the game.You are able to toggle the hints button.You have seen everything in the next 5-10 minutes and gets dull.Other things.All of these ""simulator"" games socks♥♥♥♥♥ They aren't fun and they only have one purpose, milking the customers.. These type of games are already old and it's all the same. You do this for 5 minutes and that is the game...-------------------I Give this game a 2/10			"

												This game is a perfect example of how much trite there is in the Indie gaming market.  Of course, it doesn't help that PewDieBait like this gets popular for some reason, and sells...due to idiots who follow an idiot, and steal mommy or daddy's credit card to buy terrible games.  Why did I get it?  It was on sale for incredibly cheap.  Like...laughably cheap....Even at the low price I grabbed it at, it wasn't worth the money.Pros-I'll get back to you on that.Cons-Non-responsive controls-Lousy Sound-Heart-Attack inducing introduction screen-Glitchy as a motherfcker-Feels like it was a rushed student project-Arm breaks at the slightest mistake, causing repeated game-oversAll in all - 0.05/10 - At least you can flip a table.Save your money and buy Surgeon Simulator.

												If the controls were like Sergon simulator then the game would be fun. But these controls suck. They are so bad. Everything is in reverse. If the fingers close and open manually and are locked positioned it would be fine. The robot hand opens up if you let go of the keys. Not only do you have to aim with the arm, but you are limited on movement. If you are adjusting height, your hand is stuck in that position as you adjust, vertically you can not move horizontally or forwards/backwards. If they just copied and pasted the controls from the sergon game, it would be a fun game.Also when you finally got your fingers around the cup handle, the game is so badly designed that your fingers clip through the handle if you jerk the mouse too fast. The cup falls to the floor. Game is unplayable with these controls.			"

												*Sigh well what can i say about this game? well for one thing i know it's a rage game. So there's no doubt much people are gonna like this game, secondly: the game just isn't functioning properly so most of the time your arm get's stuck in the table or floor and you can basically move your arm OUTSIDE of the room. That's some programming....Thirdly: The finger controls are clunky you can't even clench all fingers at once without creating a middle finger. And the fact that It takes half an hour to grab 1 cube of sugar :/.Fourthly: I can't stand the fact that your arm is basically so free that you might end up hitting something off the table thanks to the crappy camera angle.Fifthly: the fact that the game description says it's ""Surgeon Simulator inspired"" is a slap in the ♥♥♥♥ing face for the game. Maybe someday the game would improve then, but until that i wouldn't really recommend it unless your a diehard keyboard pro. Overall i'd give it a 3/10 it's playable in a way but it's just not really worth your time and money..			"

												Surgeon Simulator knock off with even worse controls and functionality.  Cups break too easy, the hand is poorly designed and doesn't grip well, the controls are aweful, you finally get your fingers around a cup's handle only for the fingers to clip through and the cup fall and break, the bit of whimsy that it has wears thin quickly, and the sum of it is that it's just not very fun apart from the chuckles you get from breaking your own arm or knocking stuff over.

												I perfected this game and I hate myself for it.Everything about this game is awful, the hand either moves to little or it jumps across the room, there isn't actually any real Tea, just far too much steam and blue spheres. The hand cant close all its fingers at once, only 3/4 at a time. The cups are near impossible to pick up and the teabags and cubes of sugar are also far to difficult to pick up.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with anger issues or those with a shaky hand. It is infuriating when all of a sudden the cup slips or randomly falls meaning you need to spend twenty minutes putting upright again.One positive about it is that, being English, this was an excellent test at how 'English' I am, I can now make cups of Tea in real life and in the poorly made virtual world, so any Englishmen who fancy a challenge might want to pick this up just to confirm your Tea making abilities.

												I remember youtubers playing this game allot. Now that I have played it I can say that this game is quite challenging at first, but once you get the basics you'll complete it in no time and you'll get bored. This has so much potential, unfortunatly there is too little content. Personally, I would only recommend it if you get this on a sale (while I am writing this it is currently on sale) so you can get the trading cards and sell them. That's it I suppose.			"

												Best Rage Inducing game I've ever played so far. I've come to a point where I have made the perfect cup of tea. I know how to serve it. The problem is, with my twitchy MOBA hand, I always tend to break my cup and make me rage. With the game being hard, this game has good replayability because when one gets so close to serving the perfect cup of tea and fail at serving it, it makes me want to do it all over again so that I can feel that I have accomplished something!

												Ok before I start my review, I just want to say congrats game developer. You got me. I tried to grab that damn red mug and everytime it would break. After like 7 tries i finally realised it was a troll cup, so congrats. *claps* (Also earned pretty much half of the achieves by just flipping the table)So, Ampu-Tea...You play as a man who has lost one of his arms which has been replaced by a finnicky prostetic. Sounds alright so far doesn't it? The guy wants a cup of tea. I can do that you think. That is until you realise... the game is on the verge of being unplayable and you rage instead. You break the guys robotic arm of and in turn makes you want to break yours off as well.11/10 would fall for the troll cup again.			"

Product received for free
												You can't describe how terrible this is, but I'll say this. If you have played Tea Party Simulator (ugh) , this is garbage in comparison. And that's saying a lot, considering how garbage Tea Party Simulator is. No real menu. Everything is selected/controlled with the f1-10 keys as you load up the one and only level. While turning your arm's wrist, you have a random chance of it spinning violently and breaking off, ruining any progress you may have otherwise had. This is a feature, not a bug.  Apparently that's fun. Otherwise its exactly like Tea Party Simulator, with worse graphics, even wonkier physics, and things getting stuck inside the table. (Including your hand) He has objects that are actually broken into pieces, and he stacks them together, so they look like a unbroken cup, but as soon as you brush against it or attempt interaction, it falls apart. This is not how breakable objects are supposed to work. The developer took 5 minutes of gameplay, and inflated it by making the game so broken, its nigh impossible to complete in a timely fashion, and even if you do, that's it. You're done. Its just one level. For 5 dollars. This game apparently considers ""various types of tea"" as one type of teabag, and then whether or not you add milk or sugar. That's it. Do not pay money for this.			"

Do you wish Surgeon Simulator's physics engine was ten times as glitchy? Do you wish that you automatically lost in Surgeon Simulator every time the physics engine glitched out? Do you wish Surgeon Simulator's mouse control was finicky and borderline-broken? Can you not bear to wait for Surgeon Simulator to go on sale for the same price that this game goes on sale for? Are you the sort of empty-headed idiot who thinks tea + England = hilarious comedy by itself? Well then what are you waiting for - mash that little ""buy now"" button to your idiot heart's content!

												To start with, I would like to say that this is not a bad game exactly. Really, the main problem is that there is not much to it. As of now, I have earned 100% of the achievements, and the absurd one for launching the game 500 times easily accounted for the bulk of the time involved. The one really good part is that it's my first perfect game. All that is left to do at this point as far as the game is concerned is to endlessly try my hand at making cups of tea in the tea cups using any combo of milk and sugar along with the teabags and hot water. There are no other levels, tasks, or challenges. You're only given the one set-up to work with, with various levels of difficulty only coming into play via the complexity of the cup of tea being requested.Like other games of the sort, every movement required to actually achieve a task is absolutely painstaking, which is where the fine line between fun and frustration comes into play. Unfortunately, the glitches within the game do make things weigh slightly in favor of frustration, as the arm has a habit of going through things and getting stuck, plus other issues, along with the other intended quirks common in games like this, where it refuses to truly grab things, instead often flipping, dropping, or even breaking them.Having gotten the game in a bundle, I certainly wouldn't complain, as there is definitely some amount of fun to be had here. Nor would I dismiss the possibility of getting future games from the creators in the future, especially if they do something a bit bigger in scope. Yet, still, for what it currently is I cannot recommend buying it, unless you find it in a bundle with other games you want.			"

In 15 minutes of play time I managed to get my arm wedged *inside* the table, before my hand fell off. The controls are horrid. To even compare Surgeon Sim to this is insulting. 0/5The audio is repetative and boring. 1/5The visuals are alright but this in no way makes up for the rest of the game.3/5I give this game a numerical score of a whopping 4/15.

												I saw that this was made by the same creators of Surgeon Simulator, one of my favorites on steam. I figured the hand mechanic would be similar if not the same. I was wrong. The controls are shortened so you don't have to use as many fingers however that seems to hinder mine and my friends abilities to open and close fingers maybe it us. One thing that is broken is hit detection. The fingers slip right through solid objects making it impossible to grab a miniscule tea cup.I bought this on sale and I'm disappointed. At the very least buy it on sale.			"

												I spent around 20 minutes to finish the game. It really isn't that hard. You just have to have patience and move very slowly. I can't really recommend this game when it's one level, and you can beat it within 20 minutes. Beating the game will also give you all acheivements except one.. play the game 500 times. I have no desire to replay the game at all. Even on sale this isn't worth your time unless you want the trading cards. The last achievement is playing the game 500 times. Since you can easily beat it in one sitting, this is an annoying grind if you want to get 100%.			"

												A buggy, frustrating and weird version of Surgeon Simulator 2013 where you make tea with a non-functional hand. Just when you think that you've mastered the game you'll run into a bug that ruins your cup of tea. Everything weights the same, so everything flies upon contact. Unconfortable controls makes it impossible to grab things since your hand is so slow that the thing you're trying to grab moves as you're grabbing. You can't play offline, even if you have the game installed on your PC, which is the reason to why we install most games. The help screen keeps popping up when you restart, which is annoying and the game feels unfinished, considering the fact that you can go outside the kitchen, there's no real menu or even credits/ending. On the bright side, it was a funny experience at first and the references are kinda funny since they describe the opposite of what you're actually doing. The concept is also funny (just not done right) and you can tableflip. You also get Steam cards, which you can sell and get the value of the game back. You can also troll your friends by letting them try and laugh as they rage.Pros: - Fun first time experience- Funny concept- You can tableflip- Cool references- Steam Cards- Good for trolling friendsCons:- Disgusting, uncustomisable controls- You can't launch the game without internet- Buggy hand that sometimes has its own will- Everything has the same weight- Slow and weak hand that never grips- Annoying help screen that shows up all the time- Feels unfinished2/10 - Worth 0.74€ I guess. If you like Surgeon Simulator 2013, Probably Archery etc, you'll like this game the first few minutes and then hate it forever.			"

												Let me ask you a simple question.  Have you ever considered relearning how to move?  If so, Ampu-Tea will be your cup of tea  **snickers**.  I found myself getting frustrated with games like Surgeon Sim in the past, but this one only seems to bring joy, even in failure.  I found myself tensing up over the smallest tasks while trying to not spill the perfect tea I had just finished preparing, only to end up doing something absurd, like sweeping my newly acquired prosthesis across the table to get something out of my way.  This game is hilarious and fun as all hell, because every time you fail, it is your own fault for not knowing the ins and outs of your fake hand.  The ironic ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" flags and mugs everywhere remind me of how hard I had to focus to perform such a simple task.  I like to pack my tea full of teabags and see how many sugar cubes I can pick up in a single handful.  Long story short, This simple and frustrating game is a blast, especially for the price!			"

												I think for the sale price of 74 cents, you really have no reason to be complaining about this game and its ""premise"" : the robot-arm isn't supposed to be easy to control, if it was then it wouldn't be a game.I have yet to make a successful cup of tea in about 45 minutes of playtime, but I got really close and I didn't feel all that ""enraged"" or frustrated during the entirety of my session.The game, at its current price, costs less than a snack or a drink at most vending machines -- people love to complain.

												Disappointed with this one. The controls don't feel like you are controlling a robotic arm, more like a broken drop claw game. Items are not coded correctly to be grab-able, instead fingers on arm clip through most everything and there isn't any ""grip"" to the hand. The objective is obviously to make tea, but there are items on the table that have an unclear function in the tea making process (black candy bits?). It has promise if the gameplay is fixed, mostly fixing the robotic arm to actually feel like a hand.

												This game is hilarious, frustrating, addicting, ridiculous, and infuriating all at the same time. Terrible controls (as to be expected), and lovely graphics. I don't think many people who reviewed this negatively really realise that the strong suit of the creators of this game (and surgeon simulator, I believe, though don't quote me on this), is pretty much making games that are unplayable, but you still want to beat them, BECAUSE they're so ""broken"". Like that cake-making simulator, or any game where you have to control a hand to do something. It's so stupidly difficult.I'm not gonna lie, I did rage quit this game like twenty times, but it was still enjoyable in that I'm-going-to-beat-this-impossible-game kind of way.People are taking this game too seriously >_> Buy it on sale, definitely. Or in a bundle. I didn't pay full price, so I'm not going to recommend it at that price.			"

												The name is kind of ... untasteful. However, the game itself, if you can hold yourself together for about the first 15 minutes to grasp the controls, is not so bad.Forget what you know about Surgeon Simulator. Amputea has a much quicker reflex, so you have to be extra gentle or your hand and arm will fly across the room. Also, you can break your hand off too...Once you get the hang of it, it's just as fun as Surgeon Simulator in my opinion. So if you like that game, chances are you'll like this too. Or, if you like that game, you might not like this one as it has similar yet different controls that is likely to throw some people within the first five minutes.I did finally manage to make tea and serve it, and also with cream and sugar - so it can be done.Rageaholics be warned......

												After minutes of sweet time making teas for my inviteas, I've succesfully put multiple ingredients in said cups, however, by a very sad turn of events, I've lost my hand, rendering me unable to take this cup to these poor inviteas, dying from their insanely gruesome thirst. Oh dear, what to do. I wonder. I'm such an old man I barely can reach for the cup of teas..God saves us, we might never get a cup of tea.10/10 inviteas all left me alone and now laughs of me and my terrible skills at tea making.

I think i might want to remove my left arm as it looks so cool who would of thought that having a fake arm would give you so much power! You can litraly make as many cups of tea as you want! As well as having a left arm as strong as an ox!  But honestly this game is being amazing. Its on a whole different planet. i think i might die from over dose on tea now i even drink more than posh josh and oscar rooney!But honestly i think i am AMPU-TEA CRAZY!!!!!!!  "

												This game is much better than the price makes it out to be. With the quality of a triple A game with the creativity and ingenuity of an indie game, this is definitely worth picking up. With a difficulty higher than that of Dark Souls and a Japanese bullet hell put together, it is definitely a cult classic. Make the wrong move and you lose your whole hand. The controls are responsive and definitly not janky at all.30/2 = 15			"

												I loved surgeon simulator so I had high hopes when I went to buy this game while it was only $4. It would be alright except for the fact that if something says ""No sugar"" or anything to that effect about skipping a step with your teamaking, the game has no way of detecting 0 so it remains stuck on that step and you can't move on. If it asks for 1 sugar and you put a cube of sugar in the cup before adding a teabag and water, then the game will not progress at the sugar stage. If you try to put it another sugar cube at that point though, it'll fial you for adding too much sugar. I successfully managed to make it to the milk stage and got no feedback on what ""a dash of milk"" was until the 8th glob of milk goes in and I lose because that's too much milk, even though globs 1-7 did nothing to trigger moving on to the next step.These bugs make the game almost impossible to complete unless you reset over and over until you get a mode that has you performing at least one of each item in order and somehow having it properly detect what you're doing.This game should be early access, not a full sale. To the devs in regards to their coding, ""It's time for rehabilitation!""			"

												What had seemed like an amusing and frustrating game quickly became a disappointment. Multiple times while grabbing or holding items, they would go through the solid portion of the robotic hand, or through other solid objects - attempting to grab tea cups that would then push through the back of the precariously positioned tea rack instead of knocking the rack over, bags of tea being in hand one moment and shooting up through the top of the hand the next, etc. At one point while playing, after 'pressing' the hot water button several times with no response, the water began to suddenly pop out (I would guess a 20 second or so lapse). I was tabbed out of the game in windowed mode while this was happening, and watched the hot water jug topple backwards. The hand was stationary well away from the table itself, panned out enough to see the table in its entirety while this was going on. All in all, the game could have some potential if it were polished and these errors were fixed. Unless those aren't errors and they are included purposely to make the game more 'challenging', in which case, that's poor judgment and a lack of creativity on part of the designers. Maybe if there's a patch I'd consider continuing to play, but as of now, I'd say I wasted my money and time.			"

												Clever name.  Gimmicky, yet buggy gameplay.  Not worth ANY money.  This is a very brief tech demo and nothing more.  Kudos to the devs for the thought, but this is not the type of thing pouple should be charged for.  After just a few moments, the only acheivement remaining is to launch the game 500 times.  Even exiting the game is a feature that appears to be left out of development.  If you find this ""game"" in a bundle, you can get a couple of achievements and some trading cards for a small fee... otherwise this isn't worth your time or money.Edit:Patch 1.1 finally added the ability to close the game.  This is the first game I have ever played that needed a patch for that feature.  It also added a few more achievements.  Instead of fixing where the arm gets stuck and ends the game, they added an achievement for it.  Still not worth any money as this is more of a demo than any semblance of a real game.			"

												Ampu Tea is inspired by Surgeon Simulator but with a diffrent premise but will you want to play it ? In Ampu Tea you play as an amputea and he has a robotic arm and you try to make a cup of tea. So how is this game ? Its quite bad honestly. Now its just like surgeon simulator so ill try to compare them as less as possible but its quite hard. The Game has an interesting premise and thats about it thats all the good i could tell about it. But theres a lot of bad. The game is tough to control. I know that the idea was to make a rage game. But when the controls dont work you know you did something wrong. The game is also quite buggy. The arm can get stuck in the table and it breaks randomly. There isnt a whole lot to say about this mess than just stay away as far as possible. Just get Surgeon Simulator which is a better game in general. Buggy broken game where the controls barely work. Only get it super cheap like in a bundle or other wise stay away. I give Ampu-Tea a 3/10			"

												Honestly? Possibly the worst game I've ever come across for Steam. Though thankfully I got it as part of a 10-game bundle so didn't pay the outrageous price Steam are asking.Many mugs were smahed, many tables were flipped, lets just say I'm not the best person to ask a Cup of Tea for, you'll just get it all over you from my clumsy amputated-robotic hand. Apart from all that, the upside is Trading-Cards and possibly the easiest game to get 100% achievements on.Up to you if to buy or not...Personally, I wouldn't. :')			"

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			"

Other than that I decided to wave at the table like a maniac and next thing I knew my hand went flying in to the air,all the way through the ceiling and then out of the world in to a black hole for an eternity of never seeing my arm,nor kitchen ever again,unable to make tea for the rest of my days.10/10 would wave like a maniac again			"

I can not recommend this game.-The starting screen makes it seem like the game doesn't work.-The table is invisible.-The physics should be a challenge but this is a bit too much. Honestly, it's really really bad. - The music is short and doesn't loop. Had most fun with simply breaking stuff and flipping the invisible table. :D			"

												It's a creative and interesting puzzle, but this should be pre-alpha (not in any way released to the public, let alone SOLD.)  Some tea mugs shatter at the slightest touch of a fingertip to the handle.  While taking time to make carefule adjustments, the wrist may suddenly begin spinning at high speed, turning the ""hand"" into something resembling a lawnmower blade.  The thumb may suddenly snap back on itself, collapsing against the back of the hand simply because you move the arm.  If you're going to provide your players with skill challenges, at least provide them with tools that can do it.  Don't reward the careful patience of your players by destroying their efforts with arbitrary flaws.			"

But, I may be wrong. Perhaps we’ll figure it out together and accomplish us some tea after all.Dear Wife:I know how you love drinking your tea so here’s a game where you can make your own tea, but with a robotic arm that can flip tables on command!

												This one gets a thumbs up for two reasons.Firstly, technical execution - totally adequate.  Plays well in 4K, nice graphics, nice music.Secondly, gameplay - the developers set out to do something different and they achieved that goal.  It's not a retro 2D pixel platformer, either.However - the entire premise of the game is to simulate an artificial hand being used to make a cup of tea.  Arguably this isn't much fun - if you don't enjoy those kinds of equipment simulators, this game isn't for you anyway.  But if it is, then the developers have delivered.			"

												You definitely shoudn't pay anything for this YouTube gamer-rage bait here. However after giving it a little bit of patience the game does turn out to be a little fun, a little fufilling if you can actually do it ... I ended up venturing so far off the grid I was a floating hand in a blue void. That all being said, a poorly programmed game does not necessarily mean a bad game, this is not so in Ampu-Tea's case for me.			"

												I saw this game on sale for a mere $0.74 and snatched it up quckly. I wasn't expecting much aside from a couple hours of silly entertainment. I thought it would just be another game like Octodad, or Goat Simulator....except with tea.Don't make the same mistake as me.Within a minute of playing, I wanted to chuck my mouse and keyboard across the room. The controls in this game are FRUSTRATING. Not silly frustrating like Octodad, but frustrating frustrating. Like playing QWOP while drunk. And blindfolded. On a tightrope. The only fun I had in this game was smashing everything off the table, which took about 10 seconds to do. This game is not so bad, it's good. This game is so bad, it's bad For anyone interested this game, I have a better alternative for you to try:Step 1. Go get wastedStep 2. Make tea.It'll be about 500x more fun than this game.  "

												To say this game game is difficult is like saying the earth is just another rock. This game goes far behind a difficultly controlled simulation where you make tea, who the hell ever thought making tea would be so stressful and infuriating at the same time. Once you get the controls, you would figure it gets easier from there, but it's very likely that your robot-hand will start jittering and fly off and you will fail the mission. Learning the controls are one thing, but mastering this game will definitely take some serious patience.The music is happy and full of energy, but about the time it starts getting difficult.. The music vanishes.. which makes it even more difficult seaming.. Buy this game if you're looking for one  of those simulation challenges.			"

												For 49 cents this game is amazing.(It was on sale, plus it was a gift from somepone else)It's also in beta which means we might be able to get some fun updates in future.If you are a tea loving derpling like I am you will adore this game.Hard, Awkward hand controls makes it all the more challanging in the good way.Find it funny when your friend drops thier drink on the ground?This game is that type of humour nonstop.Alone it's fun, but taking turns with friends or streaming...it's even better.If you expect the Skyrim of tea games you'll be dissapointed, if you expect a silly party game to play while waiting for Fallout4 or whatever to install then you'll have a lot of fun.Just don't ever mention coffee...it offends us tea pones.

												I want to like the game, but, the physics have just too much randomness in them.  I've played a decent amount of Sugeon Simulator, and while it's hard and easy to screw up, you're not left feeling like the game screwed up the result.  In this, physics will occationall glitch and break your hand, or an intersection of two items will cause unrealistic force and shatter everything.Concept is excellent and hillarious, execution is just a couple steps short of what's needed.

												Ampu-Tea is a game for robot nerds, or tea nerds, or maybe just for nerds in general.This is a game for people with some patience. If you want an exciting shoot-'em-up gaming experience, then Ampu-Tea is not for you - walk away now! That's right, get out of here, non-nerd, and don't come back!Now that the neanderthal troglodytes have gone, let's get back to the review.The aim of the game is to make a nice mug of tea, using a robotic arm.There are a number of different instructions given to you, in order to make several mugs of tea.However, the basic tasks are to get a mug off a shelf and then add a tea bag, some sugar, and boiling water - and then serve on a tray (there are several variations of these tasks).To start the game, push ""F1"" for English (assuming that is the language you want, of course) - I mention that because I have had the start screen come up looking blurred once, and couldn't read the instruction in the top left corner to press F1.Press ""H"" to show or hide the help screen - very useful for learning the controls.Don't be surprised if you knock the entire shelf of mugs off the table - I was knocking everything over before I got used to how the robotic arm worked.Try to manoeuvre the mug into place in front of the tea-maker, before adding any tea or sugar, as it is easier to do everything with the mug already in place.Picking up the sugar cubes can be a real pain. Be prepared to drop them many times.Hint: Put the tray in its place first (in front of the tea-maker), so you can serve the tea on it later (otherwise you can make your mug of tea and then spill it when trying to put it onto a tray).The controls can take a bit of getting used to, but then it's much easier after that.A good experience for children who might have a talent for robotics.This game is for nerds only - it is recommended on that basis.

 THE GAME Ampu-Tea OVERIEW OF THE REVIEW Another 'simulator' game trying to riding the coat tails of Surgeon Simulator. This game is tea-dious, frustra-tea-ing, and lacks quali-tea. WHAT IT'S ABOUT Ampu-Tea is a Surgeon Simulator inspired game where you are an amputee fitted with a robotic arm and are tasked with making a cup of tea. In the style of SS, you control your robo-hand to attempt assembling different kinds of teas with the mouse and keyboard. The silly control style provides a challenge to this otherwise simple task and it will test your patience and eventually lead to some chaos. MY EXPERIENCE PLAYING THIS GAME Honestly, this game was a disappointment, and I wasn't even expecting anything from it. My experience playing this game was mostly frustration, thanks to the awful controls and mechanics.There is no grip to pick up anything, so I had to rely on pushing things across the table with the hand and trying to balance cup handles around the fingers. Speaking of the fingers, grabbing with them is incredibly slow and insensitive, along with the hand rotation. It took me half an hour of messing around just to make one cup of tea because of how fragile the mugs are, how easy it is to knock the shelf off the table, the painful journey of moving the cup from each station, and how easy it is to break the arm itself.There is little variety in what types of drinks you can make, and no story or real motivation to make them except for a sticky note. The game description mentions being the son of an Earl, but I found no connection to that in the game. The achievements are (despite the shocking controls) fairly easy to get, minus the one for opening the game 500 times which I did not have the patience for. There are trading cards, but I uninstalled the game before I had enough game time to collect them.The only highlight I managed to draw from this game was being able to flip the table in rage. That's about it. I wish I had more to say. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION In short, Ampu-Tea relies on the 'joke game' factor and being a silly game for YouTubers to play. There are no outstanding features in this game besides being pointlessly difficult and having more 'Keep Calm's and 'EPIC FAIL's than is socially acceptable. It is not worth the $4.99 price tag, but if you really want to play it, wait for it to hit 90% off  on a sale at $0.49. I personally did not enjoy this game and I would not recommend it.			"

												Ampu-Tea isn\'t worth it\'s asking price, but it\'s one of those games that you can find for ridiculously cheap. I can\'t remember how much I even paid for it but I certainly didn\'t pay more that 40p I assume. Some games however aren\'t even worth the time you spend playing them. Is that true for Ampu-Tea? I wouldn\'t say so. The game is an arm simulator much like surgeon simulator but very bare bones in which the objective of the game is to make a cup of tea using the janky controlled, robotic arm you have. Being British this seemed like it wouldn\'t be much of a challenge. I was wrong. This is the only game mode but I can\'t say I was begging for more once I\'d beat it as the game plays pretty boringly and I wouldn\'t recommend it if it wasn\'t for it\'s short length and mentionable humour. The game pokes at British stereotypes fairly well and the concept is a laugh overall. It only took me 2 hours to beat this game completely and doing little things like flipping the table and watching the destruction ensue was fun and once I was done I didn\'t feel like my time was wasted. Overall it\'s nothing special, but like I say you can probably find this game in a bundle or for ridiculously cheap and it\'s no time waster. A fun game to play in those moments where you can\'t be bothered for a mass scale adventure so you just make a cup of tea instead. However achievement hunters be warned this game has one of \""those\"" achievements to boot the game so many times. There are some workarounds but as an achievement collector myself I found this really annoying.			"

												I'm not gonna do my usual ""PROS vs CONS"" review. This game is pretty much just Surgeon Simulator, sans the surgery. Surgeon Simulator has good controls, not hard to learn at all. And, if you don't like those keys, you can edit them. In Ampu-Tea, nope. Just confusing controls. Once you FINALLY get used to the controls, the game itself is unbelievably hard. Surgeon Simulator was hard, but nowhere NEAR this. The fingers react too slow, and it's IMPOSSIBLE to not knock anything down. It took me more than 1 hour to finally beat it once. I only play it now when I'm a) bored or b) waiting for download to finish. Surgeon Simulator was one of my favorite indie games, and so I thought this game would be super fun! I traded with someone to get this and another game for a TF2 key, because this game and the other was one sale. I started it up. The ear-r*pe at the beginning ALWAYS scares the living crap out of me, and after a long loading time, you get into the impossible. If you are a calm, peaceful person, I guess you should get it, but only if it's on sale. Do not, I repeat, NOT get this for the full 5 dollars. I guess I'll add my final rating like usual.Final rating: 4/10			"

												IF YOU HAVE OCD, BEWARE AS THIS GAME MIGHT BE HARD TO PUT DOWN!!There are most likely 2 outcomes to this game. Either picking it up and not putting it down umtil your done completing it or ragequit after you drop your cup of tea because your robotic arm falls off. Ampu-Tea has some optimization issues, and is insanely difficult even on the Easy modes. But the concept of the game is amazing and is great for a good laugh. I would advise picking this title up through a game bundle deal.Rating: 6.5/10			"

												Game Type: CasualLongivity: Very ShortDifficulty: HighScore: 3/10This ""game"" is more like a little physic engine where you control a floppy hand trying to make tea orders by following the instructions given to you and... thats pretty much all of it. It is indeed funny at first to try to make things correctly and to just finish by bashing everything around and flipping over the table, but this game is definetly not something worth buying at any prices. Hell i had a lot more fun with free flash games on ill-concieved web page that i had with this.			"

												Ampu-Tea is hard to control at first, and then extremely satisfying to figure out. I do hope they continue to update the game, as some sort of level progression could keep it interesting, and it desperately lacks a ""done notification"" once you serve the tea. However, It is very entertaining and worth buying... especially on sale.			"

												I want Valve to stop making these schoolboys think they can produce something useful using ""How to build a game on Unity"" tutorial and cheap assets. To write a decent indie game you have to be Notch. But Notch is an experienced programmer with a wide background. This game is on Steam for almost 1 year already. If you check the environment, it's blurred out to hide the fact that's the texture mapping is absolutely horrible. You have 1 square meter of space and still can't model it properly? Jesus Christ. If you move your hand for a dozen of seconds, you'll eventually leave the skybox! OMG, this guy doesn't even know you should lock your skybox at camera position. Not to mention the physics which is retard slow. Valve really should ban any ""indie"" developer who doesn't have at least 1 year work experience. Soon we'll literally have tutorial examples selling for the full price.			"

												This game is ok for people who have no clue what surgeon sim is. There are many pros, though there are more cons. Here they are:Pros:-Cheap Surgeon sim.-If you don't like it, you can get your money back with it's trading cards.-Constantly getting more achievements.-Funny to watch other people suck at it.Cons:-HORRIBLE INTERFACE-HORRIBLE CONTROLS-Hand Takes FOREVER to close-only uses 4 keys to close fingers-LOUD INTRO- Don't wear headphones-Buggy-RageyHere are some tips for people who suck:-Break arm on table to earn half of the achievements.-Go for one single mug, every attempt.-Frustrated?About to RAGE? take breaks.-Made tea, though still haven't said you did? You could have done the order wrong. Look at the order in top left corner.So in a nutshell, Only buy this game if it came in a bundle, or you will want to burn your computer.Happy RagingHave Fun (probably not)Goodbye!

												Since it was on sale for 59p, I thought I would try the game. It really does test your patience but thats due to the laggy controls rather than the task that is set..which is to make a cup of tea. I did have bigger hopes for this game especially at the original price being £3.99 but the sad reality is, is that it is in need of improvement and I don't think the game is worth it. Since I doubt I will ever play the game again. The achievements are pretty easy except for the last one which is to play the game 500 times and thats achieved by opening and closing the game not exactly how many times you attempt to make a cup of tea. If the controls wasn't so out of control then maybe I would give it anything go but at the moment, this game is defienetly not my cup of tea..take my advice and save your money and if you really want to try the game out for yourself, perchase it in a sale.

												A lazily made Unity game that is all about the comedic effect of the game title and the absurdity of the gameplay. The challenge of the game is ""how to master frustratingly bad controls"". It is one thing to make a game with bad crontrols but this is in fact a game -about- bad controls. Some may have the patience to master it, but I certainly didn't.			"

												A lot of people have given this game a bad review because of how broken this game is. This game is meant to be broken. Kieeping that in mind, I love this game. Good time waster to get me mad and laugh. When you make that tea... Oh god dancing around your desk (I hope you keep your computer on a desk) is halarious. I spent quite some time trying to make just one cup of tea then doing so I spilt my own tea on my lap, screamed out in pain and daced around. My girlfriend was so confused what I had acomplished, grabbed me by the shoulders shaking me screaming ""You did not just do anything you should not have on the computer!?"" I just looked and smiled and said I just made tea. I never seen someone look at me so oddly. This is not CoD or CS:GO this is Ampu-tea. Struggle with horrible controls, and horrible physics of the game. It is funny as can be. Play it!			"

												Every tried one of those claw grabber games they have in crappy arcades and on beach fronts? Imagine trying to make tea like that. No but seriously not worth the time or money. It's siilarly controlled to surgery simulator except that the hand has no grip whatsoever and has a hard time responding to what you are doing properly. I know it's supposed to be difficult to control that's the point, but it shouldn't be this bad. Every single time you try to pick up somethign you're more than lkley going to have the object phase out of your hand entirely.			"

												Ampu-Tea is a game for robot nerds, or tea nerds, or maybe just for nerds in general.This is a game for people with some patience. If you want an exciting shoot-'em-up gaming experience, then Ampu-Tea is not for you - walk away now! That's right, get out of here, non-nerd, and don't come back!Now that the neanderthal troglodytes have gone, let's get back to the review.The aim of the game is to make a nice mug of tea, using a robotic arm.There are a number of different instructions given to you, in order to make several mugs of tea.However, the basic tasks are to get a mug off a shelf and then add a tea bag, some sugar, and boiling water - and then serve on a tray (there are several variations of these tasks).To start the game, push ""F1"" for English (assuming that is the language you want, of course) - I mention that because I have had the start screen come up looking blurred once, and couldn't read the instruction in the top left corner to press F1.Press ""H"" to show or hide the help screen - very useful for learning the controls.Don't be surprised if you knock the entire shelf of mugs off the table - I was knocking everything over before I got used to how the robotic arm worked.Try to manoeuvre the mug into place in front of the tea-maker, before adding any tea or sugar, as it is easier to do everything with the mug already in place.Picking up the sugar cubes can be a real pain. Be prepared to drop them many times.Hint: Put the tray in its place first (in front of the tea-maker), so you can serve the tea on it later (otherwise you can make your mug of tea and then spill it when trying to put it onto a tray).The controls can take a bit of getting used to, but then it's much easier after that.A good experience for children who might have a talent for robotics.This game is for nerds only - it is recommended on that basis.

												I saw this game on sale for a mere $0.74 and snatched it up quckly. I wasn't expecting much aside from a couple hours of silly entertainment. I thought it would just be another game like Octodad, or Goat Simulator....except with tea.Don't make the same mistake as me.Within a minute of playing, I wanted to chuck my mouse and keyboard across the room. The controls in this game are FRUSTRATING. Not silly frustrating like Octodad, but frustrating frustrating. Like playing QWOP while drunk. And blindfolded. On a tightrope. The only fun I had in this game was smashing everything off the table, which took about 10 seconds to do. This game is not so bad, it's good. This game is so bad, it's bad For anyone interested this game, I have a better alternative for you to try:Step 1. Go get wastedStep 2. Make tea.It'll be about 500x more fun than this game.  "

												I was very excited for this game when I first saw it and bought it mostly out of novalty reasons, but I always have issues with loading the game. Although the game is cute, I personally dont think it is worth the annoying struggle to play it. With that said, this could be an issue I alone am having, but have had since I got the game. If you have a newer computer purhaps or love the idea of the game and would like to put up with loading issues Id say go for it. Personally I'm not too happy about this game's loading screen issues OR my laptops lack of ability to load the game (when it had 0 issues with most of the 300+ games I own).			"

This game goes far behind a difficultly controlled simulation where you make tea, who the hell ever thought making tea would be so stressful and infuriating at the same time. Once you get the controls, you would figure it gets easier from there, but it's very likely that your robot-hand will start jittering and fly off and you will fail the mission. Learning the controls are one thing, but mastering this game will definitely take some serious patience.The music is happy and full of energy, but about the time it starts getting difficult..

Anyway, here goes it;The controls are horrible, the physics are broken, the water is marbles, the mugs just fall of all the time, picking anything up is impossible. But I still love it xD Wouldn't reccomend it though. I only played it because it made for an interesting Video Look here on my channel if you wanna see what it looks like.

												The game is based on a neat idea, and goodness gracious I *LOVE* bad puns, but it starts to suck badly pretty quick.I'm gonna make a wild guess and say the controls are supposed to be wonky to add to the ""humour"", but they could really use some polishing. I honestly see no reason for not including elbow controls.I get that the in-game physics are supposed to be ""funny"", but it's just plain annoying that you just need to *touch* the damn shelf to make it fall.  Also, camera's weird angles and their very limited number is very, very annoying and really gets in the way of smooth gameplay. It's very hard to deduce the grip angle, and not in a fun and challenging way, but in a tableflipping way.Music is pretty nice, but could use a bit more variation, and so could the tea ""menu"" (ingredients).The robotic arm breaks WAY too easily.Conclusion: the game started to cause more frustration than fun very quickly, but if you're an achievement hunter, it's okay. I guess. Still, would not really recommend buying. "

												This youtube-fodder rage game is a waste of time and software. I already have a dislike for youtube-fodder games (Goat Simulator anyone) and I only got because it was 50p on a sale and it looked like I might get a bit of a laugh out of it. No, this game is not funny, it's a chore to play. I know that was the purpose, but a game purposely being a chore to play isn't clever, nor is it funny, it makes the game A CHORE TO PLAY. The only chortle it gave me was flipping a table, and that's because...I flipped a table.Don't buy it, not even if you want a silly video on your youtube/twitch account. It's not worth it. Go buy something that can actually make you laugh and is actually funny, if a bit silly instead: such as Turbo Dismount, Postal 2 or even the Monkey Island games. Give your money to good games (well, you can have your own opinion on Postal 2) and leave this piece of (insert word here) alone!			"

I don't know why this game has negative reviews, apart from two reasons:.The ""Obsessive Tea Drinker"" achievement (which requires you to play the game 500 times).The game makes you rageI had fun with my time on Ampu-Tea, it's a great game - and no, it's not a rip off of Surgeon Sim, it's in a way deep down, better. I enjoyed the rage of being one step closer to earning that good ol' achievement where you have to make a 'cuppa'. I had fun in and out of every aspect of this game, it sure was challenging - even on the easy difficulty, but that adds to the fun! So what if there is a few minor bugs? Kudos to DjArcas & Kiss Ltd for making sure there was no major bugs, anyway. I recommend you get Ampu-Tea to everybody, for it is a great game, and a challenging one too. I enjoyed collecting all the achievements etc, and I think you will too. Overall: 9/10.			"

												A lazily made Unity game that is all about the comedic effect of the game title and the absurdity of the gameplay. The challenge of the game is ""how to master frustratingly bad controls"". It is one thing to make a game with bad crontrols but this is in fact a game -about- bad controls. Some may have the patience to master it, but I certainly didn't.			"

The task sounds quite simple but it's extremely hard; I only ended up flipping (off) the table. There are a lot of negative reviews about this. Sure there are no other levels unlike Surgeon Simulator but it can be a fun experience. Even better, let someone else play while you watch them rage!Is this game worth €4,99? No it's not. You can get a better game for that amount of money.Buy this when it's in sale or in a bundle.			"
