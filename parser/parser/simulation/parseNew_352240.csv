												The inevitable comparisons between The Westport Independent and Papers, Please are kind of unavoidable. With its lo-fi visual style, themes of an oppressive totalitarian government and it's simple drag-and-drop mechanics it shares a lot of similarities with Lucas Pope's 2013 indie hit. (And is almost a carbon copy of Pope's earlier gamejam game - The Republia Times.) But where it differs is in its ability (or lack there of) to engage with the player and create feelings of empathy for the game's characters through its mundane, paper pushing actions.

			Become a Killer Bits Patron - http://www.patreon.com/thekillerbits Stop the presses as today we have a new editor in chief, as the Killer Bits take over editorial control of The Westport Independent...		

At it's heart The Westport Independent is a management sim. You are the editor-in-chief of one of the last remaining independent newspapers in Westport and its your job to get the truth out to the public. Unfortunately the new Loyalist government has other ideas and its new Public Culture Bill is crushing free speech and freedom of the press throughout the country. You must tread that fine line between reporting the news accurately and not raising the suspicions of government too much.You do this by picking out which stories you think you can get past the unblinking eye of Big Brother, changing the headlines and censoring certain sections of the story as necessary. You assign these articles to your reporters who all have their own political allegiancies and levels of suspicion from the government. And all this whilst trying to maintain the papers popularity.But whereas Papers, Please had you really caring for your little immigration inspector, his family and even the people passing through his booth in The Westport Independent I felt nothing for the editor, the reporters or even if the paper [inevitably] got shutdown. What's more there is no urgency to the game. In Papers, Please you had that ticking clock adding to the stress of processing people quickly & accurately but also the need to fill your quota for the day so you could actually feed your family. In Westport you do have a countdown to when the Culture Bill passes in 12 weeks time but whilst you are sat at you desk no time passes what so ever.It's a real shame as I had high hopes for the game, as I thought the idea of trying to maintain an honest news organisation under the heel of an oppressive government is a fantastic concept. Unfortunately the execution just feels a little lacklustre.			"

												I would like you to note my playtime...I had high hopes for this game but sadly it fell short. I started with a full Loyalist playthrough and it was dead easy. I had my more rebel leaning journalist write about celebrity gossip and my loyalist leaning journalists write about the glorious actions of our beloved government (Heavily censored of course) so that they would always feel safe and be happy. I quickly gained big favour with the Loyalists, turned all four districts to full loyalist support and won the game. On my second playthrough I decided to, no matter what, go full rebel! ...The Loyalists arrested Frank on turn four. I think he was the one that was a rebel, here you see how much the game had me care about the employees. I don't know who is who...). The Loyalists then shut me down at turn six. I can see that the challenge of the game is to run a rebellious newspaper without getting shut down and hopefully see the Rebels overthrow the Loyalists in the end of the game but frankly I can't be bothered to try, not now anyway. When playing as a loyalist there is really nothing that counts against you since there is no risk that rebels attack your offices.Many people have compared this game to Papers Please, and I can see why as they are set I very similar environments, and with similar gameplay elements, like the big bad government and resistance movements. But in Papers Please, going for either one brought different challenges and different rewards. I would like to point to my previous paragraph and once again point out that the rebels are no threat to you in this game.Is this game worth its price? Absolutely not! The game is maximum twelve turns and i've seen people finish it in around 40 minutes. For me it took an hour. If you want to test it out I suggest that you buy it on the appstore instead where the price is around half of Steams price. Some things change, such as which articles appear on which turn but on my second playthrough I didn't really see any new articles that I didn't get in my previous playtrough. Between turns there is a cutscene where your journalists discuss the current state of the country somewhat based on the articles you decide to print but how the discuss them don't really change depending on what you censor and to which side you lean.It's a good concept but it doesn't feel finished or fleshed out and for that I can't recommend it as of now.

												Look at the time i spent playing this game. Yup, that is a single playthrough. 12 turns, that is all.Replay value seems minor as there are hard repurcussions for extremes, so there is no Papers Please-esque payoff to certain actions. That said, this game has a lot of potential, and if the gameplay lasted for longer than 12 weeks (turns) i would be able to recommend this game. As it is now, however, why would i pay 10 euro for a game that entertains me for a shorter time than most Youtube content?			"

												Sadly I cannot recommend. The demo had 7 weeks, and this only has 5 more. I thought this game was going to be significatly longer, and may have some business management to it. Sadly that it not so. This somehow felt like it was just about to get to the climax when it ended, which utimately was a let down. The art style however, is beautiful, and the work on lore and background is great.*Edit 1*Hm, that's odd, the top reviews on the page have suddenly shifted.. the first displayed ones are now positive with the reviews being rated less helpful then others farther down the list.There's also a sudden surge of positive reviews. Odd.			"

												The Westport Independent is a worthy sibling to its spiritual brother Papers, Please. Though in tone and graphics, they're very similar (and that's to The Westport's Independent's benefit - it looks nice), the games are very different. The gameplay is slower and more considered, being turn-based with no time limits. Personally, I have a preference for the chance to read articles that might never go to press, and figure out your own view of what's best for the world - only to change that view as new information emerges.The playtime is short for a single round, but I reckon there's good replayability here - in particular, turning the entire city to rebellion requires very careful selection of stories to appeal to particular regions, balancing pro- and anti-Government stories to balance your reputation, and safe guarding your staff. A perfect run would be tricky - that's where the longer playtime comes from.I'd thoroughly recommend it - it tells an interesting story, it's well-written, it's got deceptive strategic depth, and I'd be keen to play it again.

												I am going to mark this as a recommendation, not because I wholeheartedly recommend this game but because Steam's review section is so limited. I would say, pick this up on a sale.TLDR; If you liked Paper's Please you'll like this but be warned it's MUCH shorter and also more limited.I actually really did quite enjoy this, and I would disagree with some of the reviews around that say it doesn't provoke empathy as Papers Please did. No, it doesn't to the same degree, cos there is a smaller cast of characters; it's just you in your office with your writers after all.But it does match PP in that it still has that oppressive atmosphere that has you want to achieve a greater task against a bigger power holding you down, and the stories give the world a sense of place, with many running stories across each week.You will see through the eyes of this editor the many totalitarian practices the government is enforcing on its citizens, as well as the rebel's acts of terrorism (I do feel the story aspects are much more one sided on being anti government admittedly), and it is down to you to try and get the truth out without endangering yourself, your staff or your business. It feels like a reverse Ministry of Truth from 1984.If you're a fan of Papers Please there's a lot to like here thematically, so why is there no unreserved recommendation?The major concern is that this is a much more limited game than PP.First, it doesn't have the same gameplay; PP was like a puzzle game that required you to not only be accurate but quick for best results. This is just you making a choice - which articles to run, which sections in it to censor, which writer do you give it, where do the articles go in the paper in terms of priority, and to who do we market the paper to?This last variable however seems completely useless as far as I can tell, I'm not quite sure how your sales affect your playing experience frankly.Occasionally, you will get menacing messages across your desk from government/rebel forces warning you of your actions, but as far as I can tell, as long as you don't max out your suspicion meter you're fine - don't seem to be any instant failure states like PP did.It took me an hour to finish one run, and from what I can see endings aren't as varied as PP either; it's more a slide show of variables that are affected in binary ways, a la Fallout 3's ending.If you can get it really cheap it's worth a look, it's not a bad game but it is quite limited6/10			"

												Unfortunately, I can not recommend this game, even though I was hoping it'd be good. As many others have mentioned, it seems quite similar to ""Papers,please"" (a game I really liked a lot), and I think that's due to - the old school graphics which look pretty much like a C64 game. However, it doesn't matter much, as Papers, Please proved (even though I think it should be obvious) that a game doesn't need triple A graphics and can be fun even when it looks very outdated, as long as the GAME is good!- The theme... the story is set in a region/country with a quite oppressive government, and you have to play along with the rules or suffer harsh consequences- The fact that you have to decide a lot whether you DO play by the rules, or try to be rebellious.And I think the game COULD have been fun. However... please take a look at the amount of time I played. That's one and  a quarter playthrough...Yes.Uh huh, I am serious. I finished the game in what, 33 or 38 minutes? I can't for the life of me understand why there are only 12 ""rounds"". 12 weeks where you put together a newspaper with 4 articles once per week.You have different authors, some more in line with the regime, others rather rebellious. You decide whether you print news about politics and spin them to make the government look nice and caring, or try to tell people the truth.For my first playthrough, I tried to satisfy the government just to see how that'd go. And I finished the game after less than 40 minutes. SO I figured, ""Ok"", maybe this is supposed to be played several times with different decisions.However, the replayability suffers because everything stays pretty much the same...your editors, their cutscenes in between weeks (even though they do refer sometimes to decisions you made, many of them stayed the same the second time I played), the headlines/stories.If they at least had put in randomly generated editors, so you'd have SOME variety when starting over. If they had put a pool of possible stories. I saw the exact same ones in my second game, so even though the game is short, I totally lost interest in replaying during, I think, week 4 of game 2. I had tried to ""rebel"" against the government this time, but with THAT much repetition, it felt dull.I think this game COULD have been cool had they put in more randomly generated stuff. More variety. An increasing difficulty (like Papers please, where each day, a new thing to watch out for would be added or changed). More ""time"". Why only 12 rounds? This feels like a demo for a much bigger game, but sadly, that's all there is.Even on sale, I don't think the game offers enough for about 5 EUR, not when there are games with more content and depth for like 99 cents. This had the potential to be good or at least decent, but now its a demo-sized game that feels as if the devs started with a great idea and then either lost interest, ran out of ideas or had to meet a deadline and finished the game in a rather basic shape.Too bad, I would have enjoyed a Papers,please type game with different story and mechanics (newspapers instead of a customs officer), but this is just too little content, gameplay and mechanics. Try it if it's on sale for a buck or two, but I don't think this is worth 5-10 EUR.			"

												A difficult recommendation.The Westport Incident tries to hit the same trigger ""Papers, Please"" did and show how difficult it is to operate within a repressive dictatorship. You are taking the role of a newspaper editor who has to basically choose between being a government mouthpiece, and keeping the paper running while being complicit in the government repression; or reporting the news in a more truthful manner, but by doing so putting not just the paper, but also your employees at risk.Gameplay consists of choosing which articles to put in the paper, how to present them, and who to write the article. For example you may get an article about a bombing. Articles can be roughly separated in two categories: politics and fluff.Fluff is without risk, but doesn't do much for your paper's popularity.Politics is where the risk is.If you are fully loyal throughout it's easy to complete the game, although you do end up supporting a totalitarian regime.If you decide to be disloyal (and report the truth), you will run into several problems. The most clear one is that if you become too disloyal to the government before time runs out, the paper is closed and the game ends. But even if you try to balance this somewhat by occasionally reporting something with a government slant or publishing fluff instead, you may still risk your employees as they all have their own suspicion meter. Allow this to go too high and they are arrested and you will have one fewer article you can print each week.Increasing the difficulty further is that your employees have different political leanings, a Loyalist supporter will not be happy to write against his government, for example.The various loyalties and suspicion rates make the game pretty difficult to balance. There are several possible endings, and it will require multiple playthroughs to unlock them all.While I like the concept a lot, I have a few issues with this game and they hold it back from being a new classic like its obvious inspiration Papers, Please.First off, the various mechanics are not really explained. Unless you read this or other reviews, your first playthrough you will likely have no idea about the different employees' suspicion meters, and their arrest will come at a complete surprise. The game has a too brief tutorial and it doesn't tell you about this at all. It is also not clear exactly how the advertisement works, and if this even matters. Each district has two subjects it cares about, but does that mean you are wasting advertisement points by still placing adverts in a district if your paper doesn't include a subject they like? The game doesn't tell you this.Second, the presentation. There is no voice acting outside of the intro, there is very little animation, and the game simply does not look that impressive. You will be spending most of your time on the same screen just sliding things around with no variation.For $/€ 10 as it currently priced on Steam I expect more from a game, but at a discount price I can recommend it.Pick it up if you like Papers, Please, or the idea of working as a newspaper censor in a totalitarion society.

												As it describes itself, The Westport Independent is a “censorship simulator” in which you take the role of an newspaper editor who must decide whose version of the truth your newspaper will print.  However, The Westport Independent never emerges from the shadow that Papers Please seems to cast over it.   StorySet in the fictional town of Westport, The Westport Independent sets you as the editor of one of the last few independent newspapers in town.  The town is torn between two factions, the fascist government known as the Loyalist party and the unnamed “Rebels”.  As the story begins you are informed of the new “Public Culture Bill” which in 12 weeks will cause your independent newspaper to shut down and be handed over to the government.  As the editor it is your job to assign stories to your four writers, censor whatever stories come in and decide what side of the truth to tell.  Each week is interceded by a table discussion between your writers about what is going on in their lives and in Westport in general.Gameplay and ThoughtsThe gameplay is very interesting and screams Papers, Please.  The gameplay falls into 2 basic stages.  Reading, censoring and assigning articles for your writers and marketing.  At the start of each week (one turn in this game of twelve turns) about six articles come across your desk.  Your job is to read through them and decide whether to give each article a pro or anti government bias or even to run it at all.  Running certain articles will affect the opinion of the city and can swing them from complacency to rebellion in a matter of weeks.  However, running an anti-government newspaper will attract the attention of the Loyalist Party which will threaten your newspaper and may even kidnap some of your writers.  The second portion of the gameplay is after you select what articles to publish.  You take these articles and physically arrange what page they go on in the paper.  Then you drag sliders to target certain districts and areas within the city.  In total, each week takes about 5 minutes tops.  For a twelve week long game, this amounts to each game taking 45 minutes to an hour to complete.  However, there is little replay value after doing one playthrough as a Loyalist Newspaper and one playthrough as a Rebel Newspaper.  There is also a weird discrepancy between the two.  A loyalist newspaper is very easy to do, no problems from anybody but also no notice from any of the Loyalist party.  None of the writers will leave if you make them write Loyalist articles. This does not ring true for the other side of the coin.  Playing as a Rebel newspaper is fraught with dealing with the Loyalists and having your writers kidnapped and your writers straight up quitting.  Though the bump in difficulty is a welcome challenge, it stands in a stark contrast to the absolute stroll that is having a Loyalist newspaper.  All in all, the gameplay is short but entertaining.  However, it feels like the successor to “Papers Please” (Though it is not made by the same people, there are too many similarities, whether they are intentional or not , to not draw comparisons) without capturing the essence of what made Papers Please successful.  The lack of human interaction and missing the effect of your newspaper that really makes the game feel like its missing the soul and character that Papers Please was able to capture.  This coupled with the extremely short length left a sour taste in my mouth as the credits rolled.  Graphics and SoundThe graphics are not intensive at all, with pixelated text being 99.9% of the game, running this game would take only the most basic of graphics cards.  The settings really only account for changing the resolution which in my opinion is just fine as no fine tuning should be needed as there is little movement or effects on the screen.  The soundtrack is nice, consisting of one single repeating song that sinks silently into your subconscious.  Sounding like something straight out of Casablanca, this song quietly hums in the background and helps set a nice tone for the game.  ConclusionI have very mixed feelings about The Westport Incident.  On one hand it is a good game.  It presents a good, thoughtful message.  It really lets you see that the city of Westport is tearing itself apart and lets you step into tip the scales in one groups favor.  The Westport Incident brings interesting and unique mechanics to the table that are really only ever seen in Papers Please.  However, in this case, it seems the bad outweighs the good.  Though the game tries to come off as very deep and thought provoking, it provides no real moral dilemma or anything where you can’t simply game the system to get everything you want.  I honestly felt no emotional connection to the writers and didn’t care about them besides the fact that it would mean I could only write 3 articles a week rather than 4.  The publishing and marketing section of the game is very weak as the order you put the articles in doesn't really seem to matter and the areas you target are easy to master and take very little skill at all.  After my 35 minute playthrough, The Westport Incident tried to get me to care about the city through a five minute long, unskippable, all text end credit sequence which told me about everything in the city.  I feel as though this was not very effective and it did not make me care as it was already too late.  Unfortunately, the biggest problem with the game is its length.  It took me an hour and a half minutes to beat the game twice on my first two playthroughs.  Had you been making a newspaper daily for 12 weeks rather than weekly (resulting in 84 turns rather than 12), I feel as though the game would have been much more interesting and definitely much more worth it.  Though The Westport Independent has touched on interesting ideas and mechanics, it fails to capture the character and spirit of Papers Please which it is inevitably compared to.  However, even without this comparison, The Westport Independent is too short to really leave an impression on the player.  Final Rating:5/10; What could have been a great game is stifled due to length, lack of emotion and a lack of challenge.			"

												It's a good concept, but after playing for less than an hour I had already finished the game. I do not think this game is currently worth the price, however, if you're looking to pick this game up, I strongly reccomend waiting until the price lowers, or if there's a sale. One hour of gameplay coupled with very little to do isn't worth the price.			"

												I have just completed my first playthrough of the Westport Independent. I stayed loyal to the government, always painting the rebels as the bad guys and making sure every district adored the Loyalists. My extreme devotion cost me an employee, Frank, but I weakened the rebels' movement and remained a popular newspaper.While the game is a bit shorter than I would have liked, I still loved this experience. I loved imagining how the people reacted to the articles, how this dystopia changed. I see a lot of replay value in this, to see how the other extreme and min-maxing would work out.If anything, my main gripe with the game is a minor one; the achievement don't have a description after I unlock them. Minor but annoying.If you enjoyed Papers, Please or want to see how government censorship can work out in a dark world, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I wished I'd read the reviews before purchasing this on impulse. The Westport Independent is ibviously ""Papers Please"" inspired, but without the fun, charm, and excitement. I played through it in an hour and had no desire to replay it (according to other reviews there's little difference in subsequent replays, anyways).In terms of story, the bogeyman of fascism is heavily leaned upon, but the game would have been more interesting and relevant if it took on corruption and abuse of power in modern democracy. The abandonware game Floor 13 is similar in some ways to The Westport Independent, but is much more interesting and engaging.			"

												I personally really enjoy this game. YES, I know, it didn't live up to expectations, its short, and isn't as emotionally conflicting as Papers Please. BUT, what you have here is still a good, fun, original game. Your a media outlet editor under the employ of the ""Westport Indipendent"", a newspaper publisher. Westport itself however, is a large industrial city split into four districts, The southern docks, the eastern industy area, the western middle class region, and the upperr class elite northern section. The country that westport is part of is run by a totalitarian regime that is referred to as ""The Loyalist Party"", their goals lie within censoring general media, television shows, books, and other sources of information for the sake of a tighter and more controlling grip on their citizens. The game starts off with a notice from the loyalist party, it states that soon a bill will be passed that basically shuts down all indipendent media outlets and inserts the government in control of all media. You will have 12 weeks until the bill is officially in action, meaning that you must do what you can, to influence the populace through your media in whatever way you can, for example, in my first playthrough I focused mainly on posting government propoganda, to get on the good side of the loyalist party, in turn I was able to influence the unruly southern docks into showing more loyalty towards the loyalist party, which is a big chunk of westport's population, and by the end of the 12 weeks, the government was more dystopian than ever thanks to me, militarized police that were labeled as heroes by my media outlets propoganda, flags on every street corner due to the recently brainwashed populace, and of course, the mass arrests and executions that happened anywhere disloyalty may lie. And as for my second playthrough, I took a hardheaded stand against the loyalist party, trying to brew rebel support into all the districts, I didn't play my cards well, and long story short, me and all my writers one by one were arrested, and assumedly executed. Im still trying to get a perfect rebel ending, trust me, its tough, I've already gotten a half decent rebel ending, but it basically just meant half the city was in a state of anarchist uprising... but wow, Kinda led a tangent with this review, hopefully its helpful in someway to somebody.

												At first I was excited about this game, as everybody else, because of the success of Papers, Please, we were hungry for more of this kind of game. Unfortunately, this feels more like an unfinished prototype of a game.Most remarkable is the gaping void left by the lack of features in the game. Every ingame week is the same. You grab a story, change its headline, erase a few paragraphs and send it to one of your writers. Then you finish the newspaper which is basically placing the stories in order and choosing which demographic to market that specific issue to. There are no twists, no presentation of new challenges and events that change the dynamics of the game like in Papers, Please; every week is exactly the same.Gameplay is boring and uneventful. There is no payoff or incentive of going either way. Going Rebel is pretty much the only way to go since unlike Papers, Please, if you go the Loyalist route, there is quite literally no challenge - you cruise through the game knowing that you'll ""win"". And you have zero incentives of going the Rebel route. Nothing in this game rewards you for anything; you're just expected to do things because it's how you're ""supposed to play it"". The only positive things I can say about this game are the graphics and the core idea, which was unfortunately badly executed.All in all, this is a game that could use a very heavy content update, or even a good do-over. As is, it's not worth playing.			"

												Let's face it, there are comparisons to papers please but it plays nothing like it. So let's break what you have to do down. Ok?Step 1: Choose your articleKinda a no-brainer, you are the editor at a newspaper after all. What you have to do is decide WHAT makes it into your paper. You can change the title and remove parts of the article. And it changes the opinion of both the people and the governmentStep 2:Publishing the ArticleWho writes the article? you? well that's not in your paygrade so deal with it. Your employees do that. However they have their own opinions about the government and how comfortable they are with you. In this game snitches don't get stitches. And they will report on you if they become uncomortable with what you have them doStep 3:Selling your paper.This dosen't become avaible until later but you need to manage your marketing. You decide which districts, a total of 4, get your marketing. this then can change their opinion of the current state of affairs in the nation.Step 4: Repeat?Well yes, but people do have their opinions of you. If the government becomes too suspicious of you or your employees, you'll be shut down or they will be arrested.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So basically it kinda gets monotonous around week 7-8 depending on your playstyle but it can be quite fun. Do you obey the loyalist government or help the rebellion? it's hard to do but there are many different endings depending on how you changed the opinions of the people.

A Newspaper Editor Censorship Simulator

			#westport http://store.steampowered.com/app/352240/ + A very interesting concept where you play as a newspaper editor and edit newspapers to censor out certain things to influence the population...		

+ A very interesting concept where you play as a newspaper editor and edit newspapers to censor out certain things to influence the population while trying to avoid suspicion from the government. + Nice old post-war aesthetic similar to Papers Please+ Great dialogue and propaganda ads and events that influence your actions while also causing you to fear or go against the government while swaying the minds of the people.+ Easy to learn and understand - Gets a bit repetitive early on, you mainly just read articles and cross out paragraphs- No real sense of reward or accomplishment as you progress (I feel this game could have been improved if you were actually earning money from sales or a bonus from the government, for example in Papers Please if you performed poorly at your job than you would not earn enough to provide for your family)Overall it is a nice experience, but the gameplay isn't rewarding enough to play for extended periods of time.

												For the 10 EUR I paid for this game I could have gotten a kebab, fries, and a coke. And consuming those would probably have taken me longer than it did to play this game.There's some potential here, but it falls horribly short. The game lasts only for 12 turns, which is nowhere near long enough to make you give a damn about the four people in your editorial team or the gameworld that you inhabit. The game just feels empty and entirely forgettable.The game is visually appealing, so it does have that going for it. But it still feels like a demo, not an actual game.If you can pick this up at a heavy discount, its a fun little game to try, but at full price its robbery in broad daylight.			"

												Some of my thoughts after about 40 minutes of playing:- The game is buggy, It has crashed a few times, and I have experienced glitches in the game forcing me to relaunch it.- Music is repetitive uninspiring.- This game needs more depth. A good example is a budget option for running your newspaper that rewards you for selling more newspapers.- Choices are extremely limited for editing articles and layout.The first 10 minutes were fun, but quickly got repetitive. This game has so much potential, it just needs the core concepts to be fleshed out more.			"

												Early doors review but I like this game. Seems a bit disappointing that a lot of the other reviewers don't seem to have grasped that the game has multiple endings and whether you want your paper to be the loyal government mouthpiece, the journal that sparked revolution or simply be a voice giving a balanced view upon events is up to you to decide. It's interesting and different.			"

												If you expect an ambitious game in the league of ""Papers, Please"", you will be highly disappointed. This game takes less than thirty minutes to complete. Most people think it's too short, but personnaly it allowed me to do a few runs, whereas I did one game and a half of ""Papers, Please"". This way, you can try many things.In my first run, I aligned with the  government, which was very easy. In my following runs, I tried to make each district revolt. The South and East are easy to ""win""; the West and, above all, the North are super hard to turn around (they are lawful Loyalists in the beginning). This was where the game became challenging. I find it amusing to think that one of my hardest challenge in video games was to inform rich people through newspapers that their government is evil and that they should work against it. Who knew we would someday live in such a time...However, I'm still unsure if the challenge is either very tough and complex or just plain unfair. I feel like you don't know enough about the mechanics. It seems like it's not any articles speaking against the government that will get to the North folks. What makes it even harder is that you have to avoid making the government suspicious; to influence the North, you will almost inevitably bust your limit. How do you find the balance? Lucas Pope, the creator of ""Papers, Please"", created a free game with a similar concept to The Westport Independant called Republia Times (it was released before). It wasn't divided into districts, and the outcome of everything you did was obvious. Also, the gameplay consisted only of choosing which articles to publish, and how big they would be on the front page; you couldn't modify the titles or the content, and you didn't have to assign them to a specific journalist. Finally, there wasn't all the marketing side of the game; your articles were either political (which are not popular but are influential) or about celebrities or entertainement (which have the opposite effect). So it was simpler and more straightforward, but at the same time isn't it a bit boring if you're sure of the outcome, and if there's no challenge?The community is so inactive that you can't expect to find a guide on the web. You can't even find a clear description of the achievements. So yeah, I'm a bit mixed about all of this, but overall I had a great time and it was very compelling to try to make rebels out of the North folks (in which I succeeded! Yay for me :D ).			"

												Westport is one of those rare gems about wrestling with different perspectives and compromising beliefs while trying to find some greater purpose as redemption for the actions that you do or do not take.  The game comes at a time where discussion of the idealogical role of news media and how we form the beliefs we do is important to have.While it is entirely possible to breeze through in 30 minutes or less, criticising the game for this misses the point. Modern game design has conditioned us to seek the optimal solution to a problem, but never to reflect on the moral quandry of whether the optimal choice is the same as the right choice.  Just like in life, there are easy roads pandering to power and group influence, and there are hard roads of moral principle and rational thinking.  To that end the easy loyalist playthrough holds a mirror out from which you figure out where you are on that scale.  It's the tension of that easy way out always tempting you that adds value to the choices that you do make.  I don't think i've seen a game do this before, let alone do it well.In some ways there really are no good or bad guys in westport - the rebels are just as much if not more repellantly violent and oppressive as the loyalists.  Instead, the core excercise for me quickly became juggling the welfare of my journalists against informing the public of important issues affecting their civil liberties.  Who will you choose?  Those tangibly close to you, or the unseen public?Increasingly, you'll find yourself evaluating stories based not on the actual subject matter, but underlying agendas and perceptions that can be pushed by drawing seemingly intuitive conclusions.  What is being sold, and what is being ommitted in order to allow those connections to be formed?And those high minded idealogical journalistic ideas you set out with?  Soon you'll be addicted to soft target issues of no newsworthy value simply because they have the least ammount of tied interest while still having popularity value.  Poor Harold Finn, I bullied him so much simply to fill pages and get readership :(.  An interesting take on the prevalence of celebrity news in modern society.I'm already thinking about how people will percieve Westport after reading this recommendation.  And in some ways I think that might say more about the game than anything else i may or may not have written.In the interest of fairness and objectivity, there are a few negatives however:- First week content (tutorial) is largely unskippable- some of the coffee table dialogue was more conversational placeholder like ""this coffee is bad"" and ""i went on a date which wasn't a date"" instead of dealing with interesting choices made or furthering the narrative within the game's theme.- Advertising preferences are not saved so you have to keep redoing the sliders each week.- Sometimes get crease and desist threats from the government despite having played a loyalist turn the previous week.- sometimes hard to tell how anti-loyalist a story is without passing it to phil (the loyalist journo) to see if he wants to transcribe it or not.- Auto saves at the beginning of each week so if you lose that turn you have a redundant save slot you gotta manually delete.

												The Westport Independent cannot help the comparison to 'Papers Please'. If the idea of a slightly grim game about working under an oppressive totalitarian regime doesn't make you think of 'Papers Please' then the art style certainly will. Lucas Pope (creator of the afore mentioned game) is even credited in the Special Thanks. But with papers please being one of the most critically acclaimed indies of all time it's a hard act to follow.You take on the role of editor of an independent newspaper under the particularly ruthless 'National Government'. Each week you must sort through a number potential articles, changing the title and censoring the content to fill your aims.On my first play through I whole heartedly took on the role of a nationalist. My paper oozed fascism with every article making the government into saviours of the people and the rebels into the scum of the earth. Whilst one of my employees, Frank, was taken away for 'correction' (as you'll see this is something of a habit of his) it was largely uneventful. At the end of the game almost everyone was completely in favour of the government with the air full of music and laughter and only the occasional dissenter being bundled into a van.The second time round I went full rebel! Calling out the government every chance I had and painting the rebels in a sympathetic light. This time lots of threatening messages from the government landed on my desk and before long Frank had been dragged away in the back of a van. Keeping up my anti-government sentiments the paper was soon after shut down and I was thrown back to the main menu without even an achievement.For a final run through I decided to become a tabloid. Stay as neutral as possible, publish mostly celebrity gossip and local news stories. Despite my best efforts however my paper came under suspicion from the government and, you guessed it, Frank was escorted out of the building by some men in suits. At the end the richer area of Westport remained under state control as did the Middle class area (with some protest) but the poorer regions were in full riot.Despite the clear impact of my reporting on the world around me The Westport Independent doesn't lend any weight to its actions. The censoring and headline changing feels like ticking boxes and the other options you get are sliders for slider sake. It feels all too easy to just choose your outcome. Your employees have lives, you hear them talk about current events and their opinions on the work they've produced but I'm simply not invested in them.So the question perhaps is what did 'Paper Please' do that The Westport Independent doesn't. In my opinion it comes down to two main things. Firstly making a choice is too easy.  'Papers Please' builds investment in characters leading to difficult decisions where you need to decide if you obey the government and let an innocent girl die or let her live but leave your own family without food. Westport has what feels like no or little consequences and the stories you deal with are out of your control and you're disconnected. Secondly is the time pressure. Mechanics as storytelling is a huge part of video games and is what sets it apart from other media. In 'Paper's Please' time is constantly ticking down making you feel pressured and with constant changes you need to learn and keep track of there is a real feeling of oppression. Westpost again has none of this, you are free to look through the articles deciding what will affect what value in your own time and with the exception of losing a journalist or so there's no change.Perhaps it's overly mean of me to compare this game to one of the most renowned games of its type. But it's worth noting that Lucas Pope himself once created a very similar game 'The Republia Times' for Ludum Dare. Ultimately The Westport Independent isn't a bad game, it just suffers from the fact that it is both a game that sacrifices fun for impact but fall flat and that it is unavoidably held to 'Paper Please'. For most people this is a game to be missed but I think there are some out there who would appreciate the experience this game offers. Even if it falls a bit short. ------------------------------------------------Disclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge.

												TL;DR: Definitely not worth the full price, but grab it on sale if you have an interest in propaganda, censorship and/or publishing.-----------------------------An interesting game which put you in charge of a weekly newspaper in the fictional  fascist city-state of Westport. Which four articles will be published this week, what will you censor and will the header be biased? Whom of your four unique employees gets to write which article, and how will it affect the government's suspicion of them? Which article gets to be on the front page and to which of the four city districts do you market your newspaper the most? Will your paper be popular enough to sway public opinion one way or the other before the Loyalists feel you've crossed the line and crack down on your humble little newspaper? And you only have 12 weeks before the strict new law is passed and the game ends!Twelve weeks, twelve papers, and the fate of the city's future.If you have an interest in propaganda, censorship and publishing you will like this game. Sadly it offers very little replay value. After playing through the game twice in two hours I noticed very little variation in the possible stories I could publish, despite playing radically different both times. If you can grab it on sale, do so. But it's just FAR too short and simple to recommend for the full $10 pricetag.			"

												A minimalistic game inspired by Papers, Please.You play as an editor at a newspaperthat is being watched by the fascist government.You have to decide to either censor the news by removing certain details and spinning the headlinesor you report critically against your own government, causing yourself and your employees trouble.It is a numbers game, meaning you are trying to balance loyalist/rebel support, your suspicion with the fascists, aswell as the popularity of your newspapers by managing marketing aspects.Your first playthrough of it will be about an hour long.The replayability is naturally high.Games like this... really make you think.

												As much as I'd like to upvote this game, I can't.Not for this price.It is indeed a pretty interesting game about newspaper, corruption and censorship and has manny different aspects to consider, such as the governmental suspicion of you and your workers, the comfort of your writers, the populations opinion, distribution, content etc.And it's really fun to read through all the articles, deciding over the title and what parts to cut out and seeing how it affects the population of Westport.But once you've got through the game once, wich was done in 100 minutes by me, it's just repeating itself. The story is and stays the same.The replay value only consits of getting different endings for different districts and for the workers, but that's about it.It is a good game, but you most likely will only play it once for 1-2 hours or so and for that, the price is too high. I'm glad I've bought it on a sale so i only paid a fith of the price, and for this price it would be ok for every one, but not for 10 bucks.			"

Make a sequel where what I say in the paper actually makes a difference to world at large.If I write something awful about that idiot of a president, have riots form on the spot. Blame me.

												The prospect of multiple endings is a pretty good way to draw you back into the game. BUT! and this is a big one, like most of the other reviewers have mentioned is the price/ ammount of gameplay. It is pretty lacking in that department. It does however force you to question your values and make difficult decisions becuase of the differing opinions of your staff and readers. It forces you to question your integrity no matter where your political opinions lie.I give it a 6.5/10 If it where a lesser cost or on sale I would wholly recommend it, but at its current price (at the time of writing 10 USD) its just too much.

												Disclaimer: I received a free copy of the game from the developers.PROS:- The pixel art is simple but very well done, though it can sometimes be a bit hard to read certain words.- The music is very fitting and enjoyable. Nothing out of this world, but definitely above average.- Good concept and intention (i.e. making a game that is a commentary of how censorship affects the news).- Overall an enjoyable game. Not something I hated myself for playing.CONS:- It's very, very short. I have 2.8 hours logged into it because I was recording the gameplay, but you can get through the whole thing in under an hour.- You probably won't have a reason to play it more than once.- There are a few typos and grammatical errors.- Success is not all that satisfying.TO SUM IT UP, I'm recommending it because I enjoyed it and, while not perfect, it's still not a bad game per se.On the other hand, it's not something you need to play either.It feels more like the type of game you'd find on Itch.io or GameJolt after a game jam (not in a bad way, just in the sense that it's a very short experience), so if you want to play it I'd suggest picking it up when it's on sale.If you're curious, here's part 1 of my playthrough:

												It's an interesting concept, but not much of a game. A single playthrough should not take more than an hour, and I can't see much reason to replay it because it's a bit tedious and empty, with no real sense of control over outcomes, no outside system to affect, no personal life to manage, and no plot. My point isn't that games need to have these things, but it helps to have something of substance, doesn't it? This is a bit like solitaire without the replay value.You alternate between choosing which stories to run, and viewing little cutscenes. This happens about 12 times.In the cutscenes, the employees gossip lightly about their realistically depressing personal lives in a way that has no clear connection to anything you've done. These cutscenes are ignorable and don't really carry a lot of plot or character.Editing has a few wrinkles which don't really do anything. Mostly, it is just choosing stories. Occasionally you might strike out a paragraph to avoid making the government or whoever angry. This has no obvious cost, there is no particular information to consider; it's just an arbitrary choice. If the person you give a story to refuses to write it, then you just choose another. Makes you want to hire an understudy who you can just hand the stories to, and they will shop the stories around until each one has a writer. Then there are the letters you receive, but can't read unless you drag them to exactly the right part of the screen.After each cycle, you get a little feedback about how the papers sold and how they shifted public opinion, for all the difference it seems to make.After the last cycle, you get different ending texts which might reflect your choices. Or maybe not, it's not very clear.  I think I'll skip replaying this for achievements which just meant that I sat in the chair a few more hours like this one.			"

												First off: Have you ever read George Orwell's ""1984""? Did you appreciate the meanings in it? Did you appreciate the perspective of a government worker who had to edit the media to ensure it to be proper for public viewing? Did you also appreciate the emotions that were conveyed, the fear of defying the government, which could lead to your death, or the thrill of doing the same thing, not giving a damn about the governement and giving the people the information they deserve?Well, my friend, this game reminded me of 1984. It reminded me of the rumors Americans had heard of the Communist Russia. It reminded me of the thought and fear of a totalitarian government ruling above all. This game placed me in the shoes of the editor for an indepentant media outlet (newspaper, in this case). And in my first playthrough of it, I felt concern for what the government would do to me and my colleagues if I chose to speak out against the government, even the things that were accidents.One of the things about this game is that you don't know how your article choices affect you, your colleagues, the paper, and the public opinion, until the next week.I enjoyed this game, and I can't wait to find every different ending I can. I hope you enjoy it too.			"

												I enjoyed my first play-through of the game quite a bit. It does feel a lot like Papers Please only without the time crunch factor (which, to be honest, I enjoyed because I'm terrible at making quick decisions). I look forward to playing again with a less moderated newspaper to see how the world changes. It made me laugh that writing about celebrities actually influenced their marriages. I can understand the mixed reviews but it IS enjoyable and I didn't mind paying full price because I intend to play through a few more times.If you're not a fan of reading or trying to figure out if you're inadvertantly going to start a riot by talking about an apartment fire - this game is not for you.

												This was a really interesting game. I think it does a great job of simulating the pressure of being an editor in a troubling time, using cutscenes to get you invested in your staff and making you double think your actions. It's really well designed, forcing you to think how best to send out rebellious messages without raising too much suspicion. There are also multiple factions in there as well, and your choices can force their involvement or have your staff leave for a week to do personal business. It's all really well done touches and makes for a great little title.Also love the presentation, and the gossip stories are funny tabloid parody. Well recommended.			"

												It seems pretty buggy, at least based on my two playthroughs. Not the game itself - but the endings are.------------------------------------------------------------Spoiler ahead, in case you're really that worried about it:------------------------------------------------------------In my first game, I had a reporter kidnapped fairly early on. As the game wraps up, it makes sure to point out all these great or interesting things your employees have done - and this one, instead of being 'disappeared' by the loyalist government, has actually... quit the paper in a rage, upset by the kinds of articles I was publishing? He even came to blows with me.Which is weird.Since the loyalists killed him.Oh well, second playthrough, probably just a weird bug. No reporters killed/missing, and everyone was happy with their job; I even managed to keep the Loyalist's suspicion low on all of my employees.Yet, one who I made sure never published an anti-government article in his career was apparently 'disappeared' early in the game, according to the ending text. I dunno, maybe shore up the endings a bit, and I'll be happier. Otherwise...------------------------------------------------------------...Pretty interesting game. I know it's based on something indie, but I've honestly never played the previous game. This has some cool mechanics, and may be worth a buy when it's on sale - just not for $10.			"

												This is a fun and interesting little game.  I like the simplicity of it, and it isn't overly difficult to play for someone who has worked in Mass Media like myself, and has encountered such censorship issues in the real world (yes this kind of stuff does happen).  For someone who has no clue about censorship or political agendas this might be daunting or confusing.  But I personally think it is fun to tinker with and comical at times.  It fills an interesting little niche which hasn't really been touched in the gaming world yet.  Kind of like a turn based strategy game where your keeping your nation from falling apart, (or causing it to fall apart) but instead of moving troops around on some map, you are printing articles and deciding how to promote your paper - and that has an impact.

												The Westport Independent is a game about censorship. You play the role of an editor who needs to guide his newspapers and his staff in an ever darker political landscape, always choosing between safety and truth.I welcome powerful, thought provoking games like this one,  and like Papers, Please or This War of Mine. The execution of TWI is not perfect, certainly not compared to Papers or This War, and the game certainly promises more depth than it delivers, but it still adds to the catalogue of thought provoking games, which is why I recommend it.

												A lot of the negative reviews seem to focus on the fact the game's short and that the reviewer was expecting some sort of newspaper tycoon game.Well let's be clear, this is not a news paper tycoon game and it's length is good for what the game tries to accomplish. It offers a unique look into the thought process of an editor and how newspapers can spin stories (which in turn can effect public opinion). The mechanics are simple, but they work, and the potential scenarios you may create are tantilizing. However, where the game falls short is in the consequences of the stories you run. I, for example, focused heavily on corporations and their nefarious deeds, only talking about the rebellion when people died. During the end credits (when the consequences are revealed), there wasn't a single mention of the unemployment, outsourcing, corruption or illegal immigration which I routinely addressed in my newspaper. The summary only revolved around small protests and minor rebel activity.I still recommend the game because the premise is interesting. But the execution is flawed. I'd give it a solid 7. Might be a bit overpriced for what it offers (I'd set it at $5).			"

It is also a very original game and it takes clear inspiration from Papers Please and I love it! I cheered when I saw his name in the special thanks section of the credits.

This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].Media censorship and corruption is certainly an intriguing topic, especially in this day and age when we are bombarded by the media from all sides. When a game tries to tackle this topic, it should definitely be applauded for its valiant effort. Video games are broadening their horizons on an almost daily basis and it’s the independent scene that is usually able to provide a razor-sharp focus on a certain theme because the design is usually smaller in scope compared to big budget games. This approach has brought us games like Papers, Please, which provided poignant insight into a life of an ordinary person trying to make a living under a totalitarian regime. I usually don’t like to directly compare games to one another in my reviews, but in this case that is impossible. The Westport Independent was obviously influenced by Lucas Pope’s seminal title, and perhaps even more so by his prior game, The Republia Times.In The Westport Independent, the player takes on the role of an editor-in-chief of a local newspaper of the same name. Unfortunately for the media, the oppressive government of the nameless country is introducing a new bill in 12 weeks that will make freedom of speech a thing of the past. In those 12 weeks, you can try to shape public opinion through the presentation of the articles you decide to run. You can’t lie, but you can alter article titles or delete paragraphs. In doing so, you will either comply with the Loyalist Party or show support for the rebel movement that is trying to overthrow the government. After you’re done editing the articles, you assign them to the writers. You have four writers at your disposal, all of whom have a slightly different take on the situation in the country. They will also react differently to the articles you submit to them. For example, if you give a pro-rebel article to a Loyalist Party supporter, he or she will say that they can’t write it. You can either give in and assign them another article (or change the article in question) or force them to write it.Depending on your choices, you will be contacted both by the rebels and the government. The latter will either threaten or commend you. If one or more of your writers publish too many anti-government articles, you run the risk of having them arrested and removed from the newspaper. That will leave you with one less writer and one less article per week as you can only assign a single article to a writer each week. Between each week, you will be treated with a short cutscene which will depict a brief conversation of your staff in a local bar. They will make various comments on the articles, newspaper, government, rebels, and personal issues.Apart from making choices, the game also has a management component to it. When you’re done choosing and editing the articles, you have to decide on the most appropriate marketing. The city contains of four districts and each has an interest in different topics. For example, the wealthy district is most interested in celebrity and industrial articles, whereas the poorest district wants to read about societal issues and crime. You can choose how much copies to send to each district. Your articles will influence the views of the population and the popularity of the newspaper.Unfortunately, while all of this sounds extremely interesting, the execution is severely lacking. The thing that made Papers, Please so fascinating was that it successfully wrapped mundane gameplay of pushing papers into a compelling whole. There were many subtleties that made you care about everything you were doing. The Westport Independent simply fails at that. It just feels hollow, I never really felt immersed into it, I didn’t care about the events or the characters. It all felt soulless and empty, devoid of any poignancy and meaning. I also have to point out that the game is extremely short, I managed to complete two playthroughs in two hours. The worst thing is that boredom set in even before the end of the first playthrough. The game is meant to be played multiple times, but the articles are always the same and the game world is simply not nearly compelling enough to make me want to see all the different endings. I saw two and neither gave me any sense of accomplishment in regards to the choices I made.The graphics are in the same retro style as Papers, Please, but with a more monochrome color palette, which I found suits it very well. My only complaint is that the text is sometimes hard to read. The soundtracks consists of a single derivative 1940’s jazz track. A lot more effort could have went into the entirety of the sound design.As I’ve said at the beginning, The Westport Independent is a valiant effort, but there’s simply no escaping the fact that the execution just isn’t there. The game world and the characters aren’t compelling, the gameplay is too simple, the game is far too short and it doesn’t provide much incentive for repeated playthroughs.4 OUT OF 10 (SUBPAR) "

												Good game i'd say. You play as a editor in a newspaper and your job is to take out the text that the government doesn't like. You can also choose to try and sneak in some rebel propaganda and swing the support in there favor. What you report will affect the opinion of the people so if you want a rebellion report on the stuff that the government is doing bad, though you should watch out, cause too much criticism will lead to you getting executed			"

												A haiku summing up my feels on The Westport Independent:The press is power;Yet all your time is just spent;On shuffling words.----------I got this game as a gift through Humble Bundle and it seemed pretty interesting: player takes on the role of a newspaper editor in an authoritarian dictatorship pushing censorship. Each week (for 12 weeks), you go through various articles and adjust how they read, both by crossing out certain paragraphs or changing up headlines, as well as planning the actual layout of the paper and marketing to certain districts within Westport. You can attempt to sway the populace to support the Loyalist government or try to incite rebel sympathy, all which affect the outcome of the game at the end. My only gripe I really have with the game, however, is that, while it's an interesting concept playing on the Papers, Please vibe, I wish the devs spent more time fleshing out the mechanics of the game. For example, there's only twelve weeks with each week consisting of editing and publishing four articles; after the second week, you've already been introduced to all the mechanics and, depending on how much you follow the Loyalists' censorship guidelines, you'll get different endings. But even then, the problem with that is each of the four districts' endings are independent from each other (there can be parades in the North, while riots and outright war are ravaging in the East and South, with no clear indication who won and if those decisions mattered). Of course, this could easily be fixed by just developing the world and what the player can do in it, as well as provide increasing difficulty throughout a playthrough.While $9.99 USD is a tad steep for a game that can be played through in under an hour, it is a good introduction to the world of Westport and an experimentation in games that focus on censorship, writing, and the power of the press. There just needs to be more next time.			"

												This ia  good concept that hasn't been taken far enough.  You run a paper in a society where the government watches your every word.  Attempt to sway the populace with selective information and the government will begin to swoop in and kidnap your employees in the middle of the night.You can also decide which order your stories will be in your paper, which in turn gives your paper a subject focus (Crime, Industrial, Societal, Celebrity) which makes it more or less popular in one of the four regions.You can try to sway people one way or another without attracting too much government attention.  But...I feel like the options you chose don't have a major impact on the game play.  You are expected to sway people towards the rebels without getting caught, so thats what I did.  There really was no drama or tension to it.That being said, the concept is solid.  If this game had made my choices feel more important and made me feel more attached to my reporters, I probably would have gotten much more into it.  That being said, it wasn't a BAD game either.  Probably worth picking up at the $2-5 range as long as you expect a max of an hour or two out of it.			"

												Partial spoilers? Anyway. I've only played a little of this game, if only because it's kind of confusing. It's swimming in the wake of papers please, of course. And I think it does a rather well job with the setting. The characters come off as annoying. I get that guy 1 has such a bleeding heart he can't get enough bandages in the world. I get that the others are just kind of trying to survive. But after every day that just gets kind of shoved in my face. I'm happy it's not a carbon copy of the game with different paint like all of the minecraft copies. And, frankly, the worst part since I've last played is the inability to tell me how I changed stats. In Papers Please when you make a mistake it tells you what you messed up. I tried to start off as a loyalist because I thought that'd be easier and simple and nice to start. But sometimes I'd end up accidentally posting slander to the government? I guess? I can't exactly tell what I'd done wrong, only that I had done something wrong. And with around 4 different stories with changable titles and contents it's hard to tell what is exactly slander. I've been given a rulebook and I'm given a grade but no teacher has come by to actually tell me what I did wrong. Which I'd appreciate and if it was implemented I'd actually fully recommend this game. But it's a time waster, I guess. $10 is a fine price for it though.			"

I have that game, it is far better than this. If they remastered this game, made it longer, modes and perhaps multiplayer maybe? compete against other newspapers, that may just be a completely different game entirely. Furthermore, this game is only good if you're bored. I recommend you spend your money elsewhereI feel like they have rushed this. Too short for my liking. concept is good, graphics, I like the retro pixel graphics, sounds, it was excellent. nice story line but too short and I was expecting a bit more to it than that.			"

												Papers, Please: The Less Stressful Edition.When it comes to it's theme, this game tackles similar topic as Papers, Please, the topic of social issues in a socialist state-like setting. It's even similarly short - according to Steam, it took me just 99 minutes, or a bit more than just an hour and a half, for a single playthrough, although there are multiple endings, depending on your in-game choices, just like in Papers, Please. The two even have similar art style.While they tackle similar topics, the way they tackle them is different. While in Papers, Please the main character is working in border immigration control, the main character in this game is the boss of a local newspapers who decides which topics will be covered in those newspapers and in what way. This game also drops Papers, Please' time limit in it's ""levels"" and the mechanic where the main characters needs to take care of his family's well-being. These two differences result in a much more relaxed gameplay, where the player doesn't need to worry about his or her performance that much.About the endings: it appears that each part of the country (though it actually appears to be a city in this game) receives it's own ""ending"", which one exactly indirectly depending on which news the player decides to cover and in what way. At the end, all these ""separate"" ""endings"" are then combined into a single ending, which reminds me of Long Live the Queen, another game that appears to pull off something similar.All in all, I think this game deserves a solid 8/10. It's not a GOTY, but it's not bad either.			"

												Yes, the game is short, but I don't think that's necessarily a point against it. That being said, for a game that is short, it's incredibly repetitive. I only played through it once, and even though I only got 1/5 of the achievements, I didn't feel like going back for more, or to attempt to get other ones. Even in one playthrough I found myself getting the same article over and over again, which really killed the realness of the world when, after dropping one article in my rejected bin, it just came back again in the next ""phase"".Additionally, it felt like most of the time nothing was happening. I got letters from the government once or twice, and a letter from the rebels once near the end, but it never felt engaging, or like I was making any meaningful choices. the level of Loyalty vs. Rebellion, Trust vs. Suspicion, and Popularity in the various sectors never seem to really mean anything, since you're not managing finances of your paper, and those levels dont seem to affect what kind of articles you get.It would have been much more interesting if, once you reached a certain level of popularity, The Rebels and Loyalists gave you slanderous or false articles to put in your paper, or popularity in one sector meant that you got insider news from your fans. Personally I ended up pandering to the Southern districts, but that choice never meant anything. No doubt your actions affect the ending you get, but it would have been more rewarding if those choices were actually reflected while you played.Westport Independent is not a bad game. It's an interesting premise mixed with a tried and true Papers Please artstyle, although the choice to emulate that might not have been in the game's favor. I was suddenly aware of how low the stakes felt when compared with Papers Please--the anxiety of not being able to keep my family alive was much more intense than seeing my suspicion bar rise a little. The insinuation that ""your editors will follow you but don't expect them to die for you"" is also odd, since aside from them sometimes resisting writing an article they never seem to care one way or the other about what you're printing.The most disappointing thing about Westport is that it really doesn't offer many moral choices, and it doesn't have anything to say. It's a commentary on censorship in the media that doesn't seem to say much other than ""this is a thing that happens, and media is important"". Unfortunately, can't reccomend.			"

												Disclosure: Key provided by publisher for review at https://videogamerrob.wordpress.com/The Westport Independent started life as a gamejam entry that the developers thought was promising enough to expand upon. Players are tasked with managing a newspaper under a dictatorship and are forced to choose between the truth and censorship.CONTROLS (3.5/5)Controlling a newspaper is surprisingly easy if The Westport Independent is to be believed. Players will receive articles and letters and simply need to drag an article to the center of the screen, click to remove lines or change a headline, and then toss it into a writer’s folder.Everything is simple and functional and clearly designed around mobile controls first. Some elements of the UI could use work, as establishing if a story will count as coverage in certain topics can be a little hard to tell until you’re in later steps.GRAPHICS/SOUND (3.5/5)The game is clearly meant to evoke some of the movies of the ‘40s and ‘50s, and it mostly succeeds doing so. Everything is black and white, and what little is seen outside of the newspaper office appears to be a blend of noir and art-deco. Things are kept relatively clean and simple, and I enjoyed the ever shifting newspaper cover you can get depending on how you handle advertising.Audio is similarly simple and drenched in film noir. A handful of what appear to be public domain tracks that have made their way into a dozen noirs in the past, or ones attempting to mimic them, are present. There’s not much else to speak of beyond that light soundtrack, though the production values for the intro propaganda reel are great.GAMEPLAY (2.5/5)In the fictional city of Westport set in a vaguely American country, the government has effectively decided to end freedom of the press. In 12 weeks, a bill will be going into effect turning the titular newspaper into a government-owned propaganda factory. Fortunately in 12 weeks you can affect a lot to change the world around you.Players are tasked each week with writing a few stories, but even with the law yet to take effect, the government won’t sit idly by if you libel them by printing the truth. And so it is suggested perhaps to edit out embarrassing details, such as the cost of a statue honoring the President.While you can comply with their requests, you can also spin the narrative against them by leaving that information in or tweaking a headline. Westport is struggling between two factions, the Loyalists and the Rebels, and the paper can help sway the population to one side or the other.After deciding what stories to print, you’ll need to assign them to your writers. Each writer has their own personality and opinions, so a hardcore rebel might not like printing pro-government drivel. However, there’s also suspicion mechanics at play, so if you’ve been letting him write a bunch of Rebel stories, forcing a puff piece into his hands might save his hide.Lastly, players will get to decide how to layout the paper. Each story has one of four attributes, and the placement of stories closer to the front page will strengthen them. In turn, each attribute appeals to certain sections of the city, and you’ll need to decide who to market the paper to depending on your content. The district that likes society and crime news might not buy your paper if it’s a bunch of celebrity gossip, after all.A lot of this may sound good on paper, but the execution is a bit lacking. First off, the game is extremely short, and so it can be hard to really get a feel for the world of The Westport Independent. Everything is also a bit too vague.Your reporters, for instance, have little actual character, and so caring about their fate or comfort is hard. Half of the ending goes into what happened to them, but I couldn’t tell you anything about most of them other than if they were Loyalists or Rebels. They felt like resources more than characters.Similarly, there are often few interesting choices to make in the articles. Often the headline is the big thing, offering one that’s clearly offensive to one side or the other. The body of the articles is typically three or four sentences long, and a lot of the time articles didn’t feel like they had content worth removing or keeping in that would affect much. More in-depth articles that allow players to clearly shape the narrative were desperately needed.In the end, the bill is coming, and you’ll get endings depending on the status of each of the four districts in town. Rebels will riot, Loyalists will party. There are a decent amount of alternate endings to achieve, and some meta-game goals like attempting to get all districts to be Loyalists or Rebels at once.In these scenarios, managing your writers’ comfort, sales and government suspicion are quite a challenge, but first-time players aren’t likely to know the mechanics enough early on to seek these out, and the relatively bland first run isn’t going to intrigue many to return.OVERALL (2.5 /5)The Westport Independent is a great concept, but there’s not enough follow through. Those looking to manage life in a dictatorship are more likely to find enjoyment in the game’s clear inspiration, Papers, Please.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It's a great concept, but the gameplay is too shallow.			"

The creators of “The Westport Independent” are either incredibly sick of hearing comparisons to “Papers, Please”, or it’s exactly what they were going for. And either way, it really doesn’t work. Not in the grand scheme of things, anyway.			"

												Very short game and does little to engage you in it's time. I wasn't engaged in the lives of my journalists or what was happening in this country. I wasn't even sure what my paper was trying to achieve.There was not enough feedback about what stories were working, what wasn't and what the readers wanted. It could've done better by explaining the mechanics fuller and fully demonstrating the effects my paper had. It tries to do that, but it fails; one week the writers were talking about a story that happened literally weeks prior and the paper never talked about in the first place.It reminded me of Game Dev Tycoon where the popularity of the game (or in this case a paper) was seemingly random to the player with no feedback about what worked or didn't.

												Enough room to let you play multiple times with different ideas and yet short enough to see the payoff of those decisions in the end game. It may not bring 80+ hours to the table, but then again it wasn't exactly designed to, either. It's... quirky. I hate to use that word with most games because it admittedly sounds bad, but that's about the best descriptive word I can come up with - and I mean that in the nicest, most positive way possible. There's a level of lightheartedness that plays well with the theme of facist, jack-booted media manipulation and the two go hand-in-hand well. The game never felt like it was just dragging on, or becoming so complex and muddled that going through the stages was a chore. Simple mechanics, easily accessible payoff and resolution and there's a charm to its simplicity that I fall for time and time again. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get some amusement and eat up a little time. As I picked it up on the 2016 Steam Summer Sale (for a steal, really) - I'm quite happy with my purchase, and will keep an eye on the devs to see what else they put out. If it's more of the same as this? Fine, that'll be worth the money. But if they build and expand off of the idea they have here, if they do more but keep the balance of simplicity, humor and freedom of choice? Even better. My hat's off, officially, I enjoyed and will definitely recommend this game.			"

												Great game! I have wanted to play it since I first heard of it about a year ago... and since it was just on sale, I figured: why not? For a game about politics, I was kind of shocked at how easy it was to change the government's opinion. Also the game doesn't really have a defined goal, which I think it maybe should.Anyways, an awesome game overall, would play again.			"

												The Westport Independent has an interesting concept but it isn't backed up by its gameplay. You are the editor of an independent paper and in 12 weeks the loyalist government will shut you down and enstate their own propaganda newspapers. What you must do is choose which articles are printed each week and which of your writers will write them. You can choose the headline of each article and delete any paragraphs in the articles. After a few in game weeks you also get to choose which articles get the front page and how much of your marketing budget to put into the four areas of the country. This is very simple and it basically tells you where to put your money. Moreover, there are only 2 headlines to pick for each article and a maximum of 4 paragraphs to censor.Each member of your group has a name and a sliver of a backstory, with information about whether they support the rebels of the loyalists. They also each have a comfort meter which will decrease if you force them to write articles they disagree with.You really have to make your own goals in this game. You choose whether to publish articles about celebrities, industry or articles that praise or disparage the government. Each article you chose will affect your paper's popularity, the government's suspicion of you and the public's opinion on the rebels and the loyalists. My problem with the game stems from the fact that there is no objective, no goals to reach for. You have to set your own. Do you want the public to support the rebels or the government, or will you focus on celeb gossip to sell papers. Normally I enjoy games where you make your own fun but there was little motivation to do anything in The Westport Independent. Personally I found it easy to sell papers as long as you put a bit of everything in and by the end my government suspision was ridiculously high with no negative effects apart from a few letters warning me not to badmouth the loyalists. Your staff members can also be taken out by government officials if they write too much rebel propaganda but I found it hard to care as they have only barebones backstories and barely any personality. On top of that they're literally faceless, only being presented in silouhette. They do chat amongst each other in between levels but nothing really separated the characters other than two liked the loyalists and two liked the rebels. On that note, I found it hard to care for the paper as well. Sure I wanted it to do well but only because then there'd be no more levels to play. As for the rebels and the government I think the game needs to be less black and white and have a few more gray areas. In all the articles the government is clearly shown as evil and despotic or the paragon of kindness, should you choose the other headline. There's no middle ground and it makes it hard to want to support them in any way.I gather that the point of the game is to make you endure the struggles of censorship in a world where your government is truly evil but the game fails to make this difficult and therefore it lacks impact. I managed to come up with a paper that was popular all over the country with litle government interference while disparaging them every chance I got.The game ends very anticlimactically. You get a written description of what's now happening in each district of the country but it doesn't feel like anything has been achieved. This is a consequence of the lack of any objectives. The game isn't all bad though. It's short and has a decent bit of music in.			"

												This game seems fun, but from the 10 ish minutes I played it, I just didn't get it. It was most likely introduced to you as 'Papers Please but _____', but it doesn't have the same charm as papers please.			"

												Westporrt Independent is a great game. It features great replayability. Each time you play, you can change the focus of your newspaper to get a differnt ending.			"

												Yes, the game is short, but I don't think that's necessarily a point against it. That being said, for a game that is short, it's incredibly repetitive. I only played through it once, and even though I only got 1/5 of the achievements, I didn't feel like going back for more, or to attempt to get other ones. Even in one playthrough I found myself getting the same article over and over again, which really killed the realness of the world when, after dropping one article in my rejected bin, it just came back again in the next ""phase"".Additionally, it felt like most of the time nothing was happening. I got letters from the government once or twice, and a letter from the rebels once near the end, but it never felt engaging, or like I was making any meaningful choices. the level of Loyalty vs. Rebellion, Trust vs. Suspicion, and Popularity in the various sectors never seem to really mean anything, since you're not managing finances of your paper, and those levels dont seem to affect what kind of articles you get.It would have been much more interesting if, once you reached a certain level of popularity, The Rebels and Loyalists gave you slanderous or false articles to put in your paper, or popularity in one sector meant that you got insider news from your fans. Personally I ended up pandering to the Southern districts, but that choice never meant anything. No doubt your actions affect the ending you get, but it would have been more rewarding if those choices were actually reflected while you played.Westport Independent is not a bad game. It's an interesting premise mixed with a tried and true Papers Please artstyle, although the choice to emulate that might not have been in the game's favor. I was suddenly aware of how low the stakes felt when compared with Papers Please--the anxiety of not being able to keep my family alive was much more intense than seeing my suspicion bar rise a little. The insinuation that ""your editors will follow you but don't expect them to die for you"" is also odd, since aside from them sometimes resisting writing an article they never seem to care one way or the other about what you're printing.The most disappointing thing about Westport is that it really doesn't offer many moral choices, and it doesn't have anything to say. It's a commentary on censorship in the media that doesn't seem to say much other than ""this is a thing that happens, and media is important"". Unfortunately, can't reccomend.			"

												People compare this to ""Papers, Please"", but they are quite different games. ""Papers, Please"" gets a sort of frantic feel as you try to work fast enough to earn money to support your family, while this game can be completed at your leisure and gives you time to think. The scales are also completely different; in this game you are impacting the political direction of an entire city, while in ""Papers, Please"" you have a much more immediate effect on single people as they enter your sphere of influence. Both games are excellent, and I think they provide pretty differently impactful experiences if you give each of them a chance.			"

												Not a lot of content for the cost. Your options are very limited, therefore there is not much replay value. You will quickly find yourself boxed in by the game's creative limitations. I bought this for its supposed resemblance to the game ""Papers, Please,"" but it was nowhere near as enjoyable.			"
