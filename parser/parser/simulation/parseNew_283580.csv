												This game is terrible. If it were called Crap Game Simulator then it would win awards. If you want a good bus sim then get OMSI 2. Don't waste your money on this poor excuse for a game.			"

												UPDATE: I have gotten the game to work, and it is still a waste of $10.With the Missions, you get told what to do at the beginning but if you forget then you can't ask what to do again.With the Campaign, I am currently on Chapter 6 and it has an unskippable five minute TV show at the beginning. This is really drawing me away from playing this game because I have to sit there for five minutes waiting for the game to actually start.My Logitech G27 is barely compatible with this game. If I move the wheel to the left in 5 seconds then it actually takes 10 seconds for the wheel in the game to move making it hard to drive. This is one of my only bus games where my steering wheel doesn't work.Overall, don't buy this game, it is such a waste. Buy OMSI 2 instead, it is a much better bus simulator.UPDATE 1/23/2016: I've been trying to play this game and it doesn't work anymore. When I try to play, the game crashes and takes me back to my desktop. This game is such a waste of money.			"

												I found a game I can 100% say is a terrible simulator. BROKEN!!!! Do not buy. The Monte has warned you. From falling into the ground 2 minutes in to most of the controls not even being mapped is just plain BS. I have never seen such a piece of junk game in my life. I have tried a few times and about 5 minutes into a campaign I get stuck inside a bus that drove up on the sidewalk working to the garage one campaign mission 1. After these 2 stupid issues and the inability to skip scenes just WOW. Please Please Please do not by this trash. Good gaming and see you all around. I hope I saved a life today. :) Did I mention how bad this game is. First Thumbs down review from me.			"

												1. Half the controls are not properly assigned, including the one to initiate the tutorial! Seriously, did anyone even playtest this thing?2. When walking towards your first mission, you cannot get up on the sidewalk and can get stuck in walls.Overall: The Big Rigs of bus simulators, but even that allowed you to proceed to the point where you can actually drive!

												This is really one of the worst games on Steam. Do not buy. Please get Euro Truck Simulator or just something else. This has terrible controls. The graphics are laughable even for the Playstation 2 era. Just dont even touch this. Go. Far. Away. From. This. PAGE.			"

												Whatever you do don't buy this game. It's a total scam that will take forever to downlaoad, even if you have a beast computer. It also has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, terrible control schemes, and is overall trash. I used to like sim games until I played this and it has ruined the entire genre for me; so whatever you do DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!			"

												This would be a good simulator if not for all the glitches for example, I am stook on chapter 6 because the first time I did it I got the bus out of the space took the tow truck back to the appartment but when I got out of it Carlos fell through the sidewalk, the secound time I couldn't sit in the drivers seat of the bus so I walke down the bus and got stuck in one of the seats, another time I got the bus out, again! and praked the tow truck up and got stook in the hood of a taxi, and the last time i did it I couldn't sit on the bus again! Please fix.			"

												I played it a few times and then... I bought a new pc, thats where the story ends really.Why doesn't it work anymore?It simply does not. Installed quicktime, did a reboot but nothing. I hear a second when the music plays and then back to windows.Fixes?It worked before on my old pc, but doesn't anymore on my new one. Looked everywhere for a fix but no. Did find out that a lot of people have problems with this game anyway.My OS and graphics?I use Win7 Home Premium 64 bit and a Nvidia GTX 9-series graphicscard. Do I recommend it?No, I can not and will not recommend this game, try Bus Driver instead that one does work.			"

												Great game and all but I have a suggestion for the buses. When I mean ""Buses"" i mean the RTS. I like it and all but can you give it an Detroit Diesel Series 50 Engine or a Detroit Diesel 6V92TA Engine? The C4 Just sounds little bit off task. (MAINLY GIVE IT AN 6V92TA Engine. I'm a big fan of thoose.)			"

												This is a really cool bus simulator game to play. if your looking for a simple bus simulator game then this is it. not to many buttons or controls to remember. it plays well on my computer and yes you will need a to download the quick time player so the game will work. also if you like RTS buses then you will like this game.
