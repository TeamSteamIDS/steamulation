												I go into driving simulators expecting the worst and sometimes I find a game that is, relaxing, enjoyable and challenging, even if its still dull. Bus Driver puts you in the driver's seat of several different buses on several different routes that you have to chose from. While it would be easy to dismiss a game like this, I will give it credit for having a subtle, deep and nuanced driving system.Its a game that takes patience that I'm surprised I had when I am so used to playing fast pace arcade style racers. Each route can take around ten minutes, but later routes require more time. Its a real time investment and commitment that some people can muster, but there is always a challenge.The driving is complex, slamming on the brakes might stop you faster, but it'll agitate your passengers into anger. Driving through a red light will get points deducted. Even changing lanes without using your turning signal is another infraction. Of course for every punishment there can be a reward. The game will give you points for successful stops at red lights and even lane changes. Cars behind you at red lights will honk for you to go, but your job as a bus driver is just tune it out. Happy passengers will give you score bonuses. If you drive a full mile with no penalties or if your passengers stay happy, you earn a score. There is always incentive to keep everything running smooth in an environment that without patience can go catastrophic.Because you're driving long buses, the mundane becomes the challenge and the focus. Turning a corner can turn into an accident; too wide and you'll run into the wrong lane if not slam into oncoming traffic. There is no damage for any accident, just a point deduction. If you turn too sharp, you could take out a lamp post, street light or hit a wall.Your goal is so simple, yet challenging; stop at designated points, pick up passengers and drop them off; that's it. Oh it sounds simple, but its still difficult. Stopping without slamming on your brakes, having to rush to your next stop without infractions and of course waiting for people to get on or off your bus. You never see them enter or leave, they just disappear from the bus stop.For what it lacks in human animations, it makes up for details in the city you drive in. There are firetrucks, ambulances, cars and other buses, but there are nice touches everywhere. Broken down semi trailers require you to shift lanes. You'll find construction here and there and parked cars can litter a road. I never expected the game to go that far to make the world feel real.Another interesting diversity of the game are the highways and off ramps. Its more than just flat surfaces, you'll have to deal with the bus and all of its weight and momentum going up or down inclines. When you drive fast enough, the bus begins to rock. I'm not sure if that's the wind rocking you. It all blends together to make a more believable experience that you need to control these bus beasts.While this is a believable, almost simulation like experience, the points system makes it still feel like a game. At the end of each route, you're score is tallies for passengers, delivery time, bonuses and penalties. The score then gets saved and the top six high scores stay with that route. Its good encouragement to keep trying to do better and better.The game is broken up into six tiers, each of which has six or so routes with different buses. Each of the buses might look different, but they all feel the same. Perhaps there is some subtle nuance between them, but I never felt it. Once you finish a few routes, the next tier is unlocked.Your routes take place in the same fictional city, but this city has a diverse array of places like downtown streets, snowy mountain roads, an airport roundabout and serine vistas overlooking ponds. While the graphics could be better, they are acceptable and around the good level. There are far worse games graphically, but if you expect to be dazzled, you'll be disappointed.To guide you from stop to stop is your GPS that gives you a red dot and you just follow the path. Even better than that is the roads themselves will have flashing arrows indicating your next turn or if you go forward through a five corner crossroad.On top of the city is the environment that changes from route to route. Downpours, night and fog are all here; as is bright and happy days. The rain never felt like it had an effect on the brakes like coming down a hill does.There are only two types of cameras, one that follows behind the bus, which can make it difficult to see any cars directly in front of you. The camera seems to be slightly to the side of the bus, which feels off, but it does allow you to see a bit down your nose. The other camera puts you into the grill of your bus. I would say its first person, but in this case, you see what your headlights do. You won't find any behind the wheel angles here, in fact it makes me feel like I'm less of a bus driver and more of the bus itself.For a game called Bus Driver, I expected more of a career and the ability to select a driver to be my character. Instead the routes have text blurbs explaining them, but they're almost always the same. Later tiers offer a few deviations, such as follow a helicopter, ignore the laws and get prisoners to a new penitentiary without injury. Its this sort of ingenuity that surprised me.In terms of sound and music, Bus Driver is bare bones. The only music is in the menus and while playing the game itself, you'll hear the hypnotic hum of the engine and other realistic sounds such as air brakes and horns.Its a game that is still engaging and enjoyable on some level, so why do I say stay away from it? Bus Driver is a very niche game. There are better games out there, but if you prefer driving games to racing games, this may be up your alley. Its a cheap game, but if it goes on sale, take a risk. Just expect the worst and you might end up having a delightful experience, or laughing that you can anger your passengers from braking too hard.			"

												NOTE: Review based on digital retail release that I have completed.  Not the Steam version. A classic from SCS.The game is basically broken up into bite-sized missions where you take a specific bus type on a single route, picking up and dropping off passengers in a variety of locations and weather conditions. Early missions are usually under five minutes, steadily increasing over more advanced tiers. You're scored in real time along the way for obeying common traffic rules and docked points for upsetting your passengers (breaking too hard, running lights, etc.) along the way. At the end of your route your score is tallied and put in a high-score table.Presentation-wise, the graphics are dated (technically), but since it's a '07 title it takes next to nothing to crank all the settings up to 11, giving the game a clean, inviting look. It comes off as super charming, with a vivid and colorful pallet.  The constantly-updating UI overlays just scream classic SEGA sit-down arcade racer fun.  Overall, the game has a very unique look that gives it a lot of personality.  And because it's going for a more cartoonish look, I think it's aged FAR better visually than older SCS truck-sim titles of the same period.Finally, the game can be very challenging as you get further into the missions.  Obeying traffic laws while keeping your passengers happy and on time takes strict focus, which tests your meddle over longer 10 & 15+ minute routes.I think Bus Driver is a hidden gem from SCS that could be too easily overlooked based on the screenshots.  The game is a ton of fun, more arcade in nature than the simulation that SCS is known for.  Great for short-burst gaming or prolonged sessions.  It's got a nice price tag too.SCS has a free demo for it on thier website.http://www.scssoft.com/download_bus_driver_demo.phpPlay it with a 360 pad if you can. If you enjoyed ETS2 and are curious to try some SCS history, you can't go wrong with Bus Driver.			"

												What is there to say about this game? Is it corny, because it's about bus driving? It's stupid because it doesn't accomodate any guns?No, as a matter of fact I'm glad that I bought this small game for my collection, just due to the fact that it's harder than you might expect at first glance.The graphics are more than adequate on full settings and the controls are smooth. Especially with a Joy-Pad. The busses are nicely done and the sound effects are okay.For this price ""Bus Driver"" delivers and not only passengers, but a nice and relaxing gaming experience for those who want to play something else besides shooters and strategy games.

												This is a wonderful bus simulation that almost accuratley portrays how the transportation system is in real life. Very educational, but there are a few tweaks that need to be made.Pro's: Excellent driving simulation.         Weather conditions.         Detailed cities, and highways.         Realisitic driving.         Hours of gameplay.Cons: No speed limit and the police officers just sit there if you doing something wrong.          Cars in front of you stop way too fast causing accidents to happen quite frequently.          When driving in rain or snow there is barely any difference in your driving like it implies.          Turning the bus is difficult in tight corners especially when there are cars beside you that turn sharply.Other than those issues I expect a lot out of this, and I'm sure the creators  haven't alreeady thought of these and will have more updates soon. Overall this is an amazing game and I would definitely recommend it.   "

												A lot of people don't recommend because they come to this game thinking that they would shoot cops and kill people.  What the heck were you thinking?  This game is what it sounds.  You drive.  You drive.  And you do missions.  No free-roaming(which kinda sucks) but missions.  If you want to drive a bus and pick up people, buy it.  If you want to shoot people and drive cars, get GTA4 or Saints Row 4.			"

												I got the highest rating possible (gold star) in every mission...I had NO REASON to do this.The game plays more like a college project than something professionally made, which is probably why it came unannounced and pre-packaged with Euro Truck Simulator. Either way, the game clearly has love put into it. It's simple, but quirky. Pros: -get rewarded for cutting people off - their velocity drops to 0 as soon as you jump in front of them no matter how fast you're going...this allows for some neat bobbing and weaving in and out of traffic-timer pressure. especially in the early missions, its difficult to drive safely and not be late to the stops...for whatever reason, twas a fun challenge to me-there are prisoner escort missions wherein you dont have to follow any traffic rules -after playing, i understand why such a high percentage of bus drivers are depressed Cons: -every other vehicle can go from a speed of 0 to top speed instantly...this happens often at red lights-the penalty for not stopping at a redlight is 3x higher than hitting another vehicle head-on at full speed-sometimes the arrows on the street that indicate where to turn are misleading -if you arrive at a stop early, you have to sit and wait until youre on time-you don't lose points for being late, you simply get less of a bonus-after completing every mission...there's nothing. no ""congratulations"" screen, no credits, nothing...you're simply redirected to the main menu where you can comfortably regret the hours you wasted on this game			"

												Bus Driver offers 12 unique and detailed buses to drive around cities, suburbs, and the outlying countryside. Your goal is simple; drive from stop to stop, pick up and drop off passengers, and try to stay on time while obeying traffic laws and not wrecking the bus. Easy huh? Not quite.There are 30 routes divided into 5 tiers of increasing difficulty where the timetables are shorter, the routes are longer, and traffic and weather conditions get even more challenging. Depending on the bus you are driving and the particular mission, your duties might vary slightly. One mission might have you taking kids to school while the next might have you transporting tourists on a sightseeing tour or visiting businessmen to a convention center from the airport. And things get really exciting when you get to drive the prison bus and transport prisoners from the jail to the courthouse complete with police roadblocks, chopper escort, and a free pass on obeying traffic laws.I won't lie, Bus Driver can be a bit boring and repetitive, but I'm guessing real-life bus drivers didn't pick their vocation for the thrills. The buses are painfully slow and aside from the few missions where you actually get to go out on the highway you are seldom going to achieve speeds greater than 30-40mph. But that is probably a good thing since just about the time you do get ""moving"" you find yourself quickly approaching a bus stop or a red light or some crazy driver pulls into your lane and cuts you off.The rules for each mission are simple. You have a list of stops and an interval time assigned to each. You need to get to each stop on time, then stay until the designated departure time. This part really threw me, because I always wanted to leave once everybody had boarded so I had extra time to get to the next stop, but you really can't leave early or you might miss a straggler. Remember ""no child left behind"" applies to school buses too.No matter how hard you try it's impossible to stay on time. Between traffic and stop lights my best percentage for staying on time was 47%. There is no real penalty, just a lack of bonus points when your final score is tabulated at the end of your route. You will get penalized for breaking traffic laws, driving recklessly, and of course, crashing the bus. There is even a meter to judge how hard you are applying the brakes. If you brake too hard and cause discomfort to your passengers, points will be deducted.The game tracks a lot of information like the current happiness of your passengers, how many are sitting, standing, getting off at the next stop, etc. When you pull into a bus stop and open the door the loading and unloading counters tick off the people that board and disembark the bus and a timer counts how long each stop takes. One clever element I found while driving the prison bus; the passengers start off with red angry icons and get happier with each sudden stop and wreck.Being a simulation it is imperative to obey all traffic laws, even ones that we, as everyday drivers, might have become a bit lax in. You must signal when pulling away from the curb and changing lanes. You must stop for red lights and not drive too far into the intersection. You even have the four-way flashers for the school bus. The only bus-specific law I didn't see implemented was stopping and opening the door at railroad crossings.Bus Driver has a massive city with multiple areas of diversity, so each missions looks and plays out differently. Sure, there is a bit of overlap in the scenery by the time you reach the third or forth tier, but the routes are always different as are the stops. There is even a day and night cycle and rain and snowy weather, which also affect the handling of your bus. Nothing is scarier than starting to fishtail a shuttle bus in the snow as you speed away from the airport.Of course a driving game is only as good as the controls and physics. Bus Driver nails the physics of these massive vehicles with special attention to momentum and a larger turn radius that makes right turns challenging. The game defaults to keyboard control and it gets the job done while being a bit awkward at times. It's really hard to make a smooth arcing turn with a keyboard. I played the first tier with the keyboard then broke out my gamepad for the rest of the game, but even that presented some interesting challenges, especially with the gas and brake, which were overly sensitive. I really had to learn how to feather the brakes to keep my passengers from screaming in terror.I had my doubts about how good a game called Bus Driver would actually look, or even how well I needed to look. It�s a fairly utilitarian game design that doesn't lend itself to flashing visuals or special effects, but that didn't stop the designers from really making the most out of the opportunity to create a massive living city. Each area of the game world is quite distinct but blends naturally into each adjoining section so you won't even notice when you go from the narrow streets of the city to the curvy mountain roads or the passenger pick-up lane at the airport. It just looks and feels real.There are nice subtle effects, especially for the weather. Leaves will float off trees, headlights will illuminate the road ahead, and there are nice lens flare effects off all the lighting. The city architecture is diverse enough but the textures and signage definitely gets repetitive. The framerate is really smooth and there is support for all screen resolutions, even widescreen modes.The traffic models are excellent with a nice assortment of cars, trucks, and other buses. Naturally, the bus models received the most attention and the look fantastic, complete with realistic physics that cause them to tip slightly during sharp turns. Working brake lights, turns signals and flashers complete the design. There are no pedestrians on the streets and the design for the passengers is limited to static images of people at the bus stop who magically vanish and appear inside your bus.The one thing I really wanted was some selection for camera views. The ""behind the bus"" angle works when you are going straight, but making turns, especially sharp turns, often became blind turns as the camera takes way too long to swing back in behind the bus. It also gets dangerous when following other cars. Despite the bus turning transparent, it is too easy to rear-end another car, especially in the confines of a tunnel.There is a very pleasant jazz theme for the opening title sequence and menus. It's part piano, part drums, and part guitar, and totally enjoyable. Once you get into the game you'll be left with the sounds of traffic, the click of turn signals, the ding sound when you open and close your bus door, the purr of the engine and the hiss of the air brakes. You can even honk your horn but nobody seems to get out of the way when you do, even when you are carrying a busload of prisoner which a chopper flying above you.Of course the best sound effect is the one you don't want to hear - your passengers screaming out in terror when you lock up your brakes, hit a car or glance off a guardrail. I was also amused at the cheers from the prisoners who enjoyed my reckless driving and the cheers, whistles, and applause at the end of each mission always strokes my ego, even if I didn't get a high score.Bus Driver is a surprisingly engaging driving simulation that might just give you some insight into the daily lives of real bus drivers around the world. It's great fun in a non-traditional game setting where you actually feel good about obeying traffic laws and driving safe, rather than running from the police and driving like a madman.			"

												Although I don't have a significant playtime on Steam for this game, I have played it a lot DRM-Free. This game is mainly the reason of me becoming a fan of driving simulator games.Even if this game is not that new or doesn't have excellent graphics, it's still really an excellent game to get a taste in driving simulator world, before getting into bigger sims like ETS or ETS2.This is a bit rougher than ETS2, turning is harder, significantly harder to keep a straight line and it's much less forgiving for extreme faults like hard braking. Still it is one of the best driving sims I had ever played.Definite recommendation!10/10			"

												I bought the Euro Truck Simulator 2 pack for $19.99 when it was on sale, and I found this added to my library a few days after I got the pack. This game is very good to pass the time, and has decent graphics. However, it is not so much of a simluator as a game and there is no free-roam capability (but you can still drive anywhere while playing a mission). This is simular to Euro Truck Simulator 2 in the way that it is very picky; you get points docked for not turning on your blinkers while switching lanes, and the controls can sometimes be a challenge around corners. I recommend you should go through the controls before playing your first mission, because they don't tell you on their own. Another thing: You can't manipulate the camera. Most of the time, the camera is fine, but when driving in the neighboorhoods where there are a lot of trees, they get in the way of your view. The camera sometimes tries to move to help but usually doesn't make things better. The traffic lights also seem to be rigged; they don't stay green if you're approaching them. This annoys me a lot when I'm driving in the city, where there are 5-lane roads that are completely empty, and I am speeding down one towards a green light, which suddenly turns yellow (for what seems like a fraction of a second) and then red. 200 points lost for a traffic light offense. The AI of the other cars on the road isn't the greatest it could have been, too, and they don't seem to do anything when you honk at them. Despite its few disappointments, I still think this is an excellent title by SCS Software, and I think you should buy it.			"

												Bus Driver is obviously one of those ""Gray"" games, which can't take any real prolonged game interest, but not overall Bad to be disapproved.Visuals and controls are something in between of GTA 3 and 4 eras, game missions are all about taking some city bus route, making stops where it supposed to drop and pick up passengers, all the way ""driving safely and responsibly"". My cousin, who worked on a city bus for some time, described that game as ""dull, even if accurate in some details"".Were it up to me, I'd vouch for this game to be installed on some school computers, along with ""Car Mechanic"" and some other software of this kind.Although there, on Steam platform, along my friends and any other passers, exploring this store page by some random occasion... No, I don't recommend to buy Bus Driver. The amount of fun you'll get from playing it is considerably low. You'll not get any real skills of driving buses, except of the very basic ones, like some traffic rules, or knowing the facts of large inertia and turning radius...Could it be better? Maybe. With more adaptive and precise controls, more complex traffic system (including some violations from other drivers), more realistic camera views... to feel myself at real bus driver chair. So far... it is fair, but certainly not the best and complete experience on the given topic.Overall, my mark is 5/10 for Bus Driver as for the game, But - 7.5/10 as for educating programm for schools.

												""Who knew rules could be so fun?"" 7/10I got this game in one of those fancy pants bundles of games for a nickel. And I'm not going to lie, I expected it to be a pretty terrible game. I mean it came along with like six other no-name games for less than $3; how good could it be? I don't know why I even bought that bundle now that I think about it, I was probably drunk or something. However, after playing 'Bus Driver' for a few hours I can safely admit that this is one of the best simulation games that I have ever played. And even though it is truly a simulation game it also feels like an arcade game at the same time. But that probably has something to do with the look and the feel of the game. Just think 'Crazy Taxi' with a bus and some rules. Now I know that rules don't sound like the most fun thing ever, but the best part of this game is, you guessed it, following the rules. Don't forget to use your turn signal, don't rattle the passengers too much or they'll leave, don't brake too often, don't brake too little, etc. You can see where I'm going with this. Another great aspect of this game is how true-to-bus the steering is, making it a pretty difficult game at times. So if you've ever wondered what the life of a bus driver was like, grab this game while you can. And if you really want to make this game realistic, have a few drinks before picking up the controller! Happy driving.			"

												Does exactly what it says on the tin. Pros Drive buses Select from a variety of buses Increase in difficulty as more routes are completed Signal lights have a function Can be modded with the right tools and knowledge Realistic screams from passengers during crashes or sudden breakingCons Could use a hardcore bus driver mode (gas usage, aggressive drivers, etc.) I believe the only song in the game is played at the title screen, and it's not ""The Wheels on the Bus"" No Steam Workshop supportAbsolute perfection for what it is. Does not strive to be something it is clearly not. Stays within the boundaries of the genre while managing to be fresh.If you are looking to drive buses, this is the game to do it. If you are not looking to drive buses, this game is clearly not for you and you should look for games that cater to people with poor taste (such as yourself).			"

												Even though it's mission-based instead of open-world (like ETS2, which I love), I'm enjoying this one!  It's not for everyone, as the game is rather slow-paced and requires concentration rather than quick reflexes. The graphics are dated, but they look nice for what they are, and the game does run in full HD. The city (and suburbs) we're driving in for the missions is large and detailed. There are weather effects like snow, rain, storms, and I personally found that snow-covered roads do affect the driving slightly.The game runs flawlessly on my Win7 64-bit system with an AMD Radeon card. I'm using an XBox 360 game controller, which I had no trouble configuring (doesn't recognize the D-pad, but the rest works fine).			"

												So I'm driving in the bus lane, late but not too late, no ""mistakes"" yet, light turns green, I'm going straight and the bus in the lane next to me decides to turn right into me which makes the whole bus scream in shock. Meanwhile I'm still trying to go straight and the bus is stuck to me like f**king gum.  I finally get to a stop and have to back up still stuck to the other bus, while still getting penalized for points for being in a collision.  I fnally got un-stuck and drove off while my customers are p*ssed and my points went out the window.Is this a game to fufill your desire to drive a bus?  Yes.  Is it a game that you can love AND hate?  YES.  It's a lot of fun, but it's old and has a lot of stupid things that can get annoying.  You're always pressured to be the quickest way possible and with the crappy mechanics, it makes it harder.  I've been on time, and found out you have to wait until you reach the time before you can go, which is realistic, but then I end up being late for the last one for no reason.  The timing doesn't make sense.  ALSO, they perfectly timed the lights, traffic and everything else to make sure if you are the fastest, you will make all green lights... but if you are a few seconds behind, you end up being screwed and have to wait at a red light being honked at.In some missions, you literally have a free ride, you just drive straight and there's like 20 cars in the left lane, but the right lane is free so you can get the fastest time possibile.  So that takes you out of the immersion not having cars in front of you stopped at the lights and stuff.Also the AI stops INSTANTLY and goes to full speed from a stop INSTANTLY.  The braking?  If you're using a keyboard you have to keep tapping brake and if you go a big too far... BAM -100 points and all your customers scream like you put your pants down to show your big hairy shlong.PROS:Okay graphics for its timeFun at timesFun to play in different conditionsMany different buses and missionsCONS:Drivers honk at you for stopping at red lightALWAYS pressured to be on timeBraking is annoyingCrappy AIWeird turning that really screws you upBad points system - 200 points for going through a red... 50 points for hitting somethingNo free roam (Or I couldn't find it)No cockpit view, only bumper view and third-personOverall this game is fun, but buy when it's on sale.  There's a lot of bugs and it's annoying.  I still beat all the different missions.			"

												Fun addictive game that is fun to play. The objective is to do a bus route on time, without upsetting passengers (Braking too hard, crashing, honking at them to get on the bus faster), and without breaking any road rules. However, don't buy this thinking it is a full-on bus simulator as it is not that realistic.			"

												Simulaion fans should be having a good time in this. A flawed but fun ride with detailed penalties and that penalties makes you nervous all the time while driving. It enables you to  focus and concentrate for not doing mistakes so your hands will be locked to the game while riding the bus. And in that focus moment, when I hear passengers screaming, It scares me to death and I jump on my chair. Not the best simulation but you can get it on sale or in ETS pack. Pros:-Nice penalties-Lots of diffrent busses/missions-Swift controls-Nice scoring system Cons:-Outdated graphics-No cockpit camera-Red Light / Timer incompatibility-Lazy presentationOverall Score: 6.8/10			"

												This is my go-to game when I need something that can be played for 10 minutes. Graphics is quite dated, but at least other vehicles mostly follow traffic rules. I do wish that it would be possible to have camera positioned inside of the bus and be able to turn your head. Driving double decker bus from external view is hard, as the bus itself blocks big part of the view to forward.			"

												I've played the downloadable version a fair bit but re-bought it on Steam for convenience. It's a fun causal driving game. Compared to ETS/ATS and OMSI it's quite arcade, however that does not mean the game is easy (let alone not fun). It's a challenge to keep the passengers happy and arrive at the stops within time. However that's partly where the replay value lies. It's a game I do replay every now and then because other bus driving games don't offer the same variety as this one does, not without buying a whole bunch of expensive DLCs. Personally I see it as a nice complement to the more hardcore bus driving sims. It works well with a 360 controller. For me it runs perfectly on Windows 10, for others it doesn't.			"

												I like this game it is good fun. The graphics are good enough and as other people have said in other reviews, it is quite relaxing. In the game, you drive a bus and you have to make sure you follow the rules of the road. I can't drive in real life and frequently get stuck waiting around for buses (in fact yesterday it took me three hours to get home from work) so it is nice to be able to have control for a change and actually drive one in a game. I bought this in the sale for £1.39 and it was definitely worth the price. I like the funky music on the options screens as well.It took me a while to realise you are not supposed to go through red lights and that you have to indicate when you leave a bus stop, but then I am no driver and have also played far too much Grand Theft Auto. I think that is one of the things I like about this game, it is realistic and makes a change from running people over like you do in a lot of other games. I feel a sense of achievement when I finally get the passengers to their destination without having distressed them (too much).			"

												I actually never meant to buy this game but I simply got it along with the Euro Truck Simulator 2 Collector's Bundle. That being said I'm not someone who would shy away from a ""free"" game so after playing hours and hours of ETS2 I got bored of my truck and decided to give Bus Driver a shot.Boy was I disappointed, your start out at ""tier 1"" in which are maybe about 5/10 ten bus jobs I'm not really sure. I went with the very first one your typical yellow American schoolbus. The first thing I noticed (besides the outdated graphics which where to be expected) was that there wasn't an actual ""inside view"" in this game you have two views either the classic ""look from above view"" or the ""all the way upfront"" view in which you are low to the road and only see the road.Being a little disappointed and probably a bit spoiled by ETS2 I decided to start driving and it actually went pretty well until I got to the first corner. It steers extremely heavy which might or might not make the game realistic I wouldn't know but it makes driving it a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and not something you'd do for very long. So here I came to my first stop I nicely parked it in the designated spot and waited. It probably took me about 10 seconds to figure out that the green text on the top of the game had stopped giving it's normal traffic plus or minus points depending whether or not you stick to the rules and it had been replaced with ""press enter to open the door"".Now this probably supposed to be the fun part of the game when you have picked up your passengers they will be happy or unhappy depending on whether you stick to the traffic rules, drop them off on time, don't brake too hard and several other factors. I myself got bored of this very quickly because there is very little traffic on the road which made it way to easy. Nonetheless I found myself to the end with quite an acceptable score and wondered how much I'd get paid. Well you don't you see your score on the highscore list and you select the next level. Kind of like your old fashioned arcade game with the joystick and the 3 buttons.I ended up playing 2 more levels to see if there was any difference whatsoever in the busses and I must admit they drove a little better then the first bus but not enough to be a game changer.My advise if you are a fan of the old fashioned arcade games or simply haven't gamed a lot you might enjoy this game. If you've had a taste of what the games today are capable of do not buy this game you will be sorely disappointed.			"

												I really enjoy playing this game every now and then. It was really easy to learn, which gives my brain a break in between mentally taxing tasks. It's not a real in depth simulator. You're not going to be able to control all of the actual functions of a bus beyond the basics. If you like cruising around it can be fun, though.While I wouldn't recommend buying it at the full $7.99 price, for a couple of bucks during a Steam sale you can have a game that passes time pretty well.

												The game looks old lets start with that right away. Not saying it looks terrible but does look old. However the resolution does support 1680*1050 so thats a plus. So it looks  good on a modern system as in you dont see any black bars on the side. The game is very arcade like. The bus does feel heavy and does take some time to stop and you get penalized for not using blinkers and braking to hard and so forth. You get bonus points for not running red lights and using your blinkers.The people act like cardboard cutouts. They do not move they just disappear into the bus and out of the bus. The city is big and somewhat ok looking. The fast food places where you drop people off have animated signs and their is weather effects in the game like snow. The camera view is not great. You have 2 views  one in the very front and the chase one. The chase camera is a little on the lazy side and doesnt always give you a good view. I went with the front of the bus view for better control of the bus.The music is terrible and not good. Sound effects are good. My Xbox360 gamepad I did finally get it to work however  I could not get the braking right so  I used Joy to key. Its free and works well. You can look this up online to download and use. They do have different buses you can drive so thats a plus. Overall I would recommend this if you can get it on sale. The original asking price of $10 dollars is a lot on the steep side. I bought it online for $4 dollars with 7 other games. The sale is still going on for another 12 days. Bundle Stars online. Also the other nice plus is the missions dont last all that long. Its very arcade like game.So I finished the game. Took 7 hours. I had fun playing it. Some of the faults of the game that stand out lane changes penalties sometimes are random. Bus can go out of control very quickly. A very much arcade like experience.			"

A proper controller is recommended, since most of the driving requires quite a bit of accuracy and finesse. Graphics and audio are ok...ish.			"

												Driving a bus is alot harder then I thought it was. Also, this is a game I am more likely to play like once and then never again, I bought it in a bundle with Euro Truck Simulator and so I was like ""Since I bought it, why not play it?"" then I began to play it, but I would recomend buying this game on sale, or if you're really into busses. Fun game, glad I now know what it's sorta like to be a bus driver, 7/10Seven outta ten because it's not one of thos games you'll play alot, maybe a few times and then never again... But it is a fun game, and interesting.			"

												If you're looking  for a bsu simulator, this is not it.However, what this is, is an arcade like bus driving game. Personally, I don't like it, but I'm sure some of you will.Reasons I dont like it-You get penalised for doing the slightest thing-I hate the brake intesnity meter or whatever it is, stupid passengersReasons I like it+Its a laugh+The AI can be hilariously stupidIf it's really cheap, go for it.If you respect yourself, don't go for it.

												I know its a dated game but its very tricky to drive a bus in traffic when your vehicle is the only one that is bound by gravity laws.When vehicles in front of me suddenly drop to stand still in a micro second at instant red light shifts, bang goes my nice little bus and weeee! goes the passangers in a choir of instant unhappiness in the back.Then at green light, the vehicle in front of me jumps to lightspeed so fast it would make a Bugatti Veyron blush and i'm left in the dust with my slow gear shifts.And thats just a normal day at work!Steering controls are as would be expected considering the age of the game and I find myself playing tip toe ballerina on the keyboard trying desperately to make small adjustments with those on/off keys. It ain't easy but it's a living!Fun for a few hours but not something worth actually paying for in 2016.			"

												Simple, fun, rewarding. Perhaps a little steep at $8US so maybe consider grabbing it on sale. Be aware that this isn't a super in-depth simulator, but there is a healthy trade off for fun game play over realism here which I like.Also, extra points for really cool menu music. :P

												NOT RECOMMENDED because of the priceI got this game as part of a bundle, keep that in mind.After buying the Euro truck Bundle, I noticed this came with it. I tried it and it sucked. A few months later I tried it again, but this time I made sure all the settings were maxed out, and I was playing at 1980x1080. The game suddenly became interesting! The game is very fun to play, as the missions are addicting and the controls are fairly simple. Obviously, this isnt a OMSI2 or FERNBUS simulator. It is very simple yet elegant for its release year. Basically, if there is one way I could tell what kind of game it is, it would be like an Iphone app. The graphics, Missions and controls remind me of games that I play on my phone, but on a computer and using a keyboard.Now, the reason i dont recommend it. THE PRICE!  10.99? (Canadian)  that is unbeleivable for a game like this, if anything i'd price this game as 1.99 or 2.99, just like a normal app store game.All i am saying is do not buy this for its price, if you want to drive buses go to the app store or google play on your phones and go play those, they are free and are basically the same as this. But since this is a review, I might aswell rate it and list my pros and cons.Rating 7/10 ... -1 for price = 6/10pros:-fun missions-relatively big map-""bumper"" view-Indicators and functional mirrors-realistic sounds-6 or so buses-missions that start easy but get hard fast-accually hard to get a perfect mission.-Graphics and gameplay (for the year)cons:-Price- No cockpit view or camera movement-no physics, or barly..-Controller settings (xbox or steering wheels) don't work well-Price-Weird braking system (cant brake too hard or you loose points)-Passengers dont like it fast :/-Price			"

												This is obviously a niche game, so unless you know what you're buying, be prepared for disappointment. The game is great for what it is, but it is what it is: a slow paced game meant to simulate real life scenarios. If you enjoy speeding down the street in your fast car while playing GTA or NFS, this game might not be for you. Also, SCS' trucking games are different too, because between cities, they don't have that many rules to keep you tied. Bus Simulator feels more restricted, because you play in an urban area. You have to mind the street lights, the cops, watch your speed, be considerate of your passengers, etc... This all means the game is not bad, but it ain't for everybody either.			"

												Can't imagine this being much fun with keyboard input only.Hey, ho - worked perfectly with my Thrustmaster steering wheel and pedals!Don't fall asleep at the wheel = you get penalised for drifting out of lane.Biggest gripe is being penalised for traffic lights turning red hafway through a turn! (ie when lights were green at start of manoevre!)Wheel and pedals destined for the tip as I'm not into racing games. So glad I saved them if only to play this - now one of my favourite sims!Oh, quick PS - love the London-centric destinations whilst driving on the wrong side of the road!			"

												The driving is actually really well done and the city is designed wellIt's just a shame that the game itself is so restrictive that if you actually want to make progesssion you better be able to face the sheer boredom of actually being a bus driver. It can be pretty comfy, but that feeling is gone halfway through one mission. You can try and have some fun by going off your designated track for the level but cover your ears because all you will be hearing while you do it is ""WAWA"" as the game tries to direct you back to the next bus stop.

												If You do not follow the time table and just driving, it's somehow good. If You take this game seriously, it's bad as hell sometimes. Overall not a good game, had a lot of potencial in it. Also have some major gameplay issues (camera, other cars have ""flash"" brakes and throtles, other cars not really following traffic rules sometimes, etc.).Do not let Yourself trolled, it's far from a simmulation, it's just an arcade game.

												I learned things about myself while playing this game that horrified me. I couldn't look at my own reflection the same way again. Bus Driver asked me all the tough questions and gave me all the tough choices. Do I run the red light and T-bone the Supra? Or do I slam on the brakes and make all my passengers fall flat on my face? Should I really cross over three lanes of traffic so I can make that left turn I didn't know I needed to make until the last minute? Does it really matter whether each passenger is standing or sitting? Is it fair that every other bus in the game except mine gets a rocket start as soon as the light turns green, and makes turns on a dime? All these, and more. I challenge you to find a more profound, more poignant game than Bus Driver.			"

Go on a set route picking up passengers whilst abiding the road rules.  They did reasonably at it, but for the price I can't recommend it.			"

												This game makes my exhaust pipe moist. I stay up all night playing this game and when my mommy tells me to get off i cry in my bed and staring off into the distance thinking about busses. I wish i could play this gae 24 hours a day but I cant. Because aliens invaded my room. Sometimes when I wake up I stare off into the yonder thinking about busses. This game is as competitive as CSGO. It is as good looking as Far Cry 4 and has the best single player I have ever seen in any game.Overall this game makes me moist.10/10 would shove my wee wee into a tailpipe of a bus.			"

												(2.3 hours of playtime when written)DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I have only played this game 2.3 hours but it seemed ALOOOOT longer than that. I only bothered to complete 2 of the 6 ingame tiers. On Steam, I put the game in my completed category because the games tiers are exactly the same, only with longer distances and different busses.Everything in this game looks terrible. It has a nice cell shaded vibe, but being a simulator released in 2007, it is plain awful. The controls are clunky (a bus probably does drive clunky though), the music is okay, and it just feels like work to play this game. I’m sure you’re thinking something like this, “But it is a game that simulates a real job!” Good point, but it is a game. Euro Truck Simulator 2 managed to make it fun and it’s even made by the same developers.The only thing I can give this game is okay music and initial pleasure when I played it for the first time, but that died quickly. If this review doesn’t make you not want to buy this game, then buy it on a very steep sale or in a bundle like I did.I rate this game a 2/10~bottlehead			"

												I purchased the Euro Truck Simulator 2 Collector's bundle and happened to get this with it. I enjoyed Euro Truck Simulator 2 so I thought this wouldn't be so bad. I was wrong. For starters, this game lagged like no tomorrow and I had the graphic settings down too low. I quit after completeing tier one and I'm glad I did. This game took away score for every little thing. One round I ended up with a score of 13. The gameplay is driving around a bus with a fixed camera, which gets annoying after the free roaming camera in Euro Truck. This game also makes you park your bus in a small space to drop off your passengers rather than the automatic parking in Euro Truck. If you want a driving sim, just go for Euro Truck Simulator 2. It is a much better game			"

You are first awarded to drive Tier1 small routes wich later unlocks Tier2-3-4-5-6 with more advanced routes. I tried to have fun with it but honestly i didnt have fun. The roads are narrow and buss turns like a panzer. You are awarded points for driving safely and using lights etc. The steering is awfull on the narrow roads and scenery isnt really fun to drive on.Sadly i wont recommend it. If you enjoy driving simulators get Truck Simulator 1 or 2.			"

												If you like bus, and you want to drive a bus in a game, this is NOT the game you want to buy. First of all the camera angle of this game is AWFUL!! when you turn a bus, the camera angle doesn't follow the bus, so you could see the side of the bus when you're turning. Also, the traffic light is a troll. the traffic light literally turn red as you're  about 150m away to enter the crossing. and there no way you can use the brake to stop in time. speaking of which, Why does this game limit you're using the brake, in other SCS game, non of them have brake meter, which limit you how hard you can brake, and it's also stupid because with the brake meter that only allow you to brake at a certain point, it takes forever to stop the bus. and it feel like some of the bus braking is so unrealistic. The speed of the bus is also unrealistic. First of all how could a city bus can drive 40MPH on a street road, while when the tour bus go on the highway it can only go as fast as 55MPH, which most tour bus can go 60 or even 70 MPH on city Highway. The map is pretty big, but I don't get why one part of the map is like summer weather like and the other part where the airport is fill with snow? The bus are pretty cool, the weather is somewhat realistic. The AI is better than euro truck simulator 2. but the graphic look pretty outdated. so if you want to buy a REAL Bus simulator game try OSMI, or bus simulator 2012, that has better graphic and more realism than this game			"

												As a vivid lover of simulation game and the immersion they provide, this game however does not offer that.Love the idea of the sim, but the controls are too locked up that it is hard to enjoy. Love that they are picky about your driving such as not using blinkers, smooth stopping, etc. Graphics are only ok especially in comparison to Euro truck simulator 2. Controls are too tight and barely respond. Like no controller support at all (would make the game more enjoyable).This game has so much potential but jst needs more invested in it to make it worthwhile of the money. Glad i got it cheap in the euro truck bundle			"

												This game is not for the light hearted. This game is very brutal, the carnage in which you can induce upon not only your passengers but other people on the road is insane. If you like GTA V or games of that manner you will LOVE. L.O.V.E. LOVE this game. It features all of your favourite mechanics including; Blinkers, screaming children, red lights and death. Please keep in mind that this game is not for young people, if you are under the age of 17 you should ask your parents first.I personally have not played much time in this game and I already think that it's great9/10 - Chubby Swag			"

												Absolutly terrible. there is no first person camera. There is absolutly no controller support at all. The scenery is something out of 1999. The list goes on and on. Due to ets i thought scs could do a proper bus simulator but evidently not. I am ashamed to have spent money on this terrible game			"

												I woke up this morning and thought to myself ""Well, I am a borderline alcoholic who hates the public, I think I might become a bus driver""  And before I knew it, I had downloaded Bus Driver the game and I am now as happy as a pig in Sh*t driving around a fictious town in a yellow bus.Now, in my country (the UK) we put people who are...em...shall we say on a spectrum of some sort, on yellow buses and transport them to Day Centres, specially adapted swimming pools and facilities with rooms that have padded wallpaper.  However, because this game is set in America you get to transport loud, obnoxious and seriously over weight people around various destinations.Is this game fun?

												This was the first ever PC Transport game I played when I was younger so lately I decided to buy this to see if it was as good as I remember it to be. And it still feels like a SCS Software classic okay there are a few bugs and the bus stops jump you to the correct angle and position making it feel a tiny bit fourced. But the game has good handleing and controls even for the time it was relesed. Okay the graphics are not as good as Euro Truck Simulator 2 ( also made by SCS Software ) but thats because its a older game so its to be expected If you Injoy SCS Software games then I would recomend you get this classic bus game			"

												Remember the old cruisin' USA style games for N64? That's what this is like, except buses. However, unlike just flat out racing, you have to pay attention to your braking, traffic lights, turn signals, proper door operation, etc. Very arcade style - and not so simulator like - but fun to play. Get it when it's on sale. One of the cons - I'm using a Logitech F310 gamepad, and the steering is so finicky. I've tried adjusting the steering deadzone and non-linearity but I can't get the steering to turn quckly when I want it to turn. Might just be the game controller, as I remember playing this with a wheel when it first came out and it was fine.			"

												It's using older modeling graphics, but it's still cute enough to play around with. I can tell that Bus Driver was just a practice run to test ideas with, and anybody who has also played ETS2 would know what I'm talking about (but that's another story for some other day) - :)I'm not a wheel controller person, I'm strictly a keyboarder who knows how to simulate a wheel on arrow keys. But the technique requires good clean coding in the game for it to work properly. Fortunately, Bus Driver does have good keyboard response times and works well with a USB keyboard.The game is broken up into 6 scenarios across 6 different Tiers = 36 missions. Obviously Tier 6 has the tricky missions, more stops, more turns, more intersections and traffic lights, and rush traffic that deliberately gets in your way, but I still find them just as easy as the previous Tiers as long as you watch your speed.My favorite missions are 3-5, 4-5, and 6-5 ... these are all prison bus missions where you must transport prisoners to a specific location. Now, usually you have to keep passengers Happy, but in these missions you have to keep the prisoners Unhappy while trying to keep up with a helicopter flying overhead. However, it's actually more fun to become a rogue bus driver and give the prisoners some joy by deliberately doing demolition style driving and ramming cop cars. It's hillarious entertainment for sure.Bus Driver is okay with the low-end expectations of a simulator, so I'm not going to go there. But, what I will do is list some things the game is missing...1. There is NO cockpit view, in fact what little you can see inside the buses is limited to side shots while stopping at bus stops and turning sharply in chase view mode.2. The passengers are totally static. They do not move. They are not animated in any way. They just stand still, suddenly disappear during pickup, and different ones sort of teleport to the inside of the bus. I'm sorry, but this was a really lame d__khead move for the developers to stoop that cheap, and I KNOW they could have done better.3. Bus engine SFX are not authentic. They are low grade and totally manufactured out of thin air.4. Apparently the handicapped is SOL in this game, because there's not a chair lift in sight anywhere!5. There are no bus trains. Not all that surprising considering the pedestrian population appears to be unrealistically tiny and wouldn't need the trains anyway.6. There is no bus damage or malfunctions available. You just lose points for colliding into things.7. Dual position traffic lights do not exist in this game. There's only one set of traffic lights way the h_ll over on the opposite side of the intersection and that's it. They are very wide intersections which make those traffic lights look like peanut shells with faint LED's on them. It's better to drive at night than day in this game.8. A.I. vehicle physics are virtually non-existent in this game. Example... A.I. vehicles instantly take off at max speed when a traffic light turns green, including the other A.I. buses! They also brake instantly while you're struggling to come to a stop without brake spiking. Not fair, Not fair!9. None of the buses have a properly configured transmission, so don't expect any of them to behave correctly especially while climbing hills, or when jab stopping to change direction.... I'm stopping right there. That's enough for the wall of shame, I think.Changed my mind. I think I will note some of the best features of Bus Driver...1. Love the weather system, which includes rain, thunder, snow and slippery roads. In fact, you're not having fun unless you're driving a bus sideways down the highway. You can also sort of drift the turns, but wheel spin is not being calculated to support it fully. It's an ""almost"" feature - LOL. (hey, I can't help it, I'm a natural lead footer!)2. Buses will do at least an automatic dual kneel, but since the passengers never actually walk up to the bus, this feature is mostly cosmetic.3. Bus doors actually move open/close, but again... purely cosmetic since the passengers are expert teleporters.4. When I mess up, the passenger screams and yells make me laugh every time.5. You are penalized for not using turn signals properly. This is a challenge by itself especially when you come across other vehicles that are parked in the bus lane, and you're trying to race the clock for a better score.6. In addition to being able to roam freely anywhere a road is... If you can maintain a steady speed, then you can also roam freely ""off-road style"", provided you don't drive off the flat Earth, or hit a barrier or ditch and get stuck. (speed is the trick). Some things you can drive completely through, others you can't.7. For the fun of it... you can drive in reverse the wrong way and not get penalized, but you need at least 1 mirror to watch for traffic and you still have to use turn signals. Has absolutely nothing to do with the missions, but it's still fun to do. (how many of you will actually go try this, just to see if I'm lying?)8. This should be # 1, but ... The game has NEVER crashed with me! (knock on wood).Well, that wraps up my fun review today. I've got some bus passengers to terrorize. Cheerio!			"

												After being spoiled by Euro Truck Simulator 2, I can't really say I like Bus Driver. Maybe if I was a teenager and this was back in '98 I'd love it...since that looks like when it was made.Installed to try it out, played legit & got bored fast. I then went 20ish minutes exploring with no care about the traffic laws. The moment the bus flipped, the game reset to the beginning. Now I have to go all the way back to get where I wanted to be. Eh, not worth it. Uninstalled.It's great to play if you're bored to tears & want to waste money. $10 is NOT worth it otherwise. Don't pay more than $2 for this. Really, don't.I got it 'free' with a bundle.			"

												Not the best game in the world, but it's a 2007 classic. It has 2007 written all over it, the graphics, the engine, everything.BUT, it can be treated as a proper game, believe it or not. It has good gameplay, and plenty of levels for the whole family! If that is your thing, though. Anyways, it is a good game! If you are looking for a game with proper graphics and everything a modern game needs, buy OMSI. But if you want a simple game, full of simple levels, simple graphics, simple anything, buy this cute little 2007 classic.I simply love this game. Worth the 9.99 it usually is, and it is worth the 1.99 it is the time I wrote this. Come on, what are you waiting for???			"

												More game than simulation -- New York Bus Simulator 2010 has better models and more precise controls -- Bus Driver replays a simple premise over and over again. The world is large and offers a variety of drives, though lacks realism and good traffic AI.  Nevertheless  the game is fun and addictive. For me, the average of ten minutes per mission is enough to get a bit of reward (versus committing an hour or more to NYBS2010).			"

												Remember the old cruisin' USA style games for N64? That's what this is like, except buses. However, unlike just flat out racing, you have to pay attention to your braking, traffic lights, turn signals, proper door operation, etc. Very arcade style - and not so simulator like - but fun to play. Get it when it's on sale. One of the cons - I'm using a Logitech F310 gamepad, and the steering is so finicky. I've tried adjusting the steering deadzone and non-linearity but I can't get the steering to turn quckly when I want it to turn. Might just be the game controller, as I remember playing this with a wheel when it first came out and it was fine.			"

												This is no OMSI 2 or Euro Truck Simulator 2, but for an older game it's pretty good fun. The graphics, bearing in mind the age of the game, are excellent. Steering is OK, and a LOT better than the steering in Bus Simulator 2012, although not as good as the steering in OMSI 2. You get a good range of scenarios, and passing them helps to unlock higher-level ones. The scenarios are nice and varied, with some set in the city, some in the suburbs and some out in the country. The weather in the scenarios is also highly varied. You get to drive in snow, rain, wind and of course bright sunshine. So you get a good range of driving experiences.One thing the game lacks is a bus interior. You only get two camera views: behind the bus from the outside or perched on the front windscreen. So you can't see your steering wheel, dashboard and so on. Another gripe I have is that the traffic lights are kind of hard to see and also seem to have very short sequences.This is not a sophisticated simulator like OMSI 2 or the SCS flagship Euro Truck Simulator 2. It is also not as sophisticated as Bus Simulator 2012, but is far more functional than the latter and thus more enjoyable to play. Definitely a very good early offering from SCS. I look forward to trying out their Euro Coach Simulator at some stage in the future!			"

												Not too bad! Driving a buss instead of a truck like in the other SCS games, can be a bit less freedom inspiring. This game is not about driving from town to town delivering stuff, it is about driving in A town, delivering people. You get points for proper blinker usage, not breaking to hard, stopping for red lights, transporting people and... thats it i think. An immediate free roam mode (pick a line and drive it) would have been good, instead of forcing the player to take tutorials. Can i recommend it? Well, if you have played 18WoS or ETS2 - then this is a good diversion. Or if it is on sale.			"

And it still feels like a SCS Software classic okay there are a few bugs and the bus stops jump you to the correct angle and position making it feel a tiny bit fourced. But the game has good handleing and controls even for the time it was relesed. Okay the graphics are not as good as Euro Truck Simulator 2 ( also made by SCS Software ) but thats because its a older game so its to be expected If you Injoy SCS Software games then I would recomend you get this classic bus game			"

												It's using older modeling graphics, but it's still cute enough to play around with. I can tell that Bus Driver was just a practice run to test ideas with, and anybody who has also played ETS2 would know what I'm talking about (but that's another story for some other day) - :)I'm not a wheel controller person, I'm strictly a keyboarder who knows how to simulate a wheel on arrow keys. But the technique requires good clean coding in the game for it to work properly. Fortunately, Bus Driver does have good keyboard response times and works well with a USB keyboard.The game is broken up into 6 scenarios across 6 different Tiers = 36 missions. Obviously Tier 6 has the tricky missions, more stops, more turns, more intersections and traffic lights, and rush traffic that deliberately gets in your way, but I still find them just as easy as the previous Tiers as long as you watch your speed.My favorite missions are 3-5, 4-5, and 6-5 ... these are all prison bus missions where you must transport prisoners to a specific location. Now, usually you have to keep passengers Happy, but in these missions you have to keep the prisoners Unhappy while trying to keep up with a helicopter flying overhead. However, it's actually more fun to become a rogue bus driver and give the prisoners some joy by deliberately doing demolition style driving and ramming cop cars. It's hillarious entertainment for sure.Bus Driver is okay with the low-end expectations of a simulator, so I'm not going to go there. But, what I will do is list some things the game is missing...1. There is NO cockpit view, in fact what little you can see inside the buses is limited to side shots while stopping at bus stops and turning sharply in chase view mode.2. The passengers are totally static. They do not move. They are not animated in any way. They just stand still, suddenly disappear during pickup, and different ones sort of teleport to the inside of the bus. I'm sorry, but this was a really lame d__khead move for the developers to stoop that cheap, and I KNOW they could have done better.3. Bus engine SFX are not authentic. They are low grade and totally manufactured out of thin air.4. Apparently the handicapped is SOL in this game, because there's not a chair lift in sight anywhere!5. There are no bus trains. Not all that surprising considering the pedestrian population appears to be unrealistically tiny and wouldn't need the trains anyway.6. There is no bus damage or malfunctions available. You just lose points for colliding into things.7. Dual position traffic lights do not exist in this game. There's only one set of traffic lights way the h_ll over on the opposite side of the intersection and that's it. They are very wide intersections which make those traffic lights look like peanut shells with faint LED's on them. It's better to drive at night than day in this game.8. A.I. vehicle physics are virtually non-existent in this game. Example... A.I. vehicles instantly take off at max speed when a traffic light turns green, including the other A.I. buses! They also brake instantly while you're struggling to come to a stop without brake spiking. Not fair, Not fair!9. None of the buses have a properly configured transmission, so don't expect any of them to behave correctly especially while climbing hills, or when jab stopping to change direction.... I'm stopping right there. That's enough for the wall of shame, I think.Changed my mind. I think I will note some of the best features of Bus Driver...1. Love the weather system, which includes rain, thunder, snow and slippery roads. In fact, you're not having fun unless you're driving a bus sideways down the highway. You can also sort of drift the turns, but wheel spin is not being calculated to support it fully. It's an ""almost"" feature - LOL. (hey, I can't help it, I'm a natural lead footer!)2. Buses will do at least an automatic dual kneel, but since the passengers never actually walk up to the bus, this feature is mostly cosmetic.3. Bus doors actually move open/close, but again... purely cosmetic since the passengers are expert teleporters.4. When I mess up, the passenger screams and yells make me laugh every time.5. You are penalized for not using turn signals properly. This is a challenge by itself especially when you come across other vehicles that are parked in the bus lane, and you're trying to race the clock for a better score.6. In addition to being able to roam freely anywhere a road is... If you can maintain a steady speed, then you can also roam freely ""off-road style"", provided you don't drive off the flat Earth, or hit a barrier or ditch and get stuck. (speed is the trick). Some things you can drive completely through, others you can't.7. For the fun of it... you can drive in reverse the wrong way and not get penalized, but you need at least 1 mirror to watch for traffic and you still have to use turn signals. Has absolutely nothing to do with the missions, but it's still fun to do. (how many of you will actually go try this, just to see if I'm lying?)8. This should be # 1, but ... The game has NEVER crashed with me! (knock on wood).Well, that wraps up my fun review today. I've got some bus passengers to terrorize. Cheerio!			"

												When I first saw this game on steam I didn't think it was a serious game. Probably because I was in a not so serious mood. Reading the reviews at that time I still could not believe it was a serious game. I was under the impression it would just be a game where you could screw over passengers and what not. Hours later I was not busy trying to cause accidents but I was busy trying to be a responsible bus driver. This game became very serious. I really enjoy this game. Driving on the highway has never been this calming. You just have to put on some background music and off you go! This game even got me to use blinkers! I have never bothered in any game with blinkers but in this game I really do try my best to keep to the rules of the road. Ofcourse no game is without a flaw or two and the same goes for bus driver. My biggest annoyance with this game is the timer. I understand that, as a bus driver, you need to be on time at the next stop. However, especially in later levels, this is almost impossible to do. Even if you were to drive through red lights (point deduction of 200) you will not make it. I suppose thats realistic as most of the time bus drivers are not in time but seeing as how it does count up at the end of the level I feel that that could have been made a little better. Not to mention that no matter which bus I drive there is an automatic speed limit on it. There are other busses in the same level that are going faster then I am. All in all it's a nice game to play. If you have some money to spare and you would like a nice calming game and ignore the flaws that I mentioned then get this game. :)			"

In this game the essential is respect the rules of the street i expected something more about this game but still fun just for 10 minutes for day. I recommend this game cause I liked so much.			"

												Honestly, I don't know where to begin.Once I had a dream about the greatest heroes of all time: the modern day bus driver.He is mostly calm, drives at his best all day. This is what you have to become once playing this game for even a bit.Your job isn't just transporting needy passengers from A to B, but more of a task calling for a hero. You are that hero.You are a bus driver!!			"

												Ignore the Hours Played. I've played this for over 50 Hours.Product: Bus DriverGenre: Simulation, SimulatorRating: 7.5/10 Review - Graphics are decent for the era- Still very playable on new computers- Runs on any computer, mine gets 60 FPS- Lots of missions, about 25 Hours playtime- Nostalgia Factors - Controls are stiff but easy- Fast Learning Curve- Awesome Main Theme Song- AI can go crazy at times so there's that- Scoring System is decentHowever,Not worth it at it's full price. Getting this at $5 is still fine for such a game!			"

												An enjoyable bus driving sim with lots of different buses and routes. Once you learn how to brake gently it's a lot of fun to play. Just watch out for the traffic lights, they change very rapidly and it can be tough to stop in time without a braking penalty.			"

												While it may be good value for money, Bus Driver is a very basic bus simulator with very random locations and bus routes.The world map contains different areas for the bus routes to be taking place in. Their names are very random, as for whatever reason, SCS Software has named bus stops as towns in Greater London, and as a Londoner, it is a negative, as they look nothing like their real life counterpart. For instance, a bus route has Beckton a bus stop away from Eltham which realistically, they are on either side of the River Thames Most bus routes are short or are long distance with routes having only 5 stops or long distances with no stops. Many buses have similar routes as there are 5 routes that operate around the Grove Park and Hounslow/ Ewell area.You can only operate a bus route in one direction, with no variation of passengers, weather or traffic, making each playthrough of a bus route the same.The game includes 5 different buses with two buses having a different colour scheme. They are, except for the double decker, American buses, so you'll be driving in the right side od the road. They look ok, but there isn't a cab view or the ability of exit the bus or free roam, so the game is very linear. There are also two coaches, school bus and a prison bus.The game was originally released in 2007 with 5 tiers. There are 6 routes for each tier, making this Bus Driver include 36 routes. You could fly through the game in less than an hour, as to pass a teir, 4 routes need to be completed. Graphically, there has been alot of backlash and nowadays, it looks quite poor, but for 2007, it's good.The game overall is very basic, geographically incorrect and very short. I'd still recommend it as it was my first bus simulatior almost 10 years ago and is good for beginners and value.6/10 Only due to its easy accessibility for beginners.			"

												I love this game. The computer I had when I was a kid had the demo for this game and I remeber replaying it over and over again. 10 years later I bought the full version and it is still fun. Sure it's a pretty simple game but the game is really challenging to get right and if you can get it on sale you won't be dissapointed. The problems I have with this game are, the levels are quite short and a little repetitive, and the 3rd person camera is a little akward to see. But those are small problems and I highly recommend this game if you have a couple of bucks lying around.			"

												This is old game, but it's not bad.Graphics doesn't look terrible, it's decent by todays standarts.Gameplay can depend with what equipment you will play. I think it's not great if you play it with keyboard, but it will work pretty good with any PC wheel. Yes, I said that. I know it's indie game, but it supports PC wheels better than some of the bigger titles.This game is made by those guys who have created Euro Truck Simulator, American Truck Simulator and a lot other truck simulator games, so it should say something.But it can be annoying when trying to steer very hard corners with huge buses.

												Bus Driver is a simulation game in which you work as a bus driver, and need to perform the duties of a city bus driver. It is one of SCS's earlier simulation games, the same people responsible for the popular Euro Truck Simulator 2.Pros:-Objectives are clear and point system works well. Break the rules of the road and you are penilized, drive properly and you are rewarded.-Fair price and offers a good amount of content for the price being paid.Cons:-Bus handles like a brick. Massive understeer and feels clunky-Graphics are aged, as the game was originally released in 2007Overall, this is worth a look if you enjoy simulation games and are looking for something new to play.5/10			"
