												Edited for after I was able to find the last 2 levels....TLDR: Get Dwelvers it's $14.99, and in beta has more content than this ""completed"" $40 game.I'll start this review with what I did like. 1. It's a faithfull Dungeon Keeper clone. It's fun being a bad guy and fighting the forces of good.2. I loved the artwork, graphics, way the characters look, etc.3. The story is fun and well written.4. It is a fun game overall, at a price point of say $15, I would give it a thumbs up. Now for what I didn't like.1. Too much handholding. For example ""you are going to be attacked in 3:45 and counting, get ready here they come"" on every single level for every enemy. ""Here is a big exclamation of where you need to go and what you need to do"" and the narator relentlessly pesters you to go there at a rapid pace, or ""build these unit because you need them"". I would prefer to be surprised when I explore and not have the game lead me through every minor step.2. Way too easy, with no way to increase the difficulty. Build a trap chest at the end of a 4x6 room, preceeded by a swinging mace, and 2 tar pits.. and you can defeat about 90% of the enemies that enter your dungeon.  There are a couple levels where more enemies come in, oh but they warn you well ahead of time so you just prepare for that. They do have an interesting mechanic where the enemies will send the bard in first to disable your traps, but if you put the trapped chest behind your traps the greedy good guys will bypass this and not wait for the bard because they want to get the treasure first, and they all die, every time. I would much prefer a color system, like a green bard can disable x and y traps, a blue bard can disable y and z traps, and no trapped chest that bypass the bards entirely. That way you would have to actually have an assortment of traps to handle different party configs. But no, the level 1 traps kill everything and there is no reason to even upgrade to the level 2 or 3 traps unless for fun and to just see how they work. Surface creeps are equally easy, you pretty much just steamroll everything. I think the original concept was you should only bring half your crew and leave the other half in the dungeon to continue working? But you quickly find out that in every encounter, the 1 or 2 of your army that die are resurrected (with zero penalty) inside your dungeon and start working anyway. So anyone playing quickly finds out that you just take your entire army out and the few that do die can get the dungeon in working order for your return. The one exception to this rule and was an interesting surprise, in that your level 2 healers actually STOP healing when they hit level 3 and turn into pure DPS chars. So I did get decimated once and I was unable to ressurect everyone before they decayed and had to rebuild my army from scratch. But I quickly learned my lesson to just leave my healers at level 2 and never upgraded them the rest of the game.3. Almost zero control over your troops. Example.. So you can make these cool assasins, they can turn invisible and with 2 or 3, pretty much kill a high value target. They get a a high DPS sneak attack when coming out of stealth. So let's say a group of enemies comes into your dungeon and you want to assassinate the bard. Is there any way to do this? Nope sorry! You either sound an alarm bell and watch your troops come in 1 at a time, or you manually pick them up drop them near the enemies and hope for the best. Zero control, they just kinda duke it out and occaisionally use the skills they have. Now the game is simply easy (to the point of trivial) so this is really a small complaint, but if there were any challenge associated with battles, and you wanted to actually kill specific high value targets in any kind of order. Like let's say kill the healers first... You can't. Now on the surface you get a little more control over your troops you can manually click the unit and position it, and use it's special ability. But when you have 12 units in a fight, clicking on each one giving it a command as it's running around is kinda pointless with such short battles. The only micro control you actually do is move the tanks to the front, healrs and dps in the back, and wade into the enemy and it's over very quickly. Ideally you would not have to click on each single unit. I would rather select my entire army, hit tab to select the blood orcs, have them summon wolves, hit tab to select my asassins, have them turn invisible to get a bonus attack from stealth, etc. But combat was seriously overlooked and as a result they just opted for short combats with 6 ""good guys"" against your 12 ""evil"" horde. It's simply a steamroll because there is no combat functionality built into the game. 4. Game sounds and narrator. At first when you start out it's very enjoyable. The narrator is a ♥♥♥♥ and yelling at you to do stuff. It's wonderful! But after the 19th time the narrator tells you to ""Go make 3 orcs and go to this spot on the map I'm sick of waiting for you"" it gets old. This also ties into the handholding. The narrator is better muted so you can explore the game and have fun. instead of constantly yelling at you and telling you exactly where to go and what to build next. The Demon mana generators also make the most annoying noise I have ever heard in any video game in a long long time. Mute, mute mute.. Ahh much better... The game noises are gone and play some Pandora, much much better. 5. Not enough content. If I didn't play through it 2x looking for the last 2 levels (small bug just click on the skeleton icon and it takes you there). I would estimate the game can be completed in 15 hours. For $40, I expect to get between 30-60 hours of gameplay from it for it to be a good value. Compared to their competition, a game named Dwelvers, which runs $15 and I have 30 hours into it on beta, this is not a good value IMO. 6. Spell system. With the exception of ""recall to base"" troops and the ""go here"" spell. The remaining 25 spells are useless and the entire system is not even worth bothering with. For example you shoot a fireball and it does virtually no damage. Shoot a metoer storm? Oh yeah area effect virtually no damage also. Again this is a minor complaint since a level 1 exploding chest does 90% damage to most units. But why even put it in there? The only use I could find for the spells is like a would see a fairie with 2 health left limping into my dungeon, and I wanted to shut the narrator up screaming ""enemies in your dungeon!"" and I could not be bothered to pick up an orc to kill them? Yeah I'll shoot a fireball to do 3 damage and kill that limping fairy who somehow magically managed to survive the 4 level 1 traps who usually dispatch most most enemies. But most of the time you just ignore the fairy, she will run into something and get one shotted soon enough. But yeah, it was nice to just to shut the narrator up and have him stop screaming at you I guess. But magic on the whole is innefective and useless. Closing thoughts....If there was maybe a way to make it more difficult so you don't just blow through it so fast and more of a challenge. It would have a lot going for it, particuarlly the enjoyable art and great dungeon building tools they have in place. I would also like to see an enemy evil guy to compete with, who breaks into your dungeon from a random place, but instead the enemies always come through the main door, 6 every time with zero challenge, run into your traps and die. Also when digging inot a new room full of spiders, have them get mad and charge in to to kill my guys, not just stand sit there until I can get around to farming them for expos. They had some great ideas, just a sad implementation and were probably on a limited schedule for release. It shows.			"

												Worthy successor to Dungeon Keeper.When I write ""worthy"" I mean good. Not better, though.The evil (meaning fun)+ Awesome compaign, was really surpised by that. Yes it is pretty easy. But worthwile by general design and feel - AND, most importantly, due to that awesome written and spoken narrator! Huge amount of jokes and references to games, movies and books.+ Graphics are not breath taking but still quite atmospheric. As it is somewhat comic-lookie-lookie, I guess it won't feel ""old"" too fast, which is good in my opinion.+ Overworld concept for SP+ When ""liberating"" overworld areas, cool change effects to dark side (sadly no cookies)+ Most creatures are useful on their own way, so it can make sense to not all upgrade them to highest variant (although you don't have to care on normal difficulty)+ Different races+ Gold variants make sense (normal, long lasting, infinite)The good (meaning not fun)- Music. Pretty boring. Pretty fast boring. I recommend getting the soundtrack from Dungeon Keeper 1+2 (youtube helps) and play that in the background. Ten times better than ingame one.- Glitches. There are no game braking bugs at least. But there's a ton of smaller stuff getting on your nerves: hardly being able to click a specific monster during a fight. No real feeling for where you drop one. The bright border effect for where you gonna drop/cast at is sometimes really weird. Can't pick up a specific unconsious monster, as the clickable area is not where it lies. Sometimes clicks on spell icons just do nothing, have to click twice.- Performance. Seriously, this games runs slower than Anno 2070 on a huge map as soon as you have 10+ creatures. And weirdly this is CPU limiting here (100% usage on 4x 2,5 GHz), while my GPU (AMD 7950) was bored. Also when dropping couple of creatures in a row and when digging a new area, there's this ""stutter"" after every action/digged block. Really smells like badly optimized engine.- Cannot beat chickens to pulpy messes :/When comparing to Dungeon Keeper:- Less stuff to build and do than in DK (i.e. missing prison and torture chamber)- More casualized feel, e.g. traps damage (remember that huge boulder which just killed everything?), simplified ""who works which room"" and missing skeleton/ghost/vampire/... mechanics- No VS mode against AI Keeper. Skirmish maps just drop stronger waves of heroes against you.- Slower! I do like slower games in general, but sometimes in SP it can get really boring. Mostly due to slow workers (get's better after upgrading them, though)- Some atmospheric stuff regarding the creatures is missing: monsters attacking each other (spiders vs. flies) or the wizards getting annoyed of all the commotion in the library- No real ""feedback"" of higher level monsters. They can cast anything right from the start (after researched), so it feels like you do not have to take such care of them. Which is only partly true, as they DO get stronger. Still feels not as good here as when dropping a couple of level 10 wizards+dragons in DK1 onto the enemy :D (also any creature can be revived anyway)FinallyOverall this is a good game. If you like the old Dungeon Keeper 1+2 go ahead and give it a try.I had quite fun playing and guess will start again in the future. And of all DK like games, this is in my opinion the best successor so far.In direct comparison however, I'd say I still prefer DK1+2 slightly over Dungeons 2.(Sadly DK2 is not working on mine and many other rigs I know due to graphic driver issues :/ )			"

												I've bought the game over a year ago, it was fun to play, but a little too easy. It is a RTS game which takes place in dungeons and the Overworld, gameplay is far away from Dungeon Keeper, but it is fun. Patch 1.5 came out in the middle of October 2015, from this day on the game was unplayable with 1 fps or slower. The developers admitted that there is a memory leak, but they like to keep quiet about it and blame everybodies PC. They have 5 answers ready how to fix your problem, mainly update drivers, but if drivers are up to date and the problem carries on you will be ignored from that moment on. I am waiting over 8 months now for a patch to fix the memory leak, but it doesn't look like anything will happen. They ported the game to the PS4 and promised a fix for the PC after they finished the PS4 version, but so far nothing. Take a look at the forum, there are many bug reports without solution, so unless there is a patch which fixes all the bugs don't buy this game unless you want to gamble.			"

												Almost but no dice.Why do all these company’s just fail to create what they know we want?This game is just lacking and leaves you wanting more Dungeon Keeper it really does.It gives you the feeling  like your about to have a great Evil dungeon master experience then falls short with limited rooms and limited units just limited everything.It’s not an awful game it plays well responds well and the story is even fun. it’s just hard to enjoy when in the back of your mind you know its already been done better years ago and the entire time thats what your craving.

												So this is another occasion where the Steam reviews are irrelevant and leaves me with a feeling of distrust and cynicism  that I often ignore them and have to find out myself whether or not a game is really of quality and not just some cashgrab or bug-infested mess. In my opinion, some of the negative reviews are just blatant lies. I never knew that Steam reviews could ever get to a point of just being pointless to read. I actually wonder if half of the people who post a review really have a brain because some of the stuff that is written don't pertain to the game. I thought all those negative reviews that had around 80% upvote must of been valid since so many people upvoted, nope, some of their claims just doesn't pertain to this game.All this review will serve as is a counter-post to the negative Steam reviews that I feel are irrelevant. Again, this review will be to inform mainly those inquiring about the negative reviews, so downvote this review all you want, this is an actual review of my opinion of the game.SPECS --Gfx: nvidia GT 640 CPU: intel i-3-2120 @ 3.30Ghz dual core Ram: 6.00 GB (5.88 Gb usable) --Optimization: I can't confirm if the memory leak is real or not, but I've got a decent rig and the game ran very smooth, and I have not experienced any crashes from the hour I've been playing before writing this review. As soon as entered into the options menu most of the preset where set all to max except texture filtering which on default goes up to 8x instead of 16x, however, I don't even need it that high but I left alone to test how well my computer would handle this game. Everything else was on high, which was max for graphics settings, with SSAO on and Bloom, however, I turned V-sync off as I don't like my FPS being capped to 60. When I started up a random skirmish match to see how well my rig will perform, I was really surprised as I ran a minium 60+ fps without my computer breaking a sweat, and to remind you now it is just decent, as in, it can't run AAA titles released in 2016. I just wanted to add this as I was a little worried would my rig be able to handle this game comparing it to mimimum requirements, if your rig meets the minimum, it will run very well with this game and will say this game is very well optimized and looks beautiful.  Gameplay: the dialogue was actually entertaining and actually helped immerse in the game. Who ever did the writing is top-notched because it definitely fit the setting and a lot of the jokes were actually funny and relevant. However, if you don't like dialogue the options menu does allow you to control how much dialogue you want to occur.  The gameplay for Dungeons has a Dota RTS layout when fighting in the overworld as the ""ultimate evil"" whom you assume the role as, fights the enemies along with your hoard of ""evil"" minions against the ""heroes"" in much of the fashion of the game Dota. You have a main character, but later in the campaign you can't use him, but I have not checked skirmish mode where it may be possible, I'll update the review after I test this. You can also use special abilities against tougher boss-like enemies and complete objectives and level up. While it becomes a semi-settlers + caesor; zeus; phaoroh affair when it comes to managing your dungeon, where some rooms you'll expand or add interesting machines and furnishes to accomodate your hoard. Curious heroes who stumble into your dungeon can be stalled with traps and intricates unlocked the more you upgrade your throne room, and unlock other tech to make each minion stronger. If you ever read the book Mogworld, the world is very much similar as the one depicted in the book, except you get to be the bad guy instead of the hero. Final thoughts: Dungeons II is an excellent blend of RTS and management that actually works well. The price is steep but some patience will often see deep discounts that can't go wrong with a well fleshed out game such as this. However, if you can't wait I'll say 40 $ is a fair asking price for the quality you are getting, it is a well done game in my opinion. I really felt Kalypso has really outdone themselves with this game. However, to make it up to them I shall pick up all the DLC at base price once I experienced all that vanilla has to offer. With that said, I do recommend Dungeons II to you all who may be reading this, and feel this is a really good game that deserves a playthrough. Thanks for reading, and happy gaming ^^.edit: I was recently invited by a kind user to a multiplayer group for Dungeons II. Still reletively new we could use more members if you are interested in finding a place to gather users who are interested in such affair: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dungeons2players?tscn=1472770642:D			"

												Dungeon Keeper and Evil Genius are the standards that such games will always be held too... and this one... comes in lacking.  Very dissapointed.  I am not saying its bad, and I would like to give a true ""rating"" instead of a ""Positive"" vs ""Negative"" review.  Game mechanics aren't bad.  Could be optimized more.  Larger dungeons lag hard, add that to the fact that both underworld and overworld are on the same screen... can get a bit jumpy.  Its design is still fairly well done.I think for me, the problem comes from its anti-immersion approach.This game goes out of its way not to take itself serious.  Which can be good, especially if its great dark humor... .How can it be ""Good to be bad"" evil Dungeon Lord when the whimsical narrative insults you every 5 minutes (not kidding), and when you finally get a few intense moments of bloody combat where the narrator isn't insulting you, the narrator chimes in reminding you that you are 'just playing' a game.It is incredibly hard in this game to feel like a great dungeon lord (picture Vader in pink, where everyone insults him to his face).  Narrator actually tells you, your minions are mocking you, and what do you, the fearsome ""ultimate evil""... nothing.Following on this ""LIGHT"" hearted approach to dark-hearted (HA) genre is the bright cartoony graphics, and the lack of any evil / dark / scary graphics or items.This game is so close to being just right in mechanics, and then it goes the other direction in the way it presents it.Now, if you replace the jabbing ""BARD"" narrator with intense sinister Hamlin? Replace the Disney Robin Hood graphics with the original (Dugeon Lord 1) darker graphics (maybe add a few heads on spikes and some bones... something, anything sinister), now we are recapturing the genre.

												This is a first impressions review after an evening's play.Overall 7.5/10Pros: Visuals and monster designs are appealing. Dungeon management gameplay is solid and on par with the original Dungeon Keeper games. Some new features improve on DK2 - the ability to fill tiles back in, for example. Primary writing - cutscenes and level intros - is mostly funny. The overworld becomes pleasingly despoiled and Mordor-like as your Orcs clear it of enemy soldiers and fluffy bunnies. Imp slappingNeutral:Economically feels much harder than DK2: Imps cannot carry much gold and move very slowly when doing so Imps do not seem to level up Paydays are very frequent So far there is no equivalent of the infinite gem block Imps need to work to produce food (beer)Overworld gameplay, while fleshed out enough to feel like more than a minigame, is weak compared to a proper RTS. Exploration is quite engaging but combat is all zerg, all the time. This was in line with my expectations, hence listing as neutral.Cons: The Narrator is only about half as funny as the developers think he is, and would benefit greatly from an option to turn off his obnoxious nag messages whenever you don't rush headlong to complete every objective. In particular, struggling to complete an objective because it introduced a new mechanic without explaining it properly, while the game literally calls you a lazy dunce every 2 minutes, is not compelling gameplay (I'm looking at you, fighting pits). Embedded advertising is not acceptable in a full-price game and should be removed. Mouse control is sometimes clumsy. It's not clear where the actual pointer is on the big floaty hand, unlike DK2 where it was always the tip of the index finger. Also the cursor tends to pass behind UI overlay notifications, making them difficult to click There appears to only be three skirmish mapsOverall, the dungeon gameplay *is* Dungeon Keeper 3, and this is enough to overlook the game's shortcomings and keep you coming back after you turn it off because the narrator annoyed you a bit too much for one day.

												This game has a lot of nice things going for it, the aestetics are well designed and while the humor is not brilliant it does have its share of chuckle worthy moments. But, it is abysmally slow. Like in dungeon keeper you rely on mining gold in order to drive the expansion of your dungeon, but where dungeonkeepers imps are efficient little speedfreaks the worker units in Dungeons 2 move more like arthritic old men and very large ammounts of time are spent waiting for them to collect and move gold to your vault so it can be spent. This is further aggravated by a very restrictive population cap that prevents you from keeping more than a handful of workers around without comprimising your army size. It is possible to upgrade your workers to move at a more acceptable pace, but by the time these upgrades become available you have progressed so far that they no longer usefull.The game does not, in fact, have very much content to it, but it is artificially padded by this resource throttling. The campaign is fairly short and skirmish play pretty lackluster. Most of the skirmish maps are taken directly from the campaign and simply stripped off their narative and objectives. I had some fun with this game, but only after i started cheating to give myself gold and speed up progression to something a little faster than continental drift. I cannot recommend getting this game unless these pacing issues are adressed, which seems unlikely.			"

												Slow slow slow slow slow. Takes FOREVER to make progress and that progress is shallow because your hand is held all the way through. This game feels like one long tutorial - when oh when am I going to be allowed to make my own decisions and choose how I want to develop? Evey level I've played so far is simply a 'Do what you are told' situation.I really tried to like it - but I'm just bored of wearing handcuffs. I'm off to play Dungeon Keeper 2 instead.			"

												Dungeons 2 is a Dungeon Keeper style, RTS dungeon builder game developed by RealmForge Studios and published by Kalypso Media. In Dungeons 2 you take control of one of two factions on a mission to spread evil and pretty much annihilate anything that could even be vaguely associated with the word good. You are the mighty Dungeon Lord (the name of the Dungeon Lord depends on the faction you play as) and you must build your dungeon up while defending against attackers from the Overworld, but they are not the only ones who can go on the offensive! Using the entrances/exits within your dungeon you can take the fight to the Overworld and spread your evil ways to all corners of the globe mwahahahahaha *ahem* as I was saying, along the way not only will you fight little minions, you will also fight the heroes of the Earth including demigods who will require all of your strength to defeat!Dungeons 2 has a Campaign mode, Single Player Skirmish mode and a Multiplayer Skirmish mode, I think they pretty much explain themselves.One thing I'd like to point out is that I've never played a Dungeon Keeper style game before so I'm looking at this game as an outsider.+Fantastic graphics accompanied by great visual effects+Outstanding writing which is well narrated for the most part+The Underworld portion of the game provides excellent dungeon building gameplay +The game's humour is absolutely outstanding and had me laugh out loud countless times thanks to all of it's pop culture references including: Celebrity references, LotR references, Spacebase DF9 references, Game of Thrones references (this makes me very happy) and many, many more+Some rather amusing idle animations, especially for the hand of terror (basically a giant cursor which you use to interact with things in your dungeon), leave it alone for a while and it'll start rocking out+Super simple controls and a simple building system+A few cool traps which you can research and then use to defend your dungeon+All of your workers/units and rooms can be upgraded, upgrades depend on the room or unit in question but generally just make them better at what they do+Some nice resource management elements, letting your gold or beer supplies get too low will cause your workers to go on strike +As previously mentioned the game has two factions, personally I prefer the default Horde faction+The campaign mode is a lot of fun and effectively acts as a tutorial for the Skirmish mode+If a unit doesn't have anything set by you to do then it will find something to do by itself thus preventing an overwhelming amount of micro-management+/-The campaign mode introduces new concepts rather slowly+/-Some major review outlets have complained about performance issues but I've had no issues at all running on max settings-If you take too long to complete an objective the narrator will repeat whatever the last thing he said was which gets very frustrating-The Overworld RTS gameplay is a bit too simplistic for my liking and if I'm honest rather boring, it's basically just left click to select a unit and right click to make it attack or move with precious little else-A few of the regular animations, such as when your little snots fill in an area, aren't well done and don't look at all like they shouldVerdict:8.5An excellent dungeon building game with fantastic graphics, outstanding writing to accompany the game's great humour and two factions to play as. If you can look past the Overworld portions of the game then I strongly recommend you buy this game, I for one have thoroughly enjoyed playing it.***This review was written using a key provided by the Publisher for review purposes***El K.

Dungeons 2 is a dungeon simulator for those craving a Dungeon Keeper experience with a much nicer AI but ultimately falls flat in its experience.This review is for Dungeons 2, Dungeons 2: A Song of Sand & Fire and Dungeons 2: Chance of Dragons.StoryThe story of Dungeons 2 is rather simple. You are the ultimate evil and you must build yourself up from basically nothing to a formidable force that can take down the world's greatest heroes. The story is a little thin in my opinion and relies HEAVILY on Game of Thrones so if you’ve never read the books or seen the show there are some minor spoilers. The narrator talks you through the different levels which is as far as the story goes.General Gameplay]If you’ve ever played Dungeon Keeper then the gameplay is pretty much the same (with the exception of the overworld). You start with a throne room in a bare dungeon and a few ‘little snots’ and from there you must build up your dungeon and minions in order to complete the various objectives. There are various rooms you must build and each room does something different like the treasury which stores your gold, tinkering room for new research, arena to train your units and brewery to craft beer. There are around 10 different rooms in total but some require researching them first or progressing further into the game to unlock. Units are pretty much the same. There are 5 different units (snots, goblins, nagas, orcs and trolls) and each unit has a different attack and advantages. Whilst in your dungeon your units will have free will and carry out any jobs you've set for them when they feel like it but in the Overworld you must control them fully yourself (which isn’t fun, i’ll explain further in). Enemies will periodically attack your dungeon so you’ll have to make sure to set traps or place guard rooms to ward them off, whilst digging out and explanding your dungeon. The Overworld is where most of your mission objectives will be found and has it’s own minimap which is on the complete other side of the screen. You can pick up and drop your units through a portal in your dungeon to reach it. Once there you must control your minions yourself the way you would in an RTS however the interface for this is terrible. Different minions have different abilities you can use in combat but you’ll have to select that unit and then its ability each time you want to use this. Considering the battles usually last 5-10 seconds this is completely pointless. Once you’ve researched and built the defib machine any minions that die in the overworld will resurrect moments later in your dungeon so your minions are basically unkillable and you’ll end up just using them like fodder. This makes the Overworld a series of clicking and waiting because there nothing else to do there. There are also dungeons within the Overworld with NO minimap so at times you are forced to watch 3 screens at once which is annoying.Time passes slowly and you’ll often find yourself staring at your screen waiting for things which is probably to try and make the game drag on more. The campaign is ridiculously short without the DLC and the DLC content really should have been included in the actual game. Despite playing around 27 hour around 6 of them were just for achievements and the first 4 came from card dropping. $50 for under 20 hours gameplay (most of which is waiting) is really really bad in my opinion.Pros--- Dungeon Keeper--- Humorous at times--- Pop culture references galoreCons--- Lacking hours of gameplay (unless you’re farming achievements)--- Small number of units (only 5 in total, barely different from one another)--- The narrator can get really, really annoying to the point of needing to mute him--- No time control so some missions drag on for no reason--- Limited rooms--- One dungeon trap layout works every time--- One population ratio works every time--- Overworld is lifeless and pointlessSummaryI somewhat enjoyed my time playing Dungeons 2 but the last 6 hours were for achievements only. I wouldn’t recommend buying Dungeons 2 unless it’s on a hefty discount like it was when I purchased (75% and even then I wish the discount had been larger). It fills my Dungeon Keeper needs but so does Dungeon Keeper and it's significantly cheaper and for me it does little else so if you’re looking to buy for that reason it should satisfy your needs but don't expect anything more. There was so much potential in this game I just feel like it was wasted and I really don’t think the content warrants the price.			"

												Great Game, lots of fun. Controlling your minions with a black and white style brings back all my nostalgia. The tower defense feeling and rts side is outstanding. The game feels a mix of black and white, warcraft 3, Dungeon Keeper, and even a feeling of dwarf fortress. The Combat is entertaining if a little crowded and the AI that handles fighting is extremely smart. Simple right-click into a battle will have your minions not running like idiots to their deaths. If they get hit, they hit back. That being said. It feels like it is missing too much content. -3 maps for skirmash and 6 maps for multiplayer after the release is a little disappointing. Hoping for community maps maybe.-Narrator talks too much. Wish I had an option to mute him or skip the dialogue.-Lag Issues when units are being hit by traps.-Payday needs to either be longer or instanteous. Half of the time the minions are just walking back and forth between paydays.-Minions slack off way too easily requires a lot of slapping.-Demons are currently underpowered and cost too much pop.This games needs to let you play the human Race, like a game mode of dungeon Invader almost. If new maps come out and the lag issues are handled, this game will be alot more fun. It just feels like it is missing something to keep me playing.			"

												It's an alright game. Let's start with the pros.1) Great narration for the single-player campaign. Light-hearted, and constantly cracking jokes, the narrator made me chuckle to myself more than once.2) Graphic design. Again, going for a more light-hearted feel sorta like Warcraft, I guess. Sorta cartoony. Matches the feel of the story and narration.3) Gameplay is simple. Pretty easy to figure out what's going on and the basics of how to play.The cons:1) Gameplay is simple. Monster type is very, very limited. And aside from some upgrades you can get for your monsters, it seems to be a pretty simple case of rock-paper-scissors.2) Limited monsters. For instance, the ""horde"" get orcs, goblins, trolls, and naga. In the previous game, there were quite a few more options.3) The game is based purely around defeating the enemy. There doesn't seem to be any focus on making a dungeon worty of heroes, complete with traps and treasure (and a torture room).All in all, a pretty fun game, but could be better. (Note: I have NOT played with the DLC.)			"

												I'm in love with this game, it's absolutely amazing and super-fun! 45Euros well spent!PROS:+ the art-direction and the animations are superb and who miss Warcraft III will find it very familiar.+ two factions: Horde (trolls-orcs-goblins) and the demons.+ the narrator is funny. if you don't like his reminds you can kill this features in the options.+ awesome dungeon management, it reminds me DK2 (of course). + nice and simple RTS part of the game, when you are outside your dungeon.+ RTS and Dungeon Management are well balanced, so you don't become mad looking outside of your dungeon and inside it. ++ even if the game is inspired by dungeon keeper, it's really a great and fun game by itself, with personal mechanics and pros. CONS:- the firsts levels in the campagin are easy, but this is not bad for everyone. In skirmish you can choose the difficulty and there's also the Multiplayer, that I have not tried.  "

The Good Dungeon Keeper 2 remeniscent gameplay, what's not to like? The narrator does a great job at making fun of the genre, other fantasy games, Game of Thrones and basically anything else he happens to come across. Easy to get into.The Meh The game's economy feels very wonky. Lacking Dungeon Keeper's infinite gem sources near your throne room means that the longer the game goes on, the more spread out your gold is going to get. With frequent paydays, this means that your slower creatures will quite literally walk from their work spot to the far end of the dungeon, get their gold, walk back, then by the time they get back they are hungry/craving worship, a bit bored, by the time their needs are filled it's already payday again, causing them to never actually do any work unless you manually transport gold to a central location. The campaign isn't very long. The demon campaign feels rather hastily tacked on with only two missions, but then again... The demon faction as a whole feels poorly streamlined. Especially the evolution part where you toss a minion into a sacrificial pit and then toss your demon on works very wonky. While the concept is cool, demons tend to get bored/hungry/payday-y while they are evolving and simply wander off. While horde creatures will return to their training after taking care of their needs, demons will refuse to go back, forcing you to toss them in again and start the entire process all-over. This is especially brutal for the third tier creatures, where it can take up to 2 minutes (with improved evolve speed) for them to evolve. I eventually just gave up because they would consistently wander off.Certain options in the game feel vastly inferior to others. For example, you can turn gold into mana as a demon. Why you would do this is anybody's guess, as it is incredibly easy to get mana, as opposed to gold. Then there's the guard room, which feels like it was added just because Dungeon Keeper had it, yet where in Dungeon Keeper you had to worry about multiple points of entry and you couldn't be everywhere at once, you see enemies coming from miles away in this game thanks to the overworld map, making it a rare day indeed where you can't simply scoop up a handful of creatures and toss them at the entrance to block their entry.Overworld combat feels incredibly clunky. You can only use a few skills like Entrench and Stealth when you have an entire group of creatures selected, but you can't actually 'subselect' inside this group. So you have to deselect the entire thing, then select only the minions with the skill you want to use, then use it. Which is all a lot of effort when basically the best way to deal with overworld combat is to just zerg in with a huge group and not bother with skills at all.All in all, it's a fun game, but it could use some polish.

												Ah why did i leave this sitting in my library unplayed?  This game is a ton of fun.  It's a very respectable dungeon-builder of its own right, and it throws in forays into the Overworld conquering the 'rest' of the map.  You start out with a limited selection of units, but they each have two levels of upgrade which ramps them up into much more impressive creatures with a wide variety of powers.  Later in the campaign, you suddenly get to switch to a wholly different faction which substantially shifts your building style and army composition.  The Narrator who talks you through the campaign is funny, if a bit stuck on topical humour.  He can be a bit of a nag if you're a slow-paced min-max kind of builder, but there is an option to reduce or eliminate certain types of comments he makes (which is a feature almost every game should have for any speaking character).If you also go for the Game of Winter DLC, be advised that the difficulty is ramped up considerably.  The assumption is you already know how to play the game well, so a few missions are constant zerg rushes from multiple entrances to your dungeon.  Quickly block corridors and carve a single long route that every invader has to funnel through.  And make sure you sally forth to start neutralizing their overworld spawn points as soon as possible.  This is actually a well put-together game, and is heartily recommended.			"

												First and foremost, this is like DUNGEON KEEPER and NOT like Dungeons 1!That is the one question I most wanted answering before I bought this game. I actually paid no attention to it for months because I assumed it was like the first game, which stole the look of DK and a little of its gameplay, but was basically about setting up a theme park experience for heroes with a fatal end. It... kinda sucked. This game is NOT like that, it is very close to DK. You are picking up and dropping minions, building a lair, and actively responding to kill invaders in a proper dungeon-building sim. Yay!One imporant new mechanic though is that every map has both the underground level, and also an overworld level. Heroes come down from the overworld into your dungeon, as you'd expect, but you can pick up your minions and drop them into the portal to send them to the overworld, at which point you get direct RTS-style control over them. It's not any more complicated than any Warcraft 3 clone, but it works well enough, letting you have both your complex dungeonbuilding gameplay AND a more directed linear story as you send your minions topside and run them rampant through the countryside attacking towns and such. Two playable races too, the game focuses on the Horde which is orcs, goblins and trolls etc, but there are also demons you sometimes play as in the campaign (or anytime in Skirmish) who are visually distinct but play sort of like a remix. For example, Horde need to build a brewery to keep minions happy, and a hospital to heal hurt minions. For demons, these are combined into one room, but that room is WAY inefficient so you have to build it *big*.The visual design isn't amazing but it does its job. There's something a bit generic about it, it lacks any identity or style, like the monsters could have been dragged and dropped in from any of a thousand other fantasy games about orcs and demons. The narrator is a dry english gent but sounds closer to the Stanley Parable narrator than an evil dungeon guy, which is strangely offputting when the rest of the game wears its influence on its sleeve. The game often tries to emulate DK's british humour and is very hit-or-miss where it succeeds, and of course like any ""silly"" game nowadays, it has tons of internet references and throwaway meme puns, but they didn't get grating for me. I did enjoy many jabs at other games in the sim genre (DF-9 and Game of Dwarves particularly get speared), though it's never mean.One thing I appreciated is that it's pretty polished. I've not hit any bugs yet. Compared to War for the Overworld, which had a placeholder instead of an intro video at launch, that definitely puts it ahead of the pack.One big mark in the negative column: waiting. This game likes you to wait around. If ever a game could have used a ""speed up time"" button, this is it. If you want a game where you're constantly active, move along, there'll be times you're just waiting for your minions to dig out more gold from an infinite-gold block so you can afford what you want, or for your workshop to finish a couple of monster upgrades so you can go attack, and you'll just be twiddling your thumbs. Didn't affect me too much because I tend to put on cheesy horror movies on my second monitor while I play anyway, just be aware there's a lot of downtime in this game and it often feels needless.Overall, it's a surprise success. If it had more personality, a possession spell, and that unique sense of humour, this could have been -the- spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper. As it is, it's a worthy diversion and in my opinion, the best of its genre since Evil Genius.			"

												Dungeons 2 at it's core is a game that attempts to take on too much and produces too little.The game is split into two modes, a dungeon mode where you manage your base by digging out the earth and creating specialized rooms.  The other mode is an overworld mode which is RTS lite. And the problem is that it does none of them well.  The overworld mode is a point and click affair with little of the RTS intricies one would expect from a modern day RTS.  The fights are against placed enemy units and bases consist of like 3 buildings.  Don't expect to have to do much microing.The Dungeon mode has you sending out your minons to carve earth and collect gold to fuel the rest of your base.  You get to zone areas for specialized rooms, like a brewery to make beer that will keep the rest of your army happy.  Or a tinker workshop who create toolkits to use for traps and all your research.And traps.. the game gives the impression you get to build this intricate dungeon full of traps.. and you really don't.  The first trap you get to research, the exploding chest, is about the only thing you need about and 4 of them in a line will finish any parites that go into your party. Unless there is a halfling thief who will just disable all your traps and be immune to them.  The best way is just to throw your military units at the adventurers.And the game is slow, collecting gold is an almost painful endevour, you have to set treasure rooms all over the place or it takes even longer for your goblins to haul it.  It almost seems on purpose because the amount of content is serverly lacking: only 11 missions in total.One decently good thing about the game is the narrator, it's the same individual from Stanley's Parable and while there are a number of lines that miss, there are a number that can produce a chuckle.  And while the storyline is about as generic as can be and handled with kid gloves, it is somewhat refreshing to be the 'bad guy' in a game stomping the good guys down.But at the current price of the game, I can't recommend it, maybe if you could pick it up on sale for like 10 bucks it might be worth it.

												If you don't already know, this is a dungeon builder similar to the Dungeon Keeper franchise.  Being a huge fan of this genre, I can say that I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality of this game, even though there are a few flaws that prevent it from becoming an instant classic.  I do feel like these flaws can still be corrected, and judging by the activity of the Developers in the forums, I have hope.  Overall, I do recommend this game.PROS+ Feels more like Dungeon Keeper than Dungeons 1+ LOTS of rooms, traps and creatures to build and upgrade+ Overworld adds a fresh layer of depth+ Fun sense of progression and growth+ Lots of room for future expansions and improvements+ Feels polished and stableCONS- Lack of random world generator may limit replayability- Famous announcer isn't as funny as he tries to be- Selecting your characters is a painful chore (one at a time underground?!)- Huge ""Master Hand"" pointer has zero precision- Commanding a large army carefully is virtually impossible- Keeping Little Snots (imps) working where you want can be tough			"

												Brilliant game, great humour. Some people say it tries to sell you things, they don't understand jokes. But anyway, tons of references, great gameplay if you are into slow dungeon building, if you try to rush levels you can have a good fast paced close calls game too. Currently it's quite new so only 2 playable factions, single player campaign is good, about 30 hours of gameplay and skirmishes are always nice.I give it a 8/10, great game, hope they improve it, get rid of bugs like mono crash (After around 6 hours ingame you sometimes get a crash) and add the undead as a playable faction, as well as other evil things too, there are so many more evils to make factions for I think this game will have at least 2 or 3 DLC's.

												This is a great game. And it certainly brings back some old skool DS1and2 feelings.Instead of focussing on the good. Because this game is worth a purhcase. i`m going to focus on the bad. You`ll work your way around it from there.1:  Turtle game. This game is incredibly SLOW. You need atleast 45 min at least to get some sort of base + units going. Because of this. i`d really like it if there was some sort of fast forward or ""speed up time"" option.2. Little variation:  Sure the monsters are great. And they Morph/Evolve into stronger versions of themselves. Although I find this a tedious task..it`s the lack of monster variety that does it for me. Wish there where more creatures.3. Rather short. The campign is about 10 levels long if I remember correctly. Each level takes a while because of Point 1. However it still feels rather short. A second playeable faction is introduced into the game. But they only get like 2 campaign levels.  which...is just sad :( because they are awsome.4. No end game. Once you complete the campaign. And beat the 3 (yes...only 3)  skirmish maps. The game is really just DONE. There is no reason to go back once you`ve done every level and every achievement. (if yoùre into that. No replay value.now now...DON`t let these issues bring you down. It`s still a wonderful game and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it.So I do recomment.  Just wish my feels lasted a bit longer and a little less slowszzzzzzz			"

												A fun but ultimately flawed game. I picked this up on a steam sale for 20 bucks and enjoyed the hell out of the single player campaign. Will multiplayer or skirmish be as good? Not sure.  I just played the campaign. I just don't know how multiplayer or skirmish will work. There are a lot of things that can be improved upon. Positive+ Wonderful atmosphere and narration. I cracked a smile enough times I was waiting wondering what the narrator would say next.+ Good Dungeon Management game play. I feel it could be sped up somehow but overall it was an enjoyable experience.+ Graphics are goofy and fit all aspects of the game. I was a little concerned about this part but the more I played it the more I enjoyed the look. Negatives- Unit control was clunky and not a whole lot was explained.  A lot of people compare the overworld part to playing Warcraft 3. It's true to an extent but creating groupings and general control felt very clunky. - Room control.  I enjoyed all the additional aspects of the rooms but I feel like they could have better managed how you switch between them.  I was constantly looking for my armory or my tinker shop. Even my hospital was hard to find in a large dungeon. They really needed an extra menu to control these rooms without looking for them. - Gameplay pace.  I play a lot of strategy games but the campaign took me forever to complete when it probably should have taken me half the time. Even the narrator told me to speed it up. Overall 7.0 out of 10.  It's a very good addition to the genre but I have a personal bias for WFTO. If you want a Dungeon Keeper experience, get that game(be aware it's got a lot of issues). If you want something similar and done professionally, get Dungeons 2.  It's far and beyond better than the original. They honestly should have called it something different.			"

												With mixed feelings, I'm recommending this game.  Read on for the full review and gamer beware.Dungeons 2 is a worthy heir to Dungeon Keeper legacy and also throws in some War Craft style RTS gameplay.  The mechanics are incredibly polished and storyline is very tongue-in-cheek but amazingly thought out and scripted.  Anyone who was a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper franchise, or RTS's in general will definitely enjoy this title.Now for the issues which gave me pause.  Unfortunately, I just paid $30 for a tutorial campaign.  That is unacceptable Kalypso.  I love your franchise and this was a COMPLETE DISSERVICE.  After spending less time to complete than almost any other game I've played, it ended just as soon as it had begun, LITERALLY TELLING YOU 'Now comes the real game', and, oh yeah, BUY IT!  As to why I say it's a tutorial campaign, you literally CAN NOT LOSE!  The entire campaign was designed to familiarize the player with the mechanics and trickled just enough resistance to only slow you down before utterly overwhelming your opponent.  Every level was designed to encourage you to easily research all upgrades and 'sandbox' your way to victory at your own pace.  Also, ala Starcraft, you're given the opportunity to try 2 different factions and the third, which I assume wasn't ready for release, is destined for DLC.  Again, the keyword is ""TRY"".  Even the Heores of Might and Magic franchise provides secondary campaigns with it's admitedly easy to complete tutorials >_<So yes, with a heavy heart, I recommend this game, but only bcause of what it could be, not because of the TUTORIAL I just completed.  How about throwing us gamers that purchased this product a complentary, real, campaign?			"

I played through the entire game, it was worth it+ Visually the graphics of this game look fantastic with a lot of detail and color+ Filled with fantasy charm and references to Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings+ Gameplay is fun, you are essentially managing a variety of minions commanding them to mine gold, build structures / traps, and eventually build an army to take out the humans above while they are constantly invading your dungeon to try to take you out.+ A unique multi-layered map, meaning that there's an overworld on top of your underworld with an entirely different environment and you have to send troops to and from to complete various objectives.+ Lots of things to build, upgrades, traps, and a variety of troops + An amazing narrator who essentially tells the story through the cutscenes and as you play with some very well written dialogue and some guinuely funny moments. (At one point I noticed him say something like ""Is this going too slow for you? Well check out the in-game cash shop and buy 20 gems for $100 to speed up the game by 100% Oh wait....this isn't a free to play game. Carry on"")+ Although the game gets a bit complex later on Dungeons 2 does a remarkably well done job of gradually introducing the player to new game mechanics without the need of any real tutorials or any reading.+ When controlling units there's a lot of interesting RPG mechanics where you earn exp, can research abilities, find books to upgrade or give units special perks, and strategically mix various units to give various buffs. (example: using a naga to heal from afar while orcs are in front)+ As you advance in the campaign the game seems to just get better and better+ At one point in the campaign you get to play as an alternative race with all new units with new abilities, structures, and so on, there's yet another race in the Game of Winter DLC- You can't rotate the camera it's essentially locked at an angle similar to Starcraft and other RTS games. It's not that bad, but I would have loved to see alternate viewpoints- The narrator can be incredibly annoying when you take too long to complete an objective.- You have a low population cap in first few missions at 15, which makes things a bit more difficult than they should. Later on you can increase the cap but you constantly feel limited- The level before the last of level of the campaign the ""A Blood Red Wedding"" IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!! Why? Well the length of the mission is far too long inflated by tons of timers. To put it simply every 5minutes you get fight a few enemies and then you have to wait 5minutes to fight anymore (literally you must wait for this stupid timer to tick down) meanwhile you just sit there and stare blankly at the screen waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for hours...until finally the mission ends. :(I ♥ this game!

												This is a difficult game to recommend. It's an example of a game where instead of simply answering ""Yes"" or ""No"" to Steam's question of ""Do you recommend this game?"" is not so easy. If anything, I'd prefer to answer ""It depends"". Since that's not an option, I do recommend it, but with some caveats. If you're looking for the next Dungeon Keeper, this isn't it. It gets close at times, but it doesn't quite scratch the same itch. For one thing, that's because there's a simple RTS bolted onto it. Whenever you venture into the overworld, you gain direct control over your units and play through a Warcraft III-inspired world. The switch in gameplay continues to feel jarring to me whenever I move units from the dungeon to the overworld. It's two separate games -- a dungeon-building sim and a simplified RTS -- and never do you feel like the two mesh. The developer would have done better to keep the same control scheme throughout, which would have meant abandoning direct control over your units on the overworld. The game also suffers from severe pacing problems. It's slow. Painfully slow. Getting through a mission in the singleplayer campaign feels like it takes forever. Matters become worse as units -- even the ones you've taken the time and effort to level up! -- will die fairly quickly. When they die in the dungeon, you can pick them up and move them to the hospital, where they will eventually recover. But if they die in the overworld, they're gone forever. Unfortunately, it takes ages for their corpses to disappear and for the game to remove them from the population count, at which point you can recruit more units to replace them. To expand on this, let me give you some further examples as regards the problematic pacing of this game. In some missions, you'll invade an enemy dungeon. You'll need goblins that are of a high enough level to disable enemy traps. But goblins are very fragile and will die in next to no time, so you really need to micromanage your units on the overworld and in enemy dungeons. You'll also have to fight boss enemies in some missions and it will take ages for your troops to whittle down their defences. In one mission, the boss kept walking around from one room to another, where his own minions would spawn. I lost all my troops apart from the trolls (bring plenty of those!) and it took far too long for the mission to end. Really, I had won at least twenty minutes before the game decided I did. That kind of grind is no fun at all.  Nevertheless, the game does have a lot of charm and the graphics are great for the game. The dungeon looks exactly like you would expect from a modern version of Dungeon Keeper, even if the pace and RTS-like elements don't fit. As such, I would recommend this if you're looking for a sim/RTS hybrid. If you're hoping for another Dungeon Keeper, though; this isn't it.			"

												This is a good game, but it's not worth the high price tag - there's very little content and almost no replayability. There's basically nothing to do once you've finished all the maps (which is around 4-5 hours of content).But the thing that frustrates me the most, is that they've just released their DLC 'Chance of Dragons', for a game that's missing a lot of content - it's just another blow in the face to the players.Do NOT buy this game for this price tag. It's NOT worth it, and the publishers are milking the rest with DLCs.			"

												Having played through the campaign and zero amount of multiplayer, I can say the following.The Good:1) It's a game that doesn't take itself seriously. Filled with pop culture references, narrated by the Stanley Parable guy (which alone makes it worth buying), the game had me laughing several times.2) It's a good mashup between a Dungeon Keeper/Overlord type game with a healthy splash of RTS. The unit count you end up controlling is low enough to where you don't get overwhelmed, but still great for those that enjoy group unit control.3) Great game to stream or record for youtube. People are interested in it, but not a whole lot of coverage.The Bad:1) Much more RTS than Dungeon Keeping. If you're just looking to build an automated dungeon, this probably isn't for you. A lot of unit micro-management is needed. This is partly because of my biggest gripe in the game - 2) Bard render your traps completely pointless. Traps are pretty effective if they go off, however probably like 90% of waves of enemies coming to your dungeon will have Bards who are immune to traps, and disable them in an aoe. The rest of the troop hangs back and just waits for the Bard, and then they just romp through like the traps don't matter.I have had people say oh, just use spells to burst him down, except that's multiple clicks and usually takes 4-5 hits to kill a Bard (and that's if they're not healed). Regardless of how you can finagle to kill him off, here's the bottom line: Traps are not nearly as cost effective in the game as just spending your money on units and unit upgrades to murder your dungeon invaders, and that's about as disappointing as it gets. About halfway through the campaign I stopped researching and creating traps, and then the game really just turned into a full on RTS instead.Still, game is worth it, especially if you can grab it on a Steam Sale.

												So i have almost 20 hours of gameplay on this game by now and here are my findings:So obviously you and I are going to compaire this game to the dungeon keeper (DK) series and the new war for the overworld (WFTO) game. I have played all of these games so i decided that to compaire them for the people that are deciding between these games: so lets begin with this games unique feature: the overworld. In this game you can send your minions up to plunder the hometowns of the heroes. Now ofcourse we all agree that this is a remarkebly cool feature but there are also some minor issues with it:First of all the overworld uses RTS style gameplay instead of dungeon management so you can order your units arround. Now this is verry nice for intercepting incomming raiding parties before they enter your dungeon because you can for example actually force your archers to stay behind your melee guys to save them from a horibly painfull death. Now we all agree that this is nice but unfortunetely the AI in the RTS mode does little more then a ""me orc... me bash"" approach wich makes it necesarry to micromanage every unit. Also some units refuse to cast their spells automatically wich makes battle difficult because you have to micromanage every single unit. Also it should be noted that you do not actually gain anything from plundering the overworld. For example in one the campaign missions you have to stop gold convoys. However when you kill off a convoy you do not actually get any gold. Thus far the overworld. Now back to the comparison. In will number my own comments such that you can eassily refer to them should anyone feel the need to post a comment:1) In case of grapics, this game is in my opnion better then the old DK series but also better then war for the overworld but it also appears to have slightly higher system requirements. I should note here that i do not state that war for the overworld has bad grapics, i just think that these look beter personally.2) In terms of price. This game is by far the most expensive. The old DK games can be found on gog for about 5 euros. War for the overworld costs about 30 euros and this game costs a whopping 45 euros at the time this review was written. 3) This game has 2 factions: the horde and the demons. each faction has 12 units devided over 4 catagories and 8 rooms. It should also be noted that there is no way to convert heroes into villans in this game whereas you can do as such in the DK series. In my opinion the number of units and rooms in this game is rather low when i compare it to the WFTO and DK. I would prefer a merged version of the 2 factions in which the number of possible rooms increases.  4) When comparing the dungeon management gameplay to WFTO and DK, i always had a sense of ""i have to rush this"" in WFTO. So peronally i like the gameplay in dungeons 2 better then WFTO. But your own experience can be diffrent ofcourse.5) WFTO has far more skrimish maps in their release version whereas dungeons 2 has only 3. Now i expect that this number will increase at some point in time but i personally fear that they will bring out the ""new"" skrimish maps as a DLC which would annoy me greatly becasue imo they should present in the base version of the game.Thus far my comparison of these games. If you feel that i missed something please tell me and i will endevour to add a section about that specific topic.The only thing left to say would be: Should you buy these games?My personal opionion? YES! but then i feel this way for all Dungeon-keeper-like-games including DK and WFTO.			"

												This is sort like a mashup of warcraft, sim ant, and dwarf fortress. As a fan of all those games, I enjoyed it.Seasoned RTS players like myself may get frustrated with some of the controls in the RTS part of the game, they are not nearly as tight as Blizzard games, micro is frustratingly hamstrung by weird click hitboxes and unit mechanics. However there were enough positives for me to overlook that.			"

												Initially I picked this game up on steam sale, only knowing it had some serious hindering bugs on its release. However at this point I can thankfully say throughout my whole playthrough I encountered no bugs at all and it was one of the funniest things I had seen in a long time.So to kick things of, the game doesn't focus too much on setting up a dungeon, since defending it is easy but by consistently sending troops above to go on missions. That is against the preference of some but I found it to be a satisfying strategy experience. Aside that the resource and upgrade systems are balanced while the units and factions presented(Demons and Horde) feel different, which is good.Finally I believe the biggest positive aspect of the game is the campaign. Holding a satisfactory length, it is literally decorated by the game narrator(whose name evades me at the moment but you have probably seen him from Stanley's Parable where he was pretty much the star of the game) who offers scathing comments on everything, from the events that happen to reacting when the player does nothing(please do not do nothing for 5 minutes on the first dungeon mission, you will love the response).As if that wasn't enough the campaign has tons of popular references concerning the enemies you fight and what they say, most famous ones stemming from Lord of the Rings and Warhammer to other games from the same developers. It even has a specific mission dedicated on referencing the Game of Thrones characters, each one in a unique and hilarious way.Also worth noting the achievements are nothing hard and can be achieved by one multiplayer game and through the main campaign. After saying that I definitely believe the game is worth the purchase, now that it works properly you can enjoy the fun it offers to the fullest.Heavily Recommended			"

												I am really enjoying this game. I love the mix between dungeon management and rts styles of gameplay. For those of you who have not played the game yet, you are the ""Ultimate Evil"" and you build up your perfect dungeon in the underworld and periodly send your troops to the overworld to fight, capture objectives, or free allies. You can spend your time making your dungeon be perfect, while also seeing your effect on the overworld by spreading your evil presence. You are attacked periodly in your dungeon, thus building traps, posting guard rooms, and having a good balance of troops in your dungeons and in the overworld. There are 2 factions that you can play: the horde and the demons. Each faction has 4 or 5 units as far as I can tell, and you can train those units and upgrade them into specialized classes. For example, you can train your weak archer's to be healers, etc. There are 3 game modes as of right now: Campaign, skirmish, and multiplayer. I have not touched multiplayer so I cannot comment on that but I am loving the campaign. I have played 7 of the missions and the narrator's humor is very enjoyable. Sometimes he does get a bit annoying if you take very very long in a mission, by long I mean over an hour. I am waiting to go into skirmish until after the campaign, but there are 3 maps with some customizable options. The most noteable would be the endless mode option. To sum up, I am loving this game. I highly reccommend it if your looking for a Dungeon Management game. The art style, comedy, and mechanics are all very well implemented in my opinion. Enjoy building your dream dungeon!			"

												I'll keep it short: This is a good game. Certainly not Dungeon Keeper since it brings it's own ideas into the mix. This doesn't make it worse in any way or form. Some mechanics could be better and more fleshed out but they are solid. For example: When in RTS-Mode (Overworld) why can't I Attack-Move my units? Or why can't they take a formation? I have to micro a lot that way leaving my Dungeon to itself. Small criticisms that will hopefully be fixed in Dungeons 3 (if they make it, which I hope!).This though is a very solid and easy pick, narrated by the Stanley Parable narrator who's delivering one trashy, witty, funny line after the other. The Story is full of references and easter eggs to other great fantasy worlds and overall funny but not very special.I personally like the artstyle and graphics, the sounds are good... yeah. I mean there is nothing else to say really. It's a solid, good game that's just not outstanding but totally worth your time if you like this type of games.			"

												At some point it is an enjoyable game, but despite all my experiences so far slapping away minions to work faster for me in the game, I don't seem to think the proper value of $20 with just two factions, not to mention how little the vanilla content offers sit well with me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not exactly saying this game is total crap and here I am protesting for more beer in front of the throne room. Just look at the price of the expansions, disregarding their parodies toward the books written by George R.R. Martin.All I'm saying, the least they could have done more is to focus on variation of battles. The food capacity to work on isn't enough to stage a grand battle visualized by the player. C'mon, who doesn't want a great war spiced up by the quirky announcer/advisor. The main reason I don't want to recommend this game is because of the price and the satisfaction gained. It is not enough to slap every minion to fill my desires of sadism. I rather recommend this game during sale. You'll have a better level of satisfaction with a discounted price.			"

												Dungeons 2 has all the stuff for a good game, but the stuff hasn't been used to create enough content. I read somewhere that it has about 20 hours of campaign and I actually thought that it was a glitch when I couldn't continue after the last mission / 10hours of playing. I honestly felt like the game had only just begun. I tried some skirmishing after that, but it felt like playing exactly the same content over and over again.I wouldn't rate the game as ""not recommended"" if the price tag was right, maybe something close to 10€, but 45€ is way too much to pay for this short game. It should have had 20 or so more missions with different races and with some sort of storyline between them, Frasierish narrator doesn't make up for all that.			"

												I would only recommend this game if it's being sold dirt cheap.The Narrating is great and funny. The gameplay is fun.The only problem is the very short campaign.The gameplay and choices in minions isn't that much compared to Dungeon keeper 2. Also, exploring around in the dungeon isn't that rewarding.Another negative is when playing the campaign, you never run into rival evil doers. Just boring waves of mobs. You can go on the surface aka warcraft 3 simplified mode which is rather boring but unfortunately needed to finish the game.			"

												I haven't played the retro dungeon keeper but I have played games that copy the style (eg. Evil genius).I've been wanting to play a dungeon keeper game for a while but I heard about the EA Games version of dungeon keeper and how they milked the name and turned it into a huge pay to win game. So whenever the occasional dungeon keeper style game pops up I'm fairly wary of developers that might try to follow suit.So far of what I've played this game seems to give you everything it sells you. From what I know of dungeon keeper, it's usually limited to the underground area only. This game adds a new interesting aspect by allowing you to travel to the surface. The campaign is entertaining, and teaches you mechanics/units of the game. The narration is quite humorous, although at times can begin to borderline nag you when you're not completing tasks. I was pleased to see you could play as two different 'factions', the horde and the demons. Horde being ogre/trolls and nagas, and demons being worshippers/insectoids/firedemon and succubus units.Pros:+Pretty good graphics+Two playable factions horde and demons+Good variety of units+Can go onto the surface to destroy the heroes camp+Entertaining campaign+No serious bugs encountered yet+Narrative is comedic+No EA microtransaction milkingNeutral~Space for more maps/factions (dlc maybe)~Drops below 60fps in some areas on powerful computer~Narator has presented subtle advertisements under the ruse of a humorous context~Combat animations aren't terrible, but I've seen betterCons:-Narrator can boderline nag when being slow completing tasks-AI can be a little strange at times-Encountered some minor bugs here and there-No server browser-3rd party launcher that requests an account and login			"

												I like this game however I must rate this game as average. 3/5 stars or points. Reason number ONE. Not enough content for your money. This game is soooooo not worth $40 dollars. It should be like $20 or $30 dollars. Because this game has only one campaign and only 2 factions and only 3 SKIRMISH MAPS. ONLY 3!!!! Multiplayer...... Pfft spent one hour looking for people couldnt find anyone. No one cares about multiplayer..... Also only 5 MULTIPLAYER MAPS. ONLY 5!!!! This game offers you very little content for $40 dollars. Its almost as if Kalypso Media ripped me off with a switch and bait tactic. Reason number TWO. Not enough game modes like Sandbox or Survival mode. Like I said before. This game offers you very very very little content for $40 dollars. This game is so not worth $40 dollars at all it is worth far less. Currently it only has 3 prime game modes. The funny and hilarious Campaign. The useless Multiplayer mode. And the lack luster Skirmish mode that has very little game options. You cant even face off another Dungeonier AI. Would of been nice if they also let you play as the humans too. Or even add another faction. The Undead....			"

												It's fun, and it's definitely a Dungeon Keeper homage in the same way that Cities:Skylines is to SimCity. When a AAA publisher gets greedy, there is ALWAYS someone to fill that vacuum.However, there are a couple of flaws:1. The narrator is funny, then clever, then sarcastic, then annoying. I get REFERENCES LOL but they give him way too much to say. A bit of a nag.2. Very few monster types.3. I absolutely appreciate the attempt to blend both the sim and the RTS, however the control changes between the two is always jarring and the RTS element seems particularly half baked.I'm going to enjoy this one immensely, but make no mistake, there are flaws.

												Great game and I highly recommend it.   The company made good on bringing back Dungeon Keep or a clone of it.   Don't read the IGN review, the reviewer didn't play the game or was really really stupid.  It’s nothing like he said in his review.     The best way I can sum it up, is the ""underground"" part is just like dungeon keeper.  You break out the ground and make rooms, mind gold and later mana and build your army and protect your base with doors and traps while building your army.  Then you send your troops to through the entrance(s) and you attack other army’s or bases above ground.   The game play is very much like Warcraft 3.  You have a small army and they have different abilities etc.   So think of a mix of Warcraft 3 for the above ground and a great clone of dungeon keeper below.   Also as a bonus you get to play the good guys AND the bad,  there is multiplier,  AND skirmish.    I wish the campaign was a little longer (10+ hours and I didn’t rush and had some big army killing setbacks )  but the developer seemed to state that there will be more,  so let’s hope they don’t rip us off for DLC like every greedy ♥♥♥ game company does these days.    The other small grip is you have to keep leveling up multiple times (your dungeon and your “monster” population cap) and it takes time away from doing the other fun parts.   You get 4-5 different “type” of monsters,  and then get to level them up to different versions.   I have mixed feelings about that but it didn’t detract to much of the game, but plays more like an RTS where you ramping up your army before sending them to kill the enemy or get slaughtered. Overall a GREAT game and if you’re on the fence, just buy it, it IS a lot of fun.    "

												I wish I could recommend this game - it has a solid, fun set of core mechanics, and the narrator is quite funny.Unfortunately, the control scheme and interface are too obnoxious. In the dungeon you have one control scheme, and another on the over world. On the overworld you can select your units in a traditional RTS fashion (drag over them to select everyone). You can't do this in the dungeon however, meaning that if you want to move many units to the overworld, you have to select each on individually, and then drag them each on the dungeon exit. Considering how often you'll want to go back and forth between the dungeon and overworld, all of this micromanagement gets old quite fast.In addition, the dungeon can get pretty crowded at times, making it difficult to click on the unit/room you're actually trying to access.Also, there are a number of annoying bugs. At one point I had to quit to the main menu and reload my game because one orc stayed in my hand, preventing me from dropping it or doing anything else. Another time an orc on the overworld suddenly woudn't attack, and no enemies would attack it (but his friends could still attack). This is a game I really wish was better. If they fixed these irritations it could be quite fun.Edit: as one commentor pointed out, you can use the group hotkeys you set on the overworld to select units in when they're in the dungeon. This helps a bit, but when you select units in the dungeon, it automatically moves you to the dungeon view, which gets obnoxious if you're trying to send them to the overworld.			"

												I decided to buy this game because I love the Dungeon Lords board game made by Zman Games and Czech Games.  I had heard from a friend that Dungeon Lords Board game was based on a  computer game.  After watching trailers for this game I realized it is either based off an early version of this game or based off a predecessor to this game.  In Dungeon Lords board game you build a dungeon as the evil Dungeon Lord and you have imps to mine gold for you, build tunnels, etc.  The Imps are your snotlings or Minions in Dungeons ii.  You also can build traps in your dungeon and hire monsters like Trolls, Goblins , Dragons, Vampires, Ghosts, etc.  The games are basically the same game almost but in computer format as compared to board game format.  As a whole I absolutely love Dungeons ii.  I have completed the campaign and every map including the new ones just added.  I have every achievement except king of the hill and a friend is supposed to help me with that one tomorrow or soon since it's multiplayer.  In dungeons ii which is an RTS (I normally don't like RTS games and prefer turn based strategy so this game is really good for me to like an RTS) you hire snotlings if you are the horde or minions if you are the demons to build tunnels and rooms for you and to mine gold, set traps, admire demons, etc.  You can then do research with goblins or Trolls or nagas or the demon equivalent in their respective rooms.  You can upgrade your dungeon, adventure out into the above world to wreak havoc and mayhem.After I played the game a lot I decided to read others reviews to see what they thought of the game and I had the same experiences as many of them.  Treasure chests as one person said and I agree are the best trap and they are the lowest level trap.  The reason for this is because the stupid adventurer's in their mad rush for gold will go right after them and not wait for their bard to disable them.  This is not true of any other trap as they will wait for the bard to disable them before adventuring further.  I do like the Rolling stone trap but I think the develops fixed the fact that it could roll over even bards who are immune to other traps.  The demons as I agree with other reviewers are not as good as the hordelings and here is the main reason why.The fire demons at the low level are not as good as orcs which are the equivalent.  The other problem is that for the demons the admiration chamber is the same as the hospital and that is where they heal.  With the hordelings you only have to throw beds in a hospital and they will lay down and heal.  However with the demons they have to go to the admiration chamber to heal and it requires a minion to sit there and admire them for them to heal.  Also you have to sacrifice a minion to upgrade the demons while you only have to train the hordes.  So clearly the demons are not as good as the minions must dig for gold, dig tunnels, set traps and do everything else the snotlings have to do but they also have to be a sacrifice to upgrade demons which means you have to spend more gold to replace them and they have to admire demons for demons to heal which means they have more duties than snotlings and slows down their other tasks.  They are clearly inferior to the horde which others have also said.  I also feel it would be nice for the campaign to be longer and more maps available as well.  Also I was very disappointed in the fact that you don't get an undead dungeon.  When you go through the campaign and get the nagas to join you, then the trolls it adds them to your army capabilities and when you meet the demons you get to play the demons.  However when you fight the undead in the campaign I figured that you would get to play the undead and then you would be able to build Skeletons, Ghouls, Ghosts, Zombies and Vampires in your next dungeon but you never get the option to build those types of units.  Maybe an expansion in the future will introduce this? It would be fun to get that 3rd faction.All in all I absolutely love this game.  I have heard references to Dungeon Keeper and maybe that is the predecessor to this game and what Dungeon lords is based on but I don't know as I've never played it and didn't see it on steam.  Because of this game I did buy Dungeons i and The dark lord sequel to it but have not had a chance to play them yet but am looking forward to it.  I would love to see a map creator in this game so that everyone could create their own maps to play.All in all though I have a few complaints about this game I absolutely adore it and it was totally worth the $39.99 I paid for it.  Or who I am kidding the $39.99 x 3 as I bought it for 2 of my other friends as well.			"

												18 years after the Dungeon Keeper this game couldn't properly copy the controls which makes playing it fairly painful. The mouse cursor/hand is so big in the underground part that you cannot even properly judge where you are pointing, its responses are slow which makes the whole gameplay tedious.Also I found the humor cringeworthy, but that might be just me.

												The first Dungeons game took a lot of flak for looking like Dungeon Keeper but only being a Tower Defence game. However I still liked it and felt it was a good beginning of a series I fully expected to get better.With Dungeons 2 that they addressed that but not by just copying Dungeon Keeper, oh no. In this game they put their own spin on the theme by keeping the Tower Defense game in the Dungeon levels, so you where always defending against something (the original Dungeon Keeper lacked that) and having an over world map for you to go forth and conquer. The end result is a very good Dungeon game that sees you attacked repeatedly as with any good tower defence game and a much needed Real Time Strategy Element involving the surface world. Add to that the narratives tendency to plagiarize ideas from all over as it blantanty plays the pop culture comedy card for kicks and giggles, you have to wonder, does this actually beat the original Dungeon Keeper at its own game. Well I am not sure about that but it comes close.A few more I's dotted and T's crossed and a little more detail especially on the monsters and it will over throw Dungeon Keeper and take its crown.I would like to see the generation of evil points used to upgrade dungeons be more directly linked to the Evil Leaders own actions. So the dungeons advancement is linked to the acts the players own character performs. With bonus points for achieving objectives as happens in the current game. I feel the evil points could be as important as mana or gold in generating gameplay.Especially if spells are made so they generate evil points when cast on the enemy, or torturing enemies generates them too, things like that.I would say the pace of the game feels a tad too slow at times and the campaigns it self is a little too easy but I like to be able to kick back and relax and just enjoy building up my dungeons and minion army sometimes, then send them against a defended town on the surface and see how they do, whilst my defences are tested by repeated attacks from the surface.Also not being able to put spell casters and archers at the back of my melee troops easily is a bit a of problem that will hopefully be addressed by adding simple formations to the next Dungeon game.Over all a good game, and it passed my value of game = £1 per hour of gameplay provided by the game test too. The campaign is about 23 hours long and there are additional skirmish maps. So you are going to get 25 hours easily out of this and the game costs £25 brand new. A fair price I would say.Looking forward to Dungeons 3 now....			"

												first time writing a review but the game is good enough to warrent it.  I will try and be short and sweet since reviews that are pages long usually turn me off.Pros:- is what it should be! classic dungeon keeper like play and really brings the game of old alive with updated graphics and new interactions- simple comedy and entertainment throughout the game in many forms absolutely add to the overall game- INCREDIBLE support staff; i have never posted on the forums for the game be it a simple question on how best to proceed or technical issues i ran across and not have a dev or other helpful member of the community respond within 24 hours (honestly ive had a response within an hour every time)! for me this turns a great game into an outstanding one.Cons:- game is admittedly a tad challenging on user interface.  It can be a bit finecky over hot keys and accepting commands.  Ocasionally i go to cast a spell and the spell wont cast on the enemy becuase it thinks i am trying to cast it on the trap the enemy is standing on, this sort of thing.  - does have some perfomance issues as well.  Get a ""mono"" error ocasionally that will cause the entire game to kick me out.  Also has some configuration issues with dual monitor setups and though i am a windows user myself have seen multiple issues if you are on linux systems reported.- relatively short single player.  I am not much into these types of games for multi player so havnt even attempted multiplayer yet and probably never seriously will.  I am a fairly heavy gamer but also like taking my time with these games i rarely finish a campaign map without having researched literally everything there is to research and having nearly the entire dungeon mapped out, so at the time of writing this it says i have nearly 30 hours on record and im just barely about to beat the campaign.  For me though this is short i completely recognize if i was motivated to do so i would have finished the game easily in half that time.conclusion?great game, great support game, not more then what i expected.  I would give it a 9/10 mostly becuase of the support staff and doing what its meant to do so well.  All the cons i see in the game are cons that can be improved with time, and from my interaction with the developers i have full confidence in them being handled sooner than later.  They are saying new skirmish maps are about to be released in the next week or two and the game hasnt even been out a full week yet.  While i am sad the campaign isnt longer (maybe it was just becuase i was younger and less skilled but i remember dungeon keeper 2s campaign being WAY way longer) i have no reserves at all on spending money for an expansion/dlc if they release one.

												Enjoyable dungeon builder, a little too objective oriented for my taste, but still had fun with it.  Well worth the cost for the number of hours I put into the game, but I'd kind of like to keep playing.  There just isn't anything else to do.  I've done everything in the single player (including all DLC) and have zero interest in multiplayer.Just wish it had something like a randomized endless survival mode, where invaders keep coming in stronger waves, while minions have their level caps drastically raised to extend progression.

												This is a strange review for me to make. Did i liked the game? yes. to my knowledge its the best Dungeon Keeper look-a-like i've ever played.Even so, It just makes Dungeon Keeper a much more impressive game so many years on. This game fails to excel in so many things DK did. -The humour of the narrator is cheesy at best, and irritating at times. It fails to capture the grim humour of DK, which made it so good. Even the latin grim voice saying ""impossenitum"" was top class.-Vast number of creatures you can get, with so many different strategies and interactions they gave you, which you get only a couple in Dungeons.-The feeling that the humans are really a menace (the game is wayyyyy to easy)So if you want to get a modern DK clone, you should give it a try if the sale is good enough.

I went for multiple deaths to hear the narrator complainAchievements keep you playing (like replaying one of the campaign missions)Perfection in gameplay/style/strategy not requiredThe last campaign mission can be played as horde or demonAfter playing this enough hours, the value is thereNegatives:Mouse pointer ""hand"" is a little clunkyCampaign is shorter than I would preferSystem requirements seem high "

												An overall enjoyable dungeon romp. It is let down by a slow paced hand holding main campaign. Shame. It has all the components to make it a very good game. (One i could very well rave about if it had been designed slightly differently) The extremely linear scripted campaign does not allow you the freedom to enjoy the experience of building your dungeon or to approach the objectives in anything but the one designed scripted route in the exact sequence scripted. This coupled with the very limited overland (walled routes, effectively just one winding lane) really stifle the experience. No freedom or illusion of freedom.A limited amount of rooms and a high cost in wages/upgrades for units really lets down the game also making each level a repeating slow slog of completely rebuilding the same handful of rooms then recruiting the same 4 or 5 types of units until you have enough while events trigger or trying to rush it. The actual building experience is fine as is the tried and tested formula of controlling the minions. (group assigning is possible) Its also a pretty game with nice animations and humorous commentary, thankfully with a setting to control it. (indeed i turned it to its lowest setting pretty quick as it was non stop)There is not much replayability in this game indeed I am struggling atm to complete the main campaign. Bear in mind I have not tried multiplayer but the limited rts mode overland will i think restrict the enjoyment.The first game fell far far from the mark. This game falls nearer but its not quite there. Third time may well be the charm. Metacritic (usually a cesspit of despicable untrustworthy paid for reviews) has got the score right 7/10Overall a good try but not quite a dungeon keeper beater. Not yet anyway....			"

												Definitely must buy on discount.Full price? it's up to you how much you want to play Dungeon games. Pro This game is good and nice to play to kill the time if you get bored of most game. The campaign very relaxing and captivating at the same time. The moderator that talks to you love to make jokes and troll on you and they are pretty funny. One of your minion you control is a snake women called Naga, so her nick name is Naga Minaj for exp. The depth of the above world and under world, the different realm of dungeons, monster abilities, upgrades, and spells are so diverse which kept you interested. Also, the unit specialization you get from a book drop adds cherry on top. Cmon, a healer with double the mana capacity. In single player mode, you have different factions to play which adds to more of a replayability. Oh did I mention, you will get to play the Horde faction for like 7 missions and then you get the option to do side campaigns of the new faction which I haven't completed yet. But the orc faction doesn't end at 7th mission obviously. -lots of upgrades and variety-variety of neutral lairs, drops and loots-undoubtedly beautiful gameNegative-Unbelievably high amount of graphic usage. I have i7 duo processor and 860gtx Nividia, 12gb ram laptop, I have to play this ♥♥♥♥ on the lowest! WTF!?-No torture chamber that I can convert goodies to serve ME!!!- traps OP.- Not really that many types of rooms- hard to click the wanted units or room without click something else in your way of your mouse. It doesn't have a good indication of what your will be clicking to grab x,y,z.-Sign up and login to their game domain every time....why?-Max population is only 45 for orc campaign, 65 for skirmish.  I think this game should go for 80. each warring creature already takes 2 supplies then +1 more supplies for each creature upgrade, it's too little. 7/10...and it could easily have been 9/10 or 10/10, but....I don't think they put 100% of effort on this yet.

												So this is my second review to date.......... so dont hate on meh :). So i really liked this game i finally hit that pre purchase button and I am happy I did. This game has a lot of really cool things going for it and I like the direction the developers are taking it. I also like that the developers are so active in the chats and trying to help anyone with bugs/issues. I have a sub par comp and i have absolutley no problems with this game. I think my only problem is the narrator talks to frequently...... thats literally it lol. I mean I could be nit picky but its a good game and i am glad I spent my 35 bucks on it. Def money well spent, if your reading all the negative junk hey you should just stop buying any games because every game will have people griping and complaning till they are red in the face. It doesnt mean you wont like this game because someone found a flaw that they personally didnt like. (Read the nagative reviews but keep the positive in mind as well)Graphics remind me of torchlight two but better. 8.5/10Gameplay is good no holes has a campaign and multiplayer. 8/10 Helpful Devs and community. 10/10 Game didnt ship broken to where i couldnt play it! 1000/10Overly talkative narrator 4/10 (I am sure they will tone him down in an update/patch)Overall id give it an 8.5/10 Its a fun entertaining game definitely worth putting on your wishlist and or buying. If your still hesitant about the price wait for a coupon/sale you will not be dissapointed.			"

												*In this game, you don't invade dungeons - the dungeons invade you!!!*Ok, guys. to start with, let's face it, this is a game that DOES NOT take itself seriously. There is so much goofyness, jokes, jibes, pokes and references to other franchises, that it is insane. And in pure goofy fashion, as a game that does not take itself seriously, you are allowed to make the narrator as angry as possible, so that he starts calling you names or take a commercial break just because - HE DOESNT HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO. Sounds fun? To me it does. Add to this the research system, fun dungeon layouts, tons of barrels of beer and you got yourselves a great visual experience and fun gameplay.The good:1. Player friendly atmosphere - new and old players will enjoy the goofyness just as much. Like kill your OP hero in a tutorial. LOL. Wait, did I get an achievement for this? Like for realzzz?2. The art style is gorgeous and very well executed.3. The easter eggs and references will make you ROFL. Like King's Ending ""from"" Game of Thrones and Peter Relish the Lord Middlefinger(s)... Add to this references to pop stars, LOTR, shows, etc. and you will be enjoying the other side of the game as much as the game itself.4. I will repeat myself - angering the narrator has never been more satisfying. Or pleasing him and forcing him to sing your praises.5. Microing is good, but refer to Bad 3.6. The Narrator - he did a great job in the Stanley parrable - he is back with the goods (or shall I say goofs!) once again.And most importantly: 6.1. This game does not take itself seriously, people. Dont take it seriously too. Enjoy the commercial breaks, the narrator getting confused, or quoting franchises that are irrelevant to the game (LotR, GoT), etc.7. Smiles and laughter. And lots of it :DThe bad:1. The narrator does commercial messages. While I find it goofy, people may find it offensive.2. The Narrator can be offensive. You you think he is, go play War of the Overworld.3. Basic micro wins the game. Like, if you can micro 3 units in starcraft1 or 2, you can win the game.Conclusion:While the game is on the pricy side now, I would still recommend it. It is a must buy as soon as it goes like 33-66% off. As a great game that loves goofynees, jokes, and fun, you only need to let it in and enjoy it to the fullest. Accept the game for what it is - GOOFY AND FUNNY. I have never had more fun doing the exact OPPOSITE thing that the narrator wants of me just to ♥♥♥♥ him off and get him to call me names. If you are a troll, you will like this game. If you want a relaxing game for fun, you will like this game. If you want a very serious game, better go play WotOverworld. It does look more serious, but also misses out on a ton of fun and laughter.Comment: It is very weird that we get two Dungeon Keeper-esque games one after the other. Could be corporate spying, could be a coincidence. As if I believe in coincidences. No wonder WotOverworld came out first. It is the serious one. You go in, you do you stuff, you win. WotO's narrator is also way more serious. It is the spiritual successor of DK2, even reuses some stuff. On the other side, D2 opts to win you over with goofyness and smiles all around. You choose what you would like best.Guys play this game. Missions could be mundane at start as if sucked out of the fingers of the creators. Not much ingenuity, but still good fun fun to win. Do not ever doubt that.			"

												Let's start to describe the game, in Dungeons 2 you are an evil overlord who controls his creatures and minions to build a big underworld dungeon and your goal is to take over the surface and wipe out the good guys. In your dungeon you will be building different types of rooms to satisfy the needs of your creatures, do research and improve your spells, weapons, abilities, rooms, traps and a bunch of other stuff to help you defend your dungeon and take over the surface. You can pick up and slap your minions and of course mine through the underground and build rooms to manage your dungeon.Once you get to the surface the game turns into a RTS (real time strategy) game. You will have complete control over your minions and their abilities. Having a good unit composition and formation is key to taking over the surface and wiping out the Alliance (good guys).  The campaign is fun and introduces you to the game and its mechanics in a nice and steady pace. There are a bunch of campaign maps and they all feel different and fresh enough to keep you interested. What truly makes the campaign shine though is the narrator in my opinion. It's the same narrator from the Stanelys Parable so you might know him. His voice is very clear and he really makes the script looks better than it really is. The humor, jokes and references are all pretty much spot on and got me laughing multiple times during my playthrough, but this will of course be subjective.Once you have finished the campaign you can jump into skirmish or multiplayer. Unfortunately I haven't played the multiplayer so I can't comment on that. The skirmish is really fun. You are going to play against one AI who inhabits the surface and sends units down into your dungeon. Note that you CAN'T play against annother dungeon lord in skirmish. You will be able to choose from two different factions, the demons and the horde (orcs). They both are well made factions who play differently and have their own distinct strenghts and weaknesses. All rooms, units and spells are unlocked in skirmish after you have researched them of course. Now onto some bad parts of the game. The optimization is kind of poor at the moment, once the majority of the map is discovered you will most likely drop frames and changing the graphic options doesn't help. This will of course vary depending on your pc hardware. At the moment the skirmish mode has only three different maps to play which is dissapointing. The developers has told the community that they will release more free maps later down the line though. I have also noticed some people are complaining that the narrator throughout the game advertises other products from Kalypso Media. I personally don't mind it because it happens rarely and it is done in a comical form and there are a lot of jokes and references in the game so I naturaly take it with a pinch of salt.All in all Dungeons 2 is a very enjoyable game if you are into strategy and/or management games, and it will only get better once a few patches who will adress the optimization and the small map pool will be released.

												If you're looking for a fun and stylish dungeon simulator with some simple RTS mechanics on top, this may be the game for you. This game is not an ultra challenging RTS or fast paced micromanagement dungeon simulator. It is however an extremely stylish and fairly polished playground with excellent voice acting and fantastic animation. Everything about the dungeon feels alive, with creatures amusingly waving to your evil hand as it passes over them, doing yoga in the gym, and generally delightfully cavorting about. The world even changes as you conquer things from ultra-flowery heroic scenery to brooding and mysterious dark fantasy. This is a game I come home to play to enjoy a fun and well crafted experience. The campaign is short and there are only a few skirmish maps, but the entire experience is refined and enjoyable. There is no grind or absurd number of side quests. When I come home from work I don't have 100+ hours to sink into some massively padded RPG or sprawling 4x game. This isn't a game made to strain your strategic skill to the breaking point. And I absolutely love that about it. I can create a beautifully crafted dungeon and simply watch with fascination as it operates.I was a huge fan of Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 and I've been looking for a similar game for some time. The big question now is, War for the Overworld or Dungeons 2?War for the Overworld was ultimately a buggy disappointment which entirely failed to capture the personality and style of the Dungeon Keeper series. It's focus on very faced paced competitive game play resulted in the grim dark creatures lacking any sort of style or flair. They don't struggle in the air when you grab them, they don't interact with your hand amusingly, they just act like robots. Every bit of the clunky UI is geared towards facilitating a competitive experience. The ""sandbox mode"" is literally just a giant blank map with no enemies. Your creatures are boring. Your dungeon is boring. The game is boring.Dungeons 2 on the other hand is dripping with style and humor. Your creatures interact in amusing ways, are beautifully animated, and generally give a sense of life to the dungeon you create. The narrator is also genuinely funny. The RTS mechanics are simplistic and I believe that is a plus. They don't distract from the dungeon keeper sim and if anything simply act as an additional neat feature. It feels very much like simplistic Warcraft. You spend time below ground making a big horde then unleash it on the world up top to crush up everything. It' s a jolly good time.I recommend this game heartily to anyone who enjoys excellent animation, style, and relaxing dungeon simulators.			"

												Nice game blending Warcraft 3 with Dungeon Keeper - though certainly less than perfect. If you are a fan of these games then you will enjoy it but be sorely left wanting for more. The fact is that the Campaign only has 8-ish maps and that's it. Painfully short for a AAA price game.			"

												So far this game has been a lot of fun. It is a nice mix of dungeon building games (DK clones) and RTS. It is blended together really well. The single player campaign also has a well written and witty narrator. I am only on the fifth level, but at this point I am really enjoying it.

												So far a good deal into the campaign, about to finish the Horde campaign and just started the Demon campaign after 10 hours into the game.The Dungeon Keeper II comparison is a must, but there is no better way to messure the game. Two different Dungeon factions offer low species variety per faction, but a high unit variety with different roles and purposes. There are barely any funny videos, but loads and loads of cheesy commentary from the Stanley Parable announcer. There are less mechanics and rooms (yet?) in terms of the dungeon, like prisons and casinos, but more focus on tech, micromanagement, dungeon control and overworld warfare. It is fair to say that Dungeons II orientates itself closer to Dungeon Keeper than before, but instead of copying the formula, they try their own receipe and so far I am very happy with it. If I had to make criticism, then it would be in the amount of non-campaign maps, which is far too low. Overall, the game reaches a 100% of the comparison skala: 50% of the old formula, 50% of own, new ideas.			"

Not without defaults (but what game doesn't have any?) and there is room to improve the game with either addons or a Dungeons 3 ?There are good ideas, not so good ideas, but overall, I think the devs did the hell of a job and the game is much better than I ever expected.I do hope the UI problems will be changed in a near future, I do hope other factions will join through addons or DLC.I hope for more maps and more variety from the narrator in skirmishes.And eventually, a throne room guardian (bring him back !!!), a more complex evilfying surface gameplay (cutting trees, building machines to corrupt the land) to give us more control over what is happening and also some bonus / debuff to our units and enemy units.And most of all, the RPG Diablo-like system of Dungeons 1.I know most won't probably happen but even without them, Dungeons 2 certainly deserve a 18/20 if small annoyance in the game are changed.Note: I wrote a lenghty review on the forums, complete and exhaustive, there isn't enough space on the review page to copy/paste it but if you want a detail review, if you are interested go to the forums and look for the post named:""My little review from a DK and Dungeons 1 fan...

												To be honest I did not really like original game. It was lacking something intangible. I think I know what exactly, now.First thing that catches your eye is the art. Little minions strolling around, drowning in vivid colors. World of rabbits and unicorns darkening and changing as you, the Ultimate Evil, stroll behind them, casually destroying houses damaging them for 666 or 665 with each hit (the last one just because he became a bit tired and bored). Those little details here and there are just amazing. Even gold reserves are not just gold as in other similar games: they have precious stones, like rubies and emeralds.After you come out of the shock from the beauty of the game you will dive into another shock: ""What is this? RTS?"" Do not rush to the conclusions yet. You do start by controlling your alter ego as in RTS, but then due to scenario you are diminished to an ethereal corpse.And this is when you you become the keeper. There are some significant differences compared to classic dungeon keeper here, inspired by the same RTS genre. 1st of all, you do not ""attract"" minions, you buy them and there is a limit to how many you can, as in RTS games. 2ndly rooms are clickable. And for a good reason: they need some micro-management, too: you need to build ""facilities"" in there to help the rooms work properly, and some of them allow you to research stuff like new buildings and upgrade stuff, as well. You do not claim the tiles, too: you just clear the dirt.Dirt is different here, too. 1st of all you can ""raise walls"" here. It is required to increase efficiency of the rooms: they need to be surrounded by walls for increase productivity. There are also 2 types of gold tiles: some give you a lot of gold, but get destroyed quickly, while others are virtually eternal and you can dig gold from them for quite some time, but slowly. Although, so far I never experience an urgent need for lots of cash.Unlike other keepers minions here should be cherished. As mentioned, you have a limited supply of those due to population limit. Also they do gain levels, which makes them stronger. You can also give them medals, which add some ""honorifics"" to their names. Yes, they all have NAMES. Makes it more personal. It's also nice how non-worker types smash on walls when bored and there are also those pop-ups, that tell you some thoughts of the minions, like what they are doing at the moment.I also like, how traps get restored here. When activated by heroes, they do not vanish freeing the tile, they stay there, waiting for repairs and once repaired, they can work again. If you have enough resources and build the traps wisely, you can generally forget about protection of the entrance, because it will be self-sufficient. And you will require some free time.Because, you see, there are 2 maps here. Map of your dungeon and... Map of the world above the dungeon. You can take a minion, drop him on a certain building and... Her goes out for a walk in the forest. To crash some skulls. Here I am reminded of those old-school solo missions in StarCraft or WarCraft, where you can't build anything, but have a few units, that you need to control precisely in order to finish the objectives. It may even have some stealth elements. And again - these units continue getting level-ups, medals and stuff like that.And all that is presented by a narrator, who keeps giving jokes close to what we could hear in Overlord game series. With some 4th wall breaking here and there. This is actually what original game was lacking (besides the amazing art-style). It gives the game a ""soul"", makes it even more alive, even though dungeon keeping still feels slow at times. Although, admittedly, minions here do seem a bit... Well, fat. In need of proper training.So, this is a rally good game. There are lots of minor things, that make it stand out among the others f the genre. These details show, that it was developed with love. Only 2 cons I currently see is that dungeon keeping is quite slow and generally easy and some minor interface annoyances (like sometimes you have to hover over the tutorial or event notification, because otherwise you will click on the tile, not on the actual icon).I definitely recommend it. 8/10			"

												So having played the full extent of the campaign which I very much enjoyed due to fun writing and an amazing narrator namely Kevan Brighting who was the voice of the Stanley Parable. The gameplay itself is also pretty great as it has you dealing with RTS gameplay on the overworld which you can get to through dungeon portals and dungeon simulation/management within the actual dungeon. The UI provides two maps for this and changing back and forth feels pretty crazy and great! I should also mention the game actually has 2 playable factions right now , one being the Horde and the others being the demons under control of the chaotic evil , the demons are much more magic based and the Horde bring a lot more brawn to the party. Currently you can't play the forces of good which is kindof a shame because they're also pretty fleshed out as far as units go and it would be great to attempt to invade a dungeon from the surface.Also forgive my gushing over the game but personally this game captures the bad guy humour I love so much extremely well! To compare it to something similar humour wise and who lightheartedly it pokes at things I'd have to bring up Overlord 1-2 by Guerilla games. The game does come with some hiccups here and there which I hope will be resolved with patches. Sometimes you'll encounter frame lag especially once there's a lot going on on screen , a crazy amount of shields on units for example bundled with your troops and especially the rolling boulder trap which will tear your frames apart for a few seconds. But honestly nothing really gamebreaking , the campaign takes you on a fun ride and will throw an absurd amount of references and will poke fun at so many things all with the great narration! Skirmish I tried aswell and you can flip on Endless mode if you just want to make the most ridiculous and impenetrable dungeon you had in mind , naturally you could also just crush the heroes on the surface and claim victory. Online is also included which I haven't been able to test just yet but you can connect to a random game , you can create/host one yourself and you can ofcourse join games by the use of a Game ID. To sum up the rambling for me Dungeons 2 is the Dungeonkeeper like to go this time. The aesthetic is wonderful , the narration well done , the campaign is sure to get some good laughs out of you aswell. The minor hiccups , sometimes you'll encounter frame lag when things get a little bit too much , the pricepoint personally I find a bit too high right now but you will be very happy if you do decide to make the purchase.

												I could recommend this game for the narrator alone, his constant joking and reprimanding the player is pure genius. But beyond that the system of micro-management and counquering of the overworld is very well done. Another reason that this game should be an insta-buy is the fact that the monster's AI is actually quite good, the minion's do the jobs you assign them on their own and the same goes for the other monsters as well. Overall a very good game that you will enjoy playing.			"

												Dungeons 2 is absolutely hilarious. I laughed constantly at the narrator's parodies and references to nerd culture. The flavor text is very clever, and at one point I noticed that my naga archers were named ""Lad'Gaga"" and ""Sel'Gomez"", and one of my goblins was named ""Beeber"" This is not a serious game, and it's not meant to be played seriously. That doesn't mean it isn't hard at times; some of the levels in the campaign took me hours to complete. The RTS elements are woven in quite comfortably to the traditional Dungeon Keeper formula and they feel like natural compliments to each other. The skirmish mode that you might expect to find in an RTS is replaced by a small set of single missions with an underworld map, overworld map, and set of objectives. This is a unique and humorous mix of strategy genres that is completely addictive once you're hooked.			"

												GREAT game- I've been looking for something like a modernized Dungeon Keeper, and this is exactly that.  The graphics are great - well detailed and animated.The best part is the narration of the campaign game.  The narrator tells the story of the Absolute Evil (that’s you) and his quest for revenge against the surface-dwelling goodie-two-shoes that imprisoned him.It’s a little hard to control individual units, but overall a great game with hours of content plus player vs player.  I especially enjoy the wake of corruption I leave when exploring the surface.If you were ever a fan of dungeon building games like Dungeon Keeper, you will definitely enjoy this game. "

												Its so good to see someone pick up the mantle left abandoned when BULLFROG games went under. I have missed the ""dungeon master"" genre of games very much and this one kept up with every aspect of the games I loved when I first got into them. Dungeons 2  is a dungeon builder that is extremely balanced and has a solid line of progression from one level of play to the next.  There are a couple points where the narrator gets a little testy when you dont follow the games line of progression, but that's a minor thing.  Using the traps takes a little practice, but when you finally get the hang of them.. its fun to watch the heros waltze into your house of pain.			"

												This game is pretty fun and really reminds me of Dungeon Keeper (which I loved). The only thing that really has me bummed is the constant crashing to desktop. I bought this on Steam Sale, so I'm not overly mad about it; however, this is getting to be a vey big nuisance. Overall, the game is very enjoyable though. If you liked the Dungeon Keeper series, you will probably also like this one. Pick it up on sale, just know that it has some issues.			"

												This is my first time playing a dungeon manager/builder game such as Dungeons 2 but I am having fun in my first 20 hours. A quick read of a game review on kotaku prompted me to purchase this game after it mentioned Blizzard's Warcraft RTS series. If you’ve played other real time strategy games such as Warcraft or Starcraft, then the learning curve for Dungeons 2 should not be very steep at all. So far I've only played the single player campaign missions, and while the storyline is neither compelling nor immersive, it is entertaining nonetheless. While I have only played the campaign mode so far, most of that time has been spent designing, building, expanding, and making my dungeons look aesthetically pleasing while remaining efficient instead of going straight for the mission objective. With that being said, I found that both the room/building and the unit diversity to be a bit lacking. For example, there are eight different types of rooms that can be built once the third and final tier is unlocked. A room is either a production facility or what the game calls a “room”. Some “rooms” have multiple structures that can be built, but do not require a research path to unlock different structures. For example, when playing as the horde, a hospital can both restore health to units over time, and revive units that have died in the overworld (outside of the dungeon), but the revival feature is researched at the tinkerer’s cave so no investment into whether the hospital room will act as a recovery unit or revival center is required. Therefore it often feels unnecessary and excessive to have a hospital at two different areas of your dungeon. Similar to my opinion of room diversity, there are only five units to choose from (one of them being a worker unit). The other four units can be upgraded upon reaching the next tier. If you count the upgraded versions of the units as a new unit, then there are actually 13 different units in the game.  With that being said, and despite my criticisms of the game, I’ve still logged 20 hours of gameplay and they have been a fun 20 hours (keep in mind that I have never played a dungeon manager/builder game before) which is why I would recommend this game, especially to someone such as myself who has been eagerly awaiting the next great medieval fantasy RTS, but has never played a dungeon manager game before.

												Why do I recommend this game?1.  The gameplay reminds me very much of the old DK series.  I know the comparison has been done to death but there it is.2.  I love the somewhat cartoonish art style.3.  As of this writing, the overworld RTS part isn't fully fleshed out control-wise as it's missing some pretty common controls (like subgroup selection).  That's supposed to be patched in soon.  Still, it's nice to not just sit in the dungeon waiting on heroes.  I like taking it to them for once >:).There's been some complaints you've no doubt seen in negative reviews.  I will say this.  I like the narrator.  He's funny.  Does he nag me a bit too often sometimes?  Yes.  Do I mind?  Not really, no.  Does he advertise for other Kalypso games?  No.  I've heard that maybe once and it was clearly a joke.  Everything else he says is a joke so why would that be the one thing taken seriously?  Finally, I have had no performance issues thankfully.  I don't have a beast of a computer (low-end core i7, 12 GB RAM, R9 270X 2 GB card) but there's no overworld or dungeon lag for me so far.Anyway, if you're looking for a fun and funny game that has you building a den of righteous evil from which to strike out against the so-called ""good guys"" look no further.

												I hope they do more with it. Would like better control of my minions inside my own dungeon too but I suppose that's too RTS style. But this game is a ton of fun, much better than War For the Overworld. Only because it went with the DK style, community opinion and did MORE with it. WFTO seemed a bit more.. dk1/dk2ish and not so much about the 'dungeon' as it was the 'build an army quickly and rush' attitude. Honestly they should take the advice of the community a bit more and do what Dungeons 2 did. Improve. I hated, I mean hated the first game of dungeons but I love this one. Very happy to have bought it.			"

												The game is a mix of Dungeon Keeper and Warcraft. The world is split in two zones: The underworld and the overworld.In the underworld the game behaves just like a good old dungeon keeper ""light"". On the first view it seems a bit shallow due to only a few different units. But once you are fully into the game you recognize a lot of depth there, especially with the split skills for working and combat. And the specialization by books. Same goes for rooms where you have to build the room first but you need to plan properly since most rooms need additional tools for function. Walls have influence on the rooms efficiency as well.In the underworld itself you need to gather resources to prepare for your fight against the heroes in the overworldOn the overworld the game mechanics are just like a Warcraft ""light"" you can command your units with special skills in nearly exact the same way. In the overworld you can cripple the enemy heroes by destroying their buildings so they can´t send more troops.The narratives and voice acting is quite nice and funny (at least in German language with the Deponia Rufus speaker) but especially the voice acting is a bit too often and too repetitive. A longer timer between the monologues would help.A very good thing is the pace of the game. There is most of the time no need to hurry. You can go and explore the world and build a massive dungeon - one of the things I loved at Dungeon Keeper - and in contrast to War For The Overworld. The controls are ok but still need some polishing. It is a bit annoying that you only get information about your units by dragging them up for example.Beside the campaign there are more game modes like skirmish. Furthermore it has a Multiplayer support. But haven´t tested anything but campaign yet.There are still some bugs and glitches but no gamebreakers (yet) It is a really great game and worth the price. Actually I don´t understand the ""low"" meta score.			"

												I picked this game up during the summer sale for $20 and I feel like I got my money's worth.  I enjoyed playing it overall, enough that I'll pick up the planned DLC when it comes out.  I have no interest in multi-player, so my review is based solely on my single-player experience.  Here are just a few bulleted items that came to mind while I was playing:Liked- Art style: cartoonish like DK, detailed, colorful, and original- Voice work and writing: great work on the narrator; he's pithy and verbose, but doesn't become annoying.  Story is simple and about on par w/ the DK games- Gameplay: I enjoyed the dual dungeon-digging and overland-conquest idea, I think it worked.  Even though neither was as deep as a game that just focused on one or the other, there was enough there to make a fun game- Research and upgrades: there's quite a bit to dig into here as far as upgrading your units; if you're a completionist like me, it can be time-consuming to max everything out.  Even though it's fairly linear progression, there are obvious results in your units' competence from your research- Multiple factions: although the second villainous faction doesn't come heavily into play in the campaign, there's great fun to be had playing as both villainous factions in skirmish mode.  I felt like this adds a bit of longevity to the game- UI: everything in the game is fairly straight-forward and easy to navigate.  Aside from issues I had assigning spells to hot-keys, I think you'd have to try pretty hard not to grasp how to manipulate the game world here- Developer presence on the Community page: this might seem stupid, but it's immensely gratifying to have people involved w/ the development present to field questions.  Many games I've purchased have no dev presence here and it's often incredibly frustrating working w/ other players to figure out game issues.  I had several questions that I posted  here and they always got dev attention eventuallyCould Use Improvement- Adjustable difficulty: much of the game was too easy for my tastes, the campaign needs difficulty options- More reward for exploring: this was a big thing in the DK games, digging out out every nook and cranny yielded interesting rewards. Similarly for the overworld. I felt this was lacking a bit here- Campaign could be longer and more free-form: there's a tad too much hand-holding as you go through   - Mission variety: I'm on the fence w/ this one b/c I see where the devs made the attempt.  There are several missions where you make forays into opposing dungeons and a mission where you have to ambush overworlders while they're en route to a meeting; however, I would like to have seen this variety pan out more. I like the fighting between dungeon concept, I wish it had gotten more screen-time and more robust gameplay instead of the simple set-piece scenarios we got.As I said, I enjoyed this game enough to keep an eye out for the DLC.  I didn't play the first Dungeons game; I was scared off by the negative press it got.  However, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed DK, despite its flaws.			"

												This game has been crashing every 10-15 minutes for me since I got it - I barely made it out of the tutorial map - so I can't really speak to the actual gameplay.  From what I've read there are others with the same issue and it started happening after a game update in October 2015.  After posting details of the problem on the bug report thread (along with what I've done to try and fix it myself), a dev quite promptly responded to tell me they think they've identified a fix and it just needs a bit more testing.  I figured hey, last update was just a few weeks ago, I'm sure they'll patch it soon.Almost half a year later there have been no patches - fix or otherwise - and now any enquiries regarding fixes for this or other problems get the reply that they're working on the PS4 version of the game and there'll be no updates to the PC version while that's going on.  We'll maybe get a re-port of the PS4 version once it's released, which might fix the issue(s), they think, probably, maybe, but details on any of that are hazy at best.Obviously there's a lot of people playing the game without issue, so it might be worth a look anyway, but I'd definitely keep Steam's no-questions refund criteria in mind and if you do run into problems go that route immediately rather than wait for the problems to be resolved.

												Fun game but a few problems. Campaigns short roughly 10~11 missions no need for real super complex dungeons just 2-3 well placed traps and ai dies and super slow build up for base and army and everything. The biggest negative is the fact it takes and hour to build up anything half decent and the narrator wont shut up about how slow you are.Those are the most glaring problems i see most people comment on(including myself) i enjoyed the game for what it was. Build dungeon ✔, control little minions  ✔, crush all who oppose you with the might of a massive(20-30 units so not massive massive) armies  ✔. Wont say its worth how much its priced right now but maybe it be best to buy this when its on sale for roughly 20 or less bucks.Hopefully they add more content or speed up  the progression in the game, do either of those and ill probably play it for another 10-12 hours. But to reiterate, no buy now, buy on sale.			"

												The reviewer below me pretty much summed it up extremely well and I have nothing more to add.- extremely low difficulty- very shallow (or pretty much nonexistant) tactical/strategical component on both sp and very much recognizable on mp- one multiplayer mode is senseless (the destruction of the other dungeon heart) because its pretty much always leading to a draw and unwinnable / unloosable for both sides, this is confirmed by the devs since version 1.0- the visual language is extremely blurry and unclear, battles blur into a mess of colors and effects with no way of telling what is what and why its there- no true need for many research options like better traps, doors (totally ignorable), spells (totally ignorable too) or working power improvements of the workers- simply becomes boring very fast because of the bottomline difficulty			"

												A fun little game, where the operative word is ""little"", as in small, as in shallow, as in you sped 45 min on it and you'll have build every thing in the game. No real strategi to speak of. enemies just run streight for your dungeon heart, with no concern for their own safety. also only one stategi for beating the enemy is just to swamp him with all of your forces at once. the game is literaly lacy and quite boring. all of the VERY FEW maps might as well be the same map, and all the enemies are just as boring and generic. there is no features other than a name that distinguish your forces from eachother, and enemy forces are just as boring. the game lacks personality, and playing it is like eating a plain piece of bread. this game is barely worth playing as a tablet-game. When you are building your ""dungeon"" you will experience that most items can only be placed in one or two ways, which is the locked angle of the camera, this is especially troublesome because it break any oppotunity you'll have for more complex designs (not that you need it, as said earlier AI is basically abcenst) visuals are good though, but that is the only praise i could ever hope to give it. Summery:Empty & shallow gaming experience.Very restricted building oppotunities.Abcent and lazy AI (both enemies and your units)Obvious DLC mill.Extremely repetative.Total lack of strategy.Conclusion: Not recommended.

												if you don't wanna read A lot:it's a MOST BUY for old dungeon keeper fans.if you loved dungeon keeper you will love this one.____________now for people that got the time to read a lot :PSo finished all missions in the campaign :)It took my roughly 13 hours with two crashes so let us say 11 hours to complete all the campaign missions :)So what do I think about it.Well first of I REALLY liked it, it was fun and was very close to what I wanted from a Dungeon keeper game.I will go through my thoughts here:Graphics:I really like the graphics, the animations are pretty good too. However I would like to see a bit more different attacks and the attack itself needs to be speeded a bit up (attack animation) since it looks a tiny bit weird right now.But overall the graphic is Really good.Sound:Well the creatures does not have much going for them, what they do have is good, but they are just silent with a few grunts, I would have liked some voice stuff.The narrator is amazing; it is funny while being informative. Very well done.Are there music? If so it was good enough for my brain not to turn it off, but not so good that I can remember it.Ambient and weapon/fighting sounds where good all over.Controls:I found the controls quite ok for what it is.I would like some improvement on the rts part since if we need to micro manage skills I want to be able to do so easily without having to fight the interface to grap ONE creature and use the right skill on the right enemy or friend which can be very hard currently.In dungeon mode, I found it a bit hard to catch and drop creatures, hitting them and knowing which one you hit is a bit chunky and could need improvements.Ability to grab workers from the interface would be very nice, same with creatures. If it is to prevent grabbing them while they are doing important task just make a priority system which always grab creatures idling first.Camera controls, I want to be fully in control of my camera ty. Please do not limit my rotation, angling and zoom.Of Couse there have to be a limit but it should be where I never feel it prohibits me.Interface stuff:I would like to be able to see level of my creatures over their heads. I would also want a way to inspect them easily.Information is a bit hard to get on creatures I think, or not hard but fiddly, should be made more convenient.The many maps makes it a bit confusing but nothing you don’t get used too.Besides that, I think the interface all over is pretty good.Creature variety:There is a large variety of creatures and two full races to play with, with different mechanics, tactics etc. that is pretty damn awesome !!Some more customization in gear for each creature would be nice, or some way of adding the title’s without the books, would be good.AI and Combat:The combat is properly the games weakest point even though its not bad at all.The AI isn’t very good, while it works very well for what it is, it’s very simple, ranged mobs doesnt avoid melee, succubus healers don’t heal before they get the full benefit of the heal, meaning not healing 80% of the time so stuff dies, most abilities can’t be auto used and due to the “cluster F” of the combat it becomes very annoying.I think the ai in combat need a TON of improvement, in a dungeon defender I generally don’t want to have to fight the different systems to micromanage like crazy. No I want to build my army and enjoy it doing its thing with only low interaction from me ^^when that is said it works so well that i didnt feel frustrated or annoyed by it, i just see all the potential i would like it to do instead :PWould like to see the ai actually protecting the dungeon on it’s own as well. Guard rooms needs to give xp while creatures are at them or they are essentially just wasting space and time standing there.The ability to pre-set “formations”, reaction pattern (flee when low, move back if in melee, protects friendly ranged that is attacked; etc.)AI in general:The ai is pretty ok at doing what it is suppose to.I find it pretty cool how creatures start doing workouts, waving at you and other such stuff making them seem more alive, but at the same time I am missing a LOT more of this.I would love creatures to interact more with each other, speak, fight, bully, taunt and have fun.This part is actually one of the most important once for me, I want to be able to sit back when I build my perfect dungeon and just follow the different creatures life and enjoy them like I would with a “tv show” (you can a tiny bit but there is so much more which could be done).I would like to see the AI advantage on its own accord as well, not sure exactly how this would work, would require something like new spawners popping up in the underground or over ground.Something creatures could go fight by their own will, to make them feel more like they are alive and do stuff they want themselvesGameplay flow and speed:I find the general overall speed of the game really good with one exception.Paydays and gold gathering: because there is so long from a to b once your dungeon gets a decent size you use the VAST majority of your creatures time walking from a to b instead of doing stuff. There most be a way to fix this.And having to make gold rooms all over the place because it takes the workers too long if you don’t and workers are taking resources from your army so you can’t just mass them to make up for it, it is a problem which needs to be fixed :)The flow of the game seems good; it is a nice mix of build your army and see it destroy stuff.Rooms:Most of them are awesome! :D feels a bit limited on some though, you need a TON of space to use them for several creatures, not sure if that is good a bad, it is hard to tell because the issue with it is that creature speed is so low that getting paid is really slow and takes forever.I would like a feeding room (meat not just beer).And I would REALLY REALLY! Like an actually efficient training room. As the training room are now it seems really bad for training xp etc.This is due to two things: 1. Creatures roles are VERY important so taking them of that for the minor benefit the training gives is not very valid.2: they never go there to auto train so you manually have to get them to do it, making it a hell to micro manage.Model size’s:The demons seems to have reasonable sized creature big and small (the torture rooms model is WAY too big though.. and animation for it really need improvement since its “boring”) but the orc’s all are generally around the same size with little difference, goblins should be much smaller, trolls bigger, and orc’s in the middle of it.Conclusion:overall I had a blast in the game, it is very fun and entertaining ^^it feels like a successor to dungeon keeper and it improve on the idea of dungeon keeper while keeping the spirit and awesome feeling of it.There is as mentioned a handful of things I would like to see changed, but it is pretty minor and I am VERY much looking forward to expansions, dlc, or the next game you guys created (granted it builds on this one in its concepts and stay within the dungeon manager feel :P  )			"

												Warcraft 3 meets Dungeon Keeper in this fantastic game! Voiced by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who guides you though The Stanley Parable this game is both fun and funny. All the animations are clean and its a very balanced game. One little thing that bugged me when I first stared playing is that i didn't know how to add items to rooms. You have to click the room then the item which wasn't that intuitive in my opinion. Either way, its a lot of fun, if a bit patronising (as can be expected from the guy from Stanley Parable).EDIT: The campaign mode is actually a lot shorter that I thought it would be, the ending wasn't that satisfying or even obvious at the time. ""Okay we killed the elves! What next?! Wait what?"" Its a very blunt ending that makes it seem that there is perhaps more to come (i hope) either way, a fun game.			"

												Just lovely to see a real game with most of the elements of Dungeon Keeper after the insultthat EA gave us with Dungeon Keeper Mobile, stupid micro payment piece of s**t game.This combines the classic Dungeon Keeper elements with RTS elements when going to the""overworld"", you basically make creates then drop them onto the gate and you are allowedto control them RTS style while on the overworld level. With loads and loads of nifty naratorcomments, etc. gives it the real feel that ""Dungeon Keeper"" had.Only one thing to say really, ""It's GOOD, to be BAD!"", and in this game you're controlling:The Ultimate Evil, so i guess that's very BAD! :D			"

												I was a big fan of Dungeon Keeper 1, so-so on 2. The humor and fun of that is in this game, and I loved that the narrator from the original games is back and that it is very forgiving on taking longer to complete each mission than the developers expect or on wasting unique units.It is really rare to find a game that is amusing and enjoyable just on the basis of having fun for a few evenings of gameplay. I had a great time with it.Very necessary to set compatibility mode to windows 7 if you are running windows 10. Until I did that, my mouse was not working very well when the screen was busy with effects. "

This is a game frankanstiened from Warcraft III and the old dungeon keeper, Unfurtunately everything about controlling this is garbage. It's just wanna be dungeon keeper with wanna be Warcraft III. The worst is every map has locations that you have no minemap to see. it doesn't exist, every  map there will be major spots that will not be on your map ever.			"

												This game is very well made.  Good graphics, funny commentary, no bugs I could find.However, they changed the game from the first Dungeons.  Now you no longer lure heroes into your dungeon, instead, small raiding parties always invade and bring no extra gold with them.  In its place is the ability to explore above ground in a almost Warcraft 3 style.Basically, this iteration of the game moved more towards RTS from Dungeon building SIM.  One thing I did not like about the original Dungeons was that you had to spend so much time making each room look good and then start over again in the next match.  This game has your monsters decorating/improving the walls in your rooms in their free time.If I could improve anything about this game, I would like the dungeon space to either be larger or some additional way to provide more gold.  Adding more gold veins or bringing back the old Dungeons mechanic where exploring heroes would drop gold would help.The campaign itself is pretty good and the narrator adds a very nice touch.  It did feel like the ending got chopped off, but I think there is more story/content in the ""A Game of Winter"" DLC.  There is a final ""battle"", but the story doesn't completely wrap up.I did like the ability to upgrade my monsters.  You can upgrade in three ways.  One is transforming your monster into a different but related creature.  My favorite is the regular goblin to goblin riding a flame throwing mech.  Another way to upgrade is to just increase the strength and abilities of monsters using research.  The last way is that your monsters level up as they take down enemies making keeping them alive more important.Rating - 7/10Dungeon Keeper fans= should try it outOther casual players = pick up on sale			"

												Very fun, a little bit of a slow start. Campaign seems like one large tutorial, but once you learn everything skrimishes are fun. You can have an infinite game going and just build which is really cool. To make the game seem complete you need the dlc, without the dlc the game seems a bit barren. All an all it is a really good game and i enjoy it quite a bit.			"

												OK, this game is a HUGE improvement compared to its predecessor. It adds the Strategy components that were necessary to make a new-original-on-its-way Dungeon Keeper. Forgetting any resemblance with DK, I can say that this is a good Dungeon Manager, with lots of micro and macro managing, fun campaign that guides you through the basic concepts of the whole game and a multiplayer that shines for simplicity... BUT the main problem that has made me stopped from playing has been the proportional performance drop as your dungeon and creatures grow. My PC is a med-high system that can run almost any other high requirements game in High settings but this game...even setting EVERYTHING off and EVERYTHING to Low, some maps are unplayable from some point where your Underground is Huge and things are happening in the Overworld and other sub-dungeons. TL;DR: -I'ts a good Dungeon Manager game,but still not Dungeon Keeper.-I'ts a fairly simple RTS micromanaging game, but not as deep as others.-The main problem is the performance, that drops as the game goes further.

												Everything I could have hoped for in a Dungeon Keeper sucessor.For the most part it moves at a good slow pace, allowing you to craft the dungeons to your liking before being forced too deeply into the overworld portion of the game (which plays like a WarCraft 3 style RTS).The campaign is fleshed out, with very few bugs, and is funny as hell!It is a love letter to plenty of fantasy tropes and fantasy pop culture, while also having an art style and narrative charm that stands on it's own.Overall, I would say it is a deep and satisfying experience!Can't wait for more!P.S.

												Terrible game. Far too easy and kid friendly. I have much higher hopes with  War for the Overworld. The narrator also has a horrible script to work with, and his lines are played again and again until you are forced to mute his voice. This is done in an attempt to force you to your objective, making enjoying the game at your own pace disallowed by the developers.Gameplay wise the game is just boring. Nice dungeon building mechanics, but taking over the surface world is a piece of cake, as is defending your dungeon.Recommend it as a game for kids but.. Long time Dungeon Keeper fans? No way.			"

												Yet another game inspired by the Dungeon Keeper franchise (I'm not complaining!) that has you carving out a dungeon and recruiting various evil minions to do your bidding!Dungeons 2 does it a bit different, though!Rather than being set underground for the entire game you can instead take to the surface and kill/pillage/corrupt your way to victory. So, in a way, its two games in one: a below ground dungeon building sim complete with traps, multiple rooms and spell/tech research and then an above ground RTS style where you box select your units and have them activate special attacks to defeat enemy strongholds! There are also 2 factions (Horde and Demons) complete with their own unique units and dungeon rooms for added evil value!Great graphics, a robust narrator with some witty lines, campaign that'll take 15-25 hours, skirmish/endless mode and a selection of multiplayer modes all come together rather nicely all-in-all. By no means is the game a 10/10 but its sure to help scratch that Dungeon Keeper itch!			"

												This game, unfortunately, just does not offer enough to keep my interest. The gameplay is slow and uninteresting, the character types are too limited and the game just feels like less of what Dungeon Keeper is. The narration is the best part about this game, not surprising as its the same narrator as The Stanley Parable. He does a great job in this as well but its not enough to hold this game together. I had frame drops as well, and I couldn't load my save after trying to reload my last play session so I had to start the campaign mission over again even though I was almost done. Luckily the campaign progress does save properly. The good things. First, the tone is exactly what you'd want from a dungeon keeper cloan. Its amusing and it has that generic charm of good vs evil, but its entirely intentional. Second, exploring the overworld while also keeping track of your dungeon adds an interesting dynamic, unfortunatly the gameplay isn't engaging or challenging enough to make it interesting. Just keep orcs in your dungeon and you'll be fine, thats basically the strategy. The game also looks quite good, the design of the dungeon is particularly nice. Unfortunately for me this is about where the good ends. The sound design leaves a lot to be desired, from the contact hits to the footsteps, to slapping your minions, it all sounds like it was made by a rookie sound team. The rooms aren't varied enough, the enemy and minion design isn't close to varied enough, even in the sandbox mode. I think this game could have been a lot better with more unique minion types and room types. Overall, I think Dungeons 2 was a nice attempt at a fun Dungeon Keeper cloan, but it falls flat. Even if your a fan of the genre I wouldn't bother picking this up unless it has a serious discount  Worth It In A Bundle or A Deep Discount   "

												The game is fun, to a extend to some. It may not be a full similarity of Dungeon Keepers Franchise but it has its own charm. Despite of 'attracting' units from the portal like in DK, you are hiring them from the world below to come work in your Dungeon. So therefore, DK players would have to get used to the mechanics that this game has and keep playing.Here below are my thoughts, it may or may not be the same as anyone else. But its worth saying out. Good Points:- You can build your Dungeon however you like. (Refilling on tiles you might have accidentally unearth.)- You can make your own specific army.- You have different fractions of 'Evil' (Demons/Orcs and etc. That is if I have not uncovered them all yet.)- Upgrade / Research System aka The ForgeNeutral Points:- Population System/ Evolution Mechnics (Maybe its just me.)- Minions/Servants carry so little gold.Bad Points:- Game crashes on me. (Randomly after few hours or so.)In short, if you are a gamer like me who LOVES to dig up the whole dungeon (despite having the Narrator annoying you from time to tim for dragging the game so long.) to reveal its secrets of 'free units', books and hidden gem steams. Just remember to save your game every 30 mins or so. Otherwise, a whole dungeon's worth of time will be gone. Which happened to me like three times.Other than that, have fun conquering the Lands of the Goodies and be evil smacking your Minions / Servants to make them work faster.			"

												So to start off.What is a nice throwback and attempt at Dungeonkeeper with some twists on it, its got some issues. Its a great concept and though i said the same about the first Dungeons, this one is actually better and more true to the concept. Do note, the gameplay ends up like trying to plug and save a leaking/sinking ship ( depending on how good your at it). Where youll be desperately trying to find gold, fend off waves of enemies and meet the games grueling demands of quest goals. (TL;DR at the bottom, but i advise to read all of it before you buy.)* The game (and every individual map) actually starts really effing slow. Youl find yourself waiting a long ♥♥♥ time for your workers to do anything, especially when your clearing out large rooms. Even more so when those happen to have gold nodes that take longer and has them scurrying off to the nearest gold pile. Youl end up waiting a long time on your mana and research as well. Even more since you need mana and gold to even start your research. (all of it is needless to say, very slow).* Only when youve risen up a tier or two (3 tiers total) will you get the good stuff instead of the same old bland newbie stuff mission after mission. In the campaign, this means nearing the mid and end of the campaign. In single this means collecting evil and when you do, theres really only a research need for your minions, not your workers, since theyve usually already done all the digging you need. All they do now is just stand around collecting gold and placing it at their feet (if your smart enough to place a treasury there.)Hope to christ you have an unlimited gold node on your map (usually is when your mid campaign, try searching the edges of the map) Or your already boned...The narrator is the same guy from the Stanley Parable, i love his voice and the guys a pro. But the script at times is really forced and cringy and META as ♥♥♥♥. The best laughs i had were smirks and mild 'ah, i see the reference now' moments. And those get hammered in on repeat till your sick of it.Its fun to have certain minions from the start till the end, level up, gain more fighting power, a new look and class, more side jobs skill and even titles from finding power books or doing stuff. You get attached so to speak. And the design of most of the units is quite well done. Others (like the naga or the spider bugs) look bland and boring. With the Winter expansion, youl be playing 3 evil sides in total. Each with their own play style, units and feel. With some elements staying the same, which is nice. On to the more annoying stuff:Important: THIS GAME DOES NOT GIVE YOU A ♥♥♥♥ING BREAK! ......EVER!!!!!* Where the campaign starts off slow as ♥♥♥♥. Youl find yourself to be always in need to get all upgrades for your tier before your able to do stuff without too many casualties (they recover at your base, if you have the proper room and devices, thank ♥♥♥♥ for that, but it takes a while) * As you progress, youl find yourself swamped with wave after wave after wave of increasingly more powerful enemies. At a rate thats actually quite unpleasant and hard to follow because of slow income and reasearch times.* While you can make long, snaking tunnels filled with traps and doors to bar out invaders, which mind you youve just spent ages researching in between waves and assaults and pay days, youl find that in most invasion parties (Youl mostly be facing the alliance), which even at the very first wave, has a bard. A halfling Bard. Eventually this will be 2-3 Halfling bards. This ♥♥♥♥er is IMMUNE TO ALL TRAPS and does not trigger them, is programmed to (when seeing a door or trap) head out with the party halted nearby and disarm your doors and traps....as an AOE...yup an area disarm....allowing his remaining party of death to just waltz through your tunnel as if they owned the damn place...Oh, and the bard also heals and gives a boost to his allies.  YOU WILL HATE THIS ♥♥♥♥ERDont even bother setting traps unless its the exploding kind. Heroes cannot help but hit those and get AOE damage (except the effing bard) Or the teleportation thing which is a 1 hit kill for anything enemy like. All of this results that you have to rally your minions to the intrusion anyways...having them run away form their important ( and ♥♥♥♥ing time consuming) tasks, like research and mana collection for a higher unit cap. Oh and forget picking them up one by one...and placing them down again, one by one...(which even has a small delay on it, ♥♥♥♥ that noise). Your dudes will lie there for a second or so and then hobble up, WHILE GETTING ATTACKED if you were careless. So use the rally spell and wait for them to run over.* Just as important events are starting, which usually are timed and result in an instant GAME OVER, youl find that your still reeling from yet another pay day, yet another wave incoming, or a sudden demon gate spawning end tier demons near your dungeon heart. And youl actually barely be on par to deal with the issue at hand. * Timers are too short, enemies have stupid buffs and a lot of support units. Youl get shelled from catapults and towers. Invaded by demons just out of effing nowhere (again, do not even bother setting traps, just set up a guard room with an alarm so that only nearby minions will stop their tasks). * Didnt manage to kill that passing caravan i just announced and only needs 2:45 seconds to reach the town?  of which you need a good 30secs to mobilize your forces?  Tough ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, game over or i just made it extra hard for you....oh look, another hero spawner!* Enemies will heal their allies in an instant for nealy more than half their health. They will charm your units and may even give their allies nasty buffs. Oh, and usually come in 2-3 of everything.  Squad of a bard, 4 amazon berserker ladies and 2 elf druid healers?  yup. * Always upgrade your minions to a full unit cap, they arent only better at fighting but also their side jobs. Saving you valuable moments of your life. * My God everything is expensive 0.0, you can easily toss 10K on a room with devices. Knowing that a typical worker rakes in between 40-70 gold per haul, thats expensive... And tedious.....And youl need to choose, workers or minions, since both count towards unit cap.  More income and get ♥♥♥♥ed by the enemy? or have a good army that bleeds you dry. Fun...* Pay Days are the worst -_- , youve just had one, and lost around 2K in funds. Everyones back to their chores or fighting a wave or resting after having died! and when your workers manage to regain that 2K ...oh guess what , its 'pay day'. ♥♥♥♥ me...i thought 'Payday 2' was economy heavy, Jeezus...* Cant afford to pay your dudes? Need more housing or food but cant afford it? ouch, tough break Chummer. Were all on strike now!  ♥♥♥♥ working for you! We require more Money Pile-ons (get it?).* Youl easily find yourself having to do the same map over again for 2-3 times. given your luck maybe even more. And dread to dig in certain areas because of the possible monster spawners there that release an unGodly amount of spiders, weird looking dog lizards and worse homing in for your dungeon Core. Which you need to end or YOU WILL DIE. * The entire game feels like your trying to paddle upstream in a leaking and sinking little boat. Constantly trying to replug holes and dunk water overboard while paddling. Once you manage to seal all your holes and get the water out, your good to go, but man is that a chore. And a game isnt supposed to be a chore.TL;DR:Game feels like a chore and has enormous potential to be a salt mine for people. But damn it if im not invested to see it through...Still better than Impire.Recommended cause you get as invested in this as i am. If only just to finish this ♥♥♥♥er.			"

												A hilarious game that easily offers 30+ hours of entertainment if ya include the expansions. The narrator to the game makes the experience all the more enjoyable. Would leave my game running several times just to see what new ways the narrator would start complaining at me doing nothing. Would recommend if ya enjoy a moderately easy difficulty strategy game with a good bit of humor with TONS of movie, TV, and game references and parodies.			"

												Fun game that scratches the Dungeon Keeper itch. Building and defending your dungeon is fun, but hardly ever challenging. The combat on the overworld is a bit basic too, but it's fun doing the actual corrupting of the land that in DK happened off camera. The narrator ties it all together nicely.If you're getting this, definitely get the A game of Winter DLC. It finishes the story, and adds a bit more challenge.			"

												I absolutely love this game. From the very start it's engaging, hilarious and a challenge. The narrator's mocking, sassy personality makes the whole thing even better! I've never played Dungeon Keeper so I couldn't care less about the 'IT'S NOT DUNGEON KEEPER' malarky. It's not supposed to be Dungeon Keeper. If that's all you came to review, please refrain. I almost didn't purchase the game from seeing numerous complaints about it and I'm glad I purchased it anyway. I've played almost nonstop the past few days, fighting for just one more completed campaign. I'm no super fancy expert judge of games but I loved the graphics and the little quirks of the game, especially the slow gathering of new traps and bad guys to work with. All in all if you like playing fun, entertaining games where you get to be the Ultimate Evil and extinguish those smug, sanctimonious ""heroes"" in a myriad of ways you will love this game.			"

												Absolutely great game!I remember that I didn't like the first game of Dungeons (the previous game). But Dungeons 2 is a lot different.I see a lot of people that compare this game with Dungeon Keeper 2. Well if you liked DK2, then I'm sure you'll love this game too!Gameplay:I find the game is a bit easy. But this is something I like and it means more people can enjoy this game. The game is slow compared to Starcraft, so if you are used to Starcraft speeds you might get irritated by the slowiness.The game has character grouping (really handy) and shortcuts to spells and places.You can play most missions at your own pace, which is also something I really like. I did not try multiplayer.The cursor (the hand) in the game is a bit difficult to control.You can build traps, doors and rooms in this game!There are 2 area's for the average mission: the underground (where you build your dungeon) and the above grounds. Train your minions and take them to wreck havoc on the lands!Graphics:On overall I'm satisfied with the graphics.Sound:Great music and I like the narrorations (great voice).Game in overall:- Nice jokes & easter eggs :-)- 20 hours of gameplay for me (unless you try to beat the game asap)- Finally a dungeon building strategy game!- Ability to fight above grounds- 12 great spells- the hints during loading of the level contain some important hints- stable game (only froze once, but was able to return to desktop)- DLC available (if you want more)Cons:- cursor is a bit difficult to control- if you have a lot of creatures your computer might become a bit slow (at least for me with a GTX 670)- some of the hints during loading of the game are only displayed 1 second- there's a lag when trying to pick up multiple creatures- No ability to choose difficulty levelThank you Kalypso, for making this game available to us!

												Thankfully, this game is nothing like Dungeons 1. Instead, it is a Dungeon-Sim much more in the spirit of the original Dungeon Keeper, with clever new gameplay mechanics, namely sending troops to the surface in RTS-style to attack the Alliance bases. The campaign has been a blast - there's a lot of humour, the narrator cracks me up every time. :-) My only major gripe is the fact that that same narrator keeps chiding me for not fulfilling objectives fast enough when I'm still expanding my dungeon and would like to be left on my own for a while (e.g. ""The slovenly Evil had *still* not eradicated that faerie village...!"" - this can grate on your nerves let me tell you).It is also very polished. Had one CTD in 40+ hours, which is okay in my book. I also really enjoy the cartoony graphics, especially the Undead faction have some unbearably cute units. And I saw an orc kick one of my workers, apparently just for fun. :-)Definitely recommended.			"

												Really fun game I enjoyed it a lot, the mixture of being a dungeon master mixed with RTS based base building and Tower defense style trap making work so well together. The only things I found annoying was the narrator after a while he just repeats script and although it's funny after the 5th or sixth time it gets boring hearing it, Also I wish the game was a bit longer you get the best units later in the game then it seems like 1 more quest then done. But yeah overall I really enjoyed it and if you like these kind of games I'm sure you will too.			"

												Humorous, funny and entertaining! I love the narrator, the silly names (the naming-staff must have had a ball coming up with some of the names) and the nudges in virtually every direction to other famous games and the jokes. Things you might consider annoying, like paydays, timers, when to research what, how big rooms you need etc, are a part of the challenge. If you didn't have to think, and sometimes rethink, your strategies it would be rather boring. The pace of the game is perfect in my opinion. I love tinkering with my dungeons, which annoyes the crap out of the narrator (which in it self is funny), and I don't mind the occasional visit from the heroes to test my defenses. This is a properly fun game!			"

												If you loved the Dungeon keeper games back in the day you'll love this just as much, its very similar in all regards with minor twists like Horny for the ultimate evil, dungeon heart for the dungeon glowing pit thingy. You can place doors, traps, use magic spells, and 3 different versions of orcs, naga, trolls and goblins to play and toy with. Lets not forget the fact you can leave your dungeon and go above ground corrupting the lands as you walk thru them and destroy towns, buildings, kill unicorns and other magic and wonderful things with your evil horde :) .I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to put some hurt on the heroes and wild beasties of the lands.Awesome Game, Defo worth buying in my books :)			"

												To be honest, at least for me, this is the new dungeon keeper (It does not play like the first dungeons).It keeps enough elements of the old dungeon keeper games (traps, dungeon building/rooms, minions etc.), and has build on top of that with a strategie overworld, different factions (that play similar enough to not get confused but different enough with there different units and mechanics, spells etc.) and more.And the game looks realy good. Not like for example war of the overworld that looks like an updated dungeon keeper 2. WotO may still be a good game but i much prefare dungeons 2.Seriously if you like dungeon keeper i can not believe you will not like this game.

												So this game I would consider, among my favorite games. Yet... once you master it, it starts to lack replayability. Its hard, then you learn to defend, then you learn to attack to upgrade, then you master your defenses. At higher difficulties it will still push your limits. However, the bottleneck is that... the hardest difficulty is really too hard to get started in, and once you get going... clearing a map takes HOURS and HOURS. Its fun a few times. But the replayability reallly deminishes. I'll give it a 10/10 since you can easily spend more time on this than 90% of the games out there... and its so good, you wish it was just a little better.

												A Day in the Life of a Servant of the Chaotic Evil6:00 AM: dragged out of bed by the on-shift Evil Mistress, grabbed some coffee and my magi-pick-axe to go mine gold for the glory of the True Evil! 7:00 AM: finished up my morning mining shift, still have not seen Phil since he was promoted yesterday to Summoning Portal Manager, lucky guy is probably still in bed. I head to the hall of admiration to tell the local Succubus how amazing she looks. Demons never tire of compliments. and least I don't have to praise the Infernals, the contact burns get old fast.8:00 AM:  Inspect the west annex guard complex for trap resets. Got slapped for walking past a disarmed tentacle. Huh, how'd that happen?10:00 AM: The previous shift must not be doing there jobs, 3 fire grates, 4 spiders eggs and tentacle trap all left un-reset or disarmed, spider eggs moved in place, a bit of work and the west annex should be secure. would be easier if Phil still worked my shift, but . . . oh well.10:05 AM: fled in terror from a Dwarf and his solders and the Bard who was clearly responsible for my trap work overtime. Hit the Gong in the west annex. My most abominable Evil hear my prayers, they're at the door, and I don't want to die.10:15 AM: After a very large rumble outside the door, i peek out to see a group of Pit Fiends playing rugby with the Bard's corpse. Back to work it is. A Mindflayer fell in the carnage, I'll take him for re-summoning, and maybe even see Phil on the way.Noon: Finish fixing all the havoc and clean out the smell of the heroes from the west annex. get slapped some more for not finishing sooner. Where the heck is Phil, and how can managing Summoning Portals take so much time? He's nowhere, is he just sleeping on the job, or is there a second chamber of summoning Portals i don't know about?1:00PM: Say Hi to bob as we both head to transports some exploding eggs and fire grates to the south annex. He hasn't seen Phil since yesterday either. Man, that promotion must mean he gets to work directly with the Ultimate Evil.  Lucky him!2:15PM: Wave and send off the latest group of demons to the surface, may their spoils be glorious yaddah yaddah, good riddance, now to get REAL work done. Bob, Jim and I are going to go expand the south annex, Evil wants mana crystals and there should be some down there.3:30PM:Jim got promoted thanks to the THREE of us finding a mana crystal and widening a path for an Abyssal and some Succubi to clear out the golem guards. Strange, that Abyssal looks new around here, then again, most demons just look the same to me. He laughed when i asked him if he saw Jim when he got summoned here. Summoning Portal management must be pretty cushy if you get to share jokes with the higher ups.4:00PM: explain to the the newly hired Servants, Ted and Rick, the finer points of Demon Admiration. on a good day, its all succubi and evil mistresses, on a bad infernals, Mindflayers, and any variety of Fright Demon. you have to fake it till you make it, except for the mindflayers, they'll know, and then your robed fuzzy butt is flayed. but if they enjoy it, i guess that counts as admiration, right?5:00PM:  Unbelievable, un-f-ing believable, Ted is here for less than a day and Ultimate evil has decided he's management material. At least I dodged a nasty bit by letting Rick get nominated for torture chamber clean up. He can have it. I must be slipping in my work ethic to get passed up.6:00PM: Assist the Ultimate Evil, and the Abyssal running the Mana forge by expanding in size. This abyssal reminds me of Jim somehow. I must be overworked. get slapped for daydreaming about the Summoning Portal Managers and their cushy lifestyle. I've finished my shift, I'm off to grab some shuteye. Tomorrow is another chance at getting my much deserved promotion.TLDR: feed workers to hell portals for unit upgrades, 10/10, would burn the countryside every time.			"

												The Good:-More ""Dungeon Keeper""-like than the previous ""Dungeons"" and more simpler concept.-Dungeon Management and Warcraft style RTS component.The Disappointed:-Limit for EVERYTHING, Monsters reach population limit so easily because minions are including in monster population which it's NOT suppose to, Gold limit is literally limit, in otherhand it increasing the challenge in resource management skill.-Overworld RTS (Warcraft controlled style) is nothing more than gang your mobs and using skills all the way with the highly limited number of monsters, which each tier have it own skills. So, you have to group every monster type seperately just to manage to use it skills efficiently.-And the bad news for grouping every type of monster is... very lacking key responsive, which many times have to press more than twice.-Very low responsive key is hurting magic skill usage too.Overall:If you love Dungeon Keeper 2 and capable to tolerate or managing the highly limited resource, this game is a good choice to remember the good feeling the Dungeon Keeper 2 is.If not, and you love sandbox-like side of DK2 then, this will annoy your ♥♥♥♥ off.

												This is the best game in a long time of gaming. If you loved the Dungeon Keeper series and have been looking for an updated 'better' version to play, this is IT. I have played a few 'clones' of Dungeon Keeper and found them all a bit 'mah' this one however is everything you want in a dungeon management simulator game. It's updated enough to be new and fresh, but keeps to the base of the old game enough to still hit those nostalgia cords.It does have a few issues performance wise but few and far between, easy to overlook in a game of this quality. Definitely a must have for any fan of Dungeon Keeper.			"

												Very happy with the game all round. Certainly had a much better launch than WftO. The game has a lighter appoach that was very funny. I loved how the terrain would change as I captured it. Spent many hours building up my huge dungeon in each map, so that padded out the campaign for me. I am certainly hoping that you have some plans for DLC or expansions in the near(ish) future!			"

												As stated several times, this is a combination of Dungeons meets Dungeon Keeper.  I have played for almost 12 hours, finished 7 missions in the campaign, and still can't get enough.  I do enjoy the game.  That being said, here is what I find that could use some work and/or polish:1)  Floating hand accuracy is inaccurate - When trying to pick up units in a crowded area, be it tools, beer, or several creatures, it is difficult to grab or highlight the exact creature I want.  The hand ""pointer"" seems to be around the lower part of the pointer finger close to the palm.  Hard to grab units easily and quickly.2)  Narrator - While I have found the narrator's humor to be exceptional, there were times I wish he was shut up because he was the one being the ""♥♥♥♥"".  I like to play out my campaigns over hours, trying to research everything and develop my entire dungeon, and I felt the narrator was trying to keep me on the game's timeline instead of my own.  Also, the advertising for Kalypso games, while funny and original, did get old after the 6th to 7th one.3)  Unit selection in the dungeon vs. the overworld - I really wish I could select my units in the dungeon as easily as I can in the overworld.  I may be missing a shortcut or other function for selecting in the dungeon, but as of now, having to pick up every unit I want to send to the over world, one by one, is very frustrating.  Especially when I have units set in a guard house that wander over to get beer or pay and I pick them up accidentally and send them to the overworld mission.  It would be nice to be able to shift+double-click on the population count icon to pick up all units of that type into the ""hand"" and deliver them to the overworld.  Or, let me set the rally banner in the overworld and have the units automatically go to the overworld tunnel from my dungeon.  However Kalypso wants to fix it, I feel it is an issue that should be addressed.4)  Pay vs. thirst frequency - I found I had no problem keeping up with the thirst demand (experimenting with only 1 dispenser, then 2, and finally 3) and after setting up the 3rd beer producer for a heavily populated dungeon I had excess beer production with no thirst issues, but the pay frequency seems to be, well, too frequent.  I haven't timed it yet but I do know that I was setting up a tinkerer's shop right after a payday hit and it couldn't have been more than 2 or 3 minutes when the next one hit.  With the slow rate of gold acquisition from the ""snots"", i feel the payday frequency should be lengthened slightly between pay days.5)  Unit pathing - I noticed when I sent units into combat, more often than not, my orcs at the front of my army would begin moving toward the enemy, come within a few feet of the enemy, then stop for approximately 2 to 3 seconds (while being damaged), then continue foward and engage the enemy.  It has happened on every campaign map I have done and is quite annoying.  I don't know if it's pathing or just a bug, but I feel it could use some attention as it does affect my game play and game enjoyment.  Like I said, it does get frustrating, especially when encountering a large opposing army.Well, that about sums up what I can remember so far regarding the issues I have found that I feel should be addressed.  Now, on a positive note, I feel the game has been beautifully designed.  I do love the narrator's humor and story telling.  Very unique.  The graphics, though cartoonish, are very visually pleasing and gorgeously done.  The sound is clear and helps me transport myself as if I am really in my dungeon or the overworld area.  Other than the interface issues above, I had no problems adapting to the controls.  I am still working on memorizing the hotkeys for everything (as there are many too remember), but overall the controls are easily learned.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys dungeon builders and RTS type games.  If Kalypso could keep giving this game attention and polish in future patches, I believe this game could be a very reliable and popular sequel to the previous dungeon builders many of us have come to enjoy and value.

												With a few more steps in the right direction this will be the successor to Dungeon Keeper 2 we have all been waiting for. The only drawback with the game that I have found in my short play time is the lack of creatures in the game. There are only 5 creatures at your disposal (just different skins for Demons and Horde). This is a real disappointment compared to the 12 or so creatures in DK2 as well as the plethora of rooms it had. I love the artwork and sound effects as well as the new item additions for rooms. These were all steps in the right direction, along with the venturing into Hero territory to earn EVILNESS lol. Still though, the game is sorely lacking right now in characters and scenery. These could be very easy additions though so im not giving up hope. An addon, DLC, mods, etc could solve this issue one their own or together. I thuroughly enjoyed my first few hours but once I saw that the 5 creatures and a similar small handful of rooms were all that were at my disposal I was very let down. I quickly jumped into skirmish mode to check that I wasn't worried for no reason, but my suspisions were correct in that I had already seen all that the game had to offer within a few hours. (There are more rooms than creatures but they don't bring more creatures or do anything that much more exciting). There are also only a handful of traps. For a game made 17 years after the last (well this is the one closest to reaching DK2s greatness) there should have been a ridiculous amount of minions, rooms, and traps. More than its predecessor or even approximately the same (within a couple)! But only 5...I really can't repeat that enough. I was having an absolute blast when I hoped in the game a began the path to ABSOLUTE EVIL! It was a big letdown when I saw that it offers maybe a third of DK2s creation content. It's still a lot of fun at first. I can't recommend the game at its current price and with this severe lack of minions and rooms. (Yes the rooms do more...but come on. By todays standards this feels like a smartphone game's worth of content). It is very well done in the amount of things it does, I will say that. The same narrator is back on board and he is hilarious even now. Even with it tapping into that bit of nostalgia perfectly, it was fleeting due to the aformentioned lack of unlocks. This has all the potential in the world but right now I can't recommend it. This really saddens me...feel like I keep repeating myself but 5 minions!? Come on...5!? Wow you can upgrade their armor and weapons and levels. You could do that in 1998. The furniture in the rooms is amazing...but a handful of rooms that half don't unlock anything new? There is really no room for extensive creativity and the lack of MINIONS lol, means that building little plots for rooms is the most eficient way to go. No more sprawling badass dungeons with Black Knights and Bile Demons, Fireflies, Wizrards, Goblins, Imps, Mistresses, Rogues, Salamanders and more!!!!! (Not to mention being able to turn the heros through the torture chamber which was so much fun to collect a few of each of them). Nope, you get an Orc, a Troll, a ...hmmm they aren't very memorable- wait a....NAGA- thats it. A NAGA... and a goblin. Maybe something else. Who gives a ♥♥♥♥. The more I type the more I am saddened that they shortened the most enjoyable aspect of the game for me and many others. Look at any rts/city builder and there are ridiculous amounts of units. Not so here. Kalypso, what were you doing!? You had this beautiful game you created with amazing voice acting and artwork. Wonderful sound effects and a logical, exciting campaign (at first). And then you just kind of stopped. Did you run out of money? 5 more units minimum to make it 10 or so total would have been the bare minimum for any game like this. Any RPG in this day and age has more unit types. Hell even Call of Duty has more unit types. It's because this game is so fantastic with what it has that I am so let down by such a gigantic misstep. A huge non-step? I dunno but they had everything going with this game and then just didn't take it further. They laid all this gorgeous, wonderfully executed groundwork, and then they just stopped. I have got to stop..WTF Kalypso!? You broke my heart! ♥♥♥♥ it, I'll recommend it but get your ♥♥♥♥ together.			"

												Fun and cheesy, but challenging enough past the first levels. Dungeon Keeper Plus, with an overworld map, and a dungeon map, you can swap between, with stuff to do on both. On the overworld map, you basically play an RTS, sending minions from your dungeon who you control directly. In the dungeon, your creatures have a mind of their own, like in most god genre games. This is not at all like Dungeons gameplay wise. This is much more a dungeon keeper gam in an updated version. Loving it!			"

												Fixes a lot of the issues with the first Dungeons, has some geniunely funny moments if you enjoy reference humor, colorful cartoon graphics that fits the moods, is fun at first, but despite all that suffers from the biggest flaw of the first game.  It plays itself with very little input or choice from you.  This is re-enforced when the narrator hollers at you for going off the script even slightly, albight in a funny way.And it's too short with one half campaign for one of the three races that teases dlc the whole game through.

												It's an original game, it blends dungeon design with warcraft type very well. Game is very entertaining, but it seems unfinished on the technical side. For example to send the orcs outside the dungeon I needed to press many times on the dungeon door until I got the exact point. Same to grab stuff with the hand. It becomes annoying after some time. The worst part is path finding. I have all my minions running towards a wall when they should be mining. Patch resolved pathfinding so now the game is playable . Still crashes now and then and auto save is hit or miss.6.5/10.			"

												I really liked this game.A solid dungeon keeper like experience with some interesting takes on combat with the overworld playing like an RTS.The story mode is pretty fleshed out and entertaining with it being focused on referencing other fantasy universes in a humorous manner every level. However its a bit short and the campaign only features a couple levels of the other faction which arguably is more entertaining to play as then the default.The levels reminded me of playing warcraft more then anything, and it felt really good, I just wish there was MORE.The player vs player isnt well put together in the sense theres no server/game list, simply a code you type in to join eachother or to que up for a ""matchmaking"" system which doesnt seem to work unsurprisingly and most likely because of lack of players queing.You can't play online with AI sadly so its either pvp or pve.All in all worth it on a sale, really entertaining if you like silly references and parody humor and of course if you are in to dungeon keeper like games.

												The Dungeon Keeper series has been crying out for a sequel ever since gamers were left hanging with the tantalizing view of Horny walking into the sunlight.  This game has the look, but falls frustratingly short in the execution.The developers decided to compensate for inability to design a discoverable UX or write a decent manual by having the narrator yell at the user.  Repeatedly.  For example:You're instructed to build an Arena and drop in a creature.  You do so, it happily flails away, gaining experience points.  On to the next bit of dungeon management...except the narrator is still complaining.  You train the creature again, train another, nothing is good enough.  GET OFF YOUR ♥♥♥♥, YOU ♥♥♥♥!!!Repeated.  Every few minutes.You exit the game in annoyance and search.  The Dungeons2 forums are down, and naming a game this generically doesn't help in search results.  Eventually you find a review complaining about the issue and discover that all the narrator's yelling about dropping the creature somehow neglected to mention that you also must deselect and then right-click on the Arena to choose a previously-hidden icon that levels the minion.  Brilliant!(For extra fun, you then complete the level and save.  When you return a few days later to give the game a second chance, it has lost your save and has you back in the same level.  With no creature trained yet and the announcer yelling about it again.  Repeatedly.)There are other interface issues, and the overworld play seems to be basically ""Build big army, abandon dungeon, steamroller foes.""  Wait for a 50% off sale if you want a little DK nostalgia.			"

												First off, only get this game on a sale, 40 bucks is way to much for this title.The game plays about as well as one would hope, with minimal technical issues and thought being put into how to interact with your base and minions. It has a nice mix of base building and managment, tower defence, and RTS elements. A good afternoon can be spent playing and you wont feel terrible, but as it does try to be a Dungeon Keeper clone, it does fall short on a few elements. Its not pretty, but the graphics and sound do the job to tell you whats going on.PROS:FunBase design is kept simple and easy to follow, and the overall game is easy to pick up and just play.Nice basic RTS and tower defence elements mixed together to create a good experience.CONS:Trys really hard in the joke department to the point of becoming cringe worthy. The story just takes every possible current pop culture referance and internet joke and mashes them together. Some find this a pro but I found it to be like that guy who wont stop shouting catch phrases that became old 2 weeks after they became popular.Some game design flaws here and there. You will start to despise Pay Day (basic upkeep for your minions) not for financal reasons but because production just stops. Outside of your ever diligent miner units erverything that was doing something (working in a forge, collecting mana, training) takes about 1:30-2 minutes to wander slowly to where the gold is, grab the gold, go grab a beer, drink the beer, then start wandering around. When you are on a timed mission this can become maddening to have to constantly grab units and place them back where they should have been, and that doesn't even mean they will do what they are assigned to do. Also suffers from the forced difficulty so many games try to add. Almost every boss has that percentage/timed force field that makes them immune to all damage so they can drag the battle out by adding some random mobs into the mix.It is a Kalypso game so you need to sign in to your Kalypso account to play. Not as bad as uPlay but still annoying to have to manage another account while on Steam.All in all a fun game with some decent sized flaws that pull it down to a sale only status.			"

												My first dungeon keeper style game that I've played.  I did enjoy it a lot.Plot - You play as an ultimate evil who is out there to conquer the overworld! It's actually a really cool little story, because it's voiced by Kevan Brighting (narrator of Stanley's Parable). It makes it really easy to listen and there's plenty of jokes and references. Some of them are pretty cheesy, but some made me laugh also.Gameplay - I suppose it's based on classic dungeon keeper games, though in this one you go to the overworld and the game turns into real time strategy. It's pretty fun and it won't require you to be RTS pro, but if you're not careful you could get overwhelmed. The game has missions and it advances through quests inside them. There's optional objectives that you don't have to do, but I still did them cause I enjoyed it.Graphics - I'm not a sucker for graphics so I won't be too picky. I've played on lower settings as usual on my machine, but I seem to experience lower-ish fps in the overworld. Could be my PC or a little bit of optimization issues? Who knows, though it doesn't require 200 fps or newest equipment to play it without any big problems.Music - The whole soundtrack was nice and I liked it. Especially when it changes to a nice and peaceful music where the alliance still thrives and to a menacing part when you are building your dungeon deep underground.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone that is interested in it and new to the genre (I sure was). Superb voice acting, nice cool story. I think you'll have fun.			"

												Having never played Dungeon Keeper or any other game like that, I've really enjoyed my 10 hours of gameplay. Played the Pumpkin DLC, which was rather hard. Dam penguins kept disabling my traps. After a few hours I was losing and started over. Second match proved to be better and I was able to hold out against them for hours until I finally maxed out my dungeon and lvl'd up a large army that allowed me to kill the Penguin King. Was surprising hard for a tower defense rts based on an older game. I give this game 5/5 stars. Plan on playing more matches after I take a long deserving break.			"

												It's difficult to review a game like this without making reference to the Dungeon Keeper series, since this game is effectively a Dungeon Keeper clone with a twist. It breaks with the classic Dungeon Keeper formula in a few key areas, which is sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worse.One aspect of the game I enjoyed the idea of was being able to send your creatures to fight on the overworld, something I always felt was lacking in Dungeon Keeper. In the overworld, the game switches to a more traditional RTS control scheme heavily inspired by Warcraft 3 (a game it makes reference to multiple times; more on this later), but lacking the polish of a proper RTS. This is where I felt the game was lacking - controlling units is clunky, and selecting individual units is difficult (you have to be VERY precise with your mouse clicks and it's hard to tell where your cursor is actually pointed because it's a big fat hand), which is a pain, since most units have active abilities (like Warcraft) which help them and their allies in combat. Overworld combat therefore often degenerated into two blobs of units ramming into each other, with the strongest unit blob emerging victorious.Another aspect of the game which I like in principle, but which was flawed in execution, is the ability to choose from two different factions - the Horde (another Warcraft reference) consisting of various green-skinned races, and the Demons (also referred to as 'The Flaming Legion'... yes, they did it again). In terms of mechanics, both factions play quite differently, however, the Demons require more micromanagement, are more difficult to use, and are just not very fun to play with in my opinion, which leaves me coming back to the Horde every time. There have been hints floating around that the devs are planning to bring in the Undead as a third faction. Watch this space.The underground aspect of the game plays like a simplified version of Dungeon Keeper. I like that you can now fill in areas of the dungeon you've mined out (so now my obsessive-compulsive tendencies are satisfied by perfectly shaped dungeon rooms and corridors. Researching upgrades is clunky, as you have to go to the appropriate room to do it; research takes places in three different rooms, two of which have multiple sub-menus for research, so it's difficult to tell what's yet to be discovered. Spells are, for the most part, not that interesting or useful.For me though, the worst part of the underground game is how easy it is to defeat waves of invaders after around the 15-20 minute mark. The difficulty of the waves doesn't really scale into the late game, and the top tier traps (like the Horde's Red Alert-esque Tesla Coil, and the Demons' giant tentacle) feel a bit redundant. The other thing I dislike about the game is the lack of replay value. Once you've played through the campaign, you've experienced everything the game has to offer. There isn't much strategic choice or flexibility in the game, so once you've figured out a winning formula for building up an epic dungeon from scratch, the game simply consists of following that same formula every time until you have an army big enough to stomp the overworld do-gooders.In terms of style, it's clear that the game is made by a German developer, since all rooms have an 'efficiency' rating, and beer is now an important resource that you must ensure a constant supply of, and your breweries are decorated with little Bavarian flags. In contrast to the grim, grainy visuals and dry, dark humour of Dungeon Keeper (hallmarks of its British devs), Dungeons 2 is bright and cartoonish, and its sense of humour is silly in a very Monty Pyhton-eqsue way. Most of the jokes come from the game's narrator, whose voice will be immediately recognisable to anyone who has played The Stanley Parable, which the narrator himself references in one of his many, many, fourth-wall-breaking moments. There are also multiple references to many other aspects of nerd popular culture. It's clear the devs are gigantic geeks from the things they make reference to. 80% of the references are related to Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings, I also picked up references to general pop culture (Two of my Nagas were called Kardass'shian and Kanyay'Wst), the Warcraft Universe, Warhammer, Gamergate and The Quinnspiracy, a couple of youtube videos I haven't seen in years (including Trololo and They're Taking the Hobbits to Isengard). I chuckled at a lot of the references, although the relentless Game of Thrones stuff started to get stale.All in all, this is a game I would recommend. It certainly brings back feelings of Dungeon Keeper nostalgia and despite being quite formulaic and lacking replay value, you'll get a good couple of dozen hours of fun gameplay out of this game before it starts to get dull. For those who miss the way strategy games used to be, despite all their flaws, Dungeons 2 will fill that gap while it lasts.Now to move on to War For the Overworld, which I've heard such good things about.

												Having never played Dungeon Keeper or any other game like that, I've really enjoyed my 10 hours of gameplay. Played the Pumpkin DLC, which was rather hard. Dam penguins kept disabling my traps. After a few hours I was losing and started over. Second match proved to be better and I was able to hold out against them for hours until I finally maxed out my dungeon and lvl'd up a large army that allowed me to kill the Penguin King. Was surprising hard for a tower defense rts based on an older game. I give this game 5/5 stars. Plan on playing more matches after I take a long deserving break.			"

												7/10 - A piece of gold, that sadly get's boring after a while.Many people see in Dungeons 2 the attempt to revive the success of Dungeon Keeper, but it is much more than that. Yes, it has most of the elements Dungeon Keeper had, but it has also some nice improvements to  the gameplay, a campaign that is quite entertaining over a good amount of time and a damn good working Coop- / Versus-mode. Thus the first game of the series had some problems, this one is nearly perfect for what it wants to be. The only difficulty it has, is the balancing of the three fractions. Once you know how they work you have just a limited amount of posibilties to get your opponent down: The orcs are pretty early game, the demons mid-game and the DLC's undead quite late-game. So if you dont act quick enough, you wont stand a chance later on, or vice versa. Gameplay - 9/10Atmosphere - 6/10Storytelling - 8/10Graphics - 6/10Playtime - 8/10Balancing - 3/10Total: 7/10 - A fair amount of fun, the DLC is totaly awesome.			"

												TLDR: Dungeons 2 is pretty decent strategy game.Dungeons 2 is successor for 90's game dungeon keeper, and it's as far as I think, a pretty good one. In this game you're playing as an evil dungeon master and you're using your minions to mine minerals and fight against the 'good' guys. Single player campaing is decent, it doesn't take itself very seriously wich makes it suprisingly fun and the narrator is very good. Plus there are quite a lot of references to other stuff like game of thrones for an example.The only problem that I have with this game is that there's not enough people playing it, therefore it's hard to find any online matches.

												Surprise! This game is actually good.And it is a huge surprise too, seeing as Dungeons 1 was terrible and expansion only sligthly less so.It is a cool Dungeon Keeper clone, but with it's own ideas and a pretty good execution on those too.Surface serves for a more RTS style gameplay (Warcraft 3 comes to mind a lot of times), while dungeons isa classic building we know from DK and DK2. You can now build rooms of any sizes and fit them with equipment thathas various uses, there is research, traps, spells, different creatures - with option to upgrade them to higher tiers.On top of that, there are factions now, which adds to the gameplay. Bored of horde? Go with the daemons.The overall graphic style is ok, nothing too fancy, not as serious as DK (again, Warcraft 3 comes to mind).Traps are very effective, but there are classes now that can disarm them to balance them out. Units use their skills automatically in the dungeon, while on the surface you have to use them via icons/shortcuts (again, WC3).After games like Dungeons 1 and Impire, I thought this will be a very bad game, so I was waiting with this game for some time. I think it has a solid 8/10 and is probably the best modern take on the old classics.			"

												Very fun, but short game; Even if you take your time through the campaign. Must play for Dungeon Keeper fans. Or fans of god mode dungeon play. I recommend waiting for a sale, cause $40 is double what i would play after giving the game a once through.Positives:Similar fun to dungeon keeper. Can go outside of your dungeon to wreak havoc against the outside world. Love that addition. 2 different evil groups to play with. multiplayer option. Cool traps. Warcraft like RTS above ground, and classic dungeon keeper underground. Story was amusing. Taken from Game of Thrones with little to some tweaks in storytelling. ""Unique"" minion/ henchmen naming made me smile. Glad to have had a newer version of dungeon keeper. just with there was more to it. Negatives: Overpriced IMHO. After finishing the campaign mode of this game, i would probably pay $20 for this game. Added a lot of cool elements to this game, but as far as replay value, I dont think i'd play this game again anytime soon. Not as much enemy interaction as dungeon keeper besides killing. Spell casting is annoying. Cursor calibration is needed. sometimes, the ""click box"" on something is impossible to get in a second or 2. Spent several seconds trying to find a block's click zone.

												This game is where you play as the bad guy as the task here is to take over the overworld in a fixed set of missions including where the Ultimate Evil has to wipe out the good guys from the face of the earth including some side missions where the UE can earn evil points for upgrades and things but that is all I will say here as I am not going to spoil anything. The controls may take a bit of getting used to at first but they are easy to master once the player gets the hang of using them. As well as doing missions to conqeur the overworld. You will have to defend and ward off attacks when the overworld good guys try to invade your dungeon. The missions are variable as they get challenging later on in the game as the enemies get stronger. So plan ahead and use tactics will make these missions much easier. The game is great fun to play and the narrator is quite hilarious at times because if you get stuck in the game. He will say some lines to drum up the player to work harder. Or you just laugh at the comments he makes :).Overall Rating: 8/10.			"

												Much closer to the original Dungeon Keeper games than its predecessor!  Once again you play the role of the evil dungeon keeper and build up your dungeon, fight off heros, gather gold, and upgrade your rooms and creatures.Pros:- You get the visit the 'Overworld' above your dungeon and take the battle to the heroes instead of always waiting for them to come into your dungeon. - The graphics looks like its from WarCraft 3- The dialogue of the narrator is humerousImprovments over predecessor:- Creatures can roam around the dungeon instead of being stuck in their spawn location and you can pick them up then drop them anywhere in the dungeon.- You don't have to capture heroes to collect soul energy just kill them like the good old days of Dungeon Keeper- You have to maintain your creatures by paying them gold and brewing beer for them to drink- No other dungeon masters you have to fightCons: - Campaign is short- Some missions could be long because your creatures need to have enough combat experiance to take out heroes in the OverworldOverall it was fun to play this game and would recommend if you liked the Dungeon Keeper games.

												Dungeon Keeper meets Warcraft 3.  Very nice idea, smooth gameplay, and engaging dungeon management.  I definitely feel I got value for money. Many hours of gameplay working through campaign and DLC with 3 seperate factions.The humour is where the game fell down.  It did not capture the nostalgic humour of the original DK series. This wouldn't be so bad if it hadn't been trying so desperately to do exactly this. Jokes are clunky,  cheap parodies of everything from LoTR to Frozen just come off as cheesy and the general DK feel that I and many gamers desire is simply not quite there.   "

												It's like Dungeon Keeper but at a snail's pace. You'll spend well over half of your play hours tediously upgrading everything in your dungeon one by one and watching your imps (snots) mine out gold like you recruited them from the local nursing home. Even fully upgraded the snots are incredibly slow at doing anything. You can tell just by noticing the slow pace and the ui that the game was originally developed with consoles in mind. The UI icons are pretty huge and it's also full of unnecessary submenus that just make getting to everything a little more harder than it should. Basically this is the fisher price consolized version of Dungeon Keeper, it's slow, really likes to hold your hand and is really easy. But it is still a decently enjoyable game despite some of its major flaws. if you are looking for another decent Dungeon Keeper game after you have gotten your fill of War for the Overworld then I would recommend Dungeons 2 if it is on sale.

												Having played the first I really wasn't expecting much from this one...a rare but very welcome surprise ensued. In fact it wasn't until recently that I even played it for any length consigned until now to the ""eventually"" pile of games picked up on sale.Smooth animation and art style is a joy to watch, tonge in cheek humor and campaign which plays around with popular medieval cliches and a certain high profile medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones makes for a lot of fun.Where this game differ's from standard dungeon keeper-esque games apart from being in my oppinion at least as good as it's inspiration (which is apparently quite a feet given how many have tried and failed) is in it's multiple evil factions to choose from and the ability to have your cake and eat it too in that you can take to the surface and bring the fight to those do gooders.If you're a fan of dungeon keeper gameplay and want a modern interpretation this is a very easy reccomendation.

												In my search for a worthy replacment for the much beloved Dungeon Keeper, I tried this game. I wanted to like it, I really did... but it's just not happening for me. Nice graphics? Check. Snarky moderator? Check. Dungeon management? Meh...not so much. The overworld is a nice touch, but gameplay is painfully slow. It takes forever to build up enough gold to do anything, and even then you're severely limited as to what you can do. Very few rooms, and even fewer minions to be had. And no real freedom. Sure you can turtle-up and take your time building a dungeon, but it's such a slog that you could literally walk away and do something else while waiting on it to happen. Plus, your minions will likely die from sheer boredom. Granted, I've only spent a few hours in-game, but I can't seem to force myself to play more.

												I played dungeon keeper 2 back in the day :) this is way up there and i cant stop playing it. i think dungeon management is the fun part in the game but it still is a great feeling putting ur hard trained units into controlled battle on the surface. only downside is maybe graphics as this is a 2015 release, dont know if it is to keep it in the spirit of the first dungeon keeper 2? i for one dont think the game would have been ruined with a little better graphics and if it was possible to turn camera view and maybe the ability to zoom out more. i promise u that the graphic complaints is not a reason to not buy this as this is still, for now game of the year for me :).u need this and i hope every user on steam buys this to support the future production of this series.

												Now this is a Dungeon Keeper successor.  Far better than the other copy cats I've played in recent years - and it adds a lot of it's own RTS flavored mechanics, coated in really attractive detailed graphics. There are some decent jabs at other games of our time (early access failures, EA F2P Dungeon Keeper) from the narrator, who only gets REALLY annoying if you take your time. That's my only complaint at the moment. If you crave some beautiful looking and playing Dungeon Keeper, pick it up!			"

												Dungeons 2 is a very nice game based on Dungeon Keepers, it has its unique way of telling a story and playing it doesnt get boring easily. So the main focus on the game is that of a dungeon manager. Build your dungeon with all types of different rooms, serving all types of different purposes. There is quite a lot of content in the game, which justifies the steep price for it. It's also quite polished and rich. It can get a little boring during the planning stages of the dungeon gameplay part. But nonetheless very amusing.When youve built an army youll head up to the overworld where good is oh so obviously present. From unicorns to the almost cliché good forces including wood elves, dwarves and knights in shining armor. Visually Dungeons 2 is very satisfying, though it lacks any strategic involvement of you in the RTS style battles. There isnt really any depth in the overworld fighting part. But that doesnt at all weigh out the fun in the dungeons. Last, id like to mention the narrator of the game. He also narrates the Stanley Parable. The narration is very funny and often plays a role in the game as big as the gameplay itself. The narrator makes countless references to things like the Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter etc. Also the self conscious humor about fantasy clichés the game uses, and lack of certain mechanics the narrator humorously points out. In the end Dungeons 2 is a very amusing game. It isnt at all perfect, but is does what a game should do: show you a nice time. If you like fantasy RTS dungeon managers, this is your game. Dungeons 2 is a very honorable homage to the Dungeon Keeper series.			"

												Since there are sooooo many bad reviews, just because the people wanted a 1:1 copy of Dungeon Keeper, I decided to write a fair review. This game is far from being bad! Sure it is not a 1:1 Dungeon Keeper Clone, but it doesn't even try to be a direct copy of Westwoods Old School classic. It is more a combination of Dungeon Keeper and Warcraft. The Dungeon building phases are fun, but after you get the hang out of it, they get pretty fast too easy. The battles on the overworld are fun, too. But only if you like games like Warcraft with a strict amount of units. Both placed in one game is a good combination and gives this game a nice touch. I liked the campaign very much, sure it was too short for such a game, but still it was definitely fun!But don't get me wrong. There were some points in the game, that really made me angry. Like the missing managment of the Snubs (Imps). If you had a trap and the entrance the little ones immediately run there just to repair it. Which caused a  big problem, because there were still enemies. The snubs ran there, dropped the traps in their hands and run away. Since they didn't reach their position new snubs started to run there. After a couple of seconds the complete amount of snubs tried to reach this one trap at the entrance. None of them was working on gold mining or any other job, that had to be done. That was pretty annoying. Still this game is far from being bad! So I decided to give it a positiv thumbs up and you should, too. But be aware...it is NOT a 1:1 copy of Dungeon Keeper!			"

												So far so good! The original Dungeons was a let down for me because I was expecting Dungeon Keeper. This release is DK enough to please but different enough to feel new.It's well polished and shiny, the pacing seems a little slow to start but that's okay because you gather momentum as you go, the narration is funny if a little cheesy but that's okay.I do feel like the overworld RTS elements are a bit basic (at the moment at least) but then I feel if it were to put too much into the RTS part it would undermine the dungeon part.Only detractions so far- It would be nice to be able to pick up creatures from their portraits- Population cap is very restrictive right now but I am early in and it will likely increase as I progress- The hand selection area is a bit annoying because the hand is quite big and the selector isn't at the tip of the finger as you'd expect but more towards the palm, it can make it a bit difficult when trying to pick up or drop items on specific units when there's a lot going onOverall - worth a punt, satisfies that old DK itch but not sure if It's quite worth the price tag, I'm happy right now but I'd have been ecstatic if I'd paid £20.00 for it.If you're a DK fan you've probably already bought it, if you aren't you'll enjoy it but you'll probably be more satisfied if you wait for a sale.

												Dungeons 2 is certainly a better return to the Dungeon Keeper trough than War for the Overworld.  Even better, while the game pays homage to DK, it is not a clone and brings new ideas to the table -- namely, separate RTS gameplay on overworld maps above your dungeon.  Contrary to other reviews are saying, it's not simply a matter of building up your dungeon then zerging the overworld -- you have juggle managing your dungeon whilst simultaneously dealing with overworld objectives.  The slower pace Dungeons 2 provides is welcome when you are herding your cats in two realms at once, trust me.+ Actually finished, playtested, and polished by designers with the chops to carry it off+ Servicable graphics+ Tried and true DK gameplay combined with a decent (if simplistic) overland RTS engine+ New ideas brought to the DK formula; not just new units and rooms that you wouldn't use anyway.+ Challenging scenario design- UI quibbles, particularly the fact that you have to manually pick up creatures one by one; shifts between interacting between the world (ex. tagging tiles) and clicking on UI elements is trickier than it needs to be- ""Less is more"" design sometimes packs too much functionality into a single room type resulting in having to keypress/click and search through nested selections.  Creature types are similarly overloaded.- Some annoying design decisions.  Remember how, in DK1, if creatures wandered in a library the warlocks would blast them, and how evil creatures fought amongst themselves?  Annoying, so Bullfrog removed both in DK2.  In Dungeons 2, ""bored"" creatures will pick on your imps.  - A little micro heavy for me, YMMV.8/10 "

												TLDR: The game is great. Get it.Did you ask for a truly great successor to Dungeon Keeper? Let me tell you a little bit about Dungeons 2. The gameplay is fantastic, it basically takes the gameplay of DK and improves it.The campaign is a load of fun, the narrator is superb and the references are hilarious. A pretty good campaign.Performance wise I have not had any problems at all, runs well on my 3,5years old computer.You are evil.A slight negative is the fact that there are only 3 skirmish maps available at this time.

												Definitely a dungeon keeper faithful. As many say there are some optimization tweaks that need to be done where the game lags hard on large dungeons but im running max settings and have encountered very few problems none of which were game ending.There is a screen where it ask you to sign up when you first start the game but you click skip and it merrily goes on along. Some people are too lazy to do even that and gripe about it :PIts got a good bit of light hearted humor in the typical overlord style and the graphics are not that bad.The only real downside to the game for me was the narration.... the opening story line goes on and on and on, at some point you go screw it and hit skip. And in game every 5 mins the narrator is reminding you to do this objective or that, even with a colorful tone its still damn annoying.Get a better narrator and swap out for shorter story lines to get to the point, some bug fixing and the game will not be anything revolutionary but it will be damn good fun especially if your a big old school dungeon keeper fan.well made game.

												The game is a lot of fun. Great dialogue, interesting characters and minions, with unique abilities well complemented.It's a lot like Warcraft, only you're building a dungeon, rather than a city.The reason for my thumbs down was simply the game is not optimized well for modern systems, or laden with bugs from the outset.Games could take up to 5 minutes to load up. The game would get periodically choppy as a map progressed. And if you get too far on a map, any progress you attempted to save, would become corrupted. Any attempt to load would simply crash the game to windows.After working a map for a good 2 hours, all saved progress would simply be lost. Even attempts to scatter saves within a minute apart... each would be equally corrupted.My computer is high spec, so not a hardware issue... at least from requirements.Very frustrating and disappointing for an otherwise enjoyable game play experience.

												This is the first impressions of the game, so it can be inaccurate. I played a lot in the original DK/DK2, but not in the new reincarnations, hence my opinion can look biased.It's DK, but somehow worse in almost every aspect.Controls.The controls are very inaccurate and not intuitive.Remember how you could pick up creatures clicking on their images in the menu? You can not here. Remember how you can select an individual member of a group by clicking theyr icon in almost all RTS? Guess what, you can not in D2. Remember how you can see the level of creatures? Here to see the stats of creature you must pick up it.UPD: Player can select a member of group by double-clicking on the icon. Thanks Salz.There also few graphical issues: the cursor-hand is too big and inaccurate, the click happens not in the index (which will be logical) but somewhere in the center of the palm.Gameplay.The digging and movement speed of the imps are annoyingly low. It makes the first small tutorial maps very boring. I like the idea that idle creatures decorate dungeon, but It is kind of fun to observe. However the control region if the dungeon heart was removed, you can pick up and drop your creatures everywhere -- it will probably break the balance in skirmish, to test.The limit on the number of creatures is harsh: 15 (probably it will be increased later with some chambers) imps included, that makes me feel undermanned.I will not comment the variety of rooms or creatures - I've seen only few, which is expected in the tutorial.Graphics.The visuals are Warcraft 3 style. Personally I prefer the original dark, depressive of DK,  but it the matter of taste. Images are so generic that I can't really say something, good or bad. The cinematics are better situated for a flesh game, they are not (probably yet) as goofy as in the DK2, but not epic as the  Blizzard ones. They try to be funny, but they overdo, not annoying but close.Scenario and humor.Until now the scenario is the classic DK2/Overlord -- goody destroys evil, evil starts to rebuild conquering the kingdoms.But humor... Humor is just a bunch of references, and it never shuts up. In the second mission, which takes 10-15 minutes I got the diabolical laugh, DK reference, DK mobile reference and few WTF lines.In the conclusion, it is not a bad game but it worse than the originals. If you haven't played DK and DK2 than do not take this one. Take the classics, understand why it is great game, and than try this one. If you know the originals almost by heart, than you can try D2.			"

												5/10Playable, without bugs. Gameplay is too slow with little progession and bad screenplay.At first you feel like yey! This is my good old Dungeon Keepr with new game mechanics. You would almost be right except the fact that the game is not good. It feels unfinished. I encountered only a few minor bugs. But what kills the game is the gameplay. All singleplayer games are absolutely the same. There is no progression or innovation over different levels. The game time is extremly long (we are talking up to 4 hours on a single map) because your workers are just too slow. UI is not very friendly. You constantly get mixed up about where to find upgrades for this or that. Selecting units in dungeon is pain in the ♥♥♥, because first of all you can only pick them up in dungeon and only one by one. Releasing these units can only be done again one by one even though you can press right button and it goes faster then single clicking. You can control them only on surface. There are three playable races but you won't find much difference between them. First of all they all play the same and second - combat well there is no strategy at all involved. It almost makes no difference what units you build, because the only thing that matters are their upgrades. At last we come to screenwriting. The first mission is great. You won't do much there, it's not very original but still, it is funnny. But further you get in your progression the worse the jokes get. In the end the game tries to play itself as Game of Thrones parody and nothing else. Which is in my opinion great failiure. You are put into a unique position of the Dungeon Master but this fact is hardly explored.The game has tremendous potential that is never realized except the first very short mission.			"

												After first game being rather weird and not really fun, second game went to be more RTSy. And it really worked, game is very fun. And the fact game offers tons of jokes and easter eggs makes it legen... wait for it... dary (yeah, they use that joke too). I'd guess it's main problem could be it's length. As of moment of writing review, I clocked nearly 12 hours. But there's a bit more stuff to do - a little side-campaign to finish - so I guess I'll put few more hours.			"

												A great sequal to Dungeon Keeper. There's not as many creature and room types as DK2, but the ones you have serve the purpose well, and they can be upgraded to more powerful creature types later on. One feature that this game has that DK2 didn't is the ability to fill sections of your dungeon back in so that you can funnel the heroes where you want them. This is, in my opinion, one of the best features in the game.A lot of people have complained about the surface battles, but I thought they were ok. The developers chose to focus on dungeon management rather than full RTS control. Don't go in expecting Warcraft III. The only thing I really miss from DK2 was the ability to capture enemies and imprison them. But, its not that big of a deal.Overall, this game was well thought out and designed. Loads of fun.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I feel bad for giving it a negative review. There's so much about it that's well executed. The art is phenomenal, the presentation in general shows just how much effort went into it, and it's based on Dungeon Keeper 2 which I love.The primary problem completely ruins the experience for me. You're never looking at the problems you face, considering the tools at your disposal, then producing and enacting a plan to do what you need to do. The game constantly, literally tells you what to do, and then nags incessantly whenever you don't do exactly what you've been told. I have extra hate for this game for making me want to punch The Stanley Parable narrator in the face (who gives a great performance, but the writing is very much not to my taste).The game is also much slower than DK/WFTO, which seemed like a decent idea until I experienced it; getting your dungeon to look how you want it is excruciating, and gold comes in so slow that you're constantly forced to wait, unable to do what you want... while the narrator nags you.This game looks better and runs better than War for the Overworld, and I had 10% as much fun playing it. I got about half way before giving up the notion that it might get more fun later.			"

												I really like this game! It allows you to take your time and build the most insane dungeon, basically. I bought all the DLC, but played only the vanilla campaign so far and had lots of fun so far. You can also go to the surface and fight other factions, after having trained your units in the Arena (a room you can build in your dungeon).Generally, I recommend this game if you liked Dungeon Keeper. It's different, but fun. I think it's fair to say this is the successor of Dungeon Keeper. ""Dungeons"" is not a very good name, IMHO, but don't let it fool you: this is a good game!** EDIT ** Actually, there might be some problem with memory management in this game... When the dungeon gets too crowded, bugs begin to appear. Sometimes, I can't throw minions in a portal; the loading times start getting bizarrely long and the game freezes in several occasions. :(Hope they fix it soon...			"

												If you’re interested in a deep review of this game going over pretty much all the features it offers and what it does right and wrong then I uploaded the review -> https://sithiousreviews.wordpress.com/2015/07/02/dungeons-2-review/ <- just for you.What you should enjoy:+ The art style, it's very well realized and is nice to look at, everything is well modelled and polished, the lighting and effects look great and once you get a huge dungeon built and fully working it just looks and feels wonderful.+ Content. This game would suck without all this content so thank god there is a good hunk of it here to dig into! It's defiantly the highlight of the whole game. There are two factions to enjoy here and both are unique and have their own speed of progression, play style, unit and room appearances, upgrades and god powers. Each faction has three tiers to go up from starting at tier one with the basics going up to tier three with the most powerful upgrades and units you can get, requiring to do some kind of super evil act to tier up like killing lots of unicorns so it's not just something you can do and toss away you have to earn it, making the tiers feels special and important. Alot of work went into making all this content and it's easy to appreciate since it makes the game last ages if your and upgrade hog like me and simply have to get everything before steam rolling the enemy, it feels great.+ Fun gameplay. The game doesn’t expect too much from you most of time, giving you plenty of time to get started and dig in each mission before heroes start attacking your lovely dungeon and distracting you. The over world is a great new feature to this genre, the added RTS is a great distraction and makes the game last way longer then it would without it and makes it truly feel like you’re fighting back and eliminating those nuisance heroes once and for all.+ Polished experience. You want a bug free dungeon game that runs fine, hardly crashes, goes pretty smoothly and doesn’t really ever let you down or block its own progress? Then look no further, I could never find a single bug in this game that ever effected gameplay, progression or caused frustration. The only thing it does is start up slowly, that's about it.What's not that enjoyable at all:- The RTS combat has to be the first thing, as original as it is added to a dungeon builder game it's clear these devs just don't know how to make satisfying RTS gameplay, which is a shame but you can't expect them to when they make dungeon games. The combat is way too simple to be fun or engaging for long, after your first few fights your already over it, then it just becomes a necessity not something you really want to do more of. Unit abilities and the 'god powers' you have to select from generally make a fight quicker by only afew seconds and it's easier to just not use them all, making them kinda irrelevant but it's nice they are there anyway. It's like they are there almost to distract you from the fact the combat is so super bland.- Annoying narrator, yea I did put him in the plus section for being quirky but hes also really overdone. Anyone that plays this game will either ignore how naggy he is, not like him for it or just flat out hate him, there is no true in between here he is just that naggy and hand holding your just like, ugh, please just stop nagging me and let me do my thang. I guess if the devs paid for him they are going to use the crap out of him aren't they? And that they did. - Ugly graphics choices. Although the graphics style looks great it could have done so much better with another graphics engine that really let all their hard work shine like it should do. The unity engine they are running it on must be freaken old cas the AA options are abysmal, only FXAA as an option should never be a thing, it's not even well done FXAA as it blurs the game to the point all detail and fidelity is lost, it's better without it on but then you have to put up with insane jagged edges everywhere on everything. It will drive you insane if graphics matter to you at all, seriously, it's a real shame.- Awful performance. Yep I’m gonna say it, this game runs like ♥♥♥♥, totally and complete ♥♥♥♥. It runs fine at the start where your dungeon is simply a throne room and nothing else but as you inevitably expand, more effects show up on screen, more units, more models, more stuff in general it runs worse and worse to the point where you can barely get over 20-30fps. Anyone that says under 60fps doesn’t effect gameplay doesn’t know what they are talking about or are blind cas under the 50fps mark and a game becomes less responsive and fluid, directly effecting how much you can interact with the game and thus effecting experience, it's that easy. You think turning all the graphics down to low will help too? Pff good luck, it will probably give you another 20 frames max but that’s it, if it runs like crap to begin with it will still run like crap. I have an average computer that most people will have if you’re wondering.- Way too easy. The game is abit tricky at first when your units are low levelled, not upgraded and you have few of them, but then when you build a big army and beef them up the game is a total breeze. At mid game there is no longer any intensity or worry your throne room is gonna get destroyed because you can easily call back all your units with one simple spell and stop the enemies anyway. After the start there is no challenge or depth to this game, the enemy waves stay the same as they started and never get hard or frequent enough to give you any concern, even then some well placed traps will kill most of them. A simple difficulty setting for the campaign would have easily fixed this but oh well I guess.- Hard to manage your dungeon. It's silly but sometimes you forget where your rooms are and have to keep looking for them... the god powers are binded to really weird keys like k-7, and k-1, what the hell does that even mean? You never know what your workers are actually doing, if they are mining gold for you or not, how much income they are actually making, how to make them bring it in faster, no way to make them prioritize tasks, no way to set different minions to different tasks so they are more effective, nothing. If you want management there is none in this game, you just build a pretty dungeon, build units to run it and watch, yep that’s what you do. Occasionally you'll send combat units out to fight then boom you win. The game is so simple sometimes you swear it was made for kids...- Very linear gameplay and  storyline. Your evil, you got killed by heroes, you want revenge... yep that's it. If your looking for storyline then wow you are so in the wrong place, lol. Each missions is pretty straight forward, do the usual, build up your dungeon, steam roll enemies along a super linear path all the way to enemy base and destroy it, boom done, go to next mission, rinse repeat. It's about as interesting to read as it is to play.- The game doesn’t take itself, or the fact you are supposed to be evil, seriously at all. This... makes it feel like a kids game most of the time and I’m not a kid so yea. It's pretty clear dungeon games where you being an evil sadistic a-hole ruining what’s supposed to be a happy, perfect world should never a kids game, it should take the evil thing more seriously and make you feel truly evil not like you’re kind of just acting like you are. I think the devs probably got this now... maybe.- Multiplayer. What multiplayer?! If you got this game for playing with friends you made a bad buy my friend, the multiplayer is simple and sucky, just play the single player.Overall this is a 6.7 out of 10 for me. I can't recommend it because of all the badly executed mechanics, graphics options and the sheer amount of negatives this game has that are so bad they are easy to point out and explain. Get it on sale, give it a try.			"

												The game for its current price of 45 euros is to high.It is a very slow game, not just performance wise ( a lot of slowdowns under 30 fps )The campaign can be done within 5-6 hours.The Skirmish maps are a total of 5 and some are direct copies of a campaign map.The game is very easy, even on immortal ( highest difficulty ) it is far to easy. (v1.2)A lot of features are to powerfull or no point in using ( Traps of 5 give or take is enough to beat Immortal waves of mobs ) and since its so easy, spells are hardly used or useful.The story of the campaign is heavely influenced by Game of Thrones and other known series, not much original sides to it.The Narrorator is to much on the foreground, you can change it but that kind of shows the issue..I had a much larger and more depth review but it won't post it, you can find it on metacritics.Played on a Played on Max settings, 1080p 4790K, AMD R9 280x/ATI 5870, 16 gig ram and SSD.

												They should have said to @#$% with the trademarks infringement and called this Dungeon Keeper 3 instead.Although if you were looking to be able to decorate your dungeon like you did Dungeons with all the prestige gadgets then you will be mildy disappointed.The first few campaign missions tend to suck a bit because of the polulation limit hampering your resource management. However once you get to the mission that unlocks the poulation cap increases it becomes much more managable.The outdoors portion brings a refreshing feature to the game. In most missions you have the ability to stop the adventurers before they even reach your dungeon. However it also brings more risk because you can unlock more enterances into your dungeon from outdoors and expanding underground. For those who played Impire the outdoor portion of this game is way beyond watching a timer.The narrator can be both funny and annoying. Having a narrator tell your story as you progress is an interesting new twist. However it quickly becomes annoying if you are not progressing on your mission fast enough.Have not played multiplayer or a skirmish yet, but from what I have seen those features should bring more replayability to the game. Campaign replayability not so much those first four campaign missions are a pain enough to not want to replay them. "

												Make no mistake, Dungeons 2 is a good game. It's polished, entertaining, and does scratch that Dungeon Keeper itch. It's even funny, so long as pretending to be evil and a narrator that is constantly making ridiculously obvious pop culture references is something you find funny.For better or worse, the game is extremely easy, and fairly short. I play games quite slowly, and I was finished with the main campaign in 21 hours. That's not much content for a $30 game, especially one where they could've added a lot more content simply by rehashing the same game, but with different objectives, to flesh things out, and it still would have been fun. For as polished as it is, there will be a lot of things that send you Googling. The game doesn't do a good job of explaining how you're supposed to do things, such as upgrading minions, so you're left either poking every single option, or looking it up.All in all, it is a fun 20-something hours, but I would wait for it to go on sale.

												It's awesome. Great aesthetic, good voice work, good sound quality and best of all a fun game. I love the RTS gameplay of the Overworld, feels incredibly similar to classic RTS's like Warcraft III. To add on, this game has a layer of polish that few games, such as the previous Dungeons or other games in the same vein, feature.  Also, the pop culture references are hilarious and come on, who doesn't like being the bad guy? Now, who wants to conquer the Overworld and send those pesky heroes to oblivion? >:)

												After receiving good feedback from the developers, I've been asked to post this as a review.  I just bought this wonderful game today and i've put in a few hours already and i'd like to point out a few minor issues i have, and hopefully something can do be done about them.Issue #1: During the Campaign i went to pickup a unit such as the Orc, i tried to drop him on the guard room so he would be assigned to guard, the demon-like hand was hovered over the guard room area however, the Orc fell on the outskirts of the room and by that happening he was not assigned to the guardroom. I had to re-pickup the Orc and place the hand over the room in a few different directions because i couldn't tell exactly where he would drop, this was more of an annoyance than an issue i suppose.Issue #2: I really enjoy the narrator-theme-humor, but some objectives are not as easily completed which causes the narrator to constantly repeat the same line over and over again, becomes a bit annoying - specially when the narrator is semi-insulting me for taking my time, again its more of an annoyance than an issue.Issue #3: The population cap in the first few missions during the campaign really hindered me when it came to progressing my dungeon - I had to sacrifice workers just to build Orcs to defend my dungeon, and then during the naga mission (which i am currently on) I had to go back several times to either sacrifice workers to build more soldiers, or i had to sacrifice soldiers to build more workers, it was a little hindering on progressing, but nonetheless i got through it.These so far are my only issues, overall excellent game, I'm a big fan of dungeon management games (I've been playing them since the first dungeonkeeper came out before 2003), I'm very happy about this installment to continue the dungeon-like series, the best part is that it combines RTS with dungeon management.EDIT: The developers are currently working on all of the issues I've listed here, so props to them and appreciate the hard work they're doing. I sure wish other game developers cared this much about their games.TL;DRFrom an avid RTS and Dungeon/resource management gamers point of view, 9.5/10 highly recommended			"

If you like a game that requires micro managmentlots of evil deeds, and grands you a good mood trough enjoyment and laughter,this is one to try out! :).If you find it too expansive, try a demo! Worked for me :)			"

												Make no mistake, Dungeons 2 is a good game. It's polished, entertaining, and does scratch that Dungeon Keeper itch. It's even funny, so long as pretending to be evil and a narrator that is constantly making ridiculously obvious pop culture references is something you find funny.For better or worse, the game is extremely easy, and fairly short. I play games quite slowly, and I was finished with the main campaign in 21 hours. That's not much content for a $30 game, especially one where they could've added a lot more content simply by rehashing the same game, but with different objectives, to flesh things out, and it still would have been fun. For as polished as it is, there will be a lot of things that send you Googling. The game doesn't do a good job of explaining how you're supposed to do things, such as upgrading minions, so you're left either poking every single option, or looking it up.All in all, it is a fun 20-something hours, but I would wait for it to go on sale.

												I loved the original game.  I do love this one - with a few exceptions:*I miss the jail and being able to create skeletons*I miss a ""Functional"" torture chamber where you can turn your enemies.*The quest is rather short (or I played it so often that it went too quickly.  :D )I was thrilled when Dungeons 2 came out.  There's  a learning curve (as there is with any new game) and there is not an exact line up with the old game.  Overall, that's good.  It's a new adventure with new fun.  The text has been ""fixed"" tho' the info above the heads of the demons is still too tiny to read.  The hints could be a bit more extenstive.  But if you've played the old one, you should really enjoy this one.  I'm glad I bought it.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for any add-ons or fixes that make that torture chamber useable.

												So, this is a game that, through the rough road that Dungeons followed, has ironically come full circle to become a partial shameless copy of Dungeon Keeper. Now you might be saying to yourself, ""why buy a game that's a copy of an older game,"" and normally I would be saying that to myself too, but try playing the old game on a current pc. The reality is that, when Dungeons came out, everone started comparing it to the old masterpieces, and mostly unfavorably. Kalipso seems to have taken the hint, swallowed some pride, and went all out to bring the fun of Dungeon Keeper back to life with a full slate of new and challenging features into the bargain. They had big shoes to fill; we look back at the old games of the good old days, and they seem to have a golden sheen. I believe they actually had to move to a bigger size for this one. The humor is just as good, factoring in the slight nod they've given to a somewhat younger crowd (16 vs. 18 or 21, depending on how prudish you may be), and the style is familiar without being exactly the same. Fighting across different maps makes it challanging and new. They involve the world in the gameplay in ways that DK never could have, and the cute vs. darkish tension makes me laugh, and maybe you too. I look forward to DLC and see hours of playing this in the future. It's just a good time.			"

												If you liked the original Dungeon Keeper series, you'll like this game. The witty comical comments throughout this game as you're playing are quite ""refreshing"". Just under 25 hours of total gameplay in the campaign mode. Lot's of pop culture references, TV references, other game references, and stabs at some of the aforementioned, are present.			"

												After receiving good feedback from the developers, I've been asked to post this as a review.  I just bought this wonderful game today and i've put in a few hours already and i'd like to point out a few minor issues i have, and hopefully something can do be done about them.Issue #1: During the Campaign i went to pickup a unit such as the Orc, i tried to drop him on the guard room so he would be assigned to guard, the demon-like hand was hovered over the guard room area however, the Orc fell on the outskirts of the room and by that happening he was not assigned to the guardroom. I had to re-pickup the Orc and place the hand over the room in a few different directions because i couldn't tell exactly where he would drop, this was more of an annoyance than an issue i suppose.Issue #2: I really enjoy the narrator-theme-humor, but some objectives are not as easily completed which causes the narrator to constantly repeat the same line over and over again, becomes a bit annoying - specially when the narrator is semi-insulting me for taking my time, again its more of an annoyance than an issue.Issue #3: The population cap in the first few missions during the campaign really hindered me when it came to progressing my dungeon - I had to sacrifice workers just to build Orcs to defend my dungeon, and then during the naga mission (which i am currently on) I had to go back several times to either sacrifice workers to build more soldiers, or i had to sacrifice soldiers to build more workers, it was a little hindering on progressing, but nonetheless i got through it.These so far are my only issues, overall excellent game, I'm a big fan of dungeon management games (I've been playing them since the first dungeonkeeper came out before 2003), I'm very happy about this installment to continue the dungeon-like series, the best part is that it combines RTS with dungeon management.EDIT: The developers are currently working on all of the issues I've listed here, so props to them and appreciate the hard work they're doing. I sure wish other game developers cared this much about their games.TL;DRFrom an avid RTS and Dungeon/resource management gamers point of view, 9.5/10 highly recommended			"

												The game for its current price of 45 euros is to high.It is a very slow game, not just performance wise ( a lot of slowdowns under 30 fps )The campaign can be done within 5-6 hours.The Skirmish maps are a total of 5 and some are direct copies of a campaign map.The game is very easy, even on immortal ( highest difficulty ) it is far to easy. (v1.2)A lot of features are to powerfull or no point in using ( Traps of 5 give or take is enough to beat Immortal waves of mobs ) and since its so easy, spells are hardly used or useful.The story of the campaign is heavely influenced by Game of Thrones and other known series, not much original sides to it.The Narrorator is to much on the foreground, you can change it but that kind of shows the issue..I had a much larger and more depth review but it won't post it, you can find it on metacritics.Played on a Played on Max settings, 1080p 4790K, AMD R9 280x/ATI 5870, 16 gig ram and SSD.

												This game has a lot of potiential, but as it is, it falls flat on its face.  The UI is not intuitive at all.  The maximum zoom seems like it is designed for a 640x480 screen.  It should be much further out.  Regarding the maps, the game provides 2 maps, one for overworld and one for underworld (which is great).  However, then there are alternate maps that must be frequently interacted with that do not have a ""map"" that can be quickly cliked on.  Add in a regrowing fog of war, and its too much to handle.  I played a short time, but it was a short, frustrating time, and games certainly should not be frustrating.Note, this review was when the game and DLC was 75% off.  The idea that this game regularly sells for four times what I paid is absolute insanity.  If you can get over the UI, or play games with keyboards alone, this game might be worth $15-20, but I cannot recommend it.			"

												Having never played, but was always interested in, any of the previous titles that make up this genre I was a but unsure on the purchase. I decided to take the plunge and I can honestly say it is well worth the money.This game comes across as a well polished title overall and despite some people having performance problems, for me I can report that it runs very smooth and have yet to experience a lockup or crash with graphics maxed out. This on an i7-920;  HD7970; 12 GB RAM running Windows 7 64 bit.Graphics while they come across as cartoonish, World of Warcraft comes to mind, are very detailed especially when zoomed in, however you will probably be playing the majority of the game zoomed all the way out. When zoomed in your floating hand (cursor) practically fills up the majority of the viewing space anyway. However at any level watching your little minions go about their tasks setting up traps, mining gold, brewing beer, researching tech and especially those who when left idle will take it upon themselves to sure-up and improve the walls in your dungeon, is quite enjoyable and well done.Gameplay is fun overall and building your dungeon and setting traps for any would be hero who decides to try and steal your gold is done quite well. The top side RTS type of game is not very in depth however you still have units with special abilities etc. and overall had the surface content not been implemented this game would definitely feel as if it was lacking something.  The humor displayed by the narrator is great and while it may break immersion at times this game is meant to be fun and if you're without a sense of humor perhaps this isn't the right game for you. I do agree with some people in that it can be a bit ""too"" cheerful and I would like to see more decorations befitting a true evil dungeon (skulls, chains, head on a stick etc.). Also the addition of an auto-save function would definitely be something that needs to be implemented. Despite being bug free for me had I had a crash or lockup I could have lost 2+ hours of a game by the time I realized I had been playing for so long (a positive sign lol) and decided to save on my own. There does not appear to be a map editor and skirmish play is limited to maps that shipped with the game. No randomly generated ones. In conclusion despite my limited play time I can say I already have no regrets in making this purchase and as a complete noob to this genre I couldn't be happier. Highly recommend this one to anyone on the fence about making the purchase. That goes for fans and newcomers alike.			"

												I want to like it. Really, I do. I really liked Dungeon Keeper 2. But this game needs a lot of work.First of all, there are immense memory leaks causing slowdowns and finally crashes on the surface missions. The game is entirely unbalanced, too easy through the main campaign and suddenly stupid hard in the expansion. There's promise here, but it's not an overall good game.			"

												This is my first Dungeons game so not basing my review on the series. Not worth the $40 price tag (IMO). Parts of the UI are clunky, like trying to click on units. Wish there was an option to just switch to a normal pointer (for better accuracy). Sending units around in the dungeon requires clicking on each one (can stack in hand/pointer) and then dropping them off (a spell helps a little with this later on). Sending units outside always requires clicking on each one and dropping them off on the way out.  Only 3 skirmish maps. The narrator humor is ok but starts to wear on you after awhile.			"

												I regret buying this game for $9.99 discounted, then the song of winter DLC for $15 not discounted.When I saw the 10 dollar temporary pricetag and dungeon manging preview vid (first dungeon managing game mind you) I was sucked into it's style and unit management very quickly. Installing, then playing the game. the campaign though pathetically a day or two long, had some of the most enjoyable voice acting from a narrative voice I've experienced in recent gaming. Not to mention the fun references and pokes to other well known game franchises every 30seconds.Now why I regretted buying this; it's hollow, and cheap. After quickly finishing the campaign I grew easily accustomed to the 'horde' race and was eager to try the demon race. Now being a MAN I simply could not continue playing on normal difficulty. So I ramped it hard, beat a few skirmishes, big whoop. Naturally you only want to try for a better challenge, right? So I skipped very hard right into impossible difficulty. And right there, is where it began to show how flawed the game was built. They knew the dungeon managing experience they were setting to make, however the balancing, difficulty, variance in gameplay, that all fell flat on it's face.First of all evert single race operates the EXACT SAME, build treasuries, build relax room (brewery, admiration, F.R.P.), build a mana room, build a trap resources room, build an upgrade room, then smash some camps, get your evil up, and upgrade. Rinse and repeat. Only I could repeat it barely twice per race before becoming numb.AND FUSTRATED, because impossible difficulty is well.... IMPOSSIBLE. Literally, I like hard difficulties bordering on the unfair masicism. But it's just not balanced. I couldn't find a single youtube video that showed someone beating this game on impossible. Why? Because impossible is broken. The first half is always fine but as soon as you get swamped with units that disarm your traps, you lose. You, lose. You have no chance fighting 3 times whatever size your army is as a constant stream without your traps.Lastly let me talk about the races. 'Horde' being probably the most easiest and simple to play as. Demon's being way too ridiculously weak in the beginning to stand any chance above hard difficulty. And then undead which honestly don't add anything new besides the undead theme of rooms and... some units come back when they die?Anyway.... this game is just so short, vanilla version includes a pitifully short campaign and just two boring races. And when you try to play the game seriously on a difficult that makes you try, it breaks because it wasn't balanced for higher difficulties and maps. It is such an insult when you finish the campaign and open skirmish just to find NO ORIGINAL MAPS. THEY JUST RECYCLE THE CAMPAIGN MAPS. It's fun for the first game you play, but just don't buy it. Play at your unlucky friend's who bought it.EDIT: Oh I forgot to mention? You better turn on 15min auto save or save yourself every 5minutes. I play on win10 and this game CRASHES EVERY 20minutes guaranteed. It WILL crash on you, and it seems to be a lot more likely to crash the longer you go without saving, ironically.			"

												Is not a bad game, though after playing Dungeon Keeper I'm not really totally satisfied with Dungeons 2... At Dungeon Keeper it really felt like I was building some dungeon and it was a bit more dark and focus on the construction side. Here it has a touch of defend the dungeon and the bright and happy unicorn bright side of it make me puke. I think I became evil. Sorry I cannot continue the review I need to destroy some happy rabbits dancing on a rainbow.			"

												The game tries very hard to be like old DK, but frankly it is not challenging. 5 hours in and i have nearly finished the whole game. $45 USD for 5 hours of gameplay is insaine. Additionally, unless you are willing to sign up to their online service (which goes down and throws you out of the game) you wont be able to save your progression other than manual saves. Even the original DK let you play on from unlocked levels for crying out loud. GG welcome to the new age. Strongly disappointed. bah!			"

												Slow and boring...The game is just dull, build this, ok now go here and kill this. Spells dont mean anything. The ""invaders"" into your dungeon are non-existent. The roam in all stupid like and die. I never feel like my dungeon is in danger. The narrator was meant to be funny but is just freaking miserable to listen to. I get having some quirky statements and the game trying to be funny. The whole game is the narrator being overly simple and blunt. Constantly mentioning other games and dropping names of popular culture favs. The game is nothing, just sit there and build up some stuff and then order your minions to fight by right clicking. There are some spells but there is no easy way in battle to use them. As far as I can tell no one thought making it easy to pick up minions by just clicking the potrait was a good idea and I find it tedious to order them around. Basically day 1 I was kind of meh about the game. Day 2 I got bored and I came back for a third day to find myself not even wanting to play. A waste of $40. A huge waste of money. I would rather go play dungeon keeper than this nonsense.			"

												Incredibly disappointed. Does not live up to being Dungeon Keeper 2's successor. DK2 was much better. I still have it and I'd rather replay it than finish this game.Why? The pace is VERY slow and boring. This game needs to be fixed. Population of workers and fighters are mixed and the cap is VERY low. 3 orcs does not a horde make. And when you have 25 tasks+ in your dungeon at any given moment 4 workers is not enough. But you can't waste more population cap on workers because you need to defend your dungeon. Everything is incredibly expensive and the pace never picks up.Don't you tell me about patience. This is a video game but instead of being fun it's a boring drag that wastes up my valuable free time.It was a good effort. But this is a critical flaw and until it is fixed I wouldn't recommend the game.			"

												This is a very fun - for a while. However, like many of the other reviews, i'm disappointed in the lack of content for the price of this game. After you play through the campaign of a RTS game, what do you do? Usually head over to multiplayer. This is what I did with a friend, only to find out that there is no AI support so we have to play against eachother. Other than finding two other random people, there is no way for us to be in the same team and start a game. It's so disappointing that AI has not been added in and that has pretty much ruined the game for my friend and I. The gameplay is great and I love the idea of having two ""worlds"" to control - your base back underground, and the battlefield in the overground. Being able to create your own rooms and populate them with workers creates a great sense of customization within your base. If you enjoy single-player RTS-like games then I would recommend it, however the campaign is not gigantic and as others have stated it takes only between 15-20 hours to complete, then you're stuck for choice on how to carry on. If you and a friend are looking to play this together, do not purchase this game.			"

												A very, very nice game. Two factions, four sort of 'base' units which can then be upgraded into an advanced form of said unit with different abilities, the narrator from the Stanley Parable is the narrator in this game, as per usual he is fantastic. Like in the Stanly Parable, this game is very self-aware, and jokes a lot about itself and pokes some fun at other games. The only problem I have in the game is performance issues. I have two GTX 980s and this game almost always runs sub-60fps underground, and sub 50-fps aboveground.			"

												Game has a solid amount of polish, voice acting is good. The style is very Kalypso, which if you've played Orcs must die you know the art style. Problem is the game just isn't fun. The fun part of dungeon building games is actually building the dungeon. Every map you play comes with pre excavated rooms, and your treasury is determined by where the infinite gold veins are.

												The demon faction is an imitigated disaster. They are incredibly needy, with them slowly trudging to a place for adoration and waiting minutes for someone to come and adore them rather than just chugging a beer like the normal faction. Their system of advancing troops is bugged as well as being poorly designed as is and overall seem like a tacted on afterthought that got very little thought at all. But the real reason this isn't getting a recommendation is because the normal faction isn't much better. Your minions are so slow and so needy that by the time they go and grab their pay they're thirsty and so then they go get a drink and then they slowly make their way back to work where then it is once again payday and the cycle begins anew. I had to build breweries and treasuries right next to each work place if I ever wanted any work done and I didn't want to constantly be ferrying my minions around manually. Good game, poor design.

												Simply put, this game is not worth the money, it's maybe worth $5-10.  There is very little replay value, and the single player campaign takes maybe 5 hours to complete.  While it looks like I have 24 hours played now, 15 of those hours are setting at the ""Match Making"" screen waiting for the non-existent multiplayer aspect to kick in.  The single player campaign has a neat narrator, but again, it's very, very short.Multiplayer is plagued by terrible design.  There's no lobby selection.  If you want to ""Join a Game"" you have to somehow magically know the ""Game ID.""  It doesn't show a list of available lobbies.  It's like match-making circa 1996 when you needed a third party application like GameSpy to connect to anything.  There is ""QuickMatch"" and by ""quick"" they make 5-miutes to 10+ hours.  I literally sat in a ""quick match"" queue for over 10-hours once.So basically, they game is 5 hours long, and there is no viable multiplayer.  I've managed to play 3 games, and one of them I spent about 40 minutes building before I invaded his dungeon and realized the other player was AFK the whole time.  Likely because he had fallen asleep after being in ""Quick Match"" queue for some long.Short story:  Needs more single player content.  Needs match making technology from this millenium.  Matchmaking technology equivalent to cutting edge 1990s games, might as well support IPX for LAN play.			"

												Dungeons 2 is a Dungeon Keeper clone with a touch of innovation. If you are a fan of the Dungeon Keeper series and are in the mood for something a bit more light-hearted, this might be the game to try.There are two main aspects to this game: dungeon management and RTS. The RTS element is a welcome addition, although it is somewhat simplistic.What this game lacks in depth, it makes up for in style and charm. The art style is delightful. The narrator practically bombards you with amusing pop culture references.The single player campaign will last you around 15 hours. With that in mind, I'm not sure it's worth the full asking price, but definitely consider this game if you see it on sale with a decent discount.Please note that this recommendation does not extend to this game's predecessor - Kalypso's Dungeons. Dungeons, like most other games in any way associated with Kalypso, is a disappointing game which does not deserve your money or your time. "

												This game had wonderful narration, a compelling story and neat gameplay. Which is pretty much overshadowed by the utter lack of content, the abysmal AI and the quite annoying difficulty because of it. Dungeons 2 is basically in competition with the game known as ""War for the Overworld"" and when you compare the two, this one flat out loses. Here are a list of things that Dungeons 2 doesn't have, or support.-Workshop Compatibility.-Map Editor, and access to all the units, props and environment while in Editor.-Themed Dungeons.-Ability to use the ""Good"" guys and turn them to your side. -Survival Mode. -Home Realm. (Plays the part of your MAIN Dungeon) -Both limited and unlimited variatons of the gold resource. And yet it's competitor does. When you go into the main menu for both games, Dungeons 2 has next to no options for anything, and War for the Overworld has a whole slew of things for you to do. Ontop of that, the games narrator's are about equal in terms of humor, comedic timing, story telling, helpfulness, and skill. The Campaigns of both games are fairly close as well from a storytelling standpoint. (SPOILER)To addon to the abysmal AI point I made above: From a Narrative standpoint the final battle of the Undead DLC where you bring back the prime evil. The other two aspects of evil are more focused on killing you, than actually claiming the ritual site. Any aspect of evil (Again this is a narrative point) winning, would lead to the creation of the Prime Evil. However the AI actively lets the Good guys win, just so they can focus on attacking YOU. Meaning the AI goes balls to the walls trying to kill you, pretty much avoiding eachother. This basically culminates in you losing way more often than you rightly should, as the AI is constantly agressive towards you, pretty consistently neutral/passive towards eachother, and lets good win the day, just for the sake of killing you - One of the Aspects of evil, simply because your the player. Right, thats a gameplay mechanic.Ontop of that annoying little mechanic, you will lose. A lot. Due to stupid AI shenanigans, and agressiveness. Meaning early on in the missions, you'll wind up being attacked by quickly overwhelming forces, unless you play perfectly. Which is fine, except in missions such as the one described above, your attacked right off the bat by two enimies on a set path to your base, and one enemy who randomly teleports into your base. Each force being especially difficult to fight off. Atleast the AI in War for the Overworld are more realistic, and consistent. But when you come down to it, content wise Dungeons 2 loses by a landslide, the DLC for both games are pretty bad though. Except for like one DLC for each game, Dungeons 2 has a DLC that basically lets you finish the story, and War for the Overworld has a DLC that basically picks up where the games ending left off.Again though, War for the Overworld has Workshop compatibility, a whole slew of game modes, and an editor. Dungeons 2 has DLC - which do you think is better.Edit: I just realized that the War for the Overworld team actually replies to comments in their updates, and take feedback and ideas to heart. Holy crap they beat Dungeons 2 so bad.			"

												It's quite difficult to write reviews for this sort of game without comparing them to Dungeon Keeper, so I won't bother. I've been waiting for a good successor to DK2 for years, and this one looks like a fine fit.The graphics are good, the gameplay is smooth, and I liked the sound effects. The minions in several flavours are nice. You think you've got about 5 total, but each one can evolve twice for a respectable range of 15 slightly different beasties, in the Horde, the Demons, and presumably the Undead.I haven't tried multi-player, so I won't comment on that. The storyline is silly, quirky, and slightly self-referential, happily dropping in references to other franchises with all the skill and care of a hungover troll. I found them funny, others may not.There is also a massive amount of spoofing ""A Game of Thrones"", in utterly shameless fashion :)While each level can get a little formulaic (expand, develop, build, upgrade) I can't see any way to avoid that in this sort of game, and the ability to send your minions for a walk in the sunshine and a little (crude) RTS combat keeps things interesting. Each level seemed to take quite a while, but the campaign went quite quickly.I bought this on a Steam sale, but intend to pick up the undead DLC (another 8 missions and another faction) at full price.I would reccomend this game.Having now completed this game and the Undead campaign DLC, I can confirm that it is very silly, self referential, and mercilessly takes the mickey out of ""A Game of Thrones"" all the way through....I still think it's good.

												Dungeons 2 is very similar to dungeon keeper in various ways in terms of building new rooms and expanding your dungeon. The campaign however is very good as well as the tutorial but the multiplayer is a bit on edge in terms of spells for example) by the time your opponent reaches dungeon level 2 and has required the Evil Strikes Back Spell theres no way to kill him he wipes out your army in a matter of seconds and by the time you've built up your army your opponet would have his spell already up making it pretty much impossible to kill your opponent. In terms of defence the traps are a bit over powered as well making it extremely difficult to get into any dungeon depending of the length of the hallway to your dungeon.Overall the game is really good for single play skirmish and campaign but not so well in multiplayer death match  in terms of certain spells and equipment the only thing i'd recommend if your going to play this game with a friend on multiplayer is to make a rule to not use or get the EVIL STRIKES BACK spell because of its insane power of wipping your army out in a matter of seconds.

												To summarize this in a few words.  Its a good game. It's definitely not Dungeon Keeper or its like. However its a mix of a few games in one.  Pros- Entertaining - Gives a few different army mixes and play styles. - a new gameplay mechanic. Cons. - Could have speed up the game a bit as it takes too long to move up the gameplay and the attack speeds- needed some basic key bindings that can be found in other games like attack move button. In conclusion, this game is a 50/50, you will either like it or you wont. Do watch the gameplay vids on Youtube before purchasing it. However, if there is a sale for it, this would be a sure buy.

												Fantastic game.  I've played it for hours and never ran into a bug. I've read some of the negative reviews and I don't get it.  It's far superior to the first Dungeons (which I actually did not care for).  I loved the fact that you can go from the dungeon up to the overworld.  Great mechanic where the control mechanism changes from Dungeon Keeper style of click-to-pick-up to standard RTS style.  It's got many different things to see and do.  Lots to discover and have fun with.  My only real complaint would be that, aside from the lightning spell(which you receive at the start of the game) the rest of the spells are fairly useless.  I appreciate their presence(from a desire to give a player more things to do) but it might have made more sense if certain creatures were immune or highly resistant to one type of spell over another.  As it stands, you hit their healer and/or thief with the lightning spell and let your traps do the rest of the work.  Which reminds me- I love the traps.  They work exactly as you hope they would.  Rolling boulders that hit their targets do a TON of damage, tar pits slow the good guys down, etc.  All the traps have a nice and understandable purpose(unlike most of the other spells).I'm not going to get down too much into the pros and cons.  I'll simply say that if you liked Dungeon Keeper, I think you'll like this game.I recommend it unreservedly.			"

												It is indeed very well made game that greatly well inherits the nostalgia of Dungeon keeper, which was also great game, a god-like game, a Fxxkin' masterpiece game. but, sadly, Its' campaign, which should motivate the player to play some sandbox or survival after it finished, seal the game itself after when we barely feel the tutorial is finally over.even though campaign feels like never ending tutorial, due to many of abilities and rooms and creatures and etc locked away even after half of the campaign finished, It gives you very good gaming experience, because of good sense of humor, distinctive objectives, and well, unlocking another features that game locked away.but yet again, when you finally feels like the real game started, It suddenly over. you can't actually get enough chance to play with full feature of the game in campaign. plus, It does not entertains you with variety features of 'what's becoming evil dungeon lord'. did you wanted to make some muscle creatures happy by build arena and throw them into pit-fighting? or scam the paychecks away by build some casino and bars in your dungeon? or see some dumb things that creatures do because they are dumb creatures? That's too bad. creatures in this game will show you nothing but eating and sleeping and well, decorating walls.so, what made this game cost that great feature? answer is, not so interesting surface adventuring! with bad control! of course, It is great leap for the evil lord that always dwells the grim, dark, humid, underground. but, again, to conquer and corrupt the holy surface land and kingdom, you does not need to be more challenging, like use some dark rituals, or build some great artifacts and such. you just send a bunch of orcs, which seems like all-round perfect soliders, and just walk over it. ta-da. how frustrating.but this game genre -being evil god like something and managing ♥♥♥♥♥- suffers from old chronic depression that caused by very low birth rate of the game. you don't have much of choices. so, go on.oh, If you finding other successors of Dungeon Keeper, go check 'War for the Overworld' too.

												If you enjoy dungeon keeper games then I would suggest this. Its not a god-send or anything, and with a 30 buck tag, it's overpriced. Get on sale, and it'll have worth. It has a nice gameplay but its the same enemys over and over till you move on to the next lvl, then its where you fight the same enemys over and over, till you go on to the next area or kill the main boss. It has a very clumsy look that I find funny and soothing for some reason. Minion control in dungeon is ok. You in most cases just drop your troops on top of enemys, which'll lead to them falling into a pile and scrambling to get up.			"

												Great game but just not enough content. I'm an old school Dungeon Keeper fan and this game comes the closest but not close enough. There are not enough creatures or rooms (or things to do yourself) and the fact you have to pay for DLC that's so short it should just be a free update...This could be amazing game, it just needs a lower price tag and way more content.If you're looking for a DK style game, this is it.

												At first I though the game seemed funny and it does have some great ideas. Compared to other dungeon-builder games, I particularly liked that you bring your forces to the surface and wreck havock.However, the game is very monotomous, the missions are short and the challenges are not really that creative.Furthermore, the game includes a lot semi-not-funny jokes from the narrator, which was funny at first but you tire from it after a few minutes. And they are there CONSTANTLY - every mission title is a pun and the narrator comments on everything you do and don't do. You are not allowed to take your time building your dungeon without the anrrator commenting on it in a really annoying way.So all in all - at first glance, the game brings some great new elements to the genre, but those element are not enough to make up for an otherwise throughoutly annoying game.

												Feels like it hasn't been revised much. They had some ideas and threw them in there and didn't bother much about consistency. This game is narrated with some amount of parody on game design. In that part similar to The Stanley Parable, though not as thought through. I really liked the narrator but I bet some would feel it's too much of humorous remarks. Think there was some dark humor. Game controls are unusual. Creature context makes a difference. The controls are different in overworld and underworld. I liked the concept of overworld and underworld but it was a bit annoying at times along the learning curve. Difficult to give the creatures precise orders in combat but campaign missions are easy enough to beat anyway. I focused on proper dungeon management and then the conquering went by itself.			"

												One hell of a fun game. I enjoyed every moment of this game as even though it is more simplistic than Dungeon Keeper 2, the mechanics work well and with two seporate campaigns it's quite interesting, but the annoying this is that there aren't that many. There are still MANY hours you can replay the missions. I felt it was a little short, however it was still very enjoyable with the same narrator from the Stanley Parable doing his thing and the many different comical references like the ""Bloody Wedding"" mission with so much Game of Thrones references as well as several other moments, including the Narrator making fun of the heroes dying, you when you fail a mission and even himself at times.I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's a Dungeon Keeper 2 as they do some new things, but it's a lot more fun. Sadly you can't capture heroes to toture or turn to your side or use their bodies to create new units like vampires, but it's a awful lot of fun.One of the major issues is that unlike DK2 or War for the Overworld, the animations are very slow. Especially when digging without upgrades (though you can speed them up with a slap. However, unlike the aformentioned games, you don't have to claim squares to start building and can do so immediately. You can also buy the production items to place into the room so they need to be larger for more items so it doesn't matter what shape the room is, as long as it's big enough for the items in question.

												I expected a Dungeon Keeper clone and it pretty much is, but it is done well enough and has a few key differences in the game mechanics.  There are a lot of LOTR and GOT jokes in there as well.  My only problem with it is that the difficulty never picks up and there are no difficulty modes, so overall i'd say the game is a bit on the easy casual end and could overall be a bit more challenging.  The DLC campaigns are more challenging, but the base game is never going to make you restart a level with a different strategy.			"

												I bought this game on a steam sale.  I saw reviews speaking of its patch problems. Well the gameplay was exellent and narration was really good, but it has sever gameplay speed. In that i mean the game is increadibly slow. It is alright to have a population limit but this game took it way way way to far. In that the game takes to long to mine out resources and tunnels and minions to explore and conquour the above world. I really liked this game it was a good sequal to dungeon keeper. But those main two draw backs make it unplayable as well as the poor nonexistence AI. Maybe in the future they will make this game more challengeing but at its state a 6 year old can beat it and fall asleep to its mind numbling digging due to lack of population.

												This brings back all memories from Dungeon Keeper II, even though it's a light version of it. It works fine, a bit of humour, a bit of strategy (the campaign is very easy though). Graphics are not what we're looking for in this game but they work fine.If it's on sale, you can go for it.			"

												This is a pretty fun game! I really like the dual game types (build your dungeon, and fight the ""bad"" guys on the surface). I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys builders and/or RTS's. Regarding all of the negative reviews about the narrator talking too much; there is an option to make him quiet in the ""Game"" tab in the settings.			"

												The game is good but there are so many technical issues. The lag is worse when you reach max population cap and loading time is very slow. Sometimes it crashes. The snots cracking up walls will momentarily make my game lag maybe because of the change in the surface? I don't know. I cannot recommend this game until the issues are fixed. Period.			"

												If you have that old DK itch to scratch, then this game may give a few hours of enjoyment.The graphics are not bad, the UI is adequate, but the game is very simple (unless you like that).The most annoying UI feature is that you can't ""pan"" or ""rotate"" the camera; its always in a North oriented view. Now days RTS games pretty much must have a dynamic camera view.You also cannot possess your creatures, not a big deal, but it always had a charm to see your dungeon from first person perspective.Also the game is very very short, and once you finish it, you probably won't want to do a second playthrough for quite some time.Lastly, many, many people who buy this are unable to finish the game at all. There is a game breaking bug where levels will not load and the game simply hangs. As of this date 8/18/2015 there is no fix. The programers have passed the buck stating ""It's a problem with the unity engine, and we have asked them to fix it"". No other unity games have this issue, so I'm calling BS on that one.Bottom line, you may get a few hours of fun, but due to the game being broken for many; buy with caution as you may not be able to finish the game.

												Definetely a good game, but needs a bit of work in campaign mode. There should be an ""easy"" mode. Very early on, they were throwing alliance at my base on a ticking basis, while I'm trying to complete the mission objectives AND learn the game. I only have 5 orcs.The narrator nagging at me to complete something is fun at first. However, when you're already frustrated, trying to figure out how to kill the darn fairy, defending your dungeon with what little you have, wasting time, watching your gold drain away each payday...It gets annoying. Took a while, but i realized the assassin insta-kills while invisible. There is help bubbles, they don't paint the whole picture.They expect to throw a game mechanic at you, and have you master it instantly before being able to complete a mission objective. Overall, worth $20 I paid while it was on sale. Not $40+ as is currently.			"

												This in my opinion is the closest to Dungeon Keeper yet. The battles take long enough (unlike in WFTO) for you to actually use strategy like spells, grab creatures before they die, etc. The creatures have an upgrades system that actually works quite well. Not entirely sure if I like the access to the overworld yet but the dungeon building half of this game is pretty good. My only annoyance with this game is that it's zoomed in too close without the ability to pan out. It would also be quite nice to have a full screen map of your own dungeon as well (like in dungeon keeper 1&2).This is far better and nothing like Dungeons 1. This one is actually worth playing if you're a dungeon keeper fan.			"

Not only that but you get to take your army to destroy the heroes were they live. The art style is a mix of WOW and older fantasy. I love the humor as well and the narrotor is quite funny too.

												TL;DR - good campaign, frustrating skirmish mode, no mod support.the good:   if you like dk2 you will enjoy this.  3 (with expansion) races with different play styles and dungeons.  interesting hybrid gameplay.  dungeon-building and also RTS-style overworld.  campaign is great.  humorous narration and storyline.  I was wondering why this only had an average score of 7 but not anymore. After the campaign dries up the skirmish mode that is left is really lackluster.  So lackluster that it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth and after another failed attempt made me salty enough to write this review.you expect a sandbox-like mode that lets you tinker around and build a dungeon but unfortunately you never get the chance to build with the overzealous waves of ever-hardening enemies that plague your dungeon every 5 minutes.  Ive played 6 skirmishes now and havent made it 45 minutes on normal difficulty (the lowest) after having zero problems with the campaign.  There is no way to lower difficulty further or to decrease wave spawns (in fact some skirmish maps start spawning from 2 bases if you eliminate one to try to give yourself some breathing room.)  Unfortunately again, there is no steam workshop for this so no user-created tweaks and google searches havent provided any mods or tweaks for the game either.  Im a casual gamer.  I dont play to get stressed out or feel rushed or anything like that and I wish there were a lower difficulty for people like me that just want to blow some time and build a dungeon.  campaign mode is a good 8.5/10, Ill probably end up buying the campaign expansion if I ever see it around 5 bucks.  the skirmish mode (which would provide many more hours of entertainment than the campaign if done right) is a soft 5/10.   The fact that it doesnt have workshop or modding support is dumb as well and I wont recommend a game that doesnt encourage user content.			"

												I started playing Dungeons 2 then stopped after a few missions, it just wasn't gripping me.  I also always felt rushed, you also always have this feeling that you're about to run out of gold by next pay day and scramble to keep unearthing more gold veins.I then decided to give it another go this weekend, continuing the campaign where I left off and the game has managed to open up a bit more but now I'm feeling not only rushed, but also overwhelmed.  I constantly need to be doing stuff above ground as well as needing to defend underground, I have to keep the gold flowing which has it's own risks of unearthing spiders and the like.I have yet to actually build an arena on any map and now I also have a forge to build.  I don't get enough gold / time to research all upgrades in any of the places (tinkerer, forge, mana place) and even if I had been able to build an arena, I'd never be able to use it because my forces are either busy fighting above ground or defending underground.It's just rush rush rush from the minute the map starts.  I keep getting this feeling I'm missing the ""cookie cutter recipe"" of how you're supposed to approach every map.  Almost like DOTA, start map, press this key combination to buy these things and get to that specific lane ASAP.  There's just very little ""fun"" factor and I'm not getting any actual time to ""explore"" the game.  I've started redoing each map after playing it for 5-10 minutes just so I can get a little ""exploration"" into the game mechanics.  It feels much like diving into an FPS that has you fighting aliens non stop from the second it loads till it's finished.  You don't actually get to try out the cover system or the vault system because you're constantly overwhelmed and the second you're done killing everything the mission abruptly ends with no option to continue playing in order to explore the mechanics.I felt much the same way about Dungeons 1, never finished it.  Still, it has that nostalgic feeling that reminds me of many happy hours playing DK2 as a kid which is why I'm trying so hard to like it.TLDR; Definitely has potential, get it on sale and even if you don't end up finishing it, you should get your money's worth.  Will be buying War for the Overworld in the hope that it'll be the one that will scratch the itch.			"

												This game could've been something good. The ""campaign"" is a long ♥♥♥ tutorial that ends when the cheesy story ends. The graphics and dialouge cannot decide if it wants to be campy, funny, dark, or terrible for the sake of being terrible. It is for sure immersion breaking. When you accomplish a task it doesn't feel like you did because the narrator has berated you to finish it and the rewards you get are more tutorials.Besides the campaign being god awful, the dungeon management is terrible. Digging is the only thing that can be done with ease. Managing you minion pool requires picking them up and dragging them around with the bulky ""cursor"". The 45th time you accidentally grab a barrel of beer instead of a minion or click on a room you'll curse so loud your neighbor will pound on the wall. There is no list of your minions and everything about managing them is clumsy. Picking them up  or giving them books, to upgrade them, is enraging as they hustle about. There is no pause function to easily grab anything or to take a closer look at any dangers.The 3 traps make for a terrible tower defense aspect of the dungeon management genre. The rooms allow you to stockpile whatever you want with ease and with no challenge. Upgrading random aspects of your minions is of no consequence and unlocking useless spell after spell is pointless as (that work only half the time and only in specific places btw) you have to cast them with the clumsy cursor. It doesn't require any strategy here, you can complete any mission by ammassing gold and mana and sending a horde of minions to roll over everything. Make a couple trap rooms filled with explosive treasure chests and you're safe as well!This brings us to the overworld where it turns into a terrible RTS game instead of a dungeon management game. There is no way to select your minions by type or any other way than a click and drag box group or by singularly clicking them, making their skills useless as trying to click them (with the clumsy cursor) in the heat of battle is more trouble than it's worth. Send a bunch of minions up by taking 5 minutes to grab and drag them to the exit (which is a fun and engaging game mechanic), selecting them all and sending them on their way to pummel everything in sight is how this part works.There is no reason for this game to cost 40$, if the publisher says anything about how they'll handle this game there will be many tiny DLC released with single units or missions that might flesh it out but I won't pay a single more red cent for this abomination.How this got good reviews anywhere was either by pay offs or them not paying any attention to what they were playing. Do not get this game, it is the kind of game you'd get in a bundle, not something worth this price tag.			"

												As fun as this game could be with some more polish and as entertaining as the commentary can be, this game is poorly optimized and the controls are frustrating. I often get single digit or teen FPS with very low population on screen. Moving your creatures is extremely tedious inside your homeland but tolerable outside of it which is a complete reversal of what I expect. In spite of the occasionally witty commentary, this game advertises at you from time to time as well. In many missions, the commentator actively yells at you and tells you how to play. The potential of this game of being solidly good is so obvious as to make it even more frustrating for why it's not.			"

I liked the old dungeon keeper-like gameplay, such as building rooms, making traps and looking after minions. However, there are a lot of problems with the game, chief among which are the bugs- this game CTD's like no other I've played. Every ten minutes or so in the campaign, it would crash, to the point where I almost gave up altogether.There are more problems. The campaign itself is too short, the time taken to mine  anything	 is tedious to the point of ridiculousness, you only get 5 types of minions per faction (which admittedly can be specialised into 2 further types, but I would have liked more), and the overworld RTS is basic and awkward to get through. The most annoying part of this game, however, is the humour- dated, obnoxious, groanworthy, and all personified in the intrusive and completely irritating commentator.There are some nice ideas, but they do seem ill-thought out and underdeveloped. I wouldn't recommend buying this game full-price. Wait for a sale or a bundle offer, or better yet play Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2, both of which have better gameplay and atmosphere.			"

												Dig a dungeon. Hire minions. Upgrade your dungeon and units and conquer the overworld. The mechanics and atmosphere are great. I love the concept and the game play itself is pretty fun.However, the game's performance is abhorrent. It needs serious optimization attention. Normally I get a new game, put it on max settings, and get somewhere between 30 and 60 FPS. Sometimes I have to tweak a few settings to get 60 FPS consistently. In this game I get 8-10 FPS on the lowest settings. It's terrible.Since the game involves quite a bit of micromanagement to upgrade your units, defend your dungeon, etc., poor performance is super crippling and tedious. Also, there's a ton of input lag and the cursor is very unresponsive and hard to use. Unfortunately these flaws make the game as a whole not fun to play. I think the devs are aware of the performance problem and I hope it gets fixed, but I can't recommend buying this until these issues are resolved.			"

												Fun-ish .. but not worth 40.00 at all.     This game should be 20.00 At most.Their is not enough tech / units.  They should not of made 2 factions ... it should of been 1 that is flushed out.   It is fun at first but their is not much to do in it .. it will have no replay due to the lack of ways too play it ...Have to give it a no for this price of 40.00			"

												The spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper . . . or it tries to be.On the good side, the game is a dungeon manager.  The theme and graphics are what you'd expect.  Unfortunately, that's where my good experience stops.So many issues . . .First off, I was able to beat the entire campaign in 25 hours, and that was with a lot of dithering around and trying to figure out some elements of the interface.  I would not be at all surprised if folks finished up in 12 hours.  For a game like this, I certainly expect a lot more than 20 hours of gameplay in the campaign.The interface.  Don't get me wrong, the interface itself is fairly easy to come to grips with, but mechanically, the interface doesn't do a good job at all of communicating what it is happening.  For instance, your minions can get upset with you and go on strike . . . ok, fine, it's not a new mechanic in this genre.  But . . . why are they on strike?  I can't click on them, they just stand there.  Just one example.  Upgrading units is another real trial.The challenge level is the worst offender however.  The game is just dead easy.  I remember having to really rush to keep up in Dungeon Keeper.  I always felt like I was just on the verge on falling behind and being run over.  Not an issue here.  Take all the time you like, and when you feel like the entire deck is stacked in your favor, attack.  Attack falls apart?  No problem.  Just revive your troops and try again.There are so many problems with this game, a game I really, really, really want to like.  The game has the appearance on the surface of being exactly what folks would want in a game like this.  It just doesn't deliver.  Had I spent $5.00 on it, yea, ok, I'd be like, cool.  Wait for the sale, pick it up, and enjoy it at the price it really needs to be.			"

												I bought this game a while ago, presuming it was a sequel the the previous Kalypso game called ""Dungeons"". I don't think that it's too far of a stretch to imagine that it'd be somewhat the same?Afraid not. Very different mechanics, very different direction (though the art style stayed somewhat the same).The humour is good, but I bought this at full price (£30 here in the UK) and it's not funny enough to warrant that price.I returned it. I'm sure it's a good game to some people, but if you're hoping for more ""Dungeons"", ""Dungeons II"" is not the game to buy.			"

			Views: 47		

			You can get the game here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/262280 A non-biased quick look @ 'Dungeons 2' - The Dungeon Lord is back – and this time he’s serious!		

The Dungeon Lord is back – and this time he’s serious! In Dungeons 2, fulfil the Dungeon Lord’s insatiable quest for vengeance by recruiting fearsome new monsters from all corners of the underworld in order to undertake his evil bidding. Taking over the underworld isn’t enough though – this time The Dungeon Lord will extend his dominion over the puny humans and attempt to conquer the overworld too! Take control of the mighty Dungeon Lord and craft a network of unique and terrifying dungeons, recruit an army of fearsome creatures and command two new factions. Prepare to defend your Kingdom against those pesky heroes, go above ground to wage war on their human cities and use the ‘Hand of Terror’ to take direct control over your minions, issue commands, and even dish out a swift slap to keep them in line. The extensive campaign story mode is packed with even more of the dark humour which made the original Dungeons a hit and is peppered with numerous references to various fantasy books, movies and TV shows.  - Highly Recommended!

												I was expecting a game as similar to and as good as or better than Dungeon Keeper Gold.  Long story short: i didn't get it.  The similarity was there but the fun and gameplay wasn't.The game looks good, has some good mechanics and has obviously had a lot of effort into polishing it to look really nice but really failed to grab me and i got bored an hour in. Maybe i just have higher expectations as i absolutely loved DKG but I think my boredom was mainly due to it being really slow and based off the few missions i played far to easy.  "

												TLDR, There is little freedom in this game, and few choices.Little freedom is mostly due to the fact that the games are so short. You don't get to fine-tune or OCD anything; to guarantee success you pretty much have to plow through and use your momentum to obliterate your enemies. I was hoping for a little more of a management sim, and this feels like a pure RTS.Few choices refer to how linear the progression of each level is. The tech tree goes from the bottom to the top; you have neither the time nor the ability to customize your approach. It's similar with the layout of your dungeon; you pretty much have to dig out all the gold and make that space work somehow. I was hoping for an experience resembling tower defense, but again it feels like a pure RTS where you work with what you've got to complete the match quickly and efficiently, rather than careful planning and outlasting.On the positive side, the game is beautiful and fun, the way it works makes sense, it's polished and seemingly bug-free, everything that's said in the positive reviews is true.Unfortunately it isn't for me.

												The gameplay is basically Dungeon Keeper + Warcraft + Game of Thrones references, without capturing the strengths of any of those three franchises. Dungeons 2's story is attempting parody, but really just ends up refering to the source materials rather than building upon or lampooning them.There's a couple laughs to be had, so if you really like Dungeon Keeper style games and it's on sale, it's playable enough, otherwise I'd give it a pass.

												Boring.The game moves at a glacial pace. Then when you finally get EVERYTHING and are ready for a serious challenge it ends. Everything is superficial, the main unit mechanic is beer which you get just by building a brewery, no harvesting you just build it and bam there it goes. Overall the game is simple and boring, you can ""defend"" your dungeon with traps if you want but you'll do just as well picking up every unit and just setting them on the enemy.			"

												This is one of those games where its hard to give just a thumbs up or thumbs down. The game itself is enjoyable, but is it $40 enjoyable when there are at least 2 other games similar on Steam with more content and a cheaper price point that are just as fun.The price point is already steep, and now they are coming out with DLCs you have to pay for, and the DLCS include very basic things like new maps, and maybe a new enemy or two. $3.99 per DLC, on top of the $40 price tag of the original game? Seriously? The primary game lacks so much that I could understand if it was $15, but $40....way overpriced and lack of content.Enjoyable game although the narrator gets annoying after awhile as you start hearing him repeat the same things over and over. The game itself is a bit easy, but can be challenging at times as waves of mobs come in from 3 different directions. They have traps to help defeat the waves of enemies, and unfortunately from a players persepctive the traps most of the time if setup properly will defeat any wave that comes in after you. This without even having to upgrade the traps to level 2 or 3, just another point on why this game is a little to easy. 15.7 Hours on record and I basically beat the game, most of that time I was dragging it out by seeing I could mine every mineable rock, etc. The game just seems to be lacking that few extra little things to make it go from an ok fun game to a great fantastic game. I don't know if its more characters needed, more depth of what you can do, less hand holding or what...but its missing something.I'd recommend getting this game when its on sale. The $40 tag is a bit much especially since they are wanting you to purchase DLCs for a primary game that lacks more than 10 hours of content already.			"

												First of all, i bought it on pre-order and i had not even played to it and though it was good.I did not like because of the following reasons : Short campaign, really there is like 9 missions with no replayabilityGameplay is mostly about farming enough cash to send your troops to mass attack and in the meantime build as much trap as you can to ""defend"" your base heart, all they do is sending waves of enemies that are mostly always the same and always take the same path no matter whats in itNarator: It was cool for the first 10 minutes, now it's annoying, please stop before i simply mute all the sound. He mostly tells you you have to do this and that at every 30 seconds and say things such as : insert funny line, Amateur! i'm used to work with professionalit's so repetetive that whatever the map is, it's only about farming gold and training troops to mass attack with a bunch of unit.In shorter words, a total dissapointment since i liked the first one, but this, just no.

												As a newcommer to the series, i enoyed the game a lot, the narrator made the game more fun as he was very funny.Basically the goal of the game is to build your evil army horde in the underground and create a big and powerful dungeon capable of creating stronger and bigger armies/horde to attack the goody Alliance.Game does have some drawbacks , like not much to build upon and unit variety. Its basically just wasting hours every mission building the same base over and over again. Thats not a huge problem as you can change up a bit, the problem is there isnt much to build! just a few rooms. Unlike from what i have heard in the previous series where there was a lot.Long story short, game is fun and worth your while, also if you watch Game Of Thrones then you will love this game even more as its somewhat of a parody to the TV Show :)     7/10			"

												Dungeons 2 has two problems. These are common among games about Absolute Evil:1. Dungeon Keeper. If it didn`t exist, Dungeons 2 would be a unique game.2. Disneyland. If funny and toony games about Evil were not so widely spread across industry, this would be very humorous game.If you didnt play Overlord, Dungeon Keeper, Evil Genius, Black and White, then I recommend this game to you. But If you `ve seen life, then Dungeons 2 does not worth your time.Yes, and the controls are buggy.			"

												This game has a lot of potential because dungeon building is fun, but ultimately most of it is wasted. The so-called humour in this game had me fed up around the third campaign mission, and a little after even the narrator was acknowledging how repetitive the gameplay is. Basically, every mission is build some orcs -> smash them into the enemy to do some damage -> retreat to the dungeon to heal, then repeat until the mission objective is done. Give how slow it starts and how grindy it remains all the way through, there is no real reason to buy this game.			"

												For some reason... every dungeon management game EVER has been cutsey, cartoony, comical.WHY???What the ♥♥♥♥ are they thinking?  Does that improve the game somehow?  Is it covering up untalented graphic design, or is it appealing to a wide audience?I don't know, but it RUINS IT.  I'm trying to be an evil dungeon master and the narrator is telling fart jokes n ♥♥♥♥.  Making fun of the whole fantasy paradigm.  The orcs are prancing around like fruit cakes.like, really???   Is there one dungeon game out there that takes it seriously, like DnD seriously?Warhammer or Total War kind of SERIOUSLY!?You can build a torture room for ♥♥♥♥ sakes!  This isn't elementary school material.  Get it through your head.I go to massacre the surface world of men, and the narrator is babbling about fluffy rabbits and other bad cliche jokes about being evil.  Good for you.  ♥♥♥♥ youself.The graphics remind me of when Warcraft 3 first came out.  Uhh.. wtf is this?  So cartoony.And, ya the lag.  Omg the lag.  Make it stop.  The screen tearing, the jittery graphics.  It's not me Even the PROMOTIONAL VIDEO for this game lags.  Go watch it.  What a joke.  I don't mean on Steam, I mean it was RECORDED lagging.  And published like that anyway.  Talk about a technical nightmare.The gameplay is so meh.  There is nothing new from previous titles.  Throw creatures around, slap them, dig out rooms, plant rooms, make military guys.  Would it kill you to make something interesting?Not to mention it doesn't seem balanced.  For some reason I'm always waiting for something that is taking way too long to do.  Simple tasks take all freakin day.  The developer doesn't give a fuuuuckk.  And it shows.  I got it on sale and it's still a waste of money.Don't do it.  Save yourself.  Play Dungeon Keeper of Overlord or something.  They are much less disappointing. "

												Annoying popup at the start where you have to press ""skip"" every time, then ""play game"", after you've already launched the game from steam.Hand holding tutorial in place of campaign, works off of triggers (you can't really skip ahead, invulnerable monsters etc).Terrible narrator dialog ""the goody goody town of goody goodyness"". Show don't tell.Compared to Dungeon Keeper:Less things, more upgrades.Less organic dungeon, more RTS.All the things are there. The ""minions"". Slapping them. Digging out a dungeon. Placing rooms. But it all feels a lot more constricted, and pressured. You can't evolve an evil empire. You have to rush build orcs to fight constant incoming waves that just waltz in from the get-go in every single map.The one good thing that they have done, is the ability to place back corridors (an issue in the original DK if you just mined out too much, and couldn't make rooms properly. Making it more possible to make an obstacle course for incoming enemies.Not sure how effective vs players they are, but you can just lightning/fire the halflings of the party, and let the other monsters kill themselves on traps, which is handy if you want to be out adventuring all the time.Speaking of which, there don't seem to be any down sides to always having your monsters outside - they don't rebel, or get angry/tired. Payday seems to instantly drop gold on them.The overworld changing appearance is really nice - but it is possible to get your creatures stuck behind scenery. And then there's no way to kill them, meaning that they've just permanently eaten those population slots.This game doesn't have a useful wiki that I can find either. I had to use trial-and-error to figure out which upgrades did what, and how to get better monster tiers.(Note: reviewed after game crashed half way through a campaign map and no save. grr.)After all that, I've managed to finish the token campaign, and get most of the achievements (the mana one being a little absurd)To find that the game doesn't really have a functioning multiplayer.There are 6 maps, and no way to search for games online. Or AI.You either have friends that play this, or it's a very short game indeed.As for whether it's even balanced for multiplayer, I can't really tell.It looks like they wanted to put even more races in to it, but just never got the chance, before they ran out of budget.The whole game feels a bit like that really.At £2.50, this game would be worth it. At £25.00, not snowflake's chance in hell.			"

												You know the number one complaint about this game is that its not long enough to be worth 43 dollars. I mean seriously thats the number one complaint that the game is not worth the money they are asking for because the game is to short. You would think if the developers cared about their fans they would do something to remedy that (perhaps free dlc or something). Cause i can spend 27 dollars on Ark or 27 on space engineers and those have 100s of hours worth of content. I am asking the developers why do you think it was justifiable to charge people 43 dollars for your game? Why arent you listening to your number one complaint? I mean seriously this game is good but not worth that amount of money and must reasonable complaints are centered around that. This is the kind of thing that will screw thier company over in the long run cause people are going to remember that you charge alot of money for your games when its clearly not worth that much.

												The game mechanics are not that bad although they are a bit tedious since you have to pick your defenders up literally and move them around by HAND. Granted eventually you figure out how to grab multiple enemies at once but something so critical is not taught in the tutorial.The constant nagging if you want to play at a slower pace is also very annoying. The constant gold drain with limited income turns this game into a time sensitive game that forces you to micro manage a lot. Some will like that and some wont. I don't. This would be a far more fun game if they let you take your time with it and enjoy building your dungeon up more. Instead it is constantly nagging you to hurry up and finish the objective.regardless of all that I would give it a thumbs up EXCEPT that the game constantly crashes to the point it should not even be allowed to be sold until they fix it because the constant crashes make it unplayable. No game is fun if you can play it ...			"

												What an absolutely dumb game and an horrible homage to Dungeon Keeper. Put it simply this is Dungeon Keeper for dummies. The makers basically removed everything that would make this a Rate-R game and replaced it by prepubescent humor to keep their PG-13 rating. The narrator is as annoying as a preschool teacher. His daddy jokes and incessant picking is a big minus.Aside from the presentation, there are many game issues. First the units are as dumb as a bag of hammers. You can't have units that exclusively mine or produce beer in Dungeons 2, if you place a number of traps or doors they all drop their tools and all rush to place them. There is no control whatsoever on what they do other than not lining up the tasks for them. Slapping units is completely useless and just another tasteless prop as it yields no reaction. That would just be bad for the game's rating.Speaking of props, I could have played this without the most annoying hand cursor I've ever seen in a game. It's impossible to grab or drop anything with precision with it. It's a shiny bath toy. Second, you can't actually rotate the camera in Dungeons 2!!! Guess that wasn't a good feature enough for them to concentrate on.They had to focus on an absolutely corny campaign which is lifted straight from World of Warcraft down to the race's names and present it as if it was any original. It is not. A few hours into this game and I already feel like I've wasted enough by brain cells.One positive, they mashed the RTS genre with the game decently, however crowd control is nearly impossible. You'll never handle more than ~4 units at the same time. It's a challenge to  have a healer heal the unit closest to death. No worries however, the game will never allow you to have much more units than that. Max population seems to be fixed to avoid further technical failures. Once more all units are as dumb as they could be and this game is one of the dumbest I have in my library.			"

												Dungeon Keeper is a simple concept. Give us lots of creatures and room types, give us a huge dungeon to build out and customize until our evil hearts are content. Give us interesting enemies to strategically invade and battle. It is literally that simple. I enjoyed the dungeon creation parts, and hated all the overworld parts. Not enough dungeon creation content or freedom. More room types, spells and creatures are badly needed, more options to be creative. Less overworld parts, not fun.			"

And be the way, don't try to post the official support forum about the issues if you don't want be trolled by some people, quite disapointed to see the lack of moderation on a support forum. Interseting to see the dev give more support to someone who can run GTAV on his rig but using a cracked Dungeons 2 game instead of a legit customer.

												I'll start by saying that the whole triple six thing put me off right away. I'm not sure if people think it's clever or funny, but it's lame, and I'm getting really sick of it.DK 1 & 2 were fast paced games. This game is so slow that it's annoying. This is usually the result of lazy dev's trying to increase play-time.The voice actors sound bored, like they're reading from a script.The controls are lethargic and unresponsive.I'm getting bored with the whole bad-guy hero routine.This game falls every bit as short as keeper did, the first attempt at a DK clone.

												It's a shame really... When I first saw a trailer of Dungeons 2 I thought ""Oh, this could be good!"" It seemed like Orcs Must Die, with it's dungeon defense, trap building, and mildly entertaining meta-dialogue, but with an RTS aspect as well. As an idea it had a lot of potential but I feel that the developers missed the mark in almost every way. The disconnection between dungeon and the overworld, the control scheme and not being sure where the evil hand is pointing, the confusing and badly designed minion organization in dungeon, with underwhelming overworld combat in comparison, and the limited variety of minions and rooms took a lot out of the game for me. It's been months since it was released and they've had a few updates which have only helped a little. In all, Dungeons 2 was a real dissapointment to me and it doesn't seem to be getting any better any time soon.			"

												A direct copy of Dungeon Keeper -- no originality at all.  You would think that this team would have at least applied some of the interface design improvements that have been learned in the years since DK, but they haven't.  The interface is lousy with many aspects of construction and skills not explained.  The Kalypso publisher still insists on asking for your email address every single time before playing the game -- so annoying.  Each time I start the game on my multi-monitor system the game chooses to use a different monitor, resolution, and full-screen or windowed.  However, despite all the negatives, the Dungeon Keeper formula is still entertaining here and the narrated campaign provides an occassional chuckle.  Nevertheless, Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2 are better in just about every way.  I'd recommend downloading some DK map mods and play that instead of buying this.			"

												TlDR; It's nothing like Dungeon Keeper and falls off in far too many areas. Not worth over 5$.Alright to start off I have played Dungeons 1 and the special steam eddition one. I should have known after the special edition that it would not be a good game but I tried to believein Kalypso. Yeah that didn't work too well. So let's talk graphics. They are pretty decent. The landscape changes as you take certain areas in the overworld and that can seem cool for most people. However, if you do not have a good computer it will be terribly laggy when things like this happen.Minions. The minions are.. alright? I can't find the exact words to use to describe them. They need more diversity. In the original Dungeon they had quite a few interesting minions that actually had decent consepts that simply needed to be refined and expanded. There is an enchantment system where you can give a buff to your minions but the buff tends to rarely be worth anything. Even if it is worth a little something there is no heavy effect on gameplay that would make you want to search for them.Concept. The concept of sending your minons to the surface is an interesting idea but VERY poorly executed. The positioning of the characters is terrible. There is very little you can do to organize your minions and organize them for battle. You are more or less throwing them at the enemies hoping for the best. Comparison. We can compare this to a lot of Dungeon Keeper similar games but let's compare it to the ones that stand out the most. The Original Dungeon. This was what got me so into the game series. Retaking your throne from your crazy girlfriend and having tons of challenges and boss fights up to that point? It was quite a few hours of fun and while the replay value wasn't much it had a lot that could be polished. It got me looking forward to the sequals. Dungeons 2 is nothing like Dungeons. It feels more aimed at children with its very cartoonish feel. It is less dark than Dungeons 1. The Overlord or main character from Dungeons 1 is.. well gone. It may have something to do with the steam special which admitibly I didn't finish because it made me cringe with all its Lord of the Rings references and terrible gameplay. However, it is just not the sequal you'd expect at all. It feels like a new choppy game.Dungeon Keeper. The god of dungeon games. A lot of people think most games can't hold a damned candle to it and they would be right in my opinion but you have to give other games a chance. The style for most of these games was obviously taken from this then pardon my language but it is as though someone took a big steaming ♥♥♥♥ on it. I have yet to see a decent revamped version of it and Dungeons 2 is no acception. But I'm rambling! Overall, the point of this is that the gameplay is not even close to worth 10$ on sale MUCH LESS 40$. You'd have to have very poor taste to enjoy this game.			"

												Great for 6 year olds, great for 60 year olds.It's basically Warcraft 3 + the old Dungeon Keeper games mashed together. Underground, you have your base where you find and mine gold/mana, make upgrades, hire units, that sort of thing. Up above, it's an RTS. The game devs have a good sense of humour. The narrator often makes meta jokes. A lot of the  the ""I'm not even trying but I'm still kinda funny"" kinda funny. The ""break the fourth wall with cheesy and often pointless quips for the sake of it"" kinda funny. It's good.Wouldn't pay the £25 for it though, seems a bit steep but if you have the money why not. I'd wait til it was £15 tops... £13 seems about fair. I'm a tightwad though, so. "

												Alright so I'll just list the important things that I think matters the most to help decide to buy or not, and couldnt find it among any reviews.+You have 2 semi different factions.+Each faction has 4 unit types, and 3 varients of each type. Tier I-II-III. I was happy to see that its not just a stat boost and each upgrade makes a different unit. For example, the horde has the naga unit. At tier I its an archer, at tier II its a healer, and at tier III it has a stunning magic attack. Worth noting that if you upgrade a tier II naga to a tier III one, it will loses its healing role. So over all, both factions has 12 units total + imps+Just as many hero types for the enemy+Unit cap is pretty good over all so you dont have to be afraid of not be able to have enough monsters.+Your units can have titles to get different stat boosts+big enough maps+units lvl up+good graphics-no random map generator-no dark hero unit like the horned demon was in DK2-game on normal is really easy-only 2 factions. No undead.... (Horde,Demons)-very few map selection in the vanilla version-traps are very basic and totally uselessHope this helped.			"

												Awesome game which I preordered paying full (crazy) price! Game is really good, review is negative. Had stutter issues since release, not been able to enjoy the game. Kept buying DLC's and installing patches with high hopes, game still doesn't run correctly for me. Gtx 970, i7 4970, 16gb ram, I run ultra battlefield 1 or whatever new game you say at ultra or semiultra, 1080p.War for the overworld, which isi similar and I also own, has best performance, but I don't like it as much as this one. And that one has no negative review at all, but this one does.I gone through official support since release, lots of tickets, attempts to ""fix"" stuff on my end, etc. Not even with a different high end computer I had that problem. I was suspicious it was a problem with their unity engine, but no, it's game's problem.I had a few fps problems with Vermintide on launch, which afaik uses another not mainstream engine (autodesk Maya / Stringray) and through patches and some workarounds, performance was solved, with a game much more graphic intensive. Comparisons are always hateful, but it's a way to show the problem this game has.Negative review comes now even if I preordered years ago, why? Cause after many patches and DLC's, I tried to give this game another go! And hell it was still very enjoyable and interesting to me....but the stutter while playing, scrolling though the dungeon etc, despite less noticeable, was still there.So of course, negative review, spent idk, a total of 60-70€ in this game with all dlcs? And I cant still enjoy it having thr worse performance from most of my game's library. Also owned previous dungeons game with all dlc's, so I am not exactly a hater, haha. Nice game, you can enjoy it, or blow your mind thinking why the hell the game doesn't run as good as you would, and have to decide to keep playing with bad performance...Update: Gave thumbs up to this game after playing it again, with good / decent performance.

												Score: 8.5This is a preliminary review as I only have played for ashort time. But given that it is now on sale I might as well get my first thoughts out as I disagree with some of the negative ratings received by the game.This is a *little* and *charming* game. From what I have seen so far, worth the $20 I payed for it. I never played Dungeon Keeper so I don't have that point of reference but I played the Majesty 2 game so I felt right at home with setting tasks to the units rather than directly teling them what to do (as you would in a game like Starcraft). Here you point to a location and indicate you want to mine its gold and the game engine will assign workers to mine the gold. If you want units to fight a monster you pick them up and drop them near the monster. Once they recover from the fall they will attack nearby enemies. So the units are sort of autonomous and you have indirect control. You concentrate on improving your economy, hire units, discover locations (by sending workers to mine rocks), place traps, drop units near enemies. The game holds your hand by having a narrator telling what to do. It is not particularly funny but I don't think it is intended to be funny. It is intended to hammer the message set when you see the intro movie: the game doesn't take itself too seriously. You will not be pulling your hair trying to figure out what to do next here. The narrator tells you. I like that sort of game.Would the game be worth $40? I do not know. When I finish the campaing and when/if I get around to update the review, I will tell you. For now I can say that  for $20 it is totally worth it.			"

												First things first, if you're looking for a game like the first one then skip this one. It's not exactly the same, it keeps the most basic premises and changes everything else. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, this is still a good game on its own. If you need a way to waste a few hours of your life you won't be disappointed. You still build a dungeon and fill it with monsters and gold, but this time you get to control your monsters, at the expense of not controlling your dungeon lord. You still get spells, though, so it's kinda like having a dungeon lord anyways. This makes it easier to allocate units across your dungeon where they are needed, like at your core when being attacked. The game also adds in the overworld, which gives you a chance to stretch your legs a bit and attack things with your minions. Balancing attacking targets with defending your dungeon gets a bit tricky at times but is easily managed. Overall, the game is worth playing. Once you let go of the need for it to be a carbon copy of the first, it's fun and balanced and that's what's important.			"

												What should I tell you about it?It is similar to Dungeon Keeper but not really the same.I liked Dungeons 2 without ever playing the first part.Who cares?Pros:+ The story teller is A+++ (even the german version is parfait)+ Look & Feel is great+ Story is ""good"" (especially the add-on with Mr.Snow)+ Nice characters+ Nice leveling systemCons:- Controls are sometimes unprecise (I never really know what the hand will grab)- Some Crashes- Annoying Bugs (especially the one where Mr.Snow has to collect the power from the stones - timer runs to 0.0 but game won't continue -> solution: let Mr.Snow die and repeat the process again && you are not allowed to make any actions with Mr.Snow while he is in this circle NOR you are allowed to select him -> remove him from any group and never touch him again)- Chaos fraction feels really crappy to play ... but maybe ... hm ... pretty sure ... I'm just too stupid to play them- no really long term motivation (you get only few rooms and few traps and reach the limits pretty fast)But who cares about these problems? For a low price ~15€ with all dlcs, this is a very good deal.C ya.			"

												I see a lot of negative reviews on here, and from what i'm reading people are either having the game crash or they say it's not fun. I've had the game crash once, but I was able to just relauch it and it was fine. You just have to let it load fully before you click anything.As for it not being fun, I disagree completely. The people who say it isn't fun don't like a slow-paced rts, which is what this is. You have to manage your resources, slowly build up your defences and army, and then go on the offensive. It will probably take a few offensive attacks to win the mission, but you'll get there. It's very chill and pretty laid back once you get the hang of it, and they have a funny narrator that says pretty funny references to other popular games and books of the same human vs orc theme.In the end, if you're looking for a slow-paced game that will take A LOT of time but is very enjoyable and relaxed with a funny joke here and there, this is a great game for you.Then only bad thing I'd have to say is without the DLC, there is a lack of content. I might have 13+ hours played, but that's just on a 8 or so mission campaign and i'm on the last mission. Although fun, it just shows how long the missions can take.			"

												The game can be fun i dont really care for the story i just play skimirish but the main complaint i have is you get attacked way to much or atleast me....I'll load up a game and get attacked with in the first 10mins and unless i just mass spawn people i cant defend well but that is just annoying it's any faction that i play like i watch tutorials some people dont get attacked forever but i swear for me it's every 5-10mins so the game can be extremely annoying but other than that it's a very fun game.

The Jist : Not worth full price (currently 39.99€) at all. I Bought it at 9.99€. Scathingly worth it. Relax and chill comedic game you can't lose. DON'T expect it to be anything like Dungeon Keeper.If you played Dungeon Keeper 2, this game will interest you because you really want Dungeon Keeper III.This isn't Dungeon Keeper III. Just remove all thought of that. It's Warcraft : Orcs and Humans, with 3D graphics and some rather forced elements of DKII. You're never at risk of losing. The enemy AI is just too dumb, and even the scripting is plain easy. Nothing interesting ever happens. At no point did I ever feel unsafe in my dungeon. So much so, that the only reason I ever saved is because the game crashes occasionally.  The overworld feels annoying, and the discontinuity between over and under world control of creatures is poor design. In the overworld it's classic RTS, underworld it switches to DK. The story is told by a narrator, and it's quite amusing and full of pop culture references. I actually laughed. Twice.Overall, the gameplay was not engaging enough, but it was engaging enough that I completed the campaign, and side missions. The story is amusing enough, and the voice actor did very well with the material he had. I definately feel I got my 9.99€ worth, and I don't feel like I wasted my time, but there's this burning feeling that they could have done so much MORE. I will probably buy Dungeons 3. When it's on sale. I think Kalypso did a good job. They likely just didn't have the budget to make this game great. They probably spent all their money in litigation with EA :pNote : This review does not take into account any DLC, and the experience was played without any of the DLC. "

												Now that i have played over 40 hours in the game andfinished the campaign  i feel that i can give an honoust review about this game.For starters...to all of those that are looking for dungeon keeper 2. Go buy dungeon keeper 2. This is not dungeon keeper 2 but this is a very fun game to play.So the pro's. The game is genuinly fun i had a blast playing it. Yes there is a campaign and the narrator willkeep informing you about that if you daddle around too long but you can take all the time you want to build up your dungeon and troops and place some defences if you desire so,I personally like the narrator's humor. The closer you get to the end the more insulting he gets.I also like the style of graphics, yes it is cartoonish but i like that style.There are however a few things that are a bit annoying at times.Mostly the loading times. It takes ages to start a new level.And maybe this was just me but in the later levels for some strange reason sometimes units just get stuck in one place while they are in the overworld. For some reason they do not understand that they can walk around a tree or a fox or whatever it is that is in theyre way but they just stand there and do nothing.Neither of these con's are so bad that they break the game in my opinion.In conclusion i give this game a big thumbs up and do hope that the guys and girls that worked on this game are planning to make another one cuz i really enjoyed myself it was a blast. So a big thank you to the developers of this game en keep up the good work. "

												Fun and colorful.  Basically a spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper 2.  Bascially, when you're in the dungeon it's DK2.  When you sned your troops to the overworld, it's a simple RTS.  The graphics are great and the mood is light with good humor in the campaign.      That said it is slower and more deliberate than your typical RTS (more relaxing).  I enjoy the pace, personally.

												Decent game and mostly fun when it's not crashing on me. It certainly wasn't review worthy until I got fed up with the crashes. I've also run into some significant pathfinding performance issues which forced me to restart with all new dungeon layouts. The game actually has a number of bugs and most of which is around the pathfinding.There is also constant narration throughout the game which tries to be funny and helpful but it gets triggered while you're already doing too many things at once so you miss important messages. The narration is so bloated with meaningless bad humor that it's hard to pay attention to at times. I really don't recommend this game unless you can handle a fair number of issues. Perhaps wait until a patch and a good 50% off sale.			"

												This game is hard to reccommend. I wish it had a 'netural' rating or a 'meh' rating. As it is I had more fun with this game than I had problems so I guess positivity works.You're evil. You're so evil you died and are now a ghost of your former self, using your hand to control the masses.You're evil, so this game lags a ton.You're evil, so you get cooldown timers so you can't sally forth an army at a reasonable speed.You're evil, so the AI that controls everything does a horrific job of doing things, and are about as aware of problems as a Stevie wonder with a drum set.The AI needs work. Theres too much going on so it lags a whole bunch. Making a dungon is fun; but its so easy to just make traps and laugh as invaders fall for it again and again. Its not even facing the correct way. But its so fun. Its so fun to watch the world go to hell as your army crosses it. its fun to kill the 'good guys'I just wish it ran better and I just wish the AI wasn't trash. This game plays best with a keyboard and mouse. 7/10			"

												ive enjoy this game. Similar to Dungeon Kedeper. The storyteller is very funny but i hope an expansion soon cause i miss some more missions. When the game starts to be interestint it finish. besides i miss jails like in DK. or a torture chamber to get information from the heroes. that things make this game not so good as it could be. If you are going to make a modern Dungeon Keeper  do it. Its funny but very easy and sometimes to slow. I would have done some thigs better but the ambient and the idea of make surface evil terrain as you conquer is very good. i would make bigger map outside. i insist it is too short. its a pity a good game could be a great game with just a little bit more. i would hope to the low prices time to buy it i would do it if i have known it. i wait until 15-20 € thats its price.  i hope this help s you and im sorry for my bad english.

												Overall I like the game. It is reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper. The few things I didn't like were the bards, which pretty much make traps pointless. Traps were only useful when there weren't bards involved which was rare.The DLC ""A Game of Winter"" is like hitting a brick wall after playing through everything else; it's more like threading the needle the developers created with the obvious scale up/invasion timers. By the last mission I lost interest in figuring it all out as it was just getting annoying. Otherwise it was a fun game.			"

												I personally like the base building part of RTS games the most.  This game squares the depth and fun of managing your base (traps, rooms, exploring underground, upgrading, etc), while still containing solid top-world RTS mechanics I've come to know.  It is very humorous, colorful, and detailed.  I just finished the main campaign, bought the expansion and will play it soon.If you like traps, building, exploring, upgrading, battles, magic, satire, etc... I highly recommend it!			"

												The only acceptable sequel to Dungeon Keeper! This game manages to keep the lovable Dk mechanics and still innovate, in the form of work units in rooms, manually upgradable units, exploration and conquest of the overworld and even multiple playable factions (2 in base game, 3 with game of winter DLC) Highly reccomended for all the Dungeon Keeper lovers!

It's a lot better than the first game, but there are still loads of problems with this:- There is no sandbox gameplay (Skirmish mode is not sandbox, the dungeon area and top world are not generated but presets, so once you've beaten a level, you'll always beat it)- The voice acting and writing for campaign mode falls flat.

												Pretty good game, the game doesn't really hold up to the standard of the classic DK but is still very enjoyable.+Good Campaign, both the Vanilla and DLC campaign had quite a couple missions which had good build-up, were well-constructed and alot of fun to play+The narrator: Well written and quite funny to listen to.+Worker AI works very well, workers prioritize tasks very well even though you don't really have a whole lot of control over it yourself.+Lots of control over your dungeon. You can fill up corridors back up, you decide where you put your tools, you can even restructure your entire dungeon if you have enough money.~Unit variation is alright, every factions has 4 different unit types with each 3 different tiers each and potential tactics you can create with that. Problem is that fights are way too quick for you to use any real tactics like assassinating with stealth units~Faction System: Instead of 1 big faction there are now 2(+1 with DLC). While this brings some variation in game style(although not that much) the Demon faction had only 2, potentially 3, missions while the Horde factions has like 7-Bland Specializations: On topic of faction variation, while I think the Horde faction was ok, the Undead Faction really lacks the feeling of actually playing undead, sure, they are better at resurrecting their soldiers then the other factions but unlike DK 2 you can't actually turn fallen enemies into soldiers like the Skeleton or Vampire in DK 2, which I think really should have been one of it's pointers. Same with demons, they have a torture room but it's essentially useless, you can't convert enemies like you could in the old games.-It's somewhat tedious to click on things with the hand-cursor, frequently missing or selecting wrong monsters-While I liked the narrator, the story and setting itself are quite cartoon'ish and unserious, almost all the characters and even alot of the story are quite obviously a parody of popular high-fantasy settings like Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones and World of Warcraft.Despite it's flaws I liked it quite alot. I should however mention that I bought it at a 75% sale and I would really only recommend you to buy it in a sale, it's not really worth €55 euros(with DLC). It's more of a Indie game so €15 is a more appropriate price.			"

Undead campaign was a challange however.This review is for single player so far. Overall, it is recommneded to play this game, but DK2 is way better.. "

Unique Gameplay, and also this is quite refreshing of RTS+Building SimsCONS:1) Monster type is limited.2) Limited Type of Units. 3) The game might be repetitive for awhile, it needs more function, like a heroes we could level up, or maybe the heroes could take a different kind of weapon/skill/armor/etc.All in all, a pretty fun game. it could be better thought			"

												Lets be clear: IS NOT DUNGEON KEEPER. it try to be dungeon keeper, but the ones that were there to play it, will feel Dungeons II Slower way slower, the dungeons feel smaller, way less Units than Dungeon keeper, the units pickup and other masterHand actions feel clumsy like, a real pain try to pick up a book or potion. the maps have Paths hard to distinguish from ""walls"" or from anything, like, if the Narrator dont blame you, you dont get it.If you never play Dungeon keeper, go ahead, This game ( Dungeons II ) MIGHT be fun. but by my point of view, Nope.

												I see a lot of negative reviews on here, and from what i'm reading people are either having the game crash or they say it's not fun. I've had the game crash once, but I was able to just relauch it and it was fine. You just have to let it load fully before you click anything.As for it not being fun, I disagree completely. The people who say it isn't fun don't like a slow-paced rts, which is what this is. You have to manage your resources, slowly build up your defences and army, and then go on the offensive. It will probably take a few offensive attacks to win the mission, but you'll get there. It's very chill and pretty laid back once you get the hang of it, and they have a funny narrator that says pretty funny references to other popular games and books of the same human vs orc theme.In the end, if you're looking for a slow-paced game that will take A LOT of time but is very enjoyable and relaxed with a funny joke here and there, this is a great game for you.Then only bad thing I'd have to say is without the DLC, there is a lack of content. I might have 13+ hours played, but that's just on a 8 or so mission campaign and i'm on the last mission. Although fun, it just shows how long the missions can take.			"

Casino with the jackpot winner, mistress in the torture chamber torturing the creatures, and those poor poor Imps muhahaha:) Where is ""Horny"" and his awsome music intro?:(- Lack of ""evil"" atmosphere, despite how much the narrator tries to brain wash you.- Lack of sound effects (goblins sounds redicioulous), little or no atmospheric evil sound effects..- Missing ""cool"" creatures, like black knights or ""Horny""- No POV controll of individuall creatures- Booring spells, for all factions- ""ultimate evil"" campaign was way too easy.. Undead campaign was a challange however.This review is for single player so far. Overall, it is recommneded to play this game, but DK2 is way better.. "

The Jist : Not worth full price (currently 39.99€) at all. I Bought it at 9.99€. Scathingly worth it. Relax and chill comedic game you can't lose. DON'T expect it to be anything like Dungeon Keeper.If you played Dungeon Keeper 2, this game will interest you because you really want Dungeon Keeper III.This isn't Dungeon Keeper III. Just remove all thought of that. It's Warcraft : Orcs and Humans, with 3D graphics and some rather forced elements of DKII. You're never at risk of losing. The enemy AI is just too dumb, and even the scripting is plain easy. Nothing interesting ever happens. At no point did I ever feel unsafe in my dungeon. So much so, that the only reason I ever saved is because the game crashes occasionally.  The overworld feels annoying, and the discontinuity between over and under world control of creatures is poor design. In the overworld it's classic RTS, underworld it switches to DK. The story is told by a narrator, and it's quite amusing and full of pop culture references. I actually laughed. Twice.Overall, the gameplay was not engaging enough, but it was engaging enough that I completed the campaign, and side missions. The story is amusing enough, and the voice actor did very well with the material he had. I definately feel I got my 9.99€ worth, and I don't feel like I wasted my time, but there's this burning feeling that they could have done so much MORE. I will probably buy Dungeons 3. When it's on sale. I think Kalypso did a good job. They likely just didn't have the budget to make this game great. They probably spent all their money in litigation with EA :pNote : This review does not take into account any DLC, and the experience was played without any of the DLC. "

												Now that i have played over 40 hours in the game andfinished the campaign  i feel that i can give an honoust review about this game.For starters...to all of those that are looking for dungeon keeper 2. Go buy dungeon keeper 2. This is not dungeon keeper 2 but this is a very fun game to play.So the pro's. The game is genuinly fun i had a blast playing it. Yes there is a campaign and the narrator willkeep informing you about that if you daddle around too long but you can take all the time you want to build up your dungeon and troops and place some defences if you desire so,I personally like the narrator's humor. The closer you get to the end the more insulting he gets.I also like the style of graphics, yes it is cartoonish but i like that style.There are however a few things that are a bit annoying at times.Mostly the loading times. It takes ages to start a new level.And maybe this was just me but in the later levels for some strange reason sometimes units just get stuck in one place while they are in the overworld. For some reason they do not understand that they can walk around a tree or a fox or whatever it is that is in theyre way but they just stand there and do nothing.Neither of these con's are so bad that they break the game in my opinion.In conclusion i give this game a big thumbs up and do hope that the guys and girls that worked on this game are planning to make another one cuz i really enjoyed myself it was a blast. So a big thank you to the developers of this game en keep up the good work. "

												This game is full of hilarious narration, a good story and depth of units.  The only down side (as of late 2015 and early 2016) is that there are quite a few bugs.  Units will get stuck and pushed, no big deal because you can warp them back down or just pick them up depending.  Units are not smart with work stations and will kick eachother off and sometimes rooms will not be fully utilized as a result.  The game seems to crash quite a bit right now, even though there is an auto save, you have to treat it like a 90's game in Windows 3.1 or DOS.  Save often with multiple files.  Sometimes I get an error where my units will stop interacting with everything and if I save after it wont clear the bug when I load so I have to go farther back.  I still feel the game is worth it especially for the $10 from the winter sale.  AFTER playing, I still would have payed full price and hoped for a patch for bugs later. Series Note:  This game plays a bit more like an RTS without the familiar controls even with the setting enabled.  I do sometimes miss the FPS abilities, but this was done fairly well.			"

												Bought this game while it was on SteamSale, 75% off. So $10. It felt repetitive even after just a few minutes of gameplay. I can see that the lack of building/room types is going to get old fast. It is a more RTS oriented Dungeon Keeper inspired clone(ish) graphics wise. If you enjoyed Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 , or Dwelvers then you might possibly like this game enough to pay $10 for it. I would NOT suggest paying any more than that for it though. It just isn't worth the $40 pricepoint of an A class game.I intend to exercise my rights to a steam refund on this one even though it was only $10. I am also going to click the thumbs UP on it but keep in mind ONLY at the price I paid for it $10 , not at its usual $40 price.			"

												It's certainly not a terrible game. However, the controls are frustrating and destroy the flow of the game. The narrator is too intrusive and continuously babbles along.

												Hah the story teller said that only 10% of buyers would finish this game... currently its 18% and I am one of them!In your face Kalypso :PDespite that... the game is fun (if you get all the Game of thrones refferences ... without those the humor is pretty stale). Nothing great to be seen here otherwise. Graphics, Music and Gameplay are a mediocre Dungeon Keeper clone and over all the game is way to easy without the possibility to ramp up the difficulty. DONT buy at fullprice ... you will be severly dissapointed. I got it around 20€ and still consider this to expansive for the quality and content delivered here. Still can reccomend it as there are no dungeon keeper follow ups and so even a mediocre clone is better than nothing (still my secret recommendation would be to get Dungeon Keeper 2 on GOG if you did not finish your 10.th campaign).Oh also... Multyplayer sucks as there is no lobby so you need to find players outside of the game to play a round. That might be the reason why only 0,3% of all players got the ""Win a multiplayer match"" achievement. Sucks ... but still better than nothing *thumbs up with a very forced grin*			"

												Honestly, I hear that the old Dungeon Keeper was better. Can't say because I've never played it. However, I love this game. I like how they've separated the Ultimate Evil into different factions, broke down your types of troops, and leveling the ""Do Gooders"" along with your dungeon. I like how in levels like in the dlc, you cannot be too powerful (Smog), To just sweep everything like in the vanilla levels. I do have a complaint. I have played many management games like Dungeons, Age of Mythology, Civilization, and things like that, but the one thing that they have that this game doesn't, is a map randomizer and editor.If there is anything that I wanted from this game, is the non repetitive skirmish levels. With DLC you get I think 17 maps or so... which mind you is a good... I'd say... 72 hours of gameplay, along with a good 36 hours for the story and 30 for the Game of Winter DLC, but it isn't enough. I want there to be a randomizer. I want a game where the unbreakable rock formations are randomized, amount of mana formations, secret rooms; full of spiders rates, and whatnot. I want a map where you might fight Krowtoes AND Meltysand, or just Grimlin with a big cave. I want there to be a random amount of dungeon entrances, this game has poor programming no offense. If you spent a few days or so creating a seed generator like in Age of Mythology, this game would be at the top of my list; 10/10. This game has potential but they made a sandbox that ends at some point. You're testing the same creatures on the same strategies on the same exact map over and over again. Its gotten to the point that no matter what, if I play the map a second time, I know where everything is, I could tell you where the other mana vessel is on the other side of the map. I. Don't. Like. That. Yea, you can keep the old maps (Smog, Killer Penguins, Isle of Terror, Haunted Forest, etc.) but create a seed generator you know? The game does get easy at a certain point, but if so, the difficulty increase seems to be dramatic to me (then again, I can barely handle Isle of Terror on medium, let alone hard; only at the beginning). I love this game but its too dry, too much repetitivity, not enough creativity. And please oH PLEASE, put a workshop for this game. There is so much the modding community could for this game. People would buy your game not just for the DLC, but for the modding content. I could only imagine what we can do with it, you're playing the bad guy for crying out loud what caN'T YOU DO!? Its sad how story, non free world games manage a workshop and this game, a practical sandbox, management, evil game doesn't.Okay, sorry, but this game sucks after 100 hours. I only play more because I'm testing different factions on the same levels, or playing the first story mission or the last Game of Winter mission so much. Overall, great game, horrible programming, not nearly enough time put into it. It could take them a week and all these bad reviews would go away, that's all you'd need. Make it a bigger game it's way too restricted and seriously I want the online gameplay to work. I want to join a random server and beat other people senseless and compete against people I don't know.

												First things first, if you're looking for a game like the first one then skip this one. It's not exactly the same, it keeps the most basic premises and changes everything else. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, this is still a good game on its own. If you need a way to waste a few hours of your life you won't be disappointed. You still build a dungeon and fill it with monsters and gold, but this time you get to control your monsters, at the expense of not controlling your dungeon lord. You still get spells, though, so it's kinda like having a dungeon lord anyways. This makes it easier to allocate units across your dungeon where they are needed, like at your core when being attacked. The game also adds in the overworld, which gives you a chance to stretch your legs a bit and attack things with your minions. Balancing attacking targets with defending your dungeon gets a bit tricky at times but is easily managed. Overall, the game is worth playing. Once you let go of the need for it to be a carbon copy of the first, it's fun and balanced and that's what's important.			"

												Pretty good game, the game doesn't really hold up to the standard of the classic DK but is still very enjoyable.+Good Campaign, both the Vanilla and DLC campaign had quite a couple missions which had good build-up, were well-constructed and alot of fun to play+The narrator: Well written and quite funny to listen to.+Worker AI works very well, workers prioritize tasks very well even though you don't really have a whole lot of control over it yourself.+Lots of control over your dungeon. You can fill up corridors back up, you decide where you put your tools, you can even restructure your entire dungeon if you have enough money.~Unit variation is alright, every factions has 4 different unit types with each 3 different tiers each and potential tactics you can create with that. Problem is that fights are way too quick for you to use any real tactics like assassinating with stealth units~Faction System: Instead of 1 big faction there are now 2(+1 with DLC). While this brings some variation in game style(although not that much) the Demon faction had only 2, potentially 3, missions while the Horde factions has like 7-Bland Specializations: On topic of faction variation, while I think the Horde faction was ok, the Undead Faction really lacks the feeling of actually playing undead, sure, they are better at resurrecting their soldiers then the other factions but unlike DK 2 you can't actually turn fallen enemies into soldiers like the Skeleton or Vampire in DK 2, which I think really should have been one of it's pointers. Same with demons, they have a torture room but it's essentially useless, you can't convert enemies like you could in the old games.-It's somewhat tedious to click on things with the hand-cursor, frequently missing or selecting wrong monsters-While I liked the narrator, the story and setting itself are quite cartoon'ish and unserious, almost all the characters and even alot of the story are quite obviously a parody of popular high-fantasy settings like Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones and World of Warcraft.Despite it's flaws I liked it quite alot. I should however mention that I bought it at a 75% sale and I would really only recommend you to buy it in a sale, it's not really worth €55 euros(with DLC). It's more of a Indie game so €15 is a more appropriate price.			"

												Amazing! Loved every minute of it! I missed Dungeon Keeper from back in the day and this was not only that and then some, but also extreamly funny. The WoW, LotR, and GoT references from the narrator were great, tons of puns! I highly recomend this game if you are looking for something to relax with and you have your small dungeon kingdom to micro manage, can raid the surface world and all while enjoying the comical story. The Horde / Chaos flip is nice, sets the stage for more to come and with the non ""Litch King"" figure they've set this up for some great DLC!			"

												It was a fun game brought back some memories of dungeon keeper.  There are a lot of simularities.  The campaign is lacking took around 16-17 hours to complete it and that was at a slow pace.  The narrator isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  Yes there's a few adverts and several puns but I laughed at all of them.  I grabbed it at the 50% off sale and was def worth it.			"

												A bit slow at times, a bit easy, but I thoroughly enjoyed the dungeon building aspects and the narrator. The overworld content does get harder later thankfully, but defending in the dungeon is as easy as filling it with traps and immediately zapping the bard that disables traps. There's really no fear of the heroes actually destroying your throne room.			"

												Score: 8.5This is a preliminary review as I only have played for ashort time. But given that it is now on sale I might as well get my first thoughts out as I disagree with some of the negative ratings received by the game.This is a *little* and *charming* game. From what I have seen so far, worth the $20 I payed for it. I never played Dungeon Keeper so I don't have that point of reference but I played the Majesty 2 game so I felt right at home with setting tasks to the units rather than directly teling them what to do (as you would in a game like Starcraft). Here you point to a location and indicate you want to mine its gold and the game engine will assign workers to mine the gold. If you want units to fight a monster you pick them up and drop them near the monster. Once they recover from the fall they will attack nearby enemies. So the units are sort of autonomous and you have indirect control. You concentrate on improving your economy, hire units, discover locations (by sending workers to mine rocks), place traps, drop units near enemies. The game holds your hand by having a narrator telling what to do. It is not particularly funny but I don't think it is intended to be funny. It is intended to hammer the message set when you see the intro movie: the game doesn't take itself too seriously. You will not be pulling your hair trying to figure out what to do next here. The narrator tells you. I like that sort of game.Would the game be worth $40? I do not know. When I finish the campaing and when/if I get around to update the review, I will tell you. For now I can say that  for $20 it is totally worth it.			"

												1) Has narrator advertizing in-game for other games from the studio - Do you like to take your sweet time building up resources, training up your critters, and only then wreaking terrible havoc on the innocent countryside, cracking skulls and teasing seagulls? Well! You'll be curiously interrupted mid-stride by the narrator, your head held high, streaming shadows from every pore in your skin, all stoic-like, your orcs' axes about to swing the felling blow...to hear that you should buy another game that isn't this one, the one you're playing right now, the one you pre-ordered, the one in which you are right now wreaking havoc and recording over goodie's mix tapes whilst incorrectly pressing their pantaloons.It says buy more kalypso games...if that's not an advertizement, I don't know what is...Exhibit A: Searching ad images online, you get:""Beat the system. Buy a Volvo.""""Buy the Wall Street Journal""""Buy insurance and keep calm"" (GEICO gecko image, brand recognition)[Insert lots of company names] Buy now."" (These are ads not images for buttons, by the way.)Etc.That's right, I bought your game, gave you my hard-earned coinage, so don't come bursting through my 4th wall like the Kool-aid man; no matter how passively you do your in-game advertizing, no matter how ""just right,"" - it will be inevitably wrong.Edit: Developers worked with me in terms of feedback and asking what the middleground was. I'm still not pleased with it being there but - to their great credit - they did do the work to not just mute the entire narrator but to pull certain forms of cheeky bits and nuisances as well. I like all those bits...just not this one piece, so I have to lose to gain.2) Now, this next one is relatively excusable, however frustrating, given the game just released. It's this ""Lost connection to server"" error which drops the game and anything between now and the last save. Last ~3 hours of gameplay saw this happen 3 times with ~45 minutes of gameplay lost, at least. So, there's your caveat if you're not bothered by this other smeg.Edit: July 4th, 2015 - Still an issue. Seems to be tangibly correlated to wealth acquisition which the engine simply can't handle when coupled with all the miscellaneous bits being produced in the brewery and workshop when combined with large treasure troves. Yes I could simply not do any buildup and charge the enemy but that seems to make that little pleasure of aggrandizement a moot one, yes?3) Sign in/up screen every time you start the game. See store page for ""Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Kalypso Launcher (Account registration optional)""Yeah, you can click to skip because it is supposedly optional, but why should I have to click to skip, each and every time? Yes you can skip it, but I just want to play the game; beam me up scotty - don't make me WALK up a light beam to the Enterprise.I mean, without an option to make the optional screen optional, then it seems I'm out of options, aren't I? Hmph.(mindblown)Analysis:If you don't mind being pulled out of immersion to be advertized to in that ""Satire being what it satirizes is no longer satire but reality."" kind of way, if you don't mind random losses of gameplay, and if you don't mind a not-so-optional-because-it-lacks-an-option-to-be-optional optional sign in/up screen, then grab a fistful of legal tender and drop it in their Treasure hole to get this party started.Otherwise, step back, and give them some time to swat some snots and drop the patches out to get rid of commercial time and the reminiscent-of-my-little-brother-being-a-jackass-in-the-pool splash screen, leaving me with a similar, but metaphorical, searing chlorine eye sheen.Done.Now then, if you remove said splash screen and in-game advertizing from the narrator, then I will happily spin me right round - like a record baby - and give this review the shoe, turning my philosophical frown upside down and recommending it straight away.Edit: And I have, as promised :) It's a reasonable go between, at least.I'll recommend it with the above caveats, that is. If you aren't bothered, then the rest is a pleasant and comedic game that is aware of the industry within which it resides.			"

												This game is obviously heavily influenced by the old Dungeon  Keeper games, but somehow doesn't quite capture the old magic of  those games  (which I really liked).It's kind of an automated RTS where if you don't specifically direct your units to do something, they will get to work on their own.  This lets you focus on building your dungeon without having to micro-manage your units (although on occassion you will want to do so).  You just set tasks, like digging out tunnels or researching new traps, spells or skills and the appropriate dungeon denisons go about the task.What this adds that DK did not have is an above ground element.  This felt a lot like Warcraft to me and had a much more normal RTS feeling with you directing troops to march across the map and attack units.  I don't know if this element added as much to the game as I thought it would.Overall, the game is much simpler than DK with less room types, less monster types and overall much easier missions.  I never had  to start a level again and never really felt under pressure from the heros invading my dungeon.  Basically, the game was too easy.  I guess I should have played on hard instead of medium...Overall, I had fun and it wasn't a big commitment of hours, so I would  definitely recommend it to fans of the DK games and those looking for a light RTS experience.7/10			"

												Haven't played all that much of this game, but from the few hours i've put in I can say, the narration is fantastic. This isn't a game for people serious about strategy, but more for those who love a good easter egg and a laugh			"

												It's improved and modernized Dungeon keeper. Usually this kind of 'remake of an old famous game' gives me only regret about the money I spent but this one only improved things. Maps in this game have both underground and outside world and you can send out your minions to attack villages above ground. A huge improvement over Dungeon keeper.			"

												Fun game. The whole overworld + underworld idea is quite interesting and OK accomplished.Sadly the game feels way too easy, specially when it comes to the dungeon which, to any DK fan will feel limited and monotone after a while.The narrator says at some point at the beginning something along lines of ""those bast.. oh wait, I better control myself, otherwise those age rating people will be insufferable""; I think it kind of reflects what feels wrong about this game: they played it safe when this could have been a great spooky anti-hero easy-to-learn-hard-to-master That being said, the campaign has some crazy stuff in it, is full of geeky, funny and sometimes quirky references. It keeps your interest if you like exploring everything and don't mind being 100% sure you can win any time you set your mind to it.If (when?) the narrator feels too chatty, remember there is a setting for that :).

												Pleasantly charming and entertaining game, the narrator makes it all the better (guy from Stanley parable). If you like being evil and doing evil things and if you liked Dungeon Keeper, You will like this.			"

												A very good dungeon builder with some humorous moments in the campaign. Credit to the narrator who delivers an excellent performance and 4th wall breaking jokes.			"

												This game narrator is awesome. The campain is fulled with real-life jokes / jokes to another games and much more. The game mechanics could be little bit better but the campain is total worth it!			"

												Where to begin, the Dungeons(1) had a brilliant idea where you had to lure heroes to your dungeon and ooh and ah them to fatting their bags of gold then you get to kill them - the joy factor around this was it was very close to the legendary Dungeon Keeper of Bullfrog BUT it was still unique in their own way, with Dungeons 2 they tried to much to the Dungeon Keeper name, yes indeed they did have some unique features to the game but they killed their title buy removing so many decals that you could build and make and intently luring the hero victims.The + points: The narrator of the game with his humor was a major element of the game, the idea you control the minions or demons was a nice idea. The - points: this is a very very very short game, very limit rooms and traps and units in the one hand.The game does offer a skirmish option but it the fun factor dies in 10 minutes			"

												Spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper, yay!.. until the game glitches so you can't progress.  Level 5ish, got to a point where no matter how many re-installs and re-starts, I can't hit the thing that allows me to finish the mission.  So.  I'm not even out of the tutorial part of the campaign, I'm still getting the basic minions and tech.Pros: Dungeon Keeper!Cons: Gold takes too long to gather, minion management is kind of a pain, syrupy controls don't move quick enough around and you have to constantly middle-click and drag unless you want to scudder along with WASD.  Levels take too long for what they are, if you play conservatively - and if you don't, you don't have enough minions to really sustain themselves and they croak in the overworld.  Overworld missions seems extremely clunky and detract from the fun building aspect of the game - the overworld seems more like a minigame, but it's the focus.  This game could have used a lot of polish - cool idea, bad execution.			"

												I enjoy playing this game.  The campaign went by quick.  I have only played multi-player once, but had a good time doing it.  If you like real-time strategy games, I suggest trying this game.  The game is a fairly normal RTS.  You manage a dungeon - collecting resources (gold and mana), digging out or filling in rooms and hallways, assigning rooms to various purposes (keeping your troops happy or upgrading rooms/troops), and placing traps to slow or kill would be adventurers that invade your dungeon.  There are a variety of mosters, each with different purposes and combat abilities.  The game covers most of what you would want in a dungeon management style game.			"

												Enjoyed it so much. That i just bought all the DLC. Nuff said.The only thing thats missing is multiplayer AI. However don't let that stop you because the singleplayer campaign is a blast!And playing against a friend in mp can also be alot of fun.			"

												The game is finally fixed! By Jeebus it took long enough though! I've deleted the old negative review since it's no longer relevant, but this game launched with some real issues and it took a loooong time for the devs to fix them. It's a good game, but maybe wait a few years before buying a Kalypso game in future, apparently that's how long it takes them to fix their bugs... still, kudos to them for coming back and fixing it, I honestly thought they had abandoned it! Great game now!Some Really Good Things:=*= Rebind-able Keys!=*= Runs at a fairly solid 50+fps on max graphical settings in a full dungeon, which is quite serviceable for a management game.Couple of other gripes, they don't destroy the game but it would be nice if they were fixed:there's no option to turn off mouse scrolling, so there is a tendency to scroll across the map when trying to select the spells on the bar at the right.The animations on the lust demons seem to break allot, and are just plain bad most of the time, the way the whips are animated is particularly derpy.Very occasionally it seems to stop letting me click to mine tiles, it's only happened a couple of times but it's kind of annoying when it does.Still a really good game though, and I hope they keep updating it to polish out the rest of it's minor flaws.

												Yay! I ‘m going to review Dungeons 2! Oh those Roman numerals, I decided to put a ‘2’ instead of “II” because those are really just two “I’s” (eyes) stuck together. Why Roman numeral why!So what we begin with is the main menu. There is a campaign, skirmish, and for all you crazy option loving crazies out there, options. I won’t spoil what happens in the campaign, But I dare do say it’s fun, and funny. A combination I adore, plus you get to be evil. Plus, you’re building a dungeon! How cool is that?! It’s fun to me because I enjoy the carving out your dungeon aspect, hiring units, (once the proper room is build of course,) researching upgrades, (There are general upgrades, as well as unit specific upgrades,) and the mana aspect (cast spells, etc,) Oh! And traps. And it’s funny...because of the narrator (and the slaps you may dole out to your minions). I have to be honest and say I have read other reviews, and they say, he can be...oh, what’s that word…annoying? Anyway, I found that if you sat there during the campaign, the narrator would remark something witty and funny, and, actually, the narrator tends to say funny words, on scripted spots of the game, (There is a LOT of references to movies and games) . This is a given, You may not like it. I do, enjoy the comments of the narrators wit.So, you may be asking yourself, “Big deal, it’s another dungeon game.” Yes, but it helps keep it fresh by allowing you play with more than one faction! That is, two factions. Yes, two factions does not seem like a lot, but you can switch them up between plays in the skirmish maps. (There is a third playable faction, but only if you buy the appropriate DLC!) These two factions play somewhat similar with the same goals, but their style differs. For example, Faction ‘A’ requires the thirst of your minions to be sated. You can stock up on beer and store these good for your minions. The other faction, ‘B’ demands that your minions be admired by your basic workers, something that cannot be stocked up upon and must be dealt with as the minions needs arises.There’s not a lot of skirmish maps to play with, unfortunately. There is DLC for that too. Also, I don’t believe you can make your own maps. It may have to do with how the overworld ‘evilfies’ as you rampage across the surface. It would probably be hard to design a way to allow the freedom of map making while also having changes of the map being ‘evilfied’. Like say, if I hypothetically created a map on here, some things may not ‘evilfy’ correctly. There’s integers to worry about, there’s zones, actions, boolians, true’s and falses, parameters that must be set, flags, and the different doodads that must be placed appropriately when creating a map to ensure it all works when things get all evil looking on the surface.There’s not a whole lot I dislike about the game. Sometimes the hand can be picky on what it picks up, it takes a bit of practice. There is no way of prolonging enemy waves of coming into your dungeon, (unless you kill them before they arrive,) it’s ether fight or die when they come. It usually starts out with two or three pitchfork presents, then works up to stronger units attacking you as time progresses. "
