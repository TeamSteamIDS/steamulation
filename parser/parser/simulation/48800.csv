												This game has great trailers, it does look amazing.What it does fail to deliver is a good game, it plain sucks.The damage model of the ships is super basic, it clips through whatever you crash into, there's no visible damage.You can walk on your boat, a great feature, but you can't jump, you can't open doors, those few boats that do allow for moving around on them usually have closed doors that you just walk through, like a ghost.When a ship sinks, the water just clips through everything, I realize this is not really an easy thing to code, but it's as if you played GTA vice city, perhaps that looks beter still.When a boat is going fast through the water, the water does look extremely good, but the disturbed water ""animation"" slows down"" when you go slower, doesn't look good when you know that.I can barely play this at all anyway, I have a pretty beast game PC, (60FPS in most games) but here I can barely scrape 20 at times, due to the fact that the developer has not patched the issue of AMD videocards not really being optimized for this game.If you have an NVIDIA videocard, you'll not have this issue, if you have an AMD card, don't bother buying this game, it'll not run playable.Good game? The idea is good, but it's poorly performed.			"

												It has fantastic graphics and its water simulation is top notch.  However what you see is what you get, and it is very limited out of the box.  No option for adding ships, no option for adding harbours or world locations, severely limits the game to what its developers had the time and budget to create, whch is not much.The beauty of singapore and hong kong, of oban, and orkney, of norway, the grandure of la, portland and london, of miami, the eerie, panama and great-glen canals, all missing from this game, all places modders could have developed and added themselves.This game could have been as successful as flight simulator, but instead the developers and publishers opted for closed architecture.  It is a glistening shadow of what it could have been, a frustrating mess of bugs with a clunky interface.			"

												As a student studying Deep Sea Navigation and Nautical Science, I revisit this game every year hoping that my quarrels with it were a figment of my imagination, that I had simply not installed it properly and that this time it would be the ship simulator of my dreams. Each year I get bitterly disappointed.I've been an avid fan of the Ship Simulator franchise since Ship Sim 2006. As a child, I loved maneuvering the boats out of harbour, watching them battle the fierce ocean and using the freecam to pretend i was a captain inspecting the ship as it made its passage. That passion for the industry eventually led to me choosing it as a career. Now that I have learned more about ships and how they're run in more detail, I returned to these Simulators with knowledge of international maritime regulations, rules of the road and onboard duties. Frankly, I am very disappointed, not just because the game is bland but because they missed out so much potential features that could truly add to this already lacking simulator. VStep, the developers of Ship Simulator are well known in the maritime industry as they produce training simulation software and equipment for real maritime educational institutions for training real life cadets and deck officers. It does indeed occur to me that Ship Sim is a scaled down version of their premium training software with slight adjustments to make it work for normal computers and such. That however is this game's downfall. Upon opening and loading up a game, I was greeted with a buggy, plain looking glitch fest with dead environments, the exact same ships from 2008 plus extras and an overall hideous looking appearance. Ship Simulator Extremes is literally no different from Ship Sim 2008, except for slightly more ships and a vehicle for Greenpeace to promote itself. When I first played it, the immediate let down was the graphics. This is an atrocious looking game. The harbours are dead, lifeless places and the most fun I had from this was playing on the Antarctic map and pretending to be looking for lost treasure. The water a.k.a the ""expressway of the seven seas"" is nothing interesting to look at and I have had constant texture glitches where the water textures would flash violently whenever the camera clipped the water. Example:

Another gripe with the water is that there is literally nothing underneath the ocean but an infinite void. This was excusable in previous Ship Sim games as technology was still quite primitive but surely VStep could have added a filter to appear when your camera went under?

Extremes also has constant audio issues. Engine sounds randomly cutting out, weather effect sounds stutter and stop at random. Everything about this game is an immersion killer.That's just it really. Ship Simulator Extremes lacks user-friendliness and polish. It really is just for hardcore ship enthusiasts. Having learnt the nature and sheer scale of what goes on onboard a ship, I can think of some features they can add to make the game more interesting. This can include onboard fire scenarios, discharging and loading cargo (including liquid product) as well as more immersive lifeboat mechanics. Unfortunetely, VStep are incapable of making this game appeal to non-Shipping people, simply because they're not a gaming company at their heart. I will give Vstep credit however for introducing a more educational dynamic into Ship Simulator. After completing a Greenpeace mission it shows a small video discussing more about what Greenpeace and its maritime practices do to save the oceans. This I felt was a good first step in educating young people who play this game and convincing them into entering the industry. However at the same time it falls flat on its face in this regard. When you start a new mission, it places you in a boat with all these levers and wheels in front of you and you have absolutely no clue to what to do. They don't even bother teaching you what all the information the game provides you means. Like I said, if they had added a far more stronger educational dynamic into this, it could have easily been a good tool for teaching students more about the shipping industry. However the campaigns are short and aren't really that interesting. Out of the 8 or so hours I've played, 6 of them have been me free roaming on the Antarctic map using my imagination. This is because the other campaigns are really buggy. For example, I present to you a hilarious glitch that happened when I was doing one of the random chase missions:


WTF? RHIB glitch

In all, Ship Simulator Extremes is a subpar simulator game that barely lives up to its predecessors. If you are a person looking to enter the maritime industry, don't rely on this to teach you more about it. Ship Sim 2008 does a much better job in doing that.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=305376639 "

												Ship Simulator Extremes is a Simulator which allows you to helm various types of vessels, in a variety of different modes. Free roam the seas, or play various campaigns, single player missions, or through multiplayer mode, Ship Simulator Extremes has a lot to offer the Ship Simulator enthusiest; However, there are also a few serious drawbacks. There is no playable tutorial, which teaches you how to operate the various ships, so you are thrown into campaigns, missions, and even free roam, completely blind. This makes the learning curve difficult for people who are casual players even if you have prior experience with other simulators. The piloting controls are based on realistic controls for each ship and you will need to figure it out as you go, which does give the game an interesting challenge, but could be seen as a turn off by those who do not want to spend hours doing what a playable tutorial would teach in minutes. Another problem this particular game is notorious for is difficulty running on high end machines. I only experienced one crash in the little over an hour I played, so this is something to keep in mind if you have a decent gaming rig. The scenery looks great and the boats are very detailed, but it takes a while to get from point to point, so you need to have a lot of patience to play this game. All in all, I thought it was great as a simulator, though I have to knock it for the lack of a playable tutorial. The missions you can do are interesting, such as stopping cargo ships from dumping in the ocean, and so on. There is a lot to do in this game and the DLC's offer even more ships and missions to experience. Just make sure if you spend the money on this game, you are prepared for a steeper than normal learning curve and have a boatload of patience. (Pardon the pun).			"

												Not too happy with this, It has standard simulator graphics, Not very good but in the end its the simulation you are playing, not a game designed for HD performace, although saying that, the  sunlight on the water looks superb, and the water is very nice, the effects of the ship on the water are really well done and the ships aswell look very nice, especially the cruise ship, it looks amazing. I like how you can walk around your ship, you can stand at the front and watch the waves splash over, you can take a nice walk around and its pretty good, I like it!The damage system isn't great, I don't ask for much with this becuase this isn't the ship version of GTA, but at least some visible damage would have been nice, some scratches or a hull breach would have been better, and when you are sinking you just clip through the water like you are ghost submarine having no effect at all.Freeroam is pretty relaxing, I like that they added this, you can chose any ship you want, any time of the day with any combination of weatcher and water effect. You can have a sunny hurricane or a heavily raining, cloudy sail through a calm water. The missions, where do I begin? Some are good, some are terrible. I like the cruise ship missions, they are fun to do and good to play, I only tried a few other missions but they were terrible, I played one mission 4 times over, I had to sail out of a dock at 10 knots which took forever to get near the exit, and when you get near the exit (There is NO prior warning of this) It tells you to stop, and if you do not manage to get your massive ship to stop within 3 seconds, you fail the mission and have to start over again. Very poorly done. The controls are very accurate, and the weather effects the controls very well as you can imagine, and the ships have different controls which are set to what ships of its kind in real life have. Also having to enter a product key at the start of the game for the game itself and every DLC it comes with is pretty irritating.I might be wrong on this but also Im not sure you can edit settings such as controls, audio, graphics ingame. Pressing ESC only gives you the option to Save, Cancel mission or resume. I might just not have seen it elsewhere tho,Overall I would have given this a +1, but becuase of the poorly made missions, and the graphics and lack of damage on ships (which doesn't bother me much, its mainly the missions I care about) Im gonna give this a No. If you like ships, and like simulators, then I really recommend this game if it is on sale , It is a good play if your into this kinda thing, but I think the full price isn't worth what you get. Although a few patches could easily fix it up!!			"

												MARKETTING BLURB: ""Ever wonder how it feels to sail a half-million-ton supertanker through the perfect storm?""Yes I do, however The ""EXTREMES"" part of the title is entirely misleading. I set the wind to maximum ""hurricane"" setting and went out into the Atlantic in a speedboat, sailboat and tanker and the waves are nothing like a ""perfect storm"", more like a choppy 3 mtr swell. Couldn't tip the boats or damage them in the slightest. Waves don't even break over the bow. When I do manage to ""crash"" into waves it glitches and either spins the boat chaotically into the air or stops its momentum dead. Not at all realistic and absolutely NOT EXTREME. The water is a 2D plane with no attempt to deal with the camera dropping below the waves - which happens constantly - so the water appears hollow. Scenery is dull. Textures are average. Simulation is as simplistic as it is inaccurate.Conclusion: Meh. Not even worth $10.			"

												I am a student at a Maritime Academy so I should be the target market for this simulator but I just can't get past it's flaws. First off, I have a quad-core i7 processor w/ a GeForece 555M that gets great framerates on Crysis 2 and Skyrim but no matter how I adjust the graphics this game has an awful framerate, so bad as to make the sim unusable. Second is the fact that I have to enter the product keys every time I start the game. Between these two flaws, but expecially the performance lag, I can't even get started with this simulator even though it would be a help to my career to have a tool like this. I just can't reccomend it to anyone unless they patch it to improve he perfromance issues.			"

												Ship Simulator Extremes is a decent simulator but do have some problems. Graphics are good - water, waves etc looks very good but there is some disapoiting graphical problems. Sound effects, engines, weather could have been better. Game physics are good but strange sometimes.This game is for a specific audience and may not be enyoyable to everbody. A Cod player may not like this at al. Newcomers will have big problems controlling bigger ships because of the very hardcore feeling and it takes a long time to learn how drive. I do recommend this game but Ship Simulator 2008 is a better choice, it has better menus and more selection of missions and stuff.			"

												This game really isn't very good. I have a $600 radeon 7970 3gb video card and i thought it would easily be able to run this game at 300+ frames per second. But the water has a quality slider and there is only one setting where it looks halfway decent and that is when it shows whitecaps.. But at this setting my framerate drops to 18fps? In the first greenpeace mission i was literally driving on a boat down a port getting 11 frames per second. I had to set the water to cartoon setting to be able to play at a constant 40+ fps. If you select ""very rough"" the waves just look awful and clip through your screen and do all sorts of strange things, you can not run off the ship into the water, you can not climb the ladders to explore the second floor of the ships, you can not sink a ship. (it just says your ship is sinking game over)Besides the poor performance the graphics are too cartoony for my liking. Sure outside it looks alright but the second you enter first person mode and walk around the ship the colors/surfaces make it look like you are on a childrens playground.Other than that the controls are absolutely horrible, you have to physically click the steering wheel with your mouse and rotate it.. At first i was fine with it but the problem is that it begins rotating the wrong way once you start turning the wheel. Its almost impossible to turn your boat around.			"

												Graphics for this game are very good and the water is definitely nice looking.However, what you see in the trailer is what you'll get in the actual base game itself, and it's very limited for what you get. No option to add more ships or harbours to the game (unless you buy the DLC, which I presume some people don't wanna do). The damage model simply isn't there. When you hit an iceberg it simply doesn't show any visible damage to the ship, although it does show a health meter next to your compass navigation that shows how much damage you've taken from the hit. I  know it might be hard to code that IN, but at LEAST try to get SOME type of damage model into the ships, so it'll look nice when you strike an iceberg or something of the sort...Speaking of icebergs... the game is also poorly optimized. I have a beast of a rig, and one time while trying to sink the P&O (Pride of Rotterdam), when I struck the iceberg, the game just freaked out and lagged like crazy! It went from 60FPS to 5-8FPS instantly, making me wonder how the devs tried to optimize this game.There are definitely bugs, like on the menu screen where the water just glitches like crazy, or the one I stated above. Including one where when I started the game, all it would show me is a black screen then presumably crash (what I thought) and close the game. Other than that  I don't believe there are very many bugs, but it is still a bit buggy because of when it was made. Pick up the damn pace 2010!Oh, and wanna know what's under the nice looking water? Nothing. Not joking, NOTHING. Why would they make nice looking water then put nothing under it? I don't know, honestly. But I do know THIS: If your gonna make something look nice, at least at a few touches to it to make it even nicer! I mean, would it KILL them just to put stuff underwater?Although it is a nice game, I can't recommend it for the price it's asking. For $20 bucks you get a very limited selection of ships and harbours to choose from, plus it still has bugs that haven't been fixed since the game was released. I would recommend it at $10 or maybe even $5 bucks when there is a discount for it.Good game? The idea is a nice one, but poorly preformed from the developers themselves.			"

This applies to even the smallest vessels. I've driven several different boats in real life from yachts to launches and this does not simulate the steering of a real boat at all. It is of course a game and I don't expect it to be 100% like real life but when the boats in GTA perform closer to the real life than a 'simulator' it's pretty dissapointing and makes it completly pointless			"

												I LOVE IT !!!!It is so interesting to take control over huge amount of ships, make missions and do whatever you want with them.Cons :1# when you make mission/free roam and add too many vessels to play with, you will not be able to select them because icons are out of screen. I recommend add slider menu with ships to select  :)2# I can't join any multiplayer servers and find any :( "

												On paper this game looks very promising but as the saying goes 'never judge a book by its cover' ... For starters the amount of hard drive memory the game uses up is enormous! Though Ship Simulator Extremes ran smoothly with no frame-rate issues the amount of memory used caused significant problems for me elsewhere on my PC. I also found the gameplay to be quite fractionated in terms of continuity mostly due to having to change terrains all the time in free roam (or Sandbox) mode. There are only two terrains which allow realistic free roam experiences to the player. These are Bora Bora around which attention to detail is essential when selecting larger ships and the English Channel which allows Dover to Calais (and Isle of Wight) ferry crossings. So many of the others allow the player to navigate their way out of one of several huge real world ports ... Before having to change terrains which can only be done manually involving the rather disruptive selection process. The appearance of many of the ships also tends to be quite 'cartoony' rather than photo-realistic especially when viewed internally from the Bridge. There are some good points which mostly relate to the phenominal level of detail featured within each terrain. Also the DLC Content available through Steam greatly enhances the game in a number of ways: Especially the Ferries pack which was my favourite DLC download. Ship Simulator Extremes also features a built-in Mission Editor facility but it is strongly advised to read up on how to use this before attempting to do so.Am I sad about this non-recommendation? Yes as Ship Simulator Extremes did genuinely appeal to me when I bought the game along with a number of the DLC downloads. But with so much hard drive memory required and generally  fractionated and disrupted gameplay SSE receives a no-no from Me.			"

												Read edit at the bottom after this.The game first of all is broken. Broken as a home in Beverly Hills. Although the costumer support swears the game works, that is a dirty, rotten, pee soaked lie. I have tried everything they have told me to try and get the game to work....Still a no go. And the terrible part is they insist that the game is absoluteness perfect in everyday. I tried very hard to get it through there thick heads that the game is broken....But no...nothing. I even try dumbing to there level and agreeing with them for a bit, but everything kept pointing to a problem (WITH THE GAME!!!!)......Just to point there idiocy here is what a support staff said to me on the forum. ""I had a problem similar to yours when i first got the game...All games seemed to work SS2006, SS2008, and even the Ship Sim Extremes demo. But the full game still wouldn't work"" After he said that he still tried to convince me that it was his PC that had a problem, and not the game.......So Mr. Costumer Support all games on your PC work except this one, so there must be a problem with your PC.........That makes total since.Anyways I'm getting on a bit of a rant here, so I better change my attitude. OK, So to sum it all up, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Just don't buy it! It is, as i said BROKEN. All you will be doing is spending a few dollars on a game crash simulator.....Come to think about it, thats what they should call it. Game Crash Simulator 2015! Game of the year right there! Represents the title perfectly!P.s. See how much time I've spent playing this game....Thats been me, spending that much time staring at a CRASH HANDLER!! .0000000000000000001/10 TERRIBLY AWFUL GAME Double negatived to emphasize the badness of this title.EDIT: OK, so I'm on vacation right now. So I brought along an old laptop I had sitting around the house for entertainment on the ride here (I wasn't driving) Anyways, out of curiosity I installed Ship Simulator onto the laptop to see if in any way it would work........it did. The game freaking' worked. It wouldn't work on my PC at home that is 10 times as powerful, but it would work on this....That makes no since to me! The developers said that my PC was the problem, and that it wasn't powerful enough for the game. But CLEARLY it is! If a laptop which has a AMD radeon processor and graphics card which I may add ISN'T SUPPOSED TO WORK (The forum said so), why can't my PC run it......I'm lost. And now I can't get a refund because I played the game......Another edit: It works on linux................................................			"

												This game gets undeserved criticism, simply because it is a ship simulator.Don't let that deter you from playing this game. If you have the smallest hunger for an awesome nautical experience on PC, I highly recommend this game.I enjoy all the missions because I get to try my hand at piloting all kinds of ships in varying difficulties and conditions.When I'm not playing missions, I hop onto the servers and take to the seas with other players, form fleets, make channel crossings together etcAnd sometimes I'll go into freeroam mode under horrible weather conditions, aka middle of the night on the Atlantic Ocean with extremely low visibility from fog and hurricane force winds, and have to use just my radar and instruments to track down the other AI ships that are also weathering the same storm as me.This game is a ton of fun. Buy it, play it, enjoy it, and friend me if you want to take to the water together!			"

												Nope, just nope, to sum it up.For starters, this 'game' is a dumbed down version of the actual simulator which is supposedly made for actual trainees. Moving past how unrealistic this program is for such a purpose, what you actually get when purchasing this game is a restricted version of the actual software, from which the snazzy screenshots above comes from. First off the game only runs on one core, so all the multi-core power in the world won't help you run this game at max graphics, which is still below the quality of the store page screenshots. (Which is, in fact, false advertising.) Nope, you purchased the game but you won't get the nice graphics or the FPS. What you do get is a tacky, low-fps downscaled game that doesn't live up to be called a ship simulator. The gameplay feels extremely linear, which is bizarre considering you're travelling on water, but is more or less inherited by the A to B mission objectives. Sometimes you have to do more than take your [boat] from one place to another, but then the game is deaf on its own triggers and tends to ignore the objective completion trigger the game told you to do earlier.So in short, nope. I don't recommend it unless you're into mental challenges on par with Desert Bus. In fact get Desert Bus instead. It's free and has about the same novelty after 10 minutes as this title.			"

												Erster Versuch: Runtime Error als ich das erste Spiel gestartet habe. Zweiter Versuch: Runtime Error nach 90 min.Die Spielerfahrung in jenen 90 Minuten beurteile ich als mangelhaft.Die Grafik ist auf dem Stand von 2008, für einen Simulartor ganz hübsch. Das ist auch schon das positive.Negativ fiel mir als allererstes auf, dass das Steuerrad des Motorboots nicht animiert war. Ein Tutorial gab es nicht, also zuerst try and error, anschließend gegooglet und ein paar eher weniger hilfreiche Pdfs gefunden. Die Pdfs konnten aber auch nciht hilfreicher sein, denn die Steuerung ist unter aller Sau.Das Kreuzfahrtschiff kann man nur mit Hilfe der Maus steuern, da wenn ich das Ruder inkremental mit der Tastatur bewege (Shift + Pfeiltaste Links oder Rechts), drehen sich die Steuerhebel mit, allerdings nicht parralel zum Rad, sondern irgendwie, womit der Dampfer vom Kurs abkommt.Ich bin in Simulationen schon Flugzeuge, Autos und Raketen geflogen. Hier bin ich zum ersten mal gescheitert.Entweder ist es enorm schwierig ein Boot in einem Kanal geradeaus fahren zu lassen, oder dieser Simulator ist für den ♥♥♥♥♥. (Nebenbemerkung ich habe schon ein paar echte Boote gesteuert, deswegen finde ich für mich: Der Simulator ist für den ♥♥♥♥♥.)Fazit: Man lernt nix, es macht wegen der Steuerung nicht wirklich viel Spaß, zumindest nicht genug um nach einem Absturz wieder anzufangen.Das Geld kann man sich hier definitiv sparen. ---First try: Runtime Error while loading the first game. Second try: Runtime Error after 90 min.What I saw in this 90 minutes was not good enough, to give it a third try.Gameplay: No tutorial, you have to look everything up via google. The view is nice, but wheel at the small motorboat is not animated. You can't steer the big ship via keyboard (if you use shift + <- or -> it makes some senseless stuff. Or maybe it is right, I don't no anything about boats.)If you want to learn anything about boats, this is not the game you are looking for.If you want to waste money on a buggy game, just go ahead and buy it, or do what ever you want, I'm not your boss.

Sometimes it is fun to crash the ship and sink it, which is you are able to do.It has a demo, so you know what you are expecting.It is a little bit hard to control the ship, especially when your not in 360 view.Absolute fun, sometimes you get bored of it but you'll want to play it again very soon.

												 I want to love this game.  I've tried many times to spend some time with it.  It has some nice effects.  The graphics aren't all that bad for a simulator.  But...the controls are abysmal.  There is absolutely NO documentation on what the controls do or how to use them effectively, giving the player the impression that he would have had to have some real-life boating experience. (on a cruise ship no doubt). It is terribly hard to manouver and even if you understand the mechanics through the game of how to pilot a ship, the in-game controls just want to randomly not do what they did just a minute ago.  It's very easy to run-aground and with no easy in-game way to get you out of that situation you will have wasted real-life time (becasue there is no acceleration in time/or reversal for that matter) to either start over or curse the game for screwing you over and shutting it down, placing probably no further progress than you did the last time this happened.I mentioned the graphics.  While the environment is nice visually its very bland in detail.  It's nice to walk on a ship freely but not all areas are accessible and takes for ever to walk because there is no run.  There are no passengers or crew mobile or static anywhere, leaving you the only one.  The details in the helm is great, but except for the basic controls nothing can be interacted with.  Intercom: no. Wipers: no. Except for the rudder and the engine RPMs none of the gauges work leaving the screen GUI the only information you know.  The Radar and map are ok, but not interactive in the ship; only in a window.  And the Engine Screen stats are nothing but a .jpg.  Boring and very basic.As far as stability...FORGET ABOUT IT.  In windows 10 it just stops interacting with windows.  But it doesn't throw an event view error. It doesn't throw a dialog box stating it stopped responding.  IT JUST FREEZES.  Trying to alt-tab out of it during this doesn't work.  The screen doesn't change.  The start menu can't appear/task manager over the top because when this game crashes IT TAKES OVER THE SCREEN.  On the map in game there is a slider on the bottom right but I can't tell you what it does because it crashed when I tried to slide it.  Black screen. Sound of engine. CTRL-ALT-DEL to task manager which actually worked that time ...""end process"".  Or the time I completed the 1st greenpeace mission...CRASH.  That one actually took over when I hit continue.Like I said I really wanted to get into it.  Pilot your own vessel...WHY NOT??  After 5 years of owning this game and maybe getting 1% done with it (THERE ARE SO MANY SHIPS TO TRY) I for the life of my wonder WHY AM I STILL TRYING??  I give up and concede this game actually beat me.			"

												A bit unpolished.  Could use a bit more attention to simple details in order to maintain the suspension of disbelief.  In a simulator that is pretty important.  Tiny things can turn the entire scenario into a joke.  For example:I went through the tutorial mission and successfully moved some giant cargo ship into right location!  Hooray!  But then I was teleported somewhere else, to tow something with a tugboat.  Meanwhile, the giant cargo ship crashed into the bluffs somewhere else.  Very silly!  And when I was towing a tiny boat around with the tugboat, I kept running over and completely sinking it -- but that didn't fail the mission.  I just needed to tow it into the right location and I win!Also, the waves' animations were absolutely insanely broken -- and you've just got to get that right in a ship simulation.  That's the first thing to get right.All in all, not that great. "

												It could be that the game is good, but the support from ShipSim is very bad. When i bought the game i recieved my cd-keys. Then I started the game it says that the codes were invalid, so i wrote a mail to ShipSim, and the really don´t wanna help no-one. So i conclude that if you have any troubles with the game then just let it be, because you can´t get any help!			"

												For the purposes of this review, I'll be ignoring the things about this that make it a bad ""game"" and will instead focus on why it is a bad simulator.I'll preface by saying that I'm currently a cadet at a maritime academy, and from our own simulators and my experience with ship handling, this ""simulator"" is anything but. There is almost zero representation of hydrodynamic effects such as bank suction, squat, bow cushion, and everything else that makes steering a ship a lot more complicated than just ""make it go straight."" If these are in the game, I could not, for the life of me, reproduce them. I even went as far as to bring a VLCC within 20 feet of a bank going 16 kts, and still, absolutely no bank suction or squat to be found.In this ""simulator,"" you can steam your ship into Rotterdam harbor at 8 kts or 18 and it makes no difference. Why does it make no difference? Because it still just as simple as ""put the wheel in the middle if you want to go straight.""This lack of fundamental hydrodynamic effects not only takes the immersion out of it, but it also makes Ship Simulator Extremes absolutely worthless for those who are trying to actually use it as a simulator to refine our skills.I wish I could say that it would be a fun game otherwise, but its lack of a decent soundtrack, graphics, or fun missions makes it pretty abyssmal at that too. I would be more lenient if it didn't have ""simulator"" in its title, but as it stands, it does, and it is a terrible simulator of what actual ship handling is like.			"

												After a long time trying to figure out how to get the rest of the cd keys i finally got the rest of the code by extending the cd key code box from the right hand side as you pull along it slowly reveals the missing few numbers and letters once i got these i was then able to complete the loading of the game once i got the game going i found it a bit hard at first but i soon got the hang of it.Although it is slow and i bit difficult to figure out the controls to manouver the cruise ships as you need to try and avoid crashing into the quayside once on the way it is quite enjoyable manouvering your ships through the rivers to the open seas but once out into the seas and oceans it skips the ocean sailing and goes straight into the destination rivers which you then manouver your ship to your chosen destination cruise terminal,i would certainly reccommend this game to anyone, so go on get the game and test your skills see if you have got what it takes to be a captain of a luxury cruise liner happy sailing			"

												It is difficult to properly review this game because :1. the actual game is fun, I enjoy it...but2. I had great difficulty getting it to workThe demo worked perfectly but the actual game wouldn't start, I tried all the suggested fixes and eventually it worked. (http://steamcommunity.com/app/48800/discussions/0/35220315708393043/). However looking in the community hub it seems 50% of people who buy this game still can't actually play it. It is a risky purchase better suited for when there's a sale.The game itself is a lot of fun if you are into it. Be aware that it is a VERY slow-paced game.However overall it has a nice balance between relaxation, concentration and technical skill. It is also very challenging, where mastering the different ships is quite difficult because they each have different handling and steering. If you buy the collection you get a handful of campaigns, there's free-roam and singular missions to do. I'm only 4 hrs into the game but it is just as fun as I imagined it to be. I only wish it wasn't so difficult getting it to work.			"

												I'm a total head for simulators in general so this may be a bit biased, but I really like this game. If you have interest in the maritime trade world or like being at the helm of a boat/ship, you will probably appreciate this game too.I went to a maritime academy and although I was not a marine transportation student, I always had a deep appreciation for boating and the sea. This game satisfies that longing for being on the water when it's not exactly practical in your day to day life.The graphics are a little sad (and insanely demanding for some reason - poor optimization) but the gameplay feels more or less authentic, or certainly as close as you could get to piloting a mega ship from anything on Steam right now.Euro Ship Simulator looked promising but ended up being a disaster, and its spawn World Ship Simulator might be the worst thing ever created by mankind. This is probably your best bet of anything available on Steam for this category.The harbor maps are mostly accurate which adds to the experience quite a bit. It's definitely a non-jarring game and is relaxing, but you would have to be someone who is entertained by watching a ship move like molasses, and only making tiny adjustments every 15 minutes. Definitely not for everyone.Missions are varied enough. There are several types of ships and scenarios available, and physics seem realistic. I have a newfound respect for tug captains now.It would be great to see a really nicely made ship simulator on the store someday, but for now I recommend this for the maritime enthusiast.			"

I also play ""Trans Ocean"", which is a remake of ""Ports of Call"" seen from old players eyes, but Ship Simulator Extreme is running smooth and i like the large harbors and missions and the weather. There is none better sim yet for us boat people, so i recommend it to my friends.+++++			"

												It really sucks... Start the game, get to graphic options, set to 3840x2160 60HZ, uncheck 'run windowed'click save settings,  restart game, and it goes back to 3840x2160 24HZ. Reselect 4k at 60Hz, restart game, goes back to 24HZ.I must specify that every game i have runs in 60Hz and windows desktop is at 3840x2160 60hz too.I tried to play it in 24Hz anyway, select free roam, select a ship (used default), select a location (used default - new york) and go ! But the application crash and the game is not loading.Advoid this crap, even at 5$, it's probably OK on Windows XP but i think it was never updated to runs on today configs with Windows 10.Spent 3 hours to get it work, i'll delete it, it's only a waste of time and money.

												Out of the box, this game was broken.  After jumping through hoops, multiple installs on multiple machines, and other assorted troubleshooting, the problems were identified and worked around.The end result turned out to be worth the hassle.  It's actually quite fun piloting a big fishing rig down a narrow channel while being hounded by Greenpeace.  Trying to pull up along side a pier is harder than it sounds.  I'm two missions into the game but am enjoying it despite the installation debacle.For install notes:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/48800/discussions/0/864979455697985737/ "

												As a 5th year cadet of nautical unversity with an actual seafarer experience, can say with certainty, that this simulator is very plausible. Moreover it can be very helpful for those who are working as navigators and of course for those who are still studying. You can combine business with pleasure by playing this simulator. For all others it will seem boring and dull, so i wouldn't recommend even to try it. Go and play goat simulator guys!)			"

												Wouldn't run, games like this shouldnt even be put up on steam. Steam should refund all of us that wasted money on games like these, or better yet, contact the devs or whatever and get it fixed! I've seen plenty more games like this with horrible reviews, they should be removed from steam as well so others don't waste their money on them. FIX THE GAMES OR OFFER REFUNDS AND REMOVE THESE PIECES OFJUNK!!!! Also, in my opinion do NOT but sim games if they are not by Giants software, i highly recommend them over these lazy idiots.			"

												What a waste of money, I bought this game without first have read any reviews (stupid, should have done). After installing the game I had the same startup problems like most do, did some research and found some sort of a solution. It didn't help to resolve whole of the problem but at least it got me to startup the game.Now being able to run all pre-mission/gameplay functionality such as ""options, profile, choosing game type"" so basically everything eventually, 'except' launching of the actual gameplay itself. And I haven't found a way yet to surpass this issue. So I'm more or less as good as nowhere when it comes to solving this sh*t.. For example, I've abandoned EA's platform 'Origin' a while ago because of their arrogance and poor support for the PC gaming community. And lame market deals on games which should have come with all DLC included, whereas they actually still are being advertised and sold through their store this way without any notification what so ever. Only to find out they had the store taken down long ago!- Say whuuuuut??? Isn't this like pure theft legally? Just to highlight a brief example from a response back after a request for technical support regarding my DLC problems: ""the PC is a second hand gaming platform and had been abandoned for most of it.""So I decided to move to Steam as my gaming platform thinking this would be a trustworthy corporation. Not !!!!!-Selling a product without notifying the buyer that the product he's being sold in fact is broken or incomplete is theft Valve, and in most countries suable by law! (Not that € 14,99 euros is worth the effort, but it axplains a little about how easy this stuff is done to people without further consequences.)Anyway save your money for better developed games!!========UPDATE !!!========So.. I got it working by following these steps : ------------------------------------------------------------------1) Verify local content in Steam by 'right click' on ""Ship Simulator Extremes"" in your list of games.> select 'properties> select 'local files' in tab menu> select 'Verify integrity of game cache'.2) Download and run the x86 and x64 versions of C++ available here:http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=263473) Reboot system4) Run unregister.exe file found in here:C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Ship Simulator Extremes5) Start game=================================Anyway.. There are still some minor issues I encounter such as low framerate, glitchy textures and poor visual gfx that make this game of little satisfaction for me personally. ːplaneːBut.. It works for the moment!Hope this will help solve the issues for some of you as well !!			"

												Ship Simulator Extremes has run around. When Ship Simulator first started, the simulator was pretty cutting edge at the time of release. HThe graphics were good and the physics offered a challenge when navigating a vessel. Several years later, Extremes has not felt to have taken the simulator (game) any further. It felt like more features were written into legacy code and there were no improvements. Games are getting rather sophisticated in physics and graphics and a title like Ship Simulator should be keeping pace with that.The BAD:- Graphics compared to games now-a-days are lacking- The UI is faulty and needs a major overall- The game presents many bugs when trying to play on a newer machine (not made for the higher resolution displays)- Vessels handle in a very odd, unrealistic way.- Multi-player needs a lot of rework.The GOOD:- The idea behind the game- VStep (top knotch team I have worked with in the past)			"

												My computer is pretty darn good (built it myself), and the performance on this game is fair at best.  This simulator will run at about 30 frames per second when the planets align, usually doing about 15 or 20 (note:  for reference, my computer can run Kerbal Space Program at a solid 60 with all settings maxed).  Most of the ships are fairly well detailed, but their handling is extremely unrealistic in some cases.  Overall (and I can't believe I'm saying this...), look at the Metacritic score.  You decide.

												I bought the original boxed version of this sim, because I like the idea of a boating simulator.  However, I was disappointed by the limitations of how far you can sail the vessels. When they advertised that the EXTREMES version was going to be released, I was excited by the video clips showing whales under water, which lent to the idea that there might even be subs along with an entire world of waterways... WRONG!  I was hoping they'd take a few pages from the FLIGHT SIMULATOR handbook and do the entire planet (just the waterways and/or oceans) and let the users deside how far and where they're willing to sail. Leave it open for the third party devs to make new vessels and scenery!  Still loving the idea of this sim and the graphics for this one are pretty good... LOVE the OCEANA CRUISE SHIP, but after you've gotten the ship along its way and think you're going somewhere, it's over.  Multiplayer would be fantastic too!!!  Developers... someone please give us the rest of the planets water and more vessels to sail!  By the way... real world weather would be nice too. Unfortunately, this is a let down 'as is', but I do have hopes for expansions and upgrades to this sim if not an entire reboot.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicingBut seriously, I love this game! :D "

												I LOVE THIS GAME. Ok I need to stay one track here but when they say the game freezes its not that it does not work its because maby your computer is OLD or the computer is not ment to run that I have had it happen and when I got a new computer it worked fine so if it freezes dont think it does not work its mostly because the game need 4 to 6 RAM to run so if your computer does not have that much its mostly that and if it does and you have a bunch of games those use RAM too so remember that and I am out.

												Do NOT listen to the negative reviews. They know not what they say. The people who wrote those negative reviews are hardcore gamers who don't know what a SIMULATOR is. This game is a SIMULATOR. It SIMULATES actual nautical operations. The only action you'll find in this SIMULATOR are the Greenpeace missions, which is basically an approximation of what you see on Animal Planet's Whale Wars...only without the acid being thrown on decks or the legal troubles, yet still involving Japanese whalers in the Antarctic.For users of the previous editions of Ship SIMULATOR, the RMS Titanic did not make it in. Seems the MS Orient Star replaced it. But don't worry. There's still a crapload of cool ships to use.If you're wondering why the word ""SIMULATOR"" in all-caps, it's to drive home the point that this is NOT a game for hardcore gamers. Unless you're into causing massive maritime disasters for your own amusement, this is not the game for you. So hardcore gamers, go back to CoD, Halo, and TF2.As for simulator junkies, GET IT. Especially before October 6. The core game and all of its DLC, at time of writing, are 75% off. ALL OF THEM. Use this golden opportunity NOW!			"

Also please add the new version 2.0 for the simulator itself and, a month before 2.0 is out, the P&O Ferries Package. The following ships are: Pride of Kent, Spirit of France, move the Pride of Rotterdam into the package, Pride of Bruges, European Highlander, HSC Express*, and the European Seaway.Note: that little star at the end of the name ""HSC Express"" means that she's laid up in Scandinavia, but she can still be in the game.Plus, in any way, can you set the load of ships in stock?

												This game is both good and bad. It is good for its simulation aspects, somewhat educational, controls are accurate etc. Although there is no training, it is good for practise for those who study in maritime academies and such. And there is multiplayer. Though there aren't much people playing it but people who play are mostly doing rp and it can be quite enjoying. But for the other part, this game is bad. Campaign missions are bad. Physics are horribly bad. Optimisation and game performance is beyond terrible. You can't get more than 20-30 fps no matter how good your rig. And there is no reason for this frame drops, graphics aren't that good already.But I will give thumbsup for its simulation aspecs.			"

												 Very, Very wonderful. The ship gameplay is pretty, ""extreme"" considering that most of the larger boats only go 210 rpm! Meaning it is jam full pack of ""fast"" action fun. You sail out of the dock for about 20 minutes, then you encouter the bad guy, you stay there for about 30 seconds to convince him to not do what he is doing, then you go back to the bay, which takes about another 20 minutes, then you have to moor your boat. I may be sounding sarcastic, but it is a fun game.			"

												This game is an extreme boredom simulator.    The graphics DO NOT look that good. If you have heard otherwise ignore it.    I bought this game so that I could sink the ships in interesting ways, and to generally do captain of the high seas sort of things. But there is nothing to do. You drive the boat in a circle, or in a straight line to nowhere. The ships are devoid of all people. No crew. No passengers. The radio on the bridge is a loop of random radio sounding noises.     Buy something like Silent Hunter 3 for sinking ships and to generally get your ""Master and commander"" on.			"

												1st off: Ship Simulator Extremes works on most windows 10 computers, but still download the demo.Ship Simulator Extremes, it is a relatively easy to use Ship Simulator. It has a wide selection of boats, but I would recommend the collection to get some more interesting boats. It runs well on a standard pc at medium graphics in my opinion. The multiplayer lags every once and a while, but it runs well. There is a problem with a multiplayer. There are usually only people playing from 3am-3pm pacific standard time, But if you live in Europe, or the eastern side of the Americas, you could usually get someone to play with. The official serves are back up, but they do go out every once and a while, but you can make one by yourself very easily. The community is very helpful, and some times on a server, we role play and have to rescue a boat that has been beached, etc. We do this due to there not being any multiplayer scenarios. Another downside is that Vstep, the developer is not very active with improving the game, but they do still support the servers. If you do have any technical problems, you can probably ask them on the forum. The campaigns are decent but the missions take a long time, but if you like games where you have to just sit back and drive like train simulator 2015 or euro truck simulator 2, you will probably enjoy sailing around harbors, using a tug to tow cargo, or other large ships, or chasing a boat the has tried to evade customs, you will enjoy this game. One important thing to do is to download the demo and make sure it works on you computer, because it works on one of my computers and not the other. Overall I recommend this game if you like boats, but this sim does not include any military vessels, only police and customs are similar. That does bug me because they can be used as objects in the mission editor, but that is one of the only drawbacks.P.S. Some boats you can drive in the editor that are not shown anywhere in the rest of the game.			"

												This game was good, now it just seems to have stopped working, and beside that I'm having contacting the company for support. I went to the website, the only support is uer account, tried their link to the fourm, 404. If you have Windows 8 to Windows 10 you will either have no luck running the game or a very glitchy startup. I suggest staying clear till the company sorts out their system, and give a better support method, I've tried many repair guides but I cannot get it to work, on a 3rd gen i5, GTX 780, 8GB of RAM, this is unacceptable, shame.

												In short: Quite sure the developers put a lot of work in it, but the game is not worth its price.I bought the game because it looked like a lot of fun. I love simulator games. So I thought, why not try a ship simulator? I've read the reviews here before. Fairly devided. But after playing several hours I'd say the don't buyers are at the right end.Although the game seems realistic, and actually tries very hard, but it's far from it. I can sail at 90 degrees. You can crash without consequence. You can crash into smaller ships and you will stop whilewith your mass you should continue. It can't deal with great forces.But thats not the bad part, it's the fact that it's so incredibly boring and slow. Doing stuff tages ages and the there is no variaity in the game. Almost nothing happens.The good stuff is that they've tried hard to make it realistic and the developers have succeeded in several aspects. Such has the water looks quite awesome, the ship moves fairly realistic along with it and the steering feels like this is how it would be in real life.But all in all, don't buy.			"

												if you have a beefy windows 7 PC or laptop and you want to play a boat simulation game then this is the one for you. how ever if you have a medium good laptop or PC in windows 8 then you have some problems it crashes, lags like Fu** and freezes randomly. i know some Nerds may tell me that freezing and crahsing are almost the same thing, well this game makes them totaly different some times it freezes and you have to restart your Computor or sometimes it will without warning just completely shut down and nothing is said. I think that all it needs is to be remade (better graphics and  a few extra items) and windows 8 and 10 compatable. i have played a total of 3 hours on this game and 30 minutes of actual gameplay. so ONLY BUT WITHIN A SALE AND ONLY BUY IF YOUR COMPUTER MEETS ALL THE REQUIREMENTS!!!!hope this is helpfull.Spike Arrowsmith.P.s i recomend playing the demo to check that it runs :)			"

												I don't know what improvements Ship Simulator Extremes was supposed to add to Ship Simulator 2008, but I can't find them. As far as I can tell it is the exact same game with the same graphics. They added a few ships, but I think they removed at least one. This version is buggier and more resource intensive than it's predecessor. ShipSim 2008 came with quite a few scenarios, but Extremes only comes with 2 and you are apparently expected to purchase further scenarios if you want them. Also, in ShipSim 2008 there were AI controlled ships in free roaming mode, which made free roaming more interesting as you had to navigate around other traffic. As far as I've been able to find, Extremes has eliminated that feature.All in all, Ship Simulator Extremes seems to be a considerable downgrade from the previous game.			"

												I haven't played this for a while, but I do love ships, and this sim lets me play around with ships large and small.  It isn't a game as such, there are scenarios which give a variety of tasks to complete - not all of them terribly easy.  Some of the physics can go awry - towing the bulk gas tanker is one where having tugged too hard to get the big devil moving, I couldn't find the brakes (!), and it ended up pulling my tug backwards.  There is a lot in here to enjoy, though, if you have that kind of interest in things to do with ships - they don't behave like cars, or aeroplanes - everything goes quite slowly until that crucial monent when a turn or change of rudder or throttle has to be timed to the split second or there will be a bit of a disaster!  I find the level of immersion to be deep and most enjoyable - but I think it requires some research and quite a bit of understanding.  Parking the P and O cross channel ferry in Dover is an example - reverse parking is not everyone's forte.  It is possible. but even skippers with several years sea experience can find it unnerving.  If you don't want to have to persevere and reach an understanding of the physics and hydro dynamics maybe you won't enjoy this sim - but for me, it is by far the best out there at the moment.  I'd love to see a warship game with graphics and physics as good as this has.			"

												Got this in a recent Humble Bundle. Figured since I got the game might as well try it. Well, I got to say, it is not much of a simulator for ships. Also, when you crash into something nothing happens. I wanted to simulate capsizing, but no the stinking cruiseliner just deflected me like it had the higher armor ranking. Oh well.			"

												This simulator isn't the best sim I have played, the water textures are very low quality unless you turn them up which will severely reduce the performance and the maps are very small. For a game which is based on water, the water could be better.			"

												You might think that a game like this would run smoothly on your computer, considering the fact that it is a pretty old game. WRONG! I have a very hefty PC and this games FPS drops were unbelievably evident. The boats are extremely hard to use when you lag across the water, while the environment just makes it worse.This simulator was a FAIR idea, but it is not worth your time and money. Unless you like gray hair. Play this game if you want gray hair.			"

It can be a bit buggy too but overall I really enjoy playing it. It takes awhile to get the hang of steering different ships, some are much easier than others though, I'm far from perfect on any but have definitly improved which gives some satisfaction til I sink the next one ;)			"

												I haven't played this for a while, but I do love ships, and this sim lets me play around with ships large and small.  It isn't a game as such, there are scenarios which give a variety of tasks to complete - not all of them terribly easy.  Some of the physics can go awry - towing the bulk gas tanker is one where having tugged too hard to get the big devil moving, I couldn't find the brakes (!), and it ended up pulling my tug backwards.  There is a lot in here to enjoy, though, if you have that kind of interest in things to do with ships - they don't behave like cars, or aeroplanes - everything goes quite slowly until that crucial monent when a turn or change of rudder or throttle has to be timed to the split second or there will be a bit of a disaster!  I find the level of immersion to be deep and most enjoyable - but I think it requires some research and quite a bit of understanding.  Parking the P and O cross channel ferry in Dover is an example - reverse parking is not everyone's forte.  It is possible. but even skippers with several years sea experience can find it unnerving.  If you don't want to have to persevere and reach an understanding of the physics and hydro dynamics maybe you won't enjoy this sim - but for me, it is by far the best out there at the moment.  I'd love to see a warship game with graphics and physics as good as this has.			"

												Ever imagine what it would be like driving a cruise ship, or drive a small speedy speed boat, Ship Simulator extremes offers it all. To be fair, it is pretty realistic however if you want to imagine real life scenarios of your own on the game, most of the scenery does not allow you to do that as either the boat is too small and it doesn't line up. On the plus side though, it is a test of skill, logic, balls and not trying to sink your ship by being a irresponsible captain, unless you think you are the Captain of the Titanic, which in that case, maybe you can be excused.

												This game potentially offers so much in terms of satisfying graohics, variable sea and weather with a good choice of boats but ended up delivering a less than satisfying experience due to frequent crashes and freezes on a PC where everything else runs lovely.Another mistake, and as said by others before,  is the closed architecture and not having a ship editor/constructorthus being able to build your own ship models and perhaps scenery like the Flight Simulator series did.Without this ability for enthusiast users to create their own content the shelf life is limited.I tried really hard to love this game but it failed on reliability. Might be worth a go if it is cheap though!Uninstalled.			"

												I hesitate to review this game because I feel that to compain about it's quality would make it sound exciting and interesting. The graphics are crude beyond belief. Land masses are lumps with no shape or texture.  The  waterways are without detail. The controls are archaic and not well documented. It remindes me of the original Microsoft Flight Simulator on the TRS-80, except in color. It's just Drab, unimaginate, and primative. Not worth a free download			"

												this game is junk, a top of the line AMD video card can barely push 10FPS, the graphics look terrible, especialy the bridges of various ships just look plain boring and dull, with flat colours and cheap textures. Water effects looked good, except my computer cant run the game at max settings despite have an brand new graphics card.  Don't buy it, you will be sure to be disappointed.			"

												This is a Joke. VSTEP made this as a ""side project"" and never has fully unleased the potential of this Simulator. Their 2006 release was quite good except it was missing a few bits. In 2008 they made the next sequel. Finnaly they finished patching it up and I hoped they would expand it a bit more but it was playable. Now we have this ""ship simulator extremes"" but it's extreme failiure. Why show Ship enthusiasts one thing and then when you get it, it's not as amazing as the screenshots. It's quite under-developed. Sure the enviroment like the water looks better-ish but the same simple an basic ship simulation is in place, there is no complexity in this simulator. Some boats are missing sounds still. Worste of all VSTEP are truly control-live of this simulator, we cannot add our own mods to it, it's VSTEP or no improvement. Back in 2008 we were able to produce more realistic horns and radio chatter as well as lights. There is soo much more VSTEP could of done here but they are refusing to. If you are a True ship enthusiast, this is a blow to the head.			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did.  In concept it's awesome.  I didn't even mind having to play with video drivers and settings in order to keep it from crashing.  But once the game is running, it just seems like a halfhearted effort.  There's no collision or clipping with the shore, so if you are either psychotic or bad at the game and you run aground or ashore, you keep sailing right along.  Control mappings could be a lot better.  Graphically, they show you a number of different control systems, from single stick, dual stick, wheel and throttle, wheel and two throttles, etc.  But there's no keyboard mapping to those controls, you have to do everything by mouse.  Which can add to the immersion, if you put the view at the helm station and pretend that you're actually driving the ship.  At least during the day, at night, there's no backlighting of the controls or isntruments or other way to actually see anything.I really think this could have been a great game, it just needed more time in the oven			"

If you have Windows 8 to Windows 10 you will either have no luck running the game or a very glitchy startup.

You sail out of the dock for about 20 minutes, then you encouter the bad guy, you stay there for about 30 seconds to convince him to not do what he is doing, then you go back to the bay, which takes about another 20 minutes, then you have to moor your boat.

												I'm having a lot of fun with this. It's a little ""light"" on the simulation side. There's not a ton of ship gauges, controls, etc. You can get by on a lot of the ships just with a few keys for forward, steering left/right.  I don't think they factor in fuel either. (At least I haven't had fuel be an issue yet)It's open world to the point however large the map environment is you start in. So you can't for example start in New York and sail to Britain.  Some of the missions will auto-switch you to a new location when you end your waypoint; that is pretty cool. For full disclousre, I haven't played with the mission editor yet so I'm not sure if you could simulate a full ocean experience.I wish there was an option to randomize weather. I could take my various dice and roll I suppose if I wanted to randomize it to give me the experience. I haven't done all the missions/campaigns yet. I believe in those you'll get various weather.Wish that ships had people on them. Like passengers for the cruise ships or water taxis. I guess ideally if the developers had infinite resources,etc and if this had sold like crazy we'd have a wonderful open world ship simulator with crazy features. This isn't that by any means, but it still works for me overall.  It's scratched that itch that had me wanting to play some ships!			"

I've played the non-Steam version and that was buggy, going through reviews on Steam and it's more of the same. Held back from buying because of the bugs but decided what the heck, it's 8 bucks. Installed, crashes on start, expected that, was easy enough to fix.Game apparently doesn't install the redists properly, they're all located in the games install folder minus VC++ 2005.

												I don't really get all the hate for this game. If you like the idea of moving ships around fairly realistically, get this one, especially if it is on sale.The graphics are pretty much par for a simulator released in 2010.. not really pretty, but they get the job done. The ship and water physics are very well done. A big ship really feels like a big ship. They take a long time to get going, and a long time to stop. I was towing a huge container ship out of port, and mis-timed a turn. Nothing could stop the ship from slamming into the seawall. The water physics are equally as good. I was taking a speed boat for a whirl, when I came up next to an ocean liner at full clip.. THE WAKE ACTUALLY PULLS YOU IN TOWARDS THE BIGGER SHIP.. as I approached the bow, the bow wake flipped my little boat over without mercy... 10/10, would drown again..The missions are fairly varied, and can take 1-2 hours each. It is too bad that this game can't be modded, but there is enough content to keep you busy for awhile. If you are looking for realism, you will find it here.. it is FAR more realistic than the prettier, and moddable, Vehicle Simulator (a good title in its own right, just not realistic at all.)			"

												This game is pretty good when it comes to ships. But I found that the sinking physics and ports were not that good in this game as they were in Ship Simulator 2008. Ports- Too shallow big ships get grounded everywhere. Sinking- Better style of sinking such as from the bow and stern, but the way damage works in this game unlike 2008 it is based on speed instead of colision damage. So that means if you dont hit an iceburg head on at full spead your helath bar will only go down a little and not to the bottom which means your ship will not sink. I recommend Ship Simulator 2008 much more then this game but I really did like the selection of ships in this game unlike 2008. But its your choice which game you would rather play, choose wisley my friend.			"

I would compare it to a Sid Meier's Civ game in terms of playability however.Only fault is that the game is riddled with bugs, always has been. I've played the non-Steam version and that was buggy, going through reviews on Steam and it's more of the same. Held back from buying because of the bugs but decided what the heck, it's 8 bucks. Installed, crashes on start, expected that, was easy enough to fix.Game apparently doesn't install the redists properly, they're all located in the games install folder minus VC++ 2005. Install those, reboot and good to go.			"

												I like this game. It's a open-world simulator. I have the Collecters Version, and I love it! Many ship games I play are very Limited. But this one is very good!			"

												This game really feeds into my love for the sea and exploring it.  It is just so calming and relaxing to sail on the open sea and watch the scenary.  As fun as this game is, I do wish there was an updated version.  The graphics are poor, mechanics are glitchy, and the scenary just isn't as nice as it could've beenn.			"

												There are a huge variety of scenarios to be played.  Unfortunately must have a fast computer to truly feel free of glitches that come from the heavy graphics load on older computers.  Overall a fun and very unique sea going experience.			"

												Its a really good game, but it does get boring after 40 hours of gameplay, thats only if youre like me and dont do the career mode, it also has a great and fun multiplayer, but i hardly ever find anyone using it, but i do recommend this game			"

												Alot of people are complaining that questview is not working but they like most people weren't patient. Anyway this game is really good for a ship simulator.			"
