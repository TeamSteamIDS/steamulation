								Okay ... Im a Survial Horror fan, consider myself fairly seasoned to be honest, Ive seen a trend of these POV games, i.e. Slender, Scratchs etc. So, I figured what the heck right? Give this one a go. I gotta tell ya, Its scarey. THIS GAME IS *&$#@^* SCAREY! I didnt think it would be, I mean, Im from the Resident Evil (Old School Res not the new stuff), Silent Hill and Doom generation. I get sleepy durring the Exorcist, I love Horror, but its been dry for several years now. This game, is Epic, from a horror point of view. If you kill the lights, toss in some earbuds and put yourself into this game You .. Will .. get freaked out at least some what. I found a few parts that I was thining ""Okay, just ignore it, and move on"" ... then something ELSE would kick off. Its not all in your face either, some of it is subtly, some of it is straight sick, and the rest is just very, very well done. My hats off to this game and its devs, I think a lot of AAA developers out there need to take a look and pay attention to the details of a TRUE Haunting experience. If your like me and are a fan of Horror (not guts and slashers for eye candy sake), true  Horror, and if you have a little back knowledge i.e. Demonology, Paranormal Investigation, seen The Exorcist or the Conjuring, then you will LOVE this game.This is also the first review I have ever felt compelled to write on Steam, and I have been a member for years! Im sure its just one huge run on sentence, and my spelling sucks ... trust me I know, but the point remains the same, your reading this because you are interested in this game, and if you are interested, then stop waisting time and BUY it! You will not regret it and you wont be able to stop playing it .. except maybe to turn the lights back on if your that type of person ;P			"

								Paranormal is a great early access horror game. The only truely cliched part of the game is the story behind the haunting, but the majority of the scares are quite interesting, in my experience. I don't know why, but the game has received quite a lot of hate on the internet; much of which is from people who don't realize that the game is an alpha or people who want to look tough as though they're not scared. The majority of the horror of this game is from the terror of not knowing what will happen next, and when something does happen, it's often not what one expects. It's this type of horror that made games like the first 3 Silent Hill games so great. I reccomend it to anyone who can stomache the pre-release jitters and is a fan of horror.			"

								So, before I get blasted or you decide to skip this game because of my no to reccommending this game, let me explain.Paranormal is a good game, I enjoyed it, it was creepy, scary, it changes each time you play it but there is one reason I do not and will not reccomend this game to anyone and that is it's been in alpha for going on 3 years now, they were suppose to add a free DLC expansion to the game called ""The Town"" that they have yet to release and recently announced that they are instead re-doing the game in unreal engine 4, which sure looks nice, but has left alot of us feeling cheated.We paid for a game that was in progress because it looked good and were under the impression that within a year, year in a half we'd have a bad♥♥♥♥♥survival horror game that was complete. 3 years later and we are sitting here scratching our heads asking why it hasn't delivered yet, the game as is, is only worth $5.00, you will get through it in about 20 minutes tops, 30-40 minutes if you search each nook and cranny. So as of right now, no I wouldn't reccomend this game, in the future if they ever do release a ""completed"" version, that might change, but only once its complete.come on guys, 3 years........			"

								It's somewhat like that movie Paranormal Activity, but in the players perspective, so you get scared as how the ambient changes around you and you hear strange sounds. Game is not how I would describe it, it's more like an audio visual experience. The graphics and sound could be a lot better but it's not bad for an indie game that was recently launched on Greenlight and is still under some development.--------Portuguese translation:É tipo aquele filme Atividade Paranormal, só que é em perspectiva de primeira pessoa, pro jogador tomar sustos na medida dque as coisas vão se alterando à sua volta do nada e você ouve  ruídos estranhos, não é bem um ""jogo"", é uma experiência audiovisual. Os gráficos e sons poderiam ser bem melhores, mas nada ruim prum indie que foi recém lançado através do Greenlight e ainda está em desenvolvimento.			"

								Ok, two playthroughs in (died both times).  STUPID CREAPY GAME!!!   Forget the graphics, the atomosphere is where this game shines!   It made me jump a couple times but not from something jumping out in my face, it was what I couldnt see that spooked me.  The odd sounds, the items that moved on their own,  doors closing behind you, you are in a haunted house and it feels like it.  Very suspenseful but very short playthroughs. "

								Not a bad game, but not a great game either. It has a lot of potential, but would be better suited under the guidance of more experienced developers. These devs are so indie they're still in their teens. They have no sense of geometry either; so prepare to have a midget's viewpoint and explore oddly shaped rooms. The scares were good at times, but were otherwise silly and immature. I would recommend it only after the game reaches it's true final form, if that ever comes.			"

								This is one of the times that I with there was some another option other than yes or no when it came to recommending this game.  I personally like the IDEA of the gameplay and the concept, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that I love the general gameplay as it stands right now either.  Hopefully that'll make more sense as you continue to read my review, but let's get down to it.In terms of graphics, it actually looks pretty decent for an indie game.  I've seen some people saying that their computers couldn't handle it...but I've got a Nvidia Geforce 610 GT and I managed to run the game with just about everything on whilst also getting some pretty decent frames, so seeing as how this is a 'work in progress' I'm sure that subject to change...for the good or otherwise.  When it comes to the camera effects and the SFX and whatnot, I'd say that's mostly where the game shines at in terms of graphics.  The distortions are done pretty well, there's some haze if you try to look at something in the distance, and the colors even begin to seperate when it rains (I.E. the water causes the camera to see Red, Green, and Blue).  Now, all this being said, there are some flaws here and there.  Some examples would be some textures looking...a bit outdated/out of place, randomly changing pictures (And not in the good way either...as in the paintings seem to be actually changing into something completely different before my eyes at times.  If that's part of the game, then just shoot me a message, but I'm pretty sure I saw one of those Michael Jackson paintings literally morph into one of the bathroom paintings.) There are some things that I did kinda gripe about in the game that others might say was just me nitpicking, but personally they kinda stood out a lot.  For one thing the perspective of your character is...odd.  I feel like he's taller than the viewpoint may imply, as referenced by the furniture and whatnot, but whenever I attempted to interact with something I couldn't help but feel like I was incredibly short.  The rooms could have been a bit more interesting in my opinion, and the design of the house just felt...off.  Now the sound is one of the high points.  Listening to the game via my computer speakers doesn't do it enough justice, so I normally use my headphones when I play this game.  It does a fair job of immersing you into the game via sound, and it does help to make the game more atmospheric/scary.When it comes to gameplay, the premise of the game is pretty basic.  You go around the house and record the strange occurances that happen there, or don't happen as the case may be.  You've got your flashlight, and you've also actually got a time limit on how long you can stay up before you have to charge your camera.  If you don't make it back to your bedroom before the battery hits zero then you die.  You can go around the house and collect/read the letters left behind by the previous owner, as well as learn the history of the house via the laptop, or you can learn about our main character's background.  The story is nothing special at all.  It's actually your typical 'Haunted House' type plot.  I understand that the game is supposed to be, more or less, of an homage to Paranormal Activity, but the story could really have been a bit less cliched in my opinion.  Not that you're required to even figure out the story, as you could just play the game without ever picking up a single note.  The scares aren't very scary.  I jumped due to...well, jump-scares, but that's it.  I never felt real-deal fear while I played the game, and some of the scares just felt a bit forced and really typical for me.  I get that they're dynamic to help make the game stay fresh, but that only works if the game continues to scare you...that never really happened for me.This isn't going to affect my decision on how I'd rate this game, but if you came here with the expectation that the game would have fairly frequent updates...well, then you may want to look elsewhere.  As you could probably tell from the patch-notes about, the game hasn't been updated since April.  I don't currently know what the creator is doing as of right now, but I had heard that he has tried to fund the project through a website other than Kickstarter.  I currently don't know the name.Personally, I don't know if I'd recommend this game as it stands.  I liked the idea/concept of this game, and I'd very much like to see how much farther it'll go during development, but as it stands it's just an alright game to me.  It offers nothing new in the way of gameplay, story, or otherwise, but at the same time the premise of the game is pretty appealing to those who like to try out new things.***EDIT*** 7/1/15So I've checked this game every chance that I've gotten since the latest update on New Year's Eve, and...nothing.  No updates, no latest news, nothing.  As I've stated before, it's not a bad game and it shows promise...but what's the point of promise if it just doesn't deliver?Seriously, I've just about given up on the game at this point.  I could seriously care less about the game being converted to UE4.  Why not finish the UE3 version of the game first and work on the UE4 version second?  It'd certainly give us all something to do.

								When I first started playing Paranormal, I was instantly reminded of the Paranormal Activity film. You are the protaganist who is investigating the hauntings of his new residence using a camcorder. You have to walk around the house to pick up any unusual activity (believe me there is a lot!!!) and rest every now and again to ""charge"" the recorder. As you play through the game you are gradually introduced to the story of what had happened in the house with a host of jump scares to keep you busy. Playing this game alone and with headphones is highly recommended to get the full effect of the this ghost simulator and I can guarantee at least one spine tingling moment. It is a game where both the seen and unseen can play tricks with your mind.			"

								This early access explorational horror game has a lot of potential, with its promise of dynamic random gameplay; upcoming direct-X 11 graphics; and even future Oculus Rift support.  However at this current stage of development I find the game to be rather basic and generic, with its limited gameplay, controls, writing, and even audio and visuals.Unfortunately the biggest let down for me was the horror part of Paranormal. Perhaps it is just a case of me having been desensitised by years of playing survival horror games, but I find the scares on offer here to be rather dull – they are all just too clichéd and expected, with your usual “ghost appearing in the mirror for a second” and “water turning bloody” type fares.  Overall the game has left me unfrightened, and to be honest unimpressed.			"

								Maybe this is just me, but I find that I get more satisfaction from Indie titles nowadays. I remember greenlighting this way back thinking that it looked interesting. First of all, I find playing an Early Access game exciting. You get to watch a game be developed and in a way help it to be better. Now the gameplay. If you like movies like Paranormal Activity or The Blair Witch Project then you will enjoy it. Yes, you could call this game a gigantic cliche, but the developer loves the material so much that it is almost a reminder of why we love to be creeped out by this kind of stuff. As said, the game is a work in project. Graphics are dated (personally I like it that way) and will be updated, new content is being worked on, and the story is getting more fleshed out, but what is available now is worth playing. I am looking forward to watching this game come full circle.			"

								Paranormal is an early access game with a ton of potential. Basically a haunted house simulator, you get two versions of the game: 1 that's a short stand alone game 2 the bigger game still being worked on. Both have a fair amount of scares and enough storyline to keep an EA game interesting. Also the developer has been incredibly open to feedback and responsive to discussion posts. It's worth the purchase, but bare in mind it's a one man developing team and there are long periods of time between updates.			"

								First off, the game is ugly - let's just get that out of the way.  The story is paper-thin (basically, it really is just a haunted house).  There's minimal interaction or puzzles.  At one point, my game ended and I don't know why, exactly ... I saw a black silhouette and tried to interact, and I guess it killed me?Anyway, on a more positive note, it's quite effectively creepy.  I am a jaded, modern-day 20 something, and it still made me jump a couple times.  It's not amazing, by any stretch of imagination, but it's definitely worth giving it a little bit of your time on a dark note all by yourself.			"

								I downloaded this game and only played it for a couple of minutes... Now, I know what you might be thinking, ""How can you write a review with only a few MINUTES under your belt?!"" but hear me out! I've played my fair share of scary games. Outlast wasn't as bad as this. Random scary♥♥♥♥♥♥happened that made me uneasy. The ""I no longer want to play this game because I'm too much of a big crybaby ♥♥♥♥♥."" uneasy. The whole atmosphere was unsettling. I had to put the game down just to catch my breath. I'm totally going to play this game more and hopefully beat it. To all others, I highly reccomend this game! If you can handle it, that is.			"

								And now for the most biased review you will ever see. Paranormal is a dynamic haunting simulator set in the theme of found footage games. It is being treated with a great deal of love from it's creator, Matt Cohen. The game will scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. If you use the oculus rift, you will likely lose bowel control, and everything I am writing right now has nothing to do with the fact that I voice the main character Mattel Clark. Nope.

I have to say, it scared the ever loving **** out of me several times and I look forward to playing the finished product.  I would like to see an option for saving in the future, as it is not really the kind of game I could sit and play all the way through in one sitting.  There are definitely a few bugs that need to be worked out, but overall, a really great game and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to play a VERY scary game!			"

								its kinda good it is everytime new..always something else happens..i still dont have an idea whats the goal in it..surviving as long as you can i guess..you cant outrun sooner or later it will kill you..and it kills you randomly..after playing around 50 times i figured out you can survive longer if you run away as soon as u hear something in the near or by looking at the pictures which shows u if the ghost is near or not..but still..u can sometimes just walk up the stairs and it kills you by pushing you down..or it kills you while you sleep..sooner or later it kill you no matter what you do..which is kinda stupid cause a game which is not survivable and which has not really a goal..i dont know what to do with it. u cant beat the ghost/demon or whatever it is and u cant out of this house..but it has cool scare effects and everytime u play it its different. but still in slender you had the goal to collect 8 pages..but here..its not finish yet maybe it gets better when the developres are finish with it :)			"

								So about this game at his current state..Im a skeptic person if it omes with horror/haunting games i played a lot of them.but this is somthing els ,first of all : the time for eatch session varies from like 5 minuts to 15 minutes depending on how fast or how detailed you want to investigate the house and his secrets so yhea gameplay time is not that long but then again its about the bacground stuff that is going on .second of all : after what shall i say 20 to 30 minuts you sort a know how to trigger most of the events but trying to do so will get you spooked at least a few times :P  but then again its stil in early accas so this could be a realy cool thing third of all : if you loved paranormal acktivities then you will like this game a lot  and have fun with it just dont play or rush play true it. just take your time and try to be the guy behind the camara that is trying to proof his point.what would make this game even better is like that you see your self in a mirror :Dbut in overal a good game for the price that you have to pay grats to the developers  :P the got me jumpscared a few times :D			"

								The game is quite interesting. I found myself getting shivers down my spine while simply walking through a room. The general atmosphere and jump scares made it much more enjoyable than something like Slender or another generic game. Even though it is inspired by a terrible movie, it is enjoyable and unique. It's really hard to find good horror games these days and I'm glad I found this one. I made a let's play of it if anyone wants to watch:

								I get the chance to document strange occurrences in my house! Load downstairs in the studio, hear a strange noise, ghost walks past the door next to the kitchen, run in to the room and there's nothing there, get freaked out, go the kitchen and hear another strange noise. The game is a lot of fun with some sort-of jump scares. You know something is going to happen, you just don't know what or when. It's like a real haunted house. The only problem is the game is glitchy and lagging a bit but that's been explained in the game description. So I don't really see any problems with the game. Buy it!			"

								Before purchasing Paranormal please consider that it IS still early access, and the developing team consists of one guy with a full time job and like all of us, a social life, so the updates in the game may be a tad slower than other titles with larger development teams. Even with that being said I highly recomend you buy this game. Even early on in this stage of the game there is something about Paranormal that has grabbed me and wont let go. It's immersive atmosphere and subtle to downright terrifying scares has put it's mark on me, and believe you me, I am counting the days anxiously (but patiently) between updates.			"

								My biggest problem is the menu, which is buggy, hard to navigate, and has some incorrectly-cropped text areas. Aside from the  menu, though, it actually ends up being pretty scary for what looks like could be a 1-person UDK school project. Atmosphere is fantastic, and there are some scenarios that are exciting without relying on gore (the mannequin in the attic has so far been my favorite, or using the ouji board for the first time). The security camera videos you see when you go to sleep are pretty generic scare tactics and could definitely be improved (a mannequin slowly crawling the stairs into your bedroom, for example, would be a great idea). Definitely has potential. I'd enjoy working on a project like this, there's plenty of room for an expanding story/sequel/scares			"

								First look,Oke so i just bought the game today, just because i realy love Ghosley horror and dislike pure gore.so this game attrackted me enough after reading all about it on the comunity hub.At start up it had some little hick up's but after rebooting my system it started just fine. even with the knowledge that this game is still under development, my first opinion about the game menu is that 1, why is it starting in windowed mode 2, it looks kind of extreme simplefied and should be more kind of smooth than the game.I just love this kind of game trough the eye of the camera. just wishing that there would be some night vision lenses or thermal/cold signature lensesthe idea of recharging batterie's while sleeping is great. please keep it like this .. perhaps some more creepy scene's during sleep works best like in the movie paranormal activitie. You could even let your character start sleepwalking and do some creepy stuff in front of the camera. like staring at the wall like a zombie and talk with creepy voice.further on i hope to see some smoother graphics and perhaps some more stuff in the diffrent rooms. makeing it more like a house where someone could realy live.

								I'm a horror movie and game fanatic and keep trying to find good horror games that aren't simply ""jump-scare"" filled, but gradual building, easy-paced to make the progression of terror all the more effective. Paranormal was thankfully one of these games. I thoroughly appreciated how the haunting changed in sequence each time -even though there were several things I saw on a regular basis in most outcomes and very few times there were outcomes that never happened to me again. The environment and interaction is immersive, beautiful, and definitely eerie, making one feel progressively helpless, even if you begin to learn more about what you are being haunted by. Kinda sad ultimate ending (in the basement), not sure how many ""final""/""true"" endings there are, but it was still good. Controls were easy and comfortable, some discoveries were repetitive but still rewarding (as you didn't know what the next event would be) and the mannequin in the picture on the wall that got closer each time still continued to disturb me, no matter how many times I saw it.

								After the death of his dog, young Mattel Clark has decided to investigate his house to capture the paranormal events that have been occurring. The artist may have gotten more than he bargained for...With that creepy tagline out of the way, let's talk turkey here. Paranormal is a game inspired by the likes of The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, and Cloverfield. What it does is provide you with a startling haunted house-type simulator that offers jump scares and slowly simmering fear with a basic, perhaps shallow storyline that can vary in your playlength.My tips for best game play? Always play unabridged. You'll get more scares that way. I still haven't experienced every scare yet and as of now, I'm starting to become too paranoid to experience them all. Collecting all of the collectibles is also a near impossible feat and you will get a visit from the succubus if you are attempting it.Pros:- Offers varied scares- Game length can be short or long depending on your choices in game- Replayability- Bare bones storyline leaving you to investigate for clues- Developer is rebuilding the game and is active in sharing what's next for ParanormalCons:- Not your prettiest game- Storyline could use a little more structure- House layout can be confusing- There is no saveI don't scare easily and I'm not a fan of the ""camera footage horror"" film genres, but I did find the game enjoyable. If you're looking for combat or zombies, that's not here. You're at the mercy of the hauntings here and you're just recording it. There aren't any puzzles. You just walk around and watch the haunted house come to life. If you just want to be a little scared, this is probably the game for you.			"

								Pretty good game. I played the game before it was on steam and it has come a long way since. And to be completely honest, play the UE4 Tech Demo of this game (gives you the option to when you try to start the game) as it is MUCH MUCH MUCH better than the standalone game. By no means am i saying the standalone game is bad. Not in any way, but the graphics and gameplay on the ""tech demo"" is a lot better in my opinion. The graphics are abosutely gorgeous ( not exaggerated at all) and the gameplay and sound design are great. Really do reccomend this.

								There will be two reviews in one on this because of a previous version of the game and the Unreal remake of it.The previous version is very promising in terms of what the unreal version will produce. Despite the graphics, getting stuck randomly and the look of items and rooms the game was enjoyable. The story was good but due to getting stuck and jumpscares not always appearing or something stopping them the game was harder to complete.However, I have just completely playing the unreal version just now. Everything that gamers of the original game wanted is getting completely. Although updates are slower than other games, the updates are vast and add whole new details to the game. I appreciate that it now takes a little longer for the scares to start happening which I found enjoyable and likeable, to establish the setting and tension. Even with more scares, the game is really good. Things to work on are- The game rapidly drops in frame rate to 60fps down to 12 fps when I go near the fire or there is a lot of light even with light settings turned down- More scares (that’s coming)- When answering the phone, the camera battery would often die down very quickly meaning I would have to go to bed. The issue with this is that the audio continues playing and the protagonist continues talking in his sleep- The SD card capacity reaches full amount and then I don't know what to do with it- The subtitles at the introduction of the games start were too small and didn't notice them until mid-way through the whole speech.EDIT: The game now works with your microphone. You can speak to the demon terrorising you!!!!Other than that would 100% recommend while the game is cheaper and it is good to have an audience voice with a dev that cares.			"

								This game is buggy as all hell and has terrible graphics, but it is the most genuinely scary horror game I have ever played. Different things happened in each of my three attempts (glitched the first one, failed the second), but this game isn't just jump scares. You literally sweep the house about five times each ""day"" and scary♥♥♥♥♥♥leads to more scary♥♥♥♥♥♥that honestly sent chills down my spine through the whole thing. I've played Slender, and it does not compare at all. SCP Containment Breach manages to keep me on edge. This game takes the cake for terrifying. I got it 50% off with a badge cupon, but would've willingly paid the whole $10 had I known it would be this good. 10/10 I totally recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind a good 15 minutes of goosebumps per playthrough, and I can't wait to see how this game develops. Excellent job Matthew C. Cohen on this intense and wonderful game, I sincerely cannot wait to see what this game turns in to.			"

								*Whimper.... Shriek.... Cry*. That's usually the order I go in when playing Paranormal. Probably one of my favourite creepy horror games and I own a good few of those including the Amnesia games and Outlast. What I love about this game is how nothing is the same each time and all new hauntings after every sleep (and in my case after every quit while I get my heart rate to return to normal). Despite me muttering between shrieking and whimpering 'it's only a game it's only a game' and 'what the fudge was that?' I can get so immersed it's just like I'm there with Mattel. Fantastic creepy game I highly recommend it to anyone who likes their pants scared off them :)			"

								After the death of his dog, young Mattel Clark has decided to investigate his house to capture the paranormal events that have been occurring. The artist may have gotten more than he bargained for...With that creepy tagline out of the way, let's talk turkey here. Paranormal is a game inspired by the likes of The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, and Cloverfield. What it does is provide you with a startling haunted house-type simulator that offers jump scares and slowly simmering fear with a basic, perhaps shallow storyline that can vary in your playlength.My tips for best game play? Always play unabridged. You'll get more scares that way. I still haven't experienced every scare yet and as of now, I'm starting to become too paranoid to experience them all. Collecting all of the collectibles is also a near impossible feat and you will get a visit from the succubus if you are attempting it.Pros:- Offers varied scares- Game length can be short or long depending on your choices in game- Replayability- Bare bones storyline leaving you to investigate for clues- Developer is rebuilding the game and is active in sharing what's next for ParanormalCons:- Not your prettiest game- Storyline could use a little more structure- House layout can be confusing- There is no saveI don't scare easily and I'm not a fan of the ""camera footage horror"" film genres, but I did find the game enjoyable. If you're looking for combat or zombies, that's not here. You're at the mercy of the hauntings here and you're just recording it. There aren't any puzzles. You just walk around and watch the haunted house come to life. If you just want to be a little scared, this is probably the game for you.			"

								It's a budget unity game. The models are questionable, the soundfx quality is inconsistant and the script is just bad (the voice acting itself though is ok). Even with these flaws I have to say this is the best horror game I have ever played. Slowly walking down the stairs and suddenly realizing that the couch has been hovering a foot off the ground the whole time is the kind of shock you can't get in a movie or book.However everyone's fears are different so if you enjoyed movies like The Conjuring, Paranormal Activity, and Poltergiest you might want to play this game. If Halloween, Friday the 13, or even SAW are in your list of favorite horror movies then this possibly isn't a game you want to play			"

								For starters, I'd like to say this game has made me nearly pee-my-pants just from the music. This game truly brings out the fear of the supernatural, and its story really makes you feel like your deeply invested in the character and makes you want to solve the mystery. Now with those things being said, I'd like to add that this game is not complete, and it's latest update was a few months ago, I really hope they don't end up scrapping the game, it's suppost to have in total of 3 different areas to solve mysteries in, theres only one out right now. It has beautiful graphics, and a lot of jump scares and other parts that really are just creepy. The character model (i say that because Minor Spoiler: theres only one person you see) isnt that realistic, but it gets the point across and almost adds an old-fashioned scare (honostly I think the thing that scares me the most is the one character) and the graphic glitches in the game are expected (its still in beta.) If I was to rate this out of a 10 point system Id give it a 8/10 (as of right now) because it is genuanlly scary and makes you feel invested in the game, I just really hope they continue to update it, I hope this review was helpful.

								This game, in it's current state, is almost unplayable. The controls are hardly explained. The objective is unexplained. The fact that you die when your camera dies should probably also be mentioned. You just walk around the hosue clicking on random things until the game decides to throw a random event at you. Most of the time I wasn't even turned the right way to witness what was happening and missed it all together. The camera beeps at random moments, which I assume denotes something, but I can't be sure. Everything in this game is so horribly lo res and misshapen that you can hardly tell what you're supposed to be looking at. Except the phone. The phone looks fantastic. Glitches are all over the place. I blew up while walking up the stairs for some reason. Also, why is this guy surprised to be finding written notes on his counter and such? It appears that he's been living there for a lttile bit. Is he just now realizing that there is type written notes scattered about his house in plain sight?			"

								Though Paranormal does have its bugs and glitches here and there,  it is a really great game to play if you let yourself immerse in it.  I keep going back every couple months to see and try the game out again,  sometimes I still even come across  things I hadn't before. It is also a good game to play with friends who are also willing to let themselves to be scared.  This is my second favourite horror party game next to the original slenderman games.  Just hope that the updates keep coming and the support keeps growing.			"

								Day 1: I walk around. Says to myself ""Aww, this is nuthin"" Then I walk in the garage and hear a footstep noise. Uh oh, battery must be low. Walks into the living room and looks on the wall and in blood it says ""no"". I run upstairs and go into the bathroom for no reason. A bathroom can be scary right? I walk to the mirror and a baby face pops up. ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" Runs to bed.Day 2: I say ""This game isnt too scary. I played it a little. This time it will be better"". I start walking into the room under the basement and then a voice goes ""RAAHAHAH"" and I scream like a 2 year old and run into the kitchen. I look out the window to see nothing. I then turn around and see jeremy standing there. He didnt scare me too bad. I move out of the way and I go upstairs and I stop walking to look at the Michael Jackson painting and I hear foot steps. I then go to bed.Day: 3 I wake up and play the game. I beat it until I die from some weird ghost thing. I dont know how to get further ahead into the game. Please tell me how. Whenever I press a different chapter it loads then goes back to the title screen. Please help.Day: 4 I am playing with my friend at my house, so I wil be ok. We both keep saying ""were men! We wont get scared"" Five seconds later were screaming so loud that my dog thought I was being hurt /:We keep walking and BOOF theres jeremy in front of me.

								Paranormal - One of the greatest edge-of-your-seat horror games I have played. It's up there with Outlast. Paranormal takes on the elements and features (sounds, effects, visuals) as the Paranormal movie trilogy. It's your Blair Witch Project type of set up - found footage, you know the type. The plot is simple, you document paranormal activity in a house and try avoid being killed by enviromental and accidental mistakes. For isntance: You have to sleep to recharge your camera's battery. If you run out of juice before you get to bed, you will probably end up dead. The game also uses sound efx to set a scary atmosphere. Footsteps, doors closing, items breaking, shouting, crying, etc. Plus we cant leave out the roaring sound when something ""paranormal"" is about to happen. As for replayability, each experience is different. Objects are located in different places, things happen in some play throughs and don't in others. Over all, if your looking for a good scary game like slenderman or outlast, this is a good game to add to your horror game collection.			"

Walk around, hear noises, see symbols, go to bed...murdered by invisible force in the night. Well that sucked.Playthrough #2: Walked around, mannequins starting to freak me out, more noises, more symbols, go to bathroom...JESUS H. CHRIST WHAT WAS THAT? Face in the mirror.

								Well i dont really know where to start with this game other than to say that its very well made. My first impressions were that the game has some great visuals and sound quality is unmatched and having the unique quality of each playthrough being completely different matt definatly had a great idea when he set out to do this but altogether the game feels like a beta in some areas specifically how pressing certin buttons before you have control of youre carector can cause the game to freeze but those are minor and easily fixable as with any game that uses a randomizer you are faced with the issue of content becuase if you play any randomized game enough youre bound to see repeats and wile i can say matt definatly added a huge number of scenarios and events i have found a couple events reoccur a few times in the same order although this was rare the game holds a steady framerate and deffinatly likes to push youre buttons with controvecial topics once in a while but all in al my only complaint is that the game could use some more scenarios (he has announced that he plans to add hundreds more) but i have to say with how small of a map the game uses matt make ammazing use of it in horrific and facinating ways i enjoyed everyminute of that horrifying house and am quite impressed by the mind behind the game being so creative with the scenarios im very much looking forward to his next dlc for the game that will nearly triple the game content paranormal: the townoverall i must give this game a generous 8.8 out of 10 but only because matt dementous is very good at coustomer service by constantly helping out people and replying very fast to any technical issues "

								Within the first half an hour this game had made me curse loudly multiple times. A genuinly unnerving and terrifying game at times. Unlike any other horror game I have played thus far, offering something different to likes of Amnesia, F.E.A.R (not the third I hasten to add, the first one which was scary) and slender, the three games that really defined the horror genre for me.Obviously the game is inspired by films such as Paranormal Activity, but do not let that concept put you off. The concept of handheld camera footage and paranormal events occuring around the building translates exceptionally well to a game.Being an early access game, I am truly excited for what will come next for Paranormal.If you want you heart to race and to be unnerved whilst having a few excellent impromptu jumo scares along the way, look no further. At £6.99, this game is an absolute steal.			"

								After playing as much as i could at 2 am, I think this game is going to be an amazing horror game, however at its current state (which is to be expected as it is an early access title) the game does have a few bugs, (popping textures, resolution issues and random game crushes) However, the game did scare me with its random encounters, which i highly enjoy...after i calmed down, I *only* recommend people buy this game in its current state if people are aware of what early access means and want to try the game it. The game is worth the money and I cannot wait for the full release.			"

								Paranormal; a game that aims to scare you silly, is mostly just silly. Despite the games small and limited scope, your interactions with the enviroment are as simplistic as the randomized ""scares"" which seem to alternate between youtube screamers and the mundane levitation of furniture. After three or four years of development, Paranormal is as unpolished and unimpresive as any one man beta mod you can find for free on any site for any engine.			"

								It's a promising early access game, but at the moment it does not justify its price.Logically it is still too empty and incomplete (content speaking especially). It has some good atmosphere, sounds, some scare events are good - while some others are déjà-vu.Honestly, level design/scale could be better. Last update (a few months ago, 2nd december 2013) add some fixes and stuff, game runs better, ok... but the problem is the lack of content, like additional levels, maybe random rooms that could appear or not depending the playtrough, different endings, etc.I hope the final version of the game will justify its $9, and I hope I'll edit my review to say better things about it. Good luck dev!Edit: looks like the dev is working a lot on updating the game. Let's hope updates will come soon and become more regular.			"

								A ham-fisted attempt to capitalise on 'found footage' films that doesn't understand why most of them don't work.  You play as a guy in an unlikely apartment, who has noticed odd goings-on.  Through his camera, we then experience some weak and desparate jump scares.  It's Dear Esther without the beauty or meaning.The developer's willingness to engage and expand it is great, but it's a cul-de-sac, and he should probably spend his time on something new. "

Even though the graphics are not Beautiful this game litterly well scare you if you play. Although this game has yet to finish being made and there are bugs that have yet to be fixed it is worth it to see how this game well evolve and become better.

								An overall badly fumbled attempt to slap on hints of depth over a core of a shallow, boring waste of time.There are some good jump moments, but overall even for an early release I find the game clunky and underwhelming. I'd suggest waiting for a completed version, if it ever arises, or giving this one a pass.Maybe spooky for people who aren't good with art mannequins or really lazily ouija boards, but this reeks of trying to cash in on a current fad.I've had this game for over a year now and it's still nearly unplayable with a glitchy main menu and terrible in-game load issues, stock sound effects, and all around bad level design.

								This game is not scary or creepy like some other horror games.This game uses jump scare tactics that really get old.The only way it's going to scare you is, if you have your headphones turned up too loud, then the high pitched sounds will go off in your ears making you jump.Other than loud scretches the things that flash on screen or in front of you are normallya little delayed appearing way before the loud sounds.I had hope for a more errie direction and did not expect it to be just jump scares.A side from jump scares, I found myself running up and down the stairs just trying to trigger random events.Did not seem to be any objectives other than running all around your appartment trying to find things that popout at you.I would not expect to take this game serious.I would much rather recommend a game like outlast or amnesia.

								Paranormal is terribly ugly.as you can probably see, I didn't play much of it, probably not enough to get to the main parts of the game. But I've already encountered some annoying problems.First, as I stated, the visuals. Paranormal shows that a good engine doesn't mean good graphics ; the house is a huge mess. The furniture feels like it's been placed randomly, every single room is huge but is empty. This emptiness allows the player to easily guess whats is going to happen ; the easiest example are the dummies. They are randomly placed all over the main room, and  are going to gather around you at one time or another.Still about the dummies, they were supposed to fall when I went down the stairs. They didn't. I bumped into an invisible wall, had to wait for a while before the dummies fell and I could move again.Another visual problem is the head bobbing. I like head bobbing is first person games, but in Paranormal, the head bobbing feels like it's also controlled by the animations. Sometimes, the head will look at a particular point. I thought at first I was supposed to look at it, but no, it's just that sometimes, the hero feels like bowing his head, and suddenly getting it back up.The idea behind Paranormal is good. It makes me think of The House in Underhell, but with more potential. We need to know more about the house before it gets creepy, we need to really control what we are doing, and most important, we shouldn't know what is going to try to scare us.A lot of work is needed for this game to be good. Maybe later, it'll be interesting, but currently, it's a mess, in visuals, and gameplay.			"

								The scariest part of this is that someone thought making you walk SLOWWWWLY and fall over a lot for no apparent reason would be scary (as opposed just somewhere between frustrating and hilarious)Mind you - given the state of the carpets...It also crashes a fair bit - unless ""you cannot move and any attempt to interact causes the game to end"" is deliberate?

								The maker of this game is a damned mastermind of scaring the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. I was expecting something similar to outlast, but even in alpha Paranormal has every single hair on my body standing on end. If you are questioning if it is worth the $10; it definately is. I can not wait for more updates so this game can keep me up at night freaking out at the smallest noises in my house. I'm pretty sure I will never be able to leave my phone on vibrate again because of this (unfinished) masterpiece. Very astounding job on this game, keep up the awesome work.			"

								This game will probably scare you. It's scary on a lot of levels. It's scary because of the things you see. It's scary because of the things you don't see. It's also scary because of the things you hear. The story itself is kind of mysterious, and given to us via objects we find around us. It's not overly deep, but this is perfect! Good for replay as each play is different. Please keep in mind this game is an early access title, currently still in Alpha. Not everything is running, but the game does play rather well. There are glitches here and there as to be expected, so if getting to play a game in it's early stages is not your thing...you might wait for the finished version. If that kind of thing excites you, and you're a fan of horror games, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. I did happen to get my copy at a discount, but I think it's worth the ten dollars, and will certainly be worth it once the game is finished.			"

								Honestly, I hated the movies that just have the camera shooting around everywhere and I was never scared of any of the Paranormal activity movies, but hot damn is this one great exception. You know how Left 4 Dead said that new things would happen when you play, well you actually notice the difference here. I remember waking up one time and the guy's dead dog was next to me, and when I walked downstairs to see the chalkboard it said, ""Nice Dog"", taunting me. I really can't wait for this game to be fully finished, because honestly if these people keep making games like this they can count on me to keep supporting them, they trully have earned my loyalty.

								Paranormal, this game is amazing. It always keeps you on your feet. You happen to be a man named Marcus, trying to film strange happenings inside his house to have documented proof of the paranormal, however, he doesn't realize what is really in store for him. Only equipped with a camera and flashlight you traverse his house looking for clues and proof of the other side, when your camera starts to die you go to sleep and begin a new night and every new night has new hauntings in store for you. Every haunting is different from the next it is suggested you play in the dark with the volume turned up for the best experience. I recommend giving this game a shot, even made me a little spooked not to long into it, so if you are looking for a scare or just want to experience a beautifully made game check it out!			"

								The last time I played this game it was a UDK (UE3) version and had a lot of bugs that just broke the game and the bug persisted every subsequent launch of the game. My wife and I liked the idea of the game and it was fun for a while until the bugs started to pile up on us.UE4 is out and is now available for free much like the UDK distribution model. From the sounds of it either it's being converted from UDK to UE4 or had been converted fully. Either way I really hope that a lot of these game breaking bugs got fixed because what I have played already before it totally crapped out was fun and spooky.Until I play the updated version however I can not promote it much more then I already have.

								Paranormal is something I highly recommend people to try if horror is your thing. The random generation in the game for hauntings is amazing, and is only going to get better. Don't knock it because it is still in early access, its got enough to entertain you, and will keep getting more and more to keep you entertained. The found-footage style this game gets from things like Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project is a unique take on gameplay, and something I've only seen paranormal do.			"

Simply amazing game and the fact that he is making more and more content and updates makes it even more awesome.			"

I do not recomend this game, it looks like it can be a great game...but its just broken, i play a lot of early access games and can deal with glitches...but this is too much even for me. if you are having doubts about getting this game, dont buy it....if you have a fairly new graphics card, dont buy it....wait until the game is at a beta stage....even an alpha stage, this game is unplayable as it is today 28/04/2014			"

								I don't want to be rude. I know it's one guy and all, but this is ridiculous. It's been in early access for over 4 years and is absolutely no closer to being completed now than it was in the beginning. I just reinstalled it to check it out again after a long absense, and there's a new version of the game in Unreal that looks a lot better than the old version, but I keep crashing before anything scary happens.The current version doesn't seem to have any of the story in it, which the old version did have, but maybe I just can't get there due to crashing.  The old version also had an excellerated game option, where if you didn't want to start the game with a bunch of days where nothing happens you could do that. The new version doesn't have this.It's far past time for this game to have had some real progress made towards completion. I'm a generous person and harbor no ill will to the developer and will gladly change this review if progress is made. I don't even care about the fact that I spent money on it, I just want other people to know that they are in for mess if they buy this game at the current time.			"

								It's hard for me to find a horror game that I can easily give a 10/10. There's many reasons:1. Repetition - example: Slender - Same thing over and over.2. Frustration - example: Amnesia - So much dying and 30 minute puzzles.3. No replay value - example: One Late Night - The same experience every time you play.All these were great games, but for the reasons listed they lost appeal. In my opinion, a horror game should constantly suprise you with every playthrough, completely immerse you in the enviornment with intriguing sounds and visuals, have a good story and plot, and be simple in mechanics, hud, and objectives.Paranormal did all those things and then some. It's barely in alpha and it's already my favorite horror game. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. 10/10			"

								I tried to capture the paranormal on my camcorder and all I got was 30 minutes of buyers remorse.The game has always claimed to never play the same way twice, and yet I have yet to see a single playthrough that wasn't a complete silhouette of my first. There is no suspense or subtlety, only jump-scares. From the very first minutes of the very first day you can find levitating or moving objects, tryhard creepy posing-doll figures, and a whole bunch of hollow trope appearances. It really feels like the game is constantly rolling an RNG and randomly fires off a 'spooky' happening from a small list, and by the time your preset death occurs you will have likely seen the whole list. Some of the startle-scares try so hard that it actually becomes laughable, one of which is literally just a posing-doll ornament that just slides in under your view like a motion-tween HUD element, and then slides away again, without explanation or reaction from the character. Yeah. It's that kind of game.I would have ADORED a game of genuine paranormal exposure and investigation in an enclosed space, but this is not that game it claims to be. I'm pretty sure the only kind of person that would enjoy this game is the kind of person that thinks a 'screamer' is 'horror'. Worse yet that a kickstarter was put up for a second area (yes, a second zone, in the first game) before the first area was even finished, and OH LOOK, it's STILL in early access!Save your money. Watch a youtube lets play, and then you will have seen it all.Don't believe me? Watch a few lets plays and see exactly how many differences you can find. You'll be able to count them on one hand.

								Orginal version review, not the ""new""  engine version:  I'd give it a nuetral rating if I could. However it's practically unplayable for me. I have tried various times to beat the game but every play through I encounter a bug where I get frozen in place while the camera energy drains. I can still move the mouse while it drains too.  One tme it was during reading a note and it woul;dn't let me put the note down, another time i just got stuck in place, thought it was a triggered haunting but nope, stuck sitting there watching the battery drain. Also the menus are buggy and almost unworkable taking several clicks to get through them.To be fair when the game is working (up untill the bug hits freezing you)  it's spooky, creepy, and will have you your on the edge of your seat with your nerves shot. The voice acting is decent, the graphics pretty good despite the grain effect giving me a headache, not the devs fault though. I'm just one of those people that get headaches from film grain so no points loss there. The music is nerve racking. New Unreal version: The house is different, which is pretty cool, the batteries drain quicker which kind of sucks.There is a ""day"" phase and a night phase and the hauntings a bit  different which is cool. There is a bigger outside area to explroe compared to the orginal version with notable land marks to find while exploring.The haunts seem to occur less frequently but it is an unfinished version and the dev is working to add more to it. Visually it is beautiful compared to orginal version which still looked pretty good. Just there is a very notable difference. Also player character dude plays chaotic neutral char in d&d the alingment of jerks trying to justify being able to do anything for any reason >.>  "

								This is my first early access purchase. I hate that I spent ten bucks for this game. It should be a free demo. Some have waited two years to receive a playable update (very limited). I've seen better looking games on sega cd. The design and graphics are boring. I don't see what the hype is about this game. Steam should start up a school for marketing. I still can't believe how many positive reviews there are for this game. Has anyone played this game for over an hour? I would much rather have paid someone 10 dollars to kick me in the balls than purchase this game.			"

								My playthrough experience:Sometimes a thing is in a window. Other times it's not. Then a thing moves, but like it shouldn't, so I guess that's sort of weird. Then you can't hit escape to use the menu so that's really spooky.Occasionally the ghost/s commit a serious decorating faux pas and put chairs on tables, and you get a sick recording of it for youtube. Then they leave mean messages on your wall in blood, but I mean what the h*ck are they gonna do, put a jpeg on my bathroom mirror?My god. There's a jpeg. On the bathroom mirror. Those conniving ♥♥♥♥ing puppets probably did this. One of 'em probably taped it up there when I was being bullied by the world's shortest human fence. Gonna call up their ghost momma on the ouija board, see if we can't get this bullpoop sorted out. Oh no, the board told me to die. Well geeze I guess I see where these wooden hooligans get their manners from.In summary, if you like the movie Paranormal Activity, then you have brain problems but I guess you'd also like this? Otherwise it's a real snoozefest. I mean maybe the other two scenarios involve more menace and originality than the base one, but I doubt it.Also man is it easy to break.			"

								Hi fellow steamers This game would be good if it was working ive played the game three times now and each time the games has ♥♥♥♥ed itself some how. After reading a diary page it wont go away its just stuck ther and no save opinion so i exit the game and try again attempt two one hour ish into the game and o o look at that...its happend again. Ok third attempt three is the lucky number i should be fine right:) (WRONG) i tryed to pause as i was going to make coffee and escape dident bring up any menu pause-break key works ok so i got my coffee ecsape key still does not work but pause break works ok.Look another page dont think ive read that one after reading page imagine that its happend again ahhhh i dident see that comeing if it was working it would be a below average game. Its not the least bit scary but has jump scares things happen to way to frequently every two seconds you will hear a nose it really runs the atmosfeer with so much happening at once if they wanted to do that they should have made a larger house then they would have pulled it off. what i shame i really wanted to like this game but it sucks if your after horror look away if you after jump scares this mabye the game for you if you dont get stuck and need to ctrl alt delete your way out the game several times. My verdict (4/10) ther are better horror games out ther i got this game about a year ago havent had chance to play it untill now all that time i thought bugs like this would have been ironed out but im guessing this game is no longer being worked on as it is so♥♥♥♥♥♥ Avoid it but if you want a shity game go ahead and waste your money i dont care its not my money i have all ready paid for this♥♥♥♥♥♥if your after a good horror game get your self silent hill 1-3 silent hill the room resident evil 1-3 resident evil 4 is superb but its not really a horrorsystemshock bioshock 1-2 daylight condemned not condemned 2 thats♥♥♥♥♥♥slender man amnesia pernobra ther is so meany OOoOooO if you like horror games and you dont no any tittles but want to play them fell free to ask me ill be more then happy to help			"

								DO NOT buy this if you're looking for a horror game. This game is the best game for all the wrong reasons. It is perhaps the worst coded game I've ever played, with getting stuck, accessing things only at certain distances/angles, and just straight up crashes. That being said, I can forgive it, because it was 6 hours of a great time with my buddy playing it. It's one of those 'the spoopy is out to get you' sort of things, and if you want to get into a horror atmosphere, look elsewhere. Just get into the mindset that this game is amusing, mock it with a friend, and it's great. The laughter was easily worth the low price, but if I were looking for a horror game, go something more mainstream.			"

								There are ways that you could spend your time that are much worse than playing Paranormal. It's a fairly good indie game, and it's pretty challenging to figure out each puzzle. You always have X amount of time to figure certain things out. The scares are good, the soundtrack is some great dark ambient music that I wouldn't mind just having on a disk, and the letters you find are pretty interesting. The graphics, even for an indie game using the Unreal engine, are a bit dated. I don't know how long this game has been in development, but the overall layout for the game is basically one map, if you remember the heyday of playing Unreal Tournament in the ""Giant room"" maps - it comes across a lot like that, though a bit less cartoony. The use of wooden figures throughout the game is done pretty well, too - as someone who has used these to do different poses in order to gain a certain degree of perspective from different angles, I have thought more than once about the creepy factor that they represent. Their utility in this game is as a tool to make you creeped-out. That seems to be the focus here, a skin-crawling feeling that is drawn out, less of a jump scare horror game. It plays out like you would expect a haunting to play out, if you believe in that sort of thing. This is one of those horror games that in order to become immersed, you really should turn out the lights and make things as dark as possible. The game's pacing is also almost unbearably slow, but that's a common complaint for almost any game in this genre. In short: Not bad. 6/10 - The price gets a point knocked off. I'm not saying it's a regretable purchase, I'm just saying it's a bit expensive for what it is. If you can obtain the game in a bundle, do so, you will be doing yourself a favor.			"

								In 'Paranormal' you play as an artist who has rented their own personal studio where they can work on their art without being disturbed. But then you start to notice you may not be alone in the studio, no one believes you, so you decide to try and collect 'evidence'.You don't actually collect evidence, but the developer uses it as an excuse to make your point of view through a fuzzy, crappy, pixelated video recorder that no one should have any business owning in 2015.The entire game involves you wandering around your studio, trying to find proof the house is haunted. As you spend more time in the studio, you'll find little tidbits of information that help you slowly understand the haunting and the story behind it.The studio is crampt and small, making exploring the house a very short affair. What is supposed to attract you is all of the paranormal activity happening in the studio. The game boasts re-play-ability by having 'randomly generated' events happen. The issue is, after the first or second play through, there isn't really anything random about it, the events that happen are so few and varied you may very well start seeing the same thing happen during the first play through.Obviously, since this game is in Early Access, it's unpolished. But I wouldn't even use that word with this title. The last time I played it, the game had parts of game play elements that were scrapped, but never removed, the game had two title screens, one of which doesn't work or save any of your options properly.If you want to believe what the author says on the game's forums here, you'd be lead to believe not only has he fixed several bugs, added in new content and added in a demo for the Unreal Engine 4 remake, but I didn't see any of that. Why? Because right after the title screen the game locks up every, single time. This isn't an issue of my hardware, I got a great set-up that plays current gen titles just fine. The issue is with the developer, his programming and his progress with the title. At this point, I just consider this lost money. If the author reads this, I wouldn't mind you buying a game for me from my wish list to make up for the worthless garbage you sold me.			"

I think all the thumbs up are by the creators.  -The graphics are horrid on a top of the line machine with everything up as far as it goes-While walking it randomly does some kind of motion to simulate something (no clue what) and makes me want to throw up.  Not fun.-You are eye level with the kitchen counter and dining room tables like you are 5 years old-its not even a little creepy in the 14 minutes I played before stopping to keep from throwing up due to motion sickness from the random camera bobbles -14 minutes in and I am fairly sure I will just uninstall this and figure I wasted $10-no the fact that it is pre release does not give me any need to check it out again laterI really liked Slender the Arrival, the first Amnesia, and Day Light.

Toggle buttons don't work, often crashes the game. Voice acting and all that are good, just needs tweaks that could make this game work really well.

								the game looked cool on youtube, but i have a macbook os x 10.9.4 and the game takes about 5 min to load (long time for a game to load) and the game itself is like 1 frame per 15 seconds (super slow). I really looked forward to playing this game for a long time except that the game is slow and takes long to load. Also my last commplaint is that once it finally loads, the game menu looks very very sloppy, what i mean is like the letters in the menu look terrible and the mouse is also slow. so, i dont really care about the sloppy menu, but i care that the game takes a long time to load and is very slow once it loads, so it was a real dissapointment and i feel like i wasted $10 and i feel ripped off. I also understand that this game is still an early access game so that it has a lot of updates ahead, so i just wanted to say that in the next couple of updates that you will update it to make it faster and make it load faster. So I dont recommend this game... for now.			"

								I will amend my review later if this game improves, but as it stands now, I can't recommend spending any money on it.  I don't understand what is going on in this game.  You can't tell which objects you can manipulate and which you can't, so it is just a blind click fest.  I don't know what my objective is.  Am I just trying to survive a set number of days?  Do I need to solve a mystery?  Why do I die if my camera battery runs out?  I feel like I'm supposed to be following clues, but nothing seems to lead anywhere.  If I see Good Dog scrawled on the whiteboard, then I go to my dog's grave, nothing happens.  If Basement is scrawled on the floor in blood, the damn door is locked.  Yes, I can't even get into the basement of my own house unless the random time is right for me to go down there.  This game is just a complete incoherent mess at this point.			"
