												Will be making this review a bit fatter soon! Just wanted to get my opinion out there and I'll write it out tomorrow :PGood:- One of the more ""real"" simulators that I've played- Starting up is great! Everyone I could imagine an actual bus drive would need! Just remember all the numbers or remember to write them down beforehand :PBad:- The controls are complex - Don't know how to reverse - there is no shortcut when looking at the screen thing - makes me want a touch screen monitor :L- The default steering requires a lot of effort to make sure you don't crash			"

												This is a pretty good game, It has some down sides to it though, graphics could use a little worrk and the physics are the usual german simulator ones. Unlike OMSI You can't really push many buttons, but people do get on the bus! There are only 2 busses in this game a normal city bus and a bendy bus. I recomend this game for people who like casual simulators and arent looking for the ARMA of bus simulators. 4/5			"

												Oh my god...OH MY GOD! WHY?...WHYYYY??!?! What is WRONG with the transit system in Germany?? You got cars cutting you off, pedestrians walking back and forth IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROSSWALK, and cars jumping one another...IT'S PANDAMONIUM!! Don't believe the videos you see about playing this game. It has bugs up the whazoo, and I seem to be the ONLY PERSON ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH that this happens to. The biggest one so far is that people who get on the bus just...stop. Right at the entrance. You know the spot. The one where the bus driver won't drive because it's a danger zone? And you think it's because maybe the bus is full. Well, la dee da, I look at the rearview mirror...I CAN COUNT ON ALL MY HANDS THE NUMBER OF EMPTY SEATS!!!ARHRHRJRHRJGRHJERGHRJGR MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE!! If they stand in the way, people can't get on the bus, which means I get docked, which means I can't GO ANYWHERE! Sure, alright, I suppose the terrain looks nice and it's kinda nice to hear a german lady voice saying the next stop, but that is COMPLETELY OVERSHADOWED BY THE PROBLEMS IN THIS GAME! Alright, so maybe Expert is too hard. Fine. So I go beginner. I DIDN'T THINK IT MEANT EVERYONE IN THE GAME WAS AN IDIOT! Like I mean, for serious, traffic is gridlocked...GRIDLOCKED...because the bus driver in front doesn't know the difference between a stationary car in traffic AND A PARKED CAR! And there's nothing in the game to fix itself. I actually put my bus in park, locked the cash register, stepped out of my vehicle, and went on a sight seeing trip. For like 5 blocks...both ways. It wasn't until I came back that I noticed this...convention of vehicles, and all because of this one idiot driver. ARE YOU FREAKIN' KIDDING ME?!  Stay away. Stay all the hell away. There are better things to spend your time and money on, especially on Steam. The developers need to seriously fix this...like NOW! I'm enraged because I was passionate about this. I managed to finish ONE scheduled route, and I had a blast. The fifteen I did after? Trainwreck- sorry, Buswreck.  Seriously guys. Playtest, beta test, alpha test, hell, even test the ai and framework before you put this out there. Some of us actually like the idea of a bus simulator.			"

												I played only 25minutes in this game and I must say.  It is the most impressive, hardest and coolest simulator ever created.The graphics are not amazing, but graphics do not make a game.The sound is all decent and spot on with no complaints.The controls are the trickiest to get used too... Then again you are playing a simulator.  It sometimes has multiple keys to press just to do something, like disabling the break is like a 3 key press system, but I liked it.I only played a very small amount of time because I just wanted to test and see what it was like, and even though it seems boring, if you love a proper simulator where it is over complicated, writing down your ID and PW to log into bus, sorting the money, doing the air conditioning, closing doors and windows, all while driving then this game will have you impressed.  I am impressed that EVERYTHING on the bus can be controlled and turned and used, and well done to the game.It is on sale which is a massive steal for this game and well done to the Devs for making it.Great game, great fun for simulation fans.

												I would guess that this game appeals to the hardcore simualator gamers as it is in depth and complex, very detailed.However, the tutorial is lacking quite a bit, or I'm daft, in either case it took me ages to get the frigging bus out of the garage. Trying to use my Wheel along with the game was a drag since there ain't no sensitivity adjustment so that has to be set in windows.If you are going to play this, I'd recommend watching a youtube tutorial beforehand.If you get past the initial stage I'd guess that it has value, on the simulator department, but make no mistake, this ain't no Euro Truck Simulator 2, which I found was very easy to get into and had a good level of simulator vs intuitive gameplay.My 2 cents.

												Imagine shooting up heroin whilst riding a roller-coaster made of crystalline excitement which is going through gargantuan hoops of fire over a swamp infested with three-headed sharks which have lasers for eyes and chainsaws for fins. That is exactly what Bus Simulator 2012 is not like.You are initially offered a choice between two settings, ""Beginner"" or ""Expert"". Beginner mode is essentially expert mode with more prompts and sunny weather. Even on the beginner setting there is a steep learning curve, I ended up watching tutorials online and consulting the manual due to the inadequacy of the limited in-game prompts and lack of help features.On the plus side the simulation is incredibly in-depth. Every single button on the bus is functional, including for example, all the switches for the blinds, windows, roof hatches, door locks and suite of climate controls. You also have the capability to fine-tune many aspects of the bus including brake and steering behavior, such as the brake speed and delay.The environment and its dynamic effects also add to the sense of realism. For example, if you have the heating on when it's raining outside the windows can fog up; this can be remedied by turning the air circulator to the defrost position. What's even more realistic is everyone whinges about the rain as they get on. On the downside, there are only 2 bus models (articulated and standard) to choose from which I found to be a bit of a let down. Perhaps a better game title would be ""Very-specialised-urban-area-of-Germany-Two-Buses-Simulator 2012"". The game-world is expansive and has a great level of detail. I really felt like a bus driver in Germany which was mildly depressing. The only thing which detracts from this sense of immersion is the handful of minor AI bugs, but they are rare. Occasionally when turning a tight corner a car will ram into you from behind which is annoying. On the other hand, it's quite amusing to see an overturned AI bus  - it makes you feel a bit better about your driving abilities. Overall graphics are average to decent but require abnormally high specs. It seems far too taxing but it's still playable on lower settings. The current price of $9.99 seems about right considering the simulation is very in-depth but the game feels unfinished in some areas.If you think you will find no enjoyment in driving a simulated bus for an hour then obviously don't buy it, otherwise give it a shot.Overall: 6.5/10 "

												Giving this game a 1/10. When I first started the game I walked to the garage as normal. I opened the door and went in. I saw a place where I could change the bus type (warning: there is only one bus type in the game.) I switched to articulated only to have the game crash, so I just stayed with regular. Once I got in the bus I was given instructions to get the bus started. I followed those instructions and got going. Now, once I was on the road I made a right turn, but since I was in beginner mode, I turned too far and crashed into a tree. Getting back on the road wasn't a problem, except for warnings coming up every 1 second saying to lower the engine rpm rate. Back on the road I continued driving. Later, I crashed into a car, so I went around it. But later after that I crash again, this time so hard I get myself wedged. So I had to reset the bus back at the garage (apparently there is actually an option to do that.) On attempt 2 at getting to the route start I notice that the realistic AI was just a lie, because I had several vehicles crash into me and a bunch of pedestrians didn't even know that my bus was coming, so they walked right into my vehicles path. Later then I turn too much again and crash so, again, I get wedged. At this point I switched to expert mode, since I wanted esier steering. Other than having to wait about another 5 minutes for air pressure to build up and 500 warnings saying it was too warm in the passenger conpartment, it was better overall, at least bus wise. Back on the road I had a much better time steering until I got wedged again. About 8 tries later I finally get to the first bus stop. Passengers get on the bus like normal (except for the fact that they also got in the rear door) and I drove on. At the next stop I had to give change. I had no idea what button to push for that passenger so I guessed. Since there is was no tutorial on giving change (even in beginner) I had to find a youtube tutorial. Once I figured out how to give chang I did it with ease, until the passenger didn't take the change. About a minute later I finally got the passenger to move, but then it said I didn't do it correctly, though I did. I go on to more stops, but at one of them, a passenger was just standing in the middle of the enterance. I had no choice but to start AGAIN. More tries later I actually finish my first route, but again, one of the passengers refused to get off. At this point I just didn't care anymore and accepted that, and just drove away.I HOPE I CONVINCED YOU NOT TO BUY THIS ""GAME"".			"

												Christ, this game. I bought this game after looking at the reviews and after seeing all the negative reviews and people talking about how it ""took them half an hour to find the bus"". I was like pshhhh, can't actually be that bad. I was wrong.After 10 minutes of very slowly ""sprinting"" around the bus station trying to find the door I gave up and messaged a friend with the game, the button is extremely obvious when someone points out the slightly darker bit of wall on the 3rd door from the left. After finally finding and getting into the bus you then have to start the bus up. The game gives you a few of the controls but if you're into crying while spamming keys this game is for you. The complicated buttons are too much for me Took me half an hour to start the bus and leave the station and then I crashed and had to restart the whole thing again. Just please don't buy this game, don't make the same mistake I did.			"

												I bought this with the impression it was gonna be something similar to Euro Truck Simulator. Well it's not. Its the exact opposite. This is an actual SIMULATOR. Just getting the bus started was a chore in its self. You will even need to memorize an empolyee number and security code to turn the bus on but once you do. It gets a little easier. Keeping up with the transit schedule and giving exact change to your riders can be a bit tricky. Other than that, It is a solid well built simulator. Not my type of game though so I won't publicly reccommend this. Enjoy at your own risk...			"

												This Simulator application appears to be broken with the keyboard controls not defined properly and the graphic FPS is slow at near above average quality on my new PC. I don't think it contains some of the other factual buses for the UK or US cities, mainly like Red London Buses or even the classic Volvo Alisa B55 that were popular.So in my honest opinion, no. Because it needs a lot of work and effort to make this sim-program well built - like including a wide selection of buses, enhanced tutorials, fixed controls and smooth GFX. And the city environment is in Germany but the bulletin boards and bus door and dashboard button texts are in German but not in English.			"

												I am an avid player of Simulation games, paticuarly Bus Simulators and for me this game just didn't hit the right spots, the graphics in themselves were very basic even when they were placed on High and the overall mechanics of the game were rather poor aswell, with the turning sending you 180 degrees into the nearest collidable object. This game does contain some fun!! However. I would not reccomend this game to expert Simulation players.			"

												The concept of this game is great.  Though there are some good things, the bad outweighs them:The good:- Pretty good graphics and audio- It does give the feeling of really being in the driver seat of a bus- City is fairly expansive and laid out pretty wellThe bad:- The controls are clunky and laid out terribly- Was unable to see out of the mirrors at all, even with the highest graphics detail- There is a tutorial mode, though it could be a lot more in-depth about what is going on- If you changed a keybind in options, that would not be reflected in the tutorial, and since some things named in the tutorial      are not named the same thing in the control settings it can really be confusing- There is no explaination of what kinds of menus the function keys on the keyboard will bring up, you wouldn't even know those menus are there if you didn't accidentally hit the buttons and it popped up- I tried making both male and female characters on the screen where you have to enter name/birthday/sex...etc.., regardless of the sex you choose, you will be a male that is way too overdressed to be a bus driverOverall though this game has a great concept, the execution is atrocious.  Not sure as to why it has so many positive ratings, but no matter how hard I try I am unable to fathom anything about this game that would make it worth any kind of money.  Someday hopefully there will be a bus simulation that is on par with ETS2, until then there will be no bus driving for me.My recommenation is to save your money or get ETS2 if you don't mind a really good truck driving simulator.- Phil			"

Frustrating at times as it has huge potential. Alot of controls to take in. Worth taking note of them all. Requires decent graphics and a good amount of ram to run it.

												I bought this game a while back, and I had some high expecations. Here's what I acutally got.+Nice and detailed, not as much as OMSI, but a pretty decent amount+Looks ok I guess-Poorly optimized even though I more than meet recomended specs and run on low settings-/+complicated, this can be good and bad-Ridiculous game breaking glitchesAfter I got my vehicle running, I began to pull out of the depot, I was hitting a steady 50fps or so. As I approach the gate, the frame rate drop to sub 10fps levels, I lose control and drive straight into a wall. Game eventually recovers, and I was able to drive out of the depot(NOTE: WORST AI EVER)However, driving down the road like a law abiding citizen, game goes insane and the bus starts jerking, I lose control and end up embedded in a wall.  If you want a poorly optimized, detailed, glitch as hell game, this is the one for you.EDIT- Just remembered, I was playing with my steering wheel, A Logitech Driving Force GT, it seemed to work although there was a random deadzone of 180 degrees which made it unplayable. There is no controls option for deadzone settings.			"

												Albeit the depth of the simulation is astounding (You can twiddle around with a lot of stuff) and the city feels huge, everything else around it is just... not great. The AI regularly behave extremely dumb (for example running into you while you're turning in a narrow street), the board computer is super complicated to use (...and I can calculate 10-2.20 myself, thanks), the stock version only has a few lines it makes me jot down a bunch of numbers just to get going anywhere. And don't get me started on the steering, it's unintuitive and (as another reviewer pointed out) feels like driving a shopping cart. The game lacks any real form of tutorial (apart from ""Press these buttons to start a bus"" and ""Press Up to accelerate""), so that drives the frustration-meter up even further.I would only recommend this game to someone who has a veeeery high frustration tolerance.

Posted: June 4, 2015
												After playing about 15 hours of Bus simulator 2012 I've had trouble coming to a conclusion about the quality of this game. Bus simulator 2012 is a very unique and indie bus game that is let's you simulate being a bus driver. This game is very in depth and so in depth it's very intimidating to start off. When I first bought Bus simulator 2012 I put about 20 minutes and couldn't figure out how to start my bus, so after that I threw it to the side and didn't come back to it for a few months. I really wanted to love this game, I like buses and I couldn't find a good bus sim but after a lot of troubleshooting I got my bus started and was able to play the game.       Here is the good parts of the game. It's very fun, I love the feeling of driving and trying to stay on time and try not to screw up. I also like the price, it's very cheap and if you really like buses then you could put many hours into this game. The Bus is fairly nice you can play it as an amature or play it as a bus efficantio. I like the amount of bus routes that are available to drive it gives a lot of replayability to the game. Overall it's very fun and it feels nice to drive.       Although the game is fun there are many problems with bus simulator 2012. One of the major issues is how extremely buggy it is. It's far from finished and it doesn't look like the developer is still updating the game which is a shame. Another of the games major problems is the city's design, the city isn't very well planed out. There are stop lights that don't make sense and there are stos with major congestion. I also dislike the mirror quality in the buses. The Mirrors on the bus are almost useless and the resolution of the mirror is also low. At high settings the mirrors work but they barely show anything, most of the time you just have to blindly change lanes and that can often be a problem. Another problem is the passengers animation. The passengers move extremely slow and you can not tell which pedestrians are trying to get on your bus and who isn't. It's also very hard to drive and make some turns, it took alot of pratice to get use to the buses size and how best to best maneuver the vehicle. I do wish their was an option to respawn your bus close to where you were, it became very frustrating to have to respawn the bus and start the route over because I got stuck in the fenses. Although the most frustrating part is the lack of a saving function. The saves don't work so you basicly have to start over your game once you quite. It doesn't affect the gameplay much but you have to write down your new driver id and password which is frustrating at most. Overall it's a good game but it has many major flaws.       Bus simulator 2012 is a very fun realist bus game with it's peaks and with it's flaws. It's really fun to play and the bus seems fairly heavy. I would like to see the developer put more effort into updating fixing bugs and polishing up their game. I feel It's not perfect but it can be really fun depending on how much time you are willing to put in. It's has major flaws but I would recommend this game to any person who likes buses and would like to drive one. 3/5			"

												I don't like Bus Simulator 2012. The reason is that it is just like any other simulator ever. Rubbish Graphics, Laughable Physics and a expensive price tag. If you Actually want a Good bus simulator, Buy one of the OMSIs. It may have rubbish graphics and a Expensive price tag of about £30 but if you get it in♥♥♥♥♥it is a bit cheaper and more interactive and realistic. Don't buy this game! Don't buy this game! "

												Pretty good game.The physics are not the best, however, this is a cheap alternative to Omsi with modern buses. I started using my flight simulator Joystick for control but realised you can activate mouse control when no controllers are connected to the computer. This mode made the game a lot more enjoyable and made it easy to toggle between view and driving (Highly Recommend you try it). Most of the negative comments on this game are from people that fail to read the pdf document in the installation folder giving clear steps on how to drive.The best feature of this sim is the ability to make your own routes but be careful as there are a few errors on the map in the pdf. Stop 360 doesn't exist and stop 352 in the ZOB (Bus station) should be stop 452.Overall good if you want a cheap bus sim and don't mind a few glitches.Pro:Route editorModern BusesLarge Map to exploreCons:Map repetitivePassengers often freezeCars freeze, gridlock or sink in a few locationsOccasional crashes and glitches			"

												this game would HAVE been good if it would support most common steering wheels. it does not, have have found no solution on this on steam nor google. nor the game's company.  my Ferrari Red Legend wheel from Thrustmaster is a very common wheel, and high end, and yet in this game it is reversed, the gas and brakes register backwards of what they are! if you don't step on the gas the bus is at full throttle, same with the brakes. this game is terrible! obviouisly I will avoid these paralogical Euro-foreign jobs in the future and stick to USA and Canada made games!

												Poor quality game - over complexity - like having to remember a drivers number and passcode to start the bus but only told it once.  Gears are a bit over complex - pressing brake before going through Neutral - I know on Automatic cars you have to do that but for a game, especially in beginneers mode isn't that a bit over the top.Bus regularly crashes into immovable scenery and sometimes you find the bus is stuck, at one point I found the bus had lodged itself into the middle of a bollard, another point I found the bus had actually mounted the bollard, and no amount of reverse/forward would free the vehicle, in the end had to reset the vehicle back to the depot just to get it to move again (a lot of games tend to have a ""respot"" option just in case the vehicle gets stuck, the only option this has is back to the depot and start again.Also on quitting I found the game doesn't quit properly in Windows 10.  Even though I quit Steam claimed it was still running - upon loading task manager it's still running in the background. It's a very poor game and I'm just glad it came included with a bundlestars pack.			"

It then wouldnt recognize still that I was there and no one got on the bus. I then tried the next stop to no avail. I then got stuck on a streetlamp post i couldnt get off of and had to end my game.

												This game is unbelievably detailed I couldn't believe it. I bought this game to mess around in a driving simulator but this covered everything from moving the seat up and down to actually picking people up. This is a very good training tool and kinda of fun to mess around in if you have the time.I did a video of it here: Beefgaming23 Bus Simulator All in all, I would get this game if you are actually a bus driver in training who needs practice. Otherwise, not exactly a game experience			"

Do Not Buy! An Unoptimized MessI regret buying this game.  Bus-Simulator 2012 obviously intends to be a super-realistic bus simulator, down to having you remember a PIN to activate your bus' computer.  And that's totally fine, I enjoy hardcore sims and I was ready to tackle this one.But the problem is the graphics engine.  The stuttering lag-lag-lag takes any joy from playing this title.  My computer runs modern games fine.  Something similar to this title like Euro Truck Simulator 2 is buttery smooth.  But even on lowest graphics settings this title Bus-Simulator 2012 is a mess.  Needless to say, trying to drive a bus at less than 10fps is impossible.The physics engine seems to have problems too.  I saw a bus on the opposite side of the street suddenly flip over like it was weighless and settle on the corner of one of its bumpers, totally unrealistic. I hope my review saves someone the money and grief this title cost me!			"

												I originally played this a while ago or attempted to do so, like others have said, it can be torturous to even start to play. I used to use 2 screens to play most of my games, the 2nd being used for browsing, chatting etc but I decided to go the whole way and run 3 seeing my Rig can handle it perfectly well.  I boots up Steam as usual, clicks on EBS and it loads.....but doesn't load onto the right screen, instead of loading to my middle screen like everything else does, it decides to run on my right hand screen. I am unable to move it even in windowed mode I cannot drag it across as the first click on the window just puts me back in game. (Right now it is sat there on my right monitor garing at me daring me again to try and move it!) Seems their is no way of moving across, I changed settings in NVidia to ensure games ran on middle monitor and were able to change settings within the game, still nothing. So I tried making each Monitor the primary one, still made no difference. So my next trick will be to try something like DisplayFusion to force it to run on the middle display.  Now down to the actual game itself, if your a fan of fast paced driving with easy controls, look elsewhere. Even if your a fan of Simulators you may even be put off playing it as it is like solving puzzles just to get out the garage! I would rate this game a mere 3/10 and thats being nice! Best review I found about this game is here ...   http://square-go.com/european-bus-simulator/ "

												First and most importantly, this game is buggy and not well optimized. The frame rate drops randomly as you play, and there is no background loading going on, so when your view distance needs to update the frame rate just chugs. I have played around with the graphics settings and this is a issue even on medium. The tutorial is not well done, and I got stuck a few times, having to look for answers online. There is only 1 bus, and no real selection. The controls are poorly implemented and difficult to use, for example it is almost impossible to judge and make turns in some places. They make you use the arrow keys instead of wasd, why they did this is beyond me. The AI traffic isn't really that smart, and they will often block your path and get way too close boxing you in. So I turned the traffic density to the halfway mark, and all of a sudden there were like hardly any cars on the road. There is a bug where passengers just get stuck and block others from getting on, forcing a restart. Overall this is a poorly optimized, poorly implemented, buggy simulator. I would not recommend this for $10, this game is so bad it should be free.			"

												do not buy huge waist of money the contorls are very cofuzing gives you little instructions and you just ghost through people walking whats the fun of driving a bus if you cant run people over. i know the first part of the review sounds like im just critzing it and i havent played much well thats true but i have played enough to actuly make a valid reviw. i still dont recomend this game because like i said erlaier the controls suck. i had so much trouble turning off the hand brake and there were no walkthroughts i eventuly found out that my insert button also was 0 so i had to do function insert but function was another control so it got very confusing. the one part i realy got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at was after you start the bus it just says acelarate i was realy hoping for more of a tutorial because i mean  i dont even know were im going. If the game had a mode other than beginer and advanced mabey one called heres how you ♥♥♥♥ing play i wouldnt be so mad because lets be honest beginer mode is still way to hard.			"

												Garbage. Roads are so god damn small and when you hit a car, which you will do, the bus goes flying like a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Obviously the car is fine though. ""detailed, virtual world"" is exactly what this game is NOT.  Also im pretty sure that in 2012 buses had some automation in them, not having to punch some crap into a wonderul computer machine so it spits out a ticket. I am sad now I have spent my money on this when I could have saved up for OMNI Bus.			"

												The idea of this game is good, but the execution is pretty poor. In particular, steering is absolutely atrocious, although I was only using a keyboard. But keyboard steering in the likes of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and OMSI 2 is pretty decent. In this game though, it's almost impossible. You're constantly either understeering or oversteering. The steering wheel seems to have a mind of its own. Acceleration and braking are also very laborious. It seems to take ages to do anything, like entering codes etc. (although that is quite cool - just a shame the execution is so poor) and the tutorials are not especially helpful.This is an old game, and pretty cheap. But even the low amount I paid was barely worth it. One thing I will say is that the graphics were very nice and the night lighting was superb. Better games than this can often have quite poor lighting at night, but this game has perfect night visibility - one of the few things it gets right.Essentially, the game looks great, and has a few nice touches. But while it delivers on great looks and realistic ideas, it fails to deliver on a smooth and enjoyable gameplaying experience. It's more frustrating than fun, so while it has a few good points, overall I cannot recommend this. As some other reviewers have said, you're much better off getting OMSI 2 for a decent bus simulator. Even SCS Software's old Bus Driver is a better game than this! That game doesn't have the same bells and whistles as BS 2012, but you can steer fairly well, pick up passengers and have a reasonably fun time. This game just drives you up the wall, which is really not where you want your bus to be going!			"

OMSI is way better this lags like mad and there is a bad bus selection (1 Regular bus, 1 Articulated Bus, No double decker buses). Acceleration is pretty slow on the buses. Oh..... and the AI vehicles frequently mess up. This sometimes causes a Huge traffic jam, not moving. The only thing you can do it either Restart or drive on the wrong side of the road/path to get through..... AI Vehicles also arent very well programmed and often break rules of the road.			"

												TML Studios. Should be called FML Studios. I'll sum this game up in one sentence - Darksouls meets Surgeon Simulator but with a bus!1/10 - If you're a casual gamer.3/10 - If you're into driving Simulators.9/10 - If you're into Sado-masicism and strapping car batteries up to your naughty places.

												Ok, in action period (half price), buy the game if you like the buses. Wheel support not the best, but work for me. (Logitech DFP)			"

												Firstly, I'd like to start by saying that this is a game of average quality. I would still recommed it to someone looking for a bus simualator game, mostly due to it's cheap price. It has its pros and cons though, which I am going to metion here.Here are some of the pros:- You can freely drive your bus around the city.- The interior design of the bus is quite nice.- Lots of camera views, especially in the driver's seat.- All of the switches, buttons, and levers in the cab do something, (no dummy buttons).- Lots of routes to drive around the city.- You can walk around (free movement).- Controller support.However, the cons include:- Only one game mode.- They make you remember a password at the start of the first ever game that you then have to put in to make the cash register work every time at the start of each game!- Cash register very complicated to work and there is also no tutorial.- The bus announcements are in German only, despite it saying on the Steam Store page that the game includes 'Full Audio' in English.- If you crash into another vehicle, you have to wait 30 seconds before it becomes invisible and you can drive on.- It is impossible to drive around tight bends without hitting a vehicle on the inside.There are also faults with the game, for example:- Quite often someone rings the bell to get off, but when you open the back and front doors at the next bus stop, no-one gets off.- When driving towards a bus stop, you cannot tell if some of the pedestrians are walking to the bus stop to get on your bus, or are just going to walk straight past, because their heads only look forwards.- The cash register sometimes just stops working and you cannot press any keys.- It is not very realistic because the stop bell always gets rung at exactly the same number of seconds after driving past or leaving the previous bus stop. In real life, it could be rung at any time between stops.Overall, this is an average game. Although I'd recommend it, I would say go for Munich Bus Simulator (also available on Steam). It has none of the faults that I previously mentioned. It is more expensive but it is newer and so much better. You get what you pay for. This is a cheap game so I can't complain about value.			"
