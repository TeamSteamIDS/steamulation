												DayZ is a mod for Arma 2 that turns the base game into a zombie survival simulator. DayZ is one of the most detailed, if not the most detailed, and immersive zombie survival sims available. When you play DayZ, you create a character and spawn on a beach with nothing but your clothes and from there you have to make your way inland and try to find the tools you need to fend off the undead and to survive in this new world. Generally you are looking for things such as a melee weapon, medical supplies, light sources, food and you might even be lucky enough to find a gun or camping gear.As you make your way through formerly populated areas like villages, farms and the three large cities, you will run into hordes of zombies that you will have to deal with. You can lose them by running into buildings or otherwise breaking line of sight with them. But the zombies are actually not the real threat in this game; the biggest potential threat comes from the other players who are attempting to survive just like you. Some of them will try to help you or trade with you, but usually in exchange for something of equal value, or if you are both being attacked by zombies or other players and you band together out of desperation. Most players though, are bandits, which you can tell by their clothes and covered faces. These players are out for your blood, and only want the stuff they can loot off your dead body.You want to be very cautious in approaching other survivors that you do not know in DayZ because a lot of bandit groups will try to bait victims by having one of their number pose as a ""friendly"" and then when the victim runs over to trade or help, the rest of the bandits ambush him or her. Players in this game have gotten very paranoid in the last year and a half, and so a lot of times players will shoot each other on sight rather than risk losing their gear to a potential bandit.So what do you actually do in DayZ once you have your basic weapons and tools needed to survive? Well you want to find a safe place that you can use as a home base. Generally you want to be far away from areas frequented by zombies, so somewhere in the woods usually. You want to be close enough to a town that you can raid it for supplies every few hours but far enough that zombies and players will have a difficult time tracking you home.Once you have your things safely stashed, the best thing you can do is band together with your friends or any friendly people on the server you can find and get a vehicle. A bicycle is great for solo scout and loot missions to town, but a car, truck or SUV will provide cover from bullets, a large inventory and quick transport for multiple people. Focus on getting the necessary car parts you will need to fix up one of the junked cars you find laying around. After that, once you get enough loot and establish a territory, you can even build a house in some versions of DayZ and barricade it against zeds and meddlesome players.At some point you will get into a fight with another player. Most of the time these fights aren't fair. Maybe a group of players rolled up on you while you were looting and shot you as you came out of a house. Other times you'll follow someone and not realize that they have friends with them and their friends flank and kill you, or you just get shot by someone while you are running from zombies that have aggroed you. All of these things will happen to you on a regular basis, and since everything stays on your corpse when you die, chances are they will loot and take your stuff. But other times you get lucky and you kill a guy with a huge gun that you need because you were lucky enough to catch him with his pants down. So now you have a big gun, and then when you go around the side of the house he was in, you find his giant military truck full of more guns and supplies. Now you are a zombie slaying god and you can bring all of that back to your base. It is very easy to either get very, very mad at this game and ragequit or try to keep deaths in perspective, play smart and take all the opportunities you get. If you are observant and patient in every situation you will do well. If you run into a building without checking the surroundings for players watching or for zombies that will attract attention to you, you will die a lot. If you take your time and all necessary precautions you will catch somebody making a mistake and profit from it, and continue to survive the apocalypse.			"

												First life in the game. I got kidnapped and all my stuff was taken. While the guy was walking away i hear gunshots. Russian guy comes up to me and gives me my stuff back. He doesn't speak a word of english and we team up. We were the heroes of the server, saving noobs and killing bandits. We were next to a group of bandits and the Russian guys goes up to them. I'm hiding in the house and I hear gunshots. There was no way he survived. Someone walked around the door and I blasted them. It was the Russian guy. I was apologizing and he said in broken english ""It ok, we make mistakes"" and died. I almosted cried and I never played again. Rip russian guy 2k15-2k16.EDIT: This was on my friends computer because mine is trash			"

Important Notice:There are currently over 2,000 servers[dz.launcher.eu], but this Steam download alone won't be enough to connect to the vast majority of them. Most servers require additional mods and maps. You'll get an error and fail to connect if you are missing mods. DayZ launchers are free utilities that solve this issue. I highly recommend using one to make installing mods and connecting to servers much easier.Server list by country: http://arma2.swec.se/server/listIf you are new to DayZ before installing a launcher make sure to run Steam.exe as an Admin and then install and play Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA once each to complete installation (part of the installation occurs when playing the games). Next install a launcher to download mods and connect to servers:dayzlauncher.com - All DayZ Modswithsix.com - All Arma Mods (official)survivallauncher.com - Arma 2 & 3 + Arkcustomcombatgaming[customcombatgaming.com] - CCG DayZ Serversdayzcommander.com - All DayZ Mods (currently not working)See: Newbie Guide to DayZ LaunchersPlease note that you will not be able to connect to any server until you have fully downloaded the mods necessary for that server. Vanilla DayZ is only about 500MB, but others like Epoch are 2.6GB and will take quite a while to download. Maps are also fairly large, for example Namalsk is an additional 800MB and Taviana is 1.2GB. The good news is all these mods and maps are completely free! Check the Mods tab of your launcher to view the status of your downloads before trying to connect.Interactive DayZ Mod loot maps: http://dayzdb.com/map/chernarusScreenshot after building my first DayZ Epoch base, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away (all that wood was chopped down by hand with axes!): http://i.imgur.com/88nBhSC.jpgDayZ Mod is one of the most interesting, exciting and immersive games I've ever played. It's basically a multiplayer apocalyptic virtual world or sandbox without any quests or story-line unless created by the players themselves. You go where you want and do as you want. You determine everything that happens except for the response from other players. You can be a bandit or hero engaging in constant gun battles in the busier towns or you can run off into the wilderness and build yourself a cabin in the middle of nowhere and hunt to survive. There are very few limits on what you can do.DayZ Epoch (mod) Building & Craftinghttp://epochmod.gamepedia.com/Modular_Building_Systemhttp://epochmod.gamepedia.com/Crafting_SystemI prefer DayZ Mod over DayZ Standalone for several reasons. One of the coolest things about the Mod is that it's essentially a game with hundreds of free expansions and DLCs. Because it's not centrally controlled and developed by a single dev team it offers many different types of games, maps, custom mods, play styles i.e PvP, PvE, RP, and game improvements for free from hundreds of players and community developers and continues to evolve in many alternative directions. Most mods are open source and you can modify them or help develop and improve them yourself. There are Hunger Games type mods to play like Battle Royal where it's everyone for themselves and you fight to be the last one standing, militarized mods like Overwatch full of heavy military weapons, aircraft and tanks, crafting and base building type mods like Epoch and Origins that allow you to more permanently carve out your own piece of the world and make it your home, survival type mods like vanilla DayZ, and even alien mods like Invasion. With the Mod there are so many different options and environments available for play that you're bound to find a server that suits you and if you don't you can even set up your own server and customize it just the way you like. That will likely never happen to the same degree with the Standalone.800 free mods are available for Arma 2: http://withsix.com/p/arma-2/modsThe Mod is also much cheaper than Standalone. Arma 2 Combined Operations and Arma X Anniversary keys can be bought for about $5 and $8 each, just search Google for keys or wait for a sale. Not only do you pay less and get dozens of different games and options for play, but you also get the original Arma 2 combat simulator games too, which are award winning games themselves.Overall, DayZ Mod is a must have if you enjoy PC gaming. Many games are trying to imitate DayZ Mod now, but nothing really compares so far and it will probably remain that way simply because free DayZ mods are community developed by those purely passionate about making cool mods and games while everything else is being developed primarily for profit.If you need help installing or connecting send me a friend request and I'll try to help.

												The DayZ mod is still a better game by far than SA DayZ. There are very few remaining bugs and the balance between survival, zombies, vehicles and PvP has been tweaked to make this game challenging and competitive. I recommend playing this game on a Vanilla server rather than Epoch or ""goodies"" servers because everything you find, steal and kill for is that much more valuable to you than if it's handed right over when you spawn. Spawn, loot, kill or die and repeat. But remember, we're all gonna die sooner or later. It's just a matter of time...:-)			"

												Two tips: 1. ""Don't get too fond of your gear"".... You are going to lose it. All of it. Many times.2. Elekrovadask is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ where you will usually meet a sticky end. Its a free mod. But If you are going to buy Arma2 and OA just to play the mod, proceed with caution. You need to install and set it up very carefully and use DZLauncher or it probably won't work ""out of the box"".   (NOTE: DayZ Commander is now out of date)It is built on a military simulator engine, and there is a fairly sharp learning curve, it may take a while to find a regular server that plays the style of DayZ that you like (ranging from solo survivalist in the woods PvE to relentless PVP and everything between the two extremes)It is NOT a ""run and Gun"" game. Its about stealth, walking, sneaking, surviving the hard way, and the highs and lows of living moment to moment.There are bugs, and gliches.  You will either be able to overlook these and enjoy the game, or they'll drive you mad.Under the surface there is a very good community. Although dismissed my many in the Arma2 community as ""whiny trolls from DayZ"" there are plenty of us who play both the mil-sim and the DayZ variants of Arma2. DayZ is not for everyone. It may take you a while to find a server you like, with an FPS that works, and a decent anti-cheat on it. But there are servers for everyone, from Pure PVP, to Pure PvE, and everything in between including servers witth hostile/friendly AI, and mods-on-mod like Epoch and Origins.TL/DR: do your research first: there are no half measures in DayZ, you will either love it or hate it.

												Hallelujiah, the Apocalypse has arrived. (TL:DR at bottom)I bought into DayZ StandAlone last year. For a year I've been trying to participate in and enjoy, that game, and rarely have I walked away pleased. The glitches, hackers and terrible zoombie mechanics left me disappointed too many times to recommend StandAlone.When I saw Arma 2 Complete go on sale for less than $9 I had serious reservations about giving Bohemia any more of my money, but I really wanted a DayZ experience the devs have promised me dang rabbit!So, I pulled the trigger and purchased Arma 2 Complete and immediately kissed the rest of the games in my library goodbye!Set-up wasn't easy, I was plauged by the error messages seen everywhere in the forums by recent puchasers of the same set, but with some patience, determination and a LOT of reading I was able to overcome the BattleEye bugs and, again, with some little annoyances I also got DayZ Commander set up and the Epoch & Overwatch mods installed..now, what about this DayZ mod?My time is recorded through Arma 2 OA so since purchasing Thursday so I'm closer to 15 hours in and it's been absolutely AMAZING. DayZ Mod was the experience I was hoping SA would bring me and never did. I've had more intense, blood curdling, panic-inducing moments in DayZ Mod than any other game on my steam list.The Zombie AI, imo, is the best on Steam. Coming from a pretty hefty zombie/survival/open-world gaming list, DZM provides more thrills than 7DTD, The Forest, The Dead Linger etc. The pathfinding is superb, the animations are great, the sounds are excellent. They provide a real atmosphere of tense-horror at just the right time.The one big issue in SA (out of many, believe me) is the zombies are still broken. The have x-ray vision which stretches miles, can run through a lot of obstacles and are very hard to ""lose"", imo. The zoms in DZM act exactly like I would expect zombies to act. I can't explain to you the joy I felt when I was crouched in the ditch of a road, night settling over me, with two lumbering Zeds slowly shambling my way having yet still notice me. Staying extremely still, not breathing IRL, I remained crouched as these two denizens of the undead proceeded to ramble past me, mere INCHES from my face, without knwoing I was there. One wrong move or sound from me and I was Zombie Dinner! I've been waiting for that experience for a long time, through a lot of games, and it was a joy to finally see it realized.Installing DayZ commander and getting at least Epoch and Overwatch working (out of a lot of other intense mods) are almost tantamount to give you the DayZ experience you are looking for. They add so much flavour to the game including trading posts, custom building and crafting (up to massive bases), wandering AI, including Bandits, which add SO much flair to the game, roaming bandits, Aircraft Bandits...truckloads driving from village to village looking for hapless victims to strip them off their gear and sell them at the nearest vendor. The different MODS through Commander add new maps, missions within the game (find an Alpha zombie, kill a scientist for a cure, find a downed plane for it's supplies); plus many servers have their own lore and stories built within the game. Basically you can tailor you Apocalypse scenario any way you want...creating the experience you want.Graphically I find the MOD looks almost exactly like the SA, and plays very smooth. I have a mid-grade pc and on the server I have picked as my favorite so far I have been getting FPS in the 50's, which is great for my machine (I'm used to 30 FPS for a lot of games), so technically it isn't as demanding as I thought it might be.If you are turned off by a lot of buttons then DayZ may not be for you. It is very demanding in it's use of the keyboard, utilizing a lot of keystrokes for the experience. If you're new to this structure then allow for extra time in-game to really get a feel of the flow, but once you're used to it there is no denying how satisfying it is being able to use 4 buttons at once to scope out around corners, or scan far off to the North while feverishly running South.The Gear screen is a little confusing to me still, as I'm still fiddling with how different items work together, and I haven't even begun to touch crafting or building. But running around a few servers with player made creations shows that the system is deep and immersive. There are a lot of clans out there that have spent hundreds of hours building, scavenging for parts and building a community within the game. The nice thing is, especially through DayZ Commander, you can find as casul or hardcore an experience as you wish.I haven't come across any bugs or glitches in my almost 15 hours of play or so, not that I'm saying it's perfect, but coming from SA to the Mod I was expecting it to be a horrid, buggy mess, so I have been very pleasantly surprised with the fluidity of the game and it's contents. I have tested in many types of servers, full PVP and PVE, and have been lucky to have picked really incredible community servers, so griefing and KOS'ing (so far) have been a non-issue for me, but I do a lot of research on servers before hopping in. What I did find nice was with the addition of Bandit AI, even in  a server that's PVE with no one but me on it, the threat from man is JUST as palpable as the threat from zombies. It's quite a thrill to run into a village looking for supplies and taking out a zombie population with a silenced pistol, freely exploring buildings, and at any moment hearing the sounds of a truck coming around a corner, running to hide in a a building JUST before the headlights light you up, and watch as  5 bandits jump from a truck, fully armed, going from building to building, shooting anything they see. It's exhilarating and challenging, but in no way breaks immersion or the feeling of Apocalyptic Doom.If you can get this package on sale it's a HUGE bonus. But, to be honest, now that I'm in DayZ Mod and experiencing the thrill of DayZ as I was hoping I would have had over a year ago, the retail asking price of the package is completely worth it. For now, I am am uninstalling my DayZ Standalone, saying a silent prayer for all the games on my list that I won't touch for many months to come, and immersing myself in the Zombie Apocalypse game I have always wanted and now have found. :)TL:DR; An immersive experience that blows away it's struggling little brother DayZ Standalone. Worth the price (especially on sale), and the finest example of a Zombie Apocalypse game on Steam yet. If you can get past the installation issues and have the patience to get DayZ Coammander up and running, then this game is unparallelled.			"

												Although steam says I haven't played this game much, I've put about 1000-2000 hours in total using DayZ Commander. Now, being based of a Military Sim. There is some amazing gun play, tactics and all around great fun to be had. Although there are some very bad bugs and glitches. If its not glitching off a ladder and dying or lagging through walls. (Every hardcore DayZ player has had this happen to them.) Its also got a very steap learning curve. Don't let that turn you off to the game though. DayZ is all about a game based around survival. Your set in a place in Russia, so anyone who doesn't know how to read russian is gonna have alittle harder time remembering the towns. (Although after 10 or so hours, it isn't hard.) Your set in the middle of nowhere with next to nothing. You have no objective except survive the zombie infested island. You have no idea where to go, so you start running, you found a house! Grab the beans, soda and pistol of the ground. Suddenly your a threat. You meet another player, a not so friendly one at that. People call him many names, but the most common. Bandit. He wants your items, are you going to get shot, or survive. Either by running or taking the fight to him. Now, that we're done with the little story. Back to the review d:Yes, considering it is a mod. There are going to be bugs, and more then likely you WILL get mad. Its only normal. Some annoying bugs are -- Getting one hit by zombies and dying- Glitching off ladders and dying or breaking legs- Reloging and your items be missing from inventory- Glitching through walls- Zombies hitting you through walls- Zombies having horrible pathing - Zombies glitching though floorsThose are some annoying bugs, that happen normaly. But if you can look past that, there is a silver lining. Once you get passed the bugs you find an amazing experence. Just image finding a friendly group of people, running up north, getting end-game loot and finding another squad of people and having a huge gun fight. Like I said before, the gun play is amazing. So naturaly so are the gun fights. Then you find a heli, go help freshspawns or kill them(Hero/bandit), then a rogue sniper takes all you guys out. Its fun. But I highly recommend you get some friends, get on skype/teamspeak/vent etc etc and play that way, as its much more enjoyable and way easier.If your brand new to DayZ here are some beginner tips - - G = Gear- / on numpad - Changing optics on weapons- Q , E - Lean left and right- Right click to aim- Hold right click to zoom (can do while aiming)- There is no autorun feature- Z , X , C = Changing Stance- . and , = Changing channel to talk- / not on numpad to talk- Capslock - Voice chatThose are gonna be some basics your gonna need to know. Well, I hope this review helped out atleast slightly. I fully recommend this game. Just remember. Its ok to get mad. . . Cause you will, I promise. :PEDIT - This game is also very badly rendered. Meaning, anyone who doesn't have a decent computer are going to have trouble running this game. Although not impossible, you will have to get used to it. I get a solid 30 fps and about 15-20 in large citys. Which isn't very good. But its playable. Just like the bugs, if you can get passed that. There are many adventures that await you in the DayZ.

												A Mod based off the Military Simulator, ARMA II. This mod is brilliant, because it simulates very well what would it be like if you were left behinfd in an apocalypse. This game has a huge ""mods in a mod"" modding scene, the map is HUGE (15 square kilometers), and you'll feel like you're there when you play this. Beware two things. One, this is not for the faint of heart. Two, this is NOT OPTIMIZED. So if you don't care about having the highest FPS, here you are then. But if you do, I would wait until the Day-Z Standalone comes out, which is on its way.Bottom line though, Highly recommended besides those two issues, but mentailly preapre yourself! Also, watching 28 Days Later helps with this too :P			"

												This in my Opinion is the greatest Mod for a game ever known coming right up next to garry mod and killing floor and other such as that, this mod is a Open world Survival Horror Strataagy game that takes the player into a beautiful large map with other survivors to pretty much survive the zombie Apocolypse, this includes- Eating Food ((There is also rotten food you cannot eat and animals you can hunt cook and eat for better results))- Drinking ((Water, Coke, Pepsi, Mountin Dew, Ect))- Stealth (( Stealth is a huge part of this game, you simply cannot go in guns blazing, zombies and player will hear you see you and KILL you))- Stratagy ((In DayZ combat it is nothing like CoD, you must avoid getting shot at all costs, getting shot will knock you out or break a limb. getting shot will also make you bleed and be in shock, to fix this you will have to take pain killers to stop you character from shaking, bandage your wounds, Morphine can be used for broken Limbs, blood bags will help regain colour to your screen and also stop your player from falling in and out of coma but on some servers may only be applied by other players))- People Skills ((Some people will kill on sight others will be friends, in order to survive you must know the difference))- Enviroment ((You also must make sure not to get too hot nor cold))This Mod has come so far, it now has its own standalone in witch i reviewed and multiple versions of the mod, popular ones areDayZDayZ EpochDayZ OverpochDayZ 2017This is a very well thought out mod and does a amazing job.My personal Suggesed PC SpecsCPU- Intel Quod CoreRAM- 4Gb min ((Recommend 8Gb, 16Gb is over kill and not needed))Graphics- 1Gb Nvidia Gforce ((if you have better this will be good))In conclusion i do recomend this game %100. :)			"

												DayZ is a mod for Arma 2 that turns the base game into a zombie survival simulator. DayZ is one of the most detailed, if not the most detailed, and immersive zombie survival sims available. When you play DayZ, you create a character and spawn on a beach with nothing but your clothes and from there you have to make your way inland and try to find the tools you need to fend off the undead and to survive in this new world. Generally you are looking for things such as a melee weapon, medical supplies, light sources, food and you might even be lucky enough to find a gun or camping gear.As you make your way through formerly populated areas like villages, farms and the three large cities, you will run into hordes of zombies that you will have to deal with. You can lose them by running into buildings or otherwise breaking line of sight with them. But the zombies are actually not the real threat in this game; the biggest potential threat comes from the other players who are attempting to survive just like you. Some of them will try to help you or trade with you, but usually in exchange for something of equal value, or if you are both being attacked by zombies or other players and you band together out of desperation. Most players though, are bandits, which you can tell by their clothes and covered faces. These players are out for your blood, and only want the stuff they can loot off your dead body.You want to be very cautious in approaching other survivors that you do not know in DayZ because a lot of bandit groups will try to bait victims by having one of their number pose as a ""friendly"" and then when the victim runs over to trade or help, the rest of the bandits ambush him or her. Players in this game have gotten very paranoid in the last year and a half, and so a lot of times players will shoot each other on sight rather than risk losing their gear to a potential bandit.So what do you actually do in DayZ once you have your basic weapons and tools needed to survive? Well you want to find a safe place that you can use as a home base. Generally you want to be far away from areas frequented by zombies, so somewhere in the woods usually. You want to be close enough to a town that you can raid it for supplies every few hours but far enough that zombies and players will have a difficult time tracking you home.Once you have your things safely stashed, the best thing you can do is band together with your friends or any friendly people on the server you can find and get a vehicle. A bicycle is great for solo scout and loot missions to town, but a car, truck or SUV will provide cover from bullets, a large inventory and quick transport for multiple people. Focus on getting the necessary car parts you will need to fix up one of the junked cars you find laying around. After that, once you get enough loot and establish a territory, you can even build a house in some versions of DayZ and barricade it against zeds and meddlesome players.At some point you will get into a fight with another player. Most of the time these fights aren't fair. Maybe a group of players rolled up on you while you were looting and shot you as you came out of a house. Other times you'll follow someone and not realize that they have friends with them and their friends flank and kill you, or you just get shot by someone while you are running from zombies that have aggroed you. All of these things will happen to you on a regular basis, and since everything stays on your corpse when you die, chances are they will loot and take your stuff. But other times you get lucky and you kill a guy with a huge gun that you need because you were lucky enough to catch him with his pants down. So now you have a big gun, and then when you go around the side of the house he was in, you find his giant military truck full of more guns and supplies. Now you are a zombie slaying god and you can bring all of that back to your base. It is very easy to either get very, very mad at this game and ragequit or try to keep deaths in perspective, play smart and take all the opportunities you get. If you are observant and patient in every situation you will do well. If you run into a building without checking the surroundings for players watching or for zombies that will attract attention to you, you will die a lot. If you take your time and all necessary precautions you will catch somebody making a mistake and profit from it, and continue to survive the apocalypse.			"

												(This is For DayZ: Epoch, because lets be real, who the f**k still plays normal Mod)It may look a little dated and be a bit buggy, but DayZ Epoch is better than Standalone in every single possible way, except maybe Arma 2s appaling inventory system.Set a little while after the Apocalypse, Epoch sees society slowly being rebuilt, so there is more of a focus in faction forming and base building and the like rather than surviving, trader cities are on the map where you can go to sell weapons/equipment/food for small chunks of Copper, silver and gold, each with increasing value respectivley. The player can actually purchase ammo/weapons/food/Helicopters/cars/equipment from NPC's without having to find it which in my oppinion is alot better. However, as mentioned above, you need currrency to buy these things. So in order to do that, you need to either scavenge or go do bandit missions.Scvenging is almost completley redundant but is ALOT safer than bandit missions, bandit missions are small waypoints on the map where the player and his m8s can kill NPC bandits and take their supplies to sell, this is VERY dangerous because the bandits usually number from 10-25. HOWEVER it is worth it as you can get a lifetime supply of guns/ammo and maybe even a car, that is unless another player doesnt get there first, or shoots you while you scavenge the NPC bodies. Keep in mind, one stray STANNAG round (most common type) can cripple you if not kill you, so be careful, bandit missions are best done with friends.Unlike Standalone, Epoch has a humanity system which increases as you heal and help other players, and decreases rapidly upon injuring or killing another, once 5000 or negative 5000 humanity is reached, the player becomes a hero (positive) or a bandit (negative) once one of the two, the player can travel to hero/bandit traders that sell increadibly more powerful gear (Kevlar vests, Armoured cars, Armed Helicopters, and even on some servers, tanks) This is why people on Epoch are generally more friendly because having postive humanity can get them to Hero status and thus better gear.It takes a while, but you can build massive bases from scratch to house all your items, these can be as simple as small, well fortified bunkers, to massive sprawling fortresses complete with three helipads and a airoplane runway.Overall, Epoch can be tedious, but with friends it is a blast. Bandit missions are one of the highlightes of the game, and returning from a succesful one with your car loaded with guns to your very own base is an amazing feeling. Any fans of the Walking dead series or any other zombie production ever will love this game. A must buy.P.S Be prepared, The distant rumble of a armoured car engine, or the growl of an armed blackhawk will never sound scarier, especially when its headed towards your location.			"

How to Install DayZ Mod 2016Favorite Vid (DayZ Overpoch Taviana)


YouTube™ Video:  

			Views: 0		



InstallationIf you haven't installed anything yet make sure you are on a Windows Admin account and simply install Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead (OA). Do not install the Steam DayZ mod. Before you do anything else play Arma 2 once and exit, then play Arma 2 OA once and exit, in that order. Then download dayzlauncher.com install it and run it. If all your game files are on your main C: drive then all you need to do is click the arrow button on the right side next to any server and the mods for that server will be detected and begin downloading. Some of the mods like Epoch are up to 3 GB in size and will take a while to download before you can actually connect. You can view the status of your mods and downloads by clicking the Mods page near the top of dayzlauncher. To start playing quickly you might want to start with plain old vanilla DayZ since it is only .5 GB - to see only vanilla DayZ servers select DayZ in the selection box on the left side of dayzlauncher and then click the Apply button. NOTE: do not install the old DayZ mod on Steam as it may cause conflicts.If you have multiple drives make sure to change your game folders in Dayzlauncher. Click Settings in the top right. The default location for your Mods/Download Path is your Arma 2 OA folder, typically: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 2 Operation ArrowheadThe Arma 2 Path is where you installed Arma 2, typically: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 2TroubleshootingUsually problems are caused by having ♥♥♥♥ed up Windows folder permissions. Make sure you install the game on a Windows Admin account. If your installation is screwed up try reinstalling this way:1. Uninstall everything and delete the following folders:C:\Users\[username]\Documents\ArmA 2C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\ArmA 2C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\ArmA 2 OAC:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 2C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead2. Right click and run steam.exe (not the icon) as an Admin it's located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam3. Install Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead.4. As Admin play Arma 2 and then exit. Next, play Operation Arrowhead and then exit.5. Install dayzlauncher.com (see above for usage). Do not install DayZ Mod on Steam.TipsIn Dayzlauncher settings check Nosplash, Nopause, and Nologs to load and run the game faster.DayZ Epoch servers are usually the easiest for beginners because they have high loot and NPC traders.If you don't like PvP search Dayzlauncher for PVE, RP, or Roleplay.Zombies chase noisy players. Crouch to make less noise and crawl to make almost no noise. Melee weapons are quiet.The branches of pine trees and large bushes will protect you from zombie attacks.One of the first things you need is storage. Create or get a stash, crate, backpack, or tent as soon as possible.You can drink out of ponds and wells with a chance of infection. Boil water using a tin can, waterbottle and fire.An axe is one of the most useful items. You can quitely kill zombies with it and chop wood for crafting storage and bases.More to come...			"

												I'm going to be honest here. 2 or 1 year ago I wouldn't have recommended this mod. As this mod is brilliant and phenomenal it has been very unstable since it was relased early 2013. The concept sounded cool but back then DayZ had dozens of issues which prevented me playing and enjoying this otherwise so supreme title. Glitching zombies, clumsy and buggy user interference and constant uncertainity of losing everything you had collected caused by server crash were serious problems. However - what could one expect from the free mod for players of ARMA2 and ARMA2: Operation Arrowhead?Fortunantly DayZ mod has grown these past years. With the help of active community it has gotten various new maps, the UI have been enchanted and is much more easier and safer to use. Third party management programs such as DayZ launcher and DayZ Commander have done indispensable work releasing players of most of the updating burden. Of course this mod still isn't flawless and some annoying surprices happen every now and then, but considering how well it has gotten upgreaded these last years I say the future looks encouraging. DayZ mod prospers and lives well and dozens of servers have always players to keep the game hectic and interesting where - or when ever you play. DayZ mod is still one of the greatest survival, open world titles in the world and at the moment imo it is DayZ standalone's superior.			"

												I used to play DayZ Mod by running it off Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead, hence the low ""game play"" time on this version.I miss the old Mod.Now the Mod is destroyed by hackers and destroyed by the Admins of the servers adding custom buildings, adding more weapons, making it easier to gain weapons, and of course adding something stupid like 1,000 vehicles per server. What's the point in that??????The Mod was good when weapons were hard(ish) to get, you had to go to good places like Stary Sobor Military Tents, or NW Airfield, or even Balota Airfield. Finding vehicles was something that was a challenge. Finding scrap metal, finding wheels, jerry cans etc. Now you can pretty much find a fully fixed vehicle anywhere.The times when you had shoot outs at NW Airfield, Stary Sobor, Helicopter Crash sites etc. Now you don't get that often.Miss them times.I do recommend the game as it is fun to play, well I don't find it AS fun anymore simply because the servers have been destroyed.I'd like the old DayZ Mod back.

												This is up there in my Top 3 Best Mods of all time. Easily.The changes made to the base game aren't earth-shattering, and upon close inspection of how those changes are implemented, it quickly becomes appearent how simple and rudimentary thier construction is in most cases. The changes are basically achieved with what amounts to a digital ""spiral notebook and some still photographs of new textures"". But with those simple tools, the cats behind DayZ:Mod have really sunk thier teeth in and hit the zombie survival nail on the head.This isn't your ""L4D: KILL IT ALL! KILL IT ALL WITH FIRE!"" button masher. With DayZ being built ontop of what can be classified as no less than a tried and true ""Military Personell Simulator"" (without even a fraction of the paper work and ten times the unaccounted-for munitions.)When I played EVE Online, I figured it would be many years before I saw a game even pretend to compare to the treachery it inspires in its player-base. But DayZ may have perhaps surpassed the deceit of EVE. Not in scale (the scale of player-betrayal in EVE is second to none) but in how immediate, and visceral it is force-fed to new players. And its a self-sustaining beast, since players who were initiated so cruely, tend to turn around and laugh harder and be more cruel to the next guys. And this can really ruin games like this, and can instantly rob people of thier entire evening of what they thought would be enjoyable play time to test out some of the mechanics, and replace that with having to wade through the mud and the rain for five miles back to thier corpse. After having been mercilessly made fun of as if we were born yesterday for not knowing an entire wiki cover-to-cover on our first day, and simply wanting to talk, make new friends, and leave some of the game to be discovered naturally through first hand experience. I'm often made fun of for my stand-point here, and ridiculed with ""Aww, poor baby doesn't like dying."" I genuinely don't mind dying. In fact it can spawn some really fun and exciting nemesis situations between rivaling players. But a line has to be drawn, players should be given a chance to get thier feet wet, grasp the mechanics, or survive long enough to see thier buddy(s) log in to play together. Don't feed the beast guys...work together...even if you aren't on the same team. Theres no reason to be inconsiderate or rude. If you don't understand this concept and it seems contradictory to  you, give it a couple years, wait till puberty ends. You'll get it.In the mean time, if you can recruit a friend, or manage to make a new one (in all honesty) there are some incredibly enjoyable mechanics in DayZ, with the backdrop of an often gorgeous and engrossing environment that I often find myself just kick my characters legs out on the side of a hill and watching the rainstorm. Very few games have been good-looking enough to make me wanna do that, but Arma2:OA is definitely one of them, as well as DayZ.If anyone has trouble surviving the plethora of errors and installation pitfalls, I'm usually willing to offer any help I can. And if you're interested in joining a group / server with me, I'm always on the look out for mature, calm players that enjoy the cooperative prospects of online games like this. Even the most knowledgeable and technically savvy players will require quite a bit of help in grasping / manipulating one of the most UN-intuitive interfaces I've ever seen, again easily comparable to the GrandCanyon'esque ""learning curve"". And even if you've been warned of everything that can and will go wrong, things will still stop you in your tracks and have you scratching your head. Many of the in-game menus are a bit convoluted, much of the environment is in Russion, and many things often have an almost ""unfinished"" feel to them. But that being said, I can admiringly say that the good certainly out-weighs the bad in my book. Just don't come alone ;) Bring a friend. Buy an extra copy or two. And work through it together. It's definitely not a 12 year olds CoD weekend-warrior FPS game.This is a cruel, harsh, unforgiving, cursed mod for an already teeth-grindingly difficult simulator of sorts. But with a little luck, and a helping hand (trust NO ONE for your first entire week, no matter what) maybe you'll uncovered the addictive, immersive, awesome-fest of DayZ			"

												In a world of so few friends, I begin to realize that we dont get to choose our friends, we dont get to decide how they act, and worse of all how that comradre is severed. There was probably a better way, but bordering on almost 20 hours with about 4 hours sleep, my mind was frazzled and couldnt see a better alternative.just 15 or so hours earlier, we had been a tightly knit unit. laughing, argueing, and generally enjoying ourselves. But one certain problem began to crop up in the group, with a specific person. There was a systematic failure to communicate. As gear began to dissapear, it was obvious, very obvious, who was stealing it. Finally when a ghillie suit disappeared, and this individual claimed to have found it in a barn, the level of distrust was pushed over the line by the lies. lies told well are one thing, but lies as transparent as this spoke to how little he thought of our intelligence. We discussed what we should do in a seperate message on steam.......................................................................................................................................I didn't pull the trigger my self, in fact, i didnt even hear the shots go off. But as i fortified my base, i also saw him leave, i hadn't even been sure when it would happen. Just as i finished making my base sealed off, i saw the words.Wolfy was killedEerie as ♥♥♥♥ for a brief secondfollowed by the exasperated sounding words ""Dude.....What the ♥♥♥♥?""The conversation that ensued was that reminiscient of an ugly Divorce. I didn't speak much during this, But he was presented with the facts. He denied these vehemently, trying to blame others. He claimed he had no choice but to kill us, now. After awhile of this i spoke up and agreed with the triggerman, he had crossed a line. the conversation degraded into denials and insults. There was nothing else to do but hang up and delete him from steam.As our reality begun to settle around us, the impact of what we had done hit us full force. the person we had spent almost 20 consecutive hours with, looting, shooting the ♥♥♥♥, and even executed several well coordinated operations with, was dead. not the kind of dead where, when he respawns he'll just meet us at base. no, this felt real. it felt real because we knew him. we knew him on a personal level. the diffrence between killing someone with whom ive never had extended interaction with, and killing wolfy was monumental. It felt real. As we discussed it and dissected what it was,and how wierd we felt, we came back to one amazing fact. An amazing fact that we have always known, one that sharply blew our minds. it was so obvious. This is a video game. How? Just How? we began to discuss that too. After having disscussed at depth for about an hour, we slowly went back to our normal habits. hunting and gathering supplies. wolfy was out of our minds soon after. However he is still in the back of our minds, and this morning after three hours of sleep i feel heart broken. I Very much expect that wolfy is equally heartbroken, but that this will be masked with rage and un-adult rated vengence. we have to relocate now, and despite this base being a dream come true. i know i cannot fight him off 24/7. i know we cannot undo what we did. words have been exchanged, actions have been taken. So with heavy hearts we pick up and move on, knowing now we have a mortal enemy...................................................................................................................................................................................All in all the level of immersion in this game is second to none. The learning curve is hard. but if you persevere you will find yourself having adventures unique and all their own. sometimes what happens is even more dramatic then any games storyline. bandits suck, yes but if you find the right server, youll have a little wiggle room. start off with smaller servers go big later.

												Day One: Met a guy. Told me a nice story. ""Once there was and ugly freshy. He was so ugly that everyone died."" Then he magically got a M4A1 and blasted my head off.Day Two: I was thinking how people said after you get gear you dont worry about zombies, BS. I was getting chased by 7-9 zombies in Cherno and died later of blood loss.Day Three: Found a helicopter I didn't know how to fly. Decided to turn on autolanding. Had to bail. 10/10 autolanding features.Day Four: Got a huge group of men to follow me around. We got guns, ghilles, and even humvees. We found a heli later on and decided to tow a humvee to it. Exploded and killed us all.TIP FOR NEW PEOPLE: Don't use towing features on servers. Solo play is hard if your planning on it. Always try to stay in a group and out of major towns.			"

												It's terrirfying at times and consistantly unnerving, it's  hard to master as there's always something impeding your progress be it bandits, untrusting/trigger happy survivors, zombies or yourself, i say yourself as it's a game that is very unforgiving in the choices you make. It contains a vast map that seems impossible to learn, only after multiple hours of playtime will you get the lay of the land. Stay on the coastline or head inland? Will you live discreetly from a tent in a forest or openly in a fortified compound?Your morality will be tested, will you be a hero (help survivors) or a bandit (kill survivors)? Will you team up with other people ingame/friends or lone wolf it? But remember obviously there are advantages and disadvantages in whatever options you choose. I highly recommend this game/mod. "

			Welcome to Chernarus. A 225 km2 open world post-soviet state and one of the areas hit by a new and presently unknown infection which has wiped out most of the world's population.		

The correct install of Arma 2 and Battleye is a pain in the ♥♥♥. Here is what works for most:1. Exit Steam. Right click Steam shortcut and select Open file location. Right click on steam.exe and select Run as administrator.2. As Administrator install both Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead.3. As Administrator play Arma 2 all the way to the multiplayer menu and exit. Then do the same for Operation Arrowhead. Don't skip this!4. Install and run dayzlauncher.comIn Dayzlauncher you can sort the servers by connection speed by clicking on PING at the top right. Click on the play arrow along the right side next to the server you want to join. You will have to click on the Steam icon on your task bar and then click OK on the confirmation window to launch each server. You will also need to wait for mods to download the first time you try to connect to a server and can check the status of downloads by clicking on MODS at the top of dayzlauncher.I recommend playing on a DayZ Epoch or Overpoch server first because most have high loot and vehicle spawns along with NPC traders making it much easier to survive.I'm loving the game!

												 If you're looking for a immersive experience where you can lose everything in an instance for not being carful ( or from falling 2 inches down stairs). This Hardcore game calls players who have patience and an Iron will to deal with the threat of Zombies and the even greater threat of players. I play on an Epoch server and im having the time of my life. I've made trusted teammates and mortal enemies. In this game you're options are almost unlimited: Farm for materials to build a huge base, Test your skills at player killing and become a powerful ""bandit"", or become a ""hero"" and befriend multiple players to create an unstoppable force. I recommend this game to experiences gamers who are looking for a psychological challenge. Both through the game and through the players you meet.			"

												Such a fun game. I never played it during the glory days (2012-13 I suppose), but still now this can thrill and challenge you.On an empty server you can play PVE style, scavenging and hunting which is great fun to begin with, but actually it's far too easy. Once you get the hang of it zombies are no threat - you can just run right by them and into a building where they suddenly become slow for no particular reason, then a quick axe to the head and you're off on your way again.So by all means learn the ropes on an empty server, but get yourself onto a full one asap. The added challenge of other players is what makes this game truly unique and thrilling. You're going to die, a lot, but that's the key point of the game. It takes time to gear up and travel to interesting places, so your character is valuable. The joy you'll feel at finding a water pump when you're thirsty is balanced perfectly with the fear of getting shot by a bandit as you drink. This game can take you on a real roller coaster ride of emotions and heart-stopping moments. Honestly, the first time you get into a car after 50 hours of endless running is just pure joy. Others in these reviews seem intent on bad-mouthing the standalone version of this game. I say get both. They're both great. This version is a simpler one, though its vehicles and the range of weapons is broader. It also has other DayZ-themed mods such as the excellent Epoch (though really that's not DayZ - too easy to get high end gear means less fear of losing it all). The standalone has far deeper mechanics for survival and player interaction which for me provides a richer and more satisfying experience. All buildings are enterable in the standalone and loot is more spread out, all of which means fewer ""hotspots"" in each location - and therefore meeting other people is more random and therefore even more heart-stopping! It also has better, more deadly zombies.			"

												In Dayz you are dropped into a world devastated by a zombie outbreak, the goal of the game is to survive all the elements that you would encounter if this was real life, such as Hunger, Thirst, Temperture and more while at the same time defending yourself from the zombies that roam the land and other survivors that might be trying to kill you for that last can of food. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of realistic games and/or zombie games. This game is one of the most entertaining games i've played and it is definitely worth the money.			"

												This is the reason I built a gaming pc. Seeing those awesome Youtube videos of others playing this open world where survival was key hit something possibly primal in me and I had to have a go myself.Still play iterations of the base mod now mainly DayZ Epoch and it still holds up in giving satisfyng gameplay solo against all odds or teamed and rolling in a pack hunting all others down.In buying Arma2 Combined Ops package I spent some of the best value money ever, hands down. The 900 odd hours i have in game are only those recorded since steam took over server duties I probably have that much time again from pre steam days.If you don't have it get it now while it is dirt cheap still plenty of active servers out there and guess what there is zombies in the game unlike certain stand alone game I shouldn't mention.

												Holy wow do I love this game, so many shooters have no lasting effect other than ""okay so I spray painted my weapon and no one else will see it except for some tosser who ran out of ammo"", but in Dayz Mod holy cow do you feel the eyes on you when you are holding a DMR or FAL somewhere somehow someone is going to want to shoot you and take that gun. I must also itterate this is the only first person shooter that I had sights on target and I hesitated and regretted the position of hostility to someone I had not yet acknowledged or they me, basically I recoiled at the idea of shooting someone for no reason and my hands began to shake (almost like Captain Miller from saving private ryan) and took a good five minutes to calm down and reasess. Powerful interactions, or best said 40 min of boredom while hiking, 20 min of scavenging, and 5 min of pure terror as you wounder where that bullet wizzing by your head came from.			"

												Want to play Day Z the way its meant to? THEN BUY BOTH ARMA 2 AND ARMA 2 OPERATION ARROWHEAD AND DOWNLOAD THIS MOD. The standalone version of Day Z is a disaster, this mod is a million times better than the ""Standalone Version"". And ive read other players reviews on how its hard to find servers? Or its hard to find servers with active people playing? You must have a connection issue because every single time i get on theres atleast 1 or 2 servers almost full of players, and a handful of other servers that are half full or less. Overall, best way to play Day Z is right here on the original mod version.			"

												As an avid ArmA 2 ACE player, I came to DayZ for a good zombie role play experience. I wanted to get involved in the world of the apocalypse, with some of the milsim mechanics from ArmA 2. When I went into DayZ, alot of things felt spectacular - the music, the map, the saturation, the user interface, etc. I really got a good first impressions of the game. However, my experience suffered after this point. The first problem with this mod is zombie AI pathing. Zombie AI is horrid, and zombies, to me, were more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ rather than something to keep me on my toes and alert in the enviorment. While the sound and models were good, there was no recompense for their buggyness. After dying to some buggy zombies, because they were so rediculous, I then came across my first player. I did not want to play as a bandit, for I wanted to collaborate with people. In my first play session, I was sniped on my treck to Chernogorsk. After many playthroughs, I could not find a single friendly person. I came to the conclusion that there was barely ANY friendly people. This is because there is no incentive to help people! When you kill someone, you get their stuff, which was more than enough reason to kill someone. There are NO pros what-so-ever to being a hero, and that is a game mechanic that needs to be fixed.When I was being fired at, I was using alot of the milsim tactics that I used in ACE. However, the blood system in the game is horrid, and forces you to get headshots or use a sniper rifle on your opponent. I was in one firefight where I had an M4A1 CCO, and my opponent had an M9SD. After putting FIVE body shots into him, he shot me in the head once with his pistol, and that was the end of it. In a regular game of ArmA, my combatant would have been dead in a heartbeat. This mechanic really needs to be fixed.I really love the concept of DayZ, I really do. But the game is such a jumbled mess at the moment that needs to flesh out its mechanics and fix its formula to be a worthy mod. Zombie AI pathing needs to be fixed, hacking needs to be fixed, player interaction needs to be more dynamic, combat should be better, and camping should be less of an issuse. DayZ tries hard to be the ultimate zombie apocalypse simulator, but it really needs to work out its kinks before I get lost in the universe. If you are on the same boat with me, you may take interest in the DayZ Standalone, where hopefully, some of these issues will be adressed; and hell, that game looks promising.			"

												Pros:- the mod has a whole bunch of weapons and attachments you can use- it's realistic, for instance getting shot in the leg causes it to break- it's alive, what i mean by this is that servers are still full of people even though there's dayz standalone- the mod itself is free- free russian language lessons- there is a small amount of '' little microphone squeekers'' so you don't usually have to mute anyone- there is little to none hackers thanks to the auto kick systemCons:- it's unoptimised - there is a whole bunch of people with high end rigs that can't get 30 fps and i'm not only talking about playing in big cities- it's like cs go when it comes to russians - about 60% people in all servers are russians that speak absolutely NO english (atleast from what i have seen)- the mod is extremely glitchy, it has tons of bugs and most of them are pretty f*cking annoying, for instance zombies hear you from a mile away if not cautious, walk through stairs, doors, gates and when they run after you they usually literally make f*cking circles around you, run away and then come back for you when you thought they lost you- bandits in this game are annoying - whether you're a fresh spawn or not they'll shoot you on sight without any questions asked, but the worst type of bandit is the one that says that is friendly and then shoots you in the back when you turn aroundOverall, i think the game's really great and really fun even though it has some cons here but still i definitely recommend it>9/10			"

												Well goodie you can write a review on Dayz in steam nowWell I first started playing this game back in August 2012, Entered a server my buddy sent me, spawned in to a very dark night, a flashlight and sounds of zombies around me... turned on the flashlight and I see teh zombies walking around without batting an eye to me, finally my friend showed up and we headed to a elektro (one of the main cities) and since then I fell in love with the game.Never trust people completely: A lot of the player base is a bunch of a--holes who just want to steal gear and wouldn't care to shoot you down on sight, so be very careful. that is the main rule for this gameand yes the game is a little buggy but it is a heck lot better than standalone which was a big dissappointment filled with crap juice. stopped playing a year ago, decided to install the game again but this time on steam instead of DayzCommander and wow it still getting updates, though there aren't many servers, there is still one vanilla dayz server i'm playing on which is stable and brings me the same goosebumps and joyment i've got when the game was at its prime.I recommend to get this game with a buddy or two for teh full experience.

												This is, and will always be one of my favorite games of all time. I have so many stories of this game and I continue to make more stories every day. The best part about DayZ, is that you never know what is going to happen next, you could die, get a squad wipe, meet a friend that will be your friend for life, get backstabbed, find a DMR, find a can of beans, make a base, find a base, this game is all about what is going to happen next. This is my second favorite game of all time and it will be for life. The fan-base that this small mod has created is fantastic. There is only a few good servers left, but hell... Everyone knows everyone now. I just want to say thank you Dean Hall for making this fantatic piece, if DayZ never existed, I don't see myself playing video games. (10/10)			"

												OK so the first month I got this game I played it for 100 hours, I had made a team of 4 (including me), we all skyped together and had a great time in the server that we were on, I remember the huge gun fights we would have with other groups. It was the best time ive had in a game since forever, this game really made me feel like I was in the zombie world from having to trust others and loot and kill just to survive. This game is a good game and will most likly be the best game to play with a team of at least 3-5, Its really fun to stalk other players in the game then snipe them when they arent looking and just the feeling of finding a DMR and going out to hunt players is just awesome. Anyway I would buy this game if you have at least a GTX 560ti and a i5 to play it because sometimes you can get down to 20 fps but the game feels smooth as 60 when its really on 30 fps, but after my 166 hours I stopped playing this game because I lost contact with my team and it was pretty boring just running around alone.

Forever.Think about that.I've dumped so many hours, money and time and friends into DAYZ MOD, I had birthdays surrounding it and weekend pc gaming parties all focused on this one mod.Its that amazingly addictive.The rush you get from seeing a guy dart across the screen while you hide in the trees, deciding to take his life and risk your own, no other game has reached that for me. Every other game seems ""boring"" in comparison.Buy ARMA 2 combined ops and download this mod and try it.Its alot of bugs and weird UI and controls but once you get past it, you can see why it feels so epic and real.

												The darkness of the forest leaves you restless as you wait just in the treeline a few hundred meters away from the airfield. Pulling out your rifle, you switch on your nightvision, and aim down the southern side of the runway to the helicopter for the third time. Satisfied that no players have boarded the chopper, you put away your rifle and finally head down to the hangers about a hundred meters from the bird. Stopping just behind the fifth hanger from the north, you check the area once more for hostiles, only this time a bullet barely misses your head and slams harmlessly into a tree twenty away. Instinctively you back away behind the hanger and flank around to the other side, making sure no players threaten you from behind. Peeking from the front of the hanger, you identify the shooter, pull out your rifle, and take the shot. As you pull the trigger, three things happen; firstly, you killed the hostile player that shot at you moments ago, secondly, you've just alerted the player hiding inside the hanger to your presence, and lastly, you've alerted the mass of zombies patroling the airfield looking for fresh meat. Flanking back around to the back of the hanger, you then sprint for the chopper you've worked so hard to repair, only to get shot by the player inside the hanger you used as cover.Experiences like these are hard to come by. And ArmA 2 does it right.			"

												Note: Once you load the mod it doesn't really count the hours but I have over 1000+ hours on DayZ including all different mods like Overwatch, Epoch, Overpoch, Origins, Vanilla, that weird ww2 dayz, and alot of other modsDayZ, this game is just great. You have a awesome survival simulator with zombies and you can also play it with your friends to survive the apocalypse. There are also other mods that can extend the experience even more if you dont like JUST surviving. Personally, Vanilla DayZ is my favorite because to me its scary compared to other mods.If you want to survive, loot, and thrive with your friends all while being worried about zombies and other players who may or may not try to kill you, play Vanilla.If you dont like zombies and you just wanna PVP, base build, and trade, go with epoch/overwatch. These 2 mods or both of them combined (Overpoch) change the experience by adding in traders and base building.Also, if your new to DayZ you should visit FrankieOnPCin1080p and view his series. He teaches you to play the game all while having a cinematic experience. Here's his first video.

												An amazing game, my time does now matter I have spent count less amount of hours on the mod. It's proberly the best game i've ever played, by you're self its no fun but when you're with a clan its a whole different ball park. Imgiane rolling in one of the main towns in a humvee with a .50 cal while a Blackhawk is giving you covering fire while you try to dodge the bulletes of an opposing clan, or when you're stalking other players at night armed with a DMR, a ghillie and a pair of Night Vision Goggles which leads up to a ten kill streak and ending in a giant fire fight. Then when thats all over and you start runing back to base you and your whole squad is killed by a sniper team and you have to restart all over and you know why you restart all over? Because you had a blast doing the same to other players, this game is not for people who do not like taking their time or those who like fast action 24/7 and depending on what you play Ex. Epoch,Overwatch Etc. You have to build a base while doing all the above but its worth it! You will meet amazing people and have fun at it but you WILL rage quit and you WILL lose evrything at one point in time, but over all I'd say its worth it.			"

												Definetly one of my favorite post apocalyptic games, and that means something because thats my favorite game genre :Dbut it does lack some crucial elements that do stand out when you play. Very fun yet very buggy but it doesnt comepletly ruin the game. If you like zombie survival games then this is striaght up your alley! It has a ton of scavenging and murdering and all those goodies! I do reccomend this if you like zombie games but if you're just looking for post apocalyptic games then I would recommend Arma 2's Wasteland survival. It is basicaly DayZ without zombies or random drops. Anyways it is truly a great game without all the bugs. I would get it if you like zombie games but if you don't then I wouldn't think this is for you.Things that realy stood out:Amount of bugs: 6/10Design: 8/10Lasting appeal: 7/10OVERALL: a fair 7.5/10			"

												The DayZ Mod is a masterpiece in my opinion, And I dont understand the people that say they dont play it because its broken. Its really not, But thats their opinion and they are probably hipsters of videogames also. This game has evolved from a very basic survival game to a very complex web of mods and different ways to play. The modding community have done alot to DayZ that will probably make it forever better then the Standalone. Unless the Standalone is equally or better to make mods for.			"

												Arma 2 dayz is a very good game with loads to explore and do! The basics are get friends, Stay away from the hordes and keep away from anyone hostile! This is a very fun game but has a few learning curves but apart from that this game is a very solid game with stunning graphics! and lots of land to explore! There is a few severs still running on the game but not as many as there used to  due to the release of Arma 3 dayz mod and the Dayz Standalone, but there is still a good amount of players to interact with and to team up with, but just remember be careful who you trust! Overall: This game is very good and as shown by the famous youtuber Frankieonpcin1080p, I give this game a 8.5/10 would recommend anyone playing this when you get the chance as it's still a great game no matter what! :)			"

												Well besides the constant frame drop and the occasional DDOS attacks, DayZ Seems to be a game that I would recommend to anybody who has a grand computer. Now you dont even need a grand computer to play this game either. Trust me I have logged over 800 hours on this game and every single second I play I am getting below 20 frames, but when I zoom in on the long range of my  Mosin the frames just wipe away and its aftermath is beatiful. I recommend this game for all jump scare, thrill seeking, heart stoping, bunny bashing, zombie killing, fps, and third person gamer out there.10/10 "

												not the best programmed mod but really addictive, the only game that give me adrenaline in firefights  ,after all the time you spend finding the best gear you dont want to die , it make it really stressful in firefight and the thrill of finding the one who killed you , tracking em down and killing them back is a intense task i really recommend this game . Crazy adventures are waiting for you if you download it (may contain toxic players but killing them and stealing their stuff is more than satisfying)			"

												After purchasing Arma CO for a discounted bundle I managed to install this game. Guys if you get installation errors it's most likely the dayz mod you installed from steam. Simply redownload it and it should work fine now. That's what I did when Arma says Missing content. Anyways when you play the game BE SURE to play in a morning server because the worst mistake I did was to play in a server in night time which I got instantly killed over. The game is good though and lots of people to trust/not trust but I never encountered one due to my short gameplay.			"

												Help, ZOMBIES!DayZ is a amazing game and the mod will probably almost always be the best, there's currently a standalone but for anybody who wants a minimal amount of glitches then I highly recommend this.There's only one issues I have with this, sometimes it does work and sometimes it doesn't; it works soo much better through the DayZ Commander.Requires quite a good computer and is extremely hard to learn but still is incredibly fun!

												MANY long and fun hours to be had, for those of you that arent aware you can play your more advanced DayZ and im not talking just your Vanilla basic DayZ mod version. Simply Install DayZ Launcher and from there you are able to experience it from a whole different level, there are many great servers but sadly not as much as there once use to be. But the remaining servers are very fun and still very populatedThrough the DayZ Launcher you will find you will be able to install different mods and maps for DayZ which all improve the gameplay for those who are playing, for example DayZ Epoch mod a much more improved version and there are many othersNow as for this launcher one can easily find and download from the website on the web. (Note There once use to be other launchers such as this.. say for example DayZ Commander which no longer works, I believe the only working launcher for Arma 2 is DAYZ Launcher.[Links for the launchers]1.) https://dayzlauncher.com   (By far the easiest launcher)2.) http://customcombatgaming.com (Appears to only support ARMA 3 now)3.) Just so you all are aware do not use this launcher as it no longer works -> http://www.dayzcommander.com/Also be aware DayZ isnt just for Arma 2 alone, there are some incredible and hugely populated servers for ARMA 3 ALSOA GREAT AND POPULAR YOUTUBER WHO I REALLY APPRECIATE FOR THE GREAT DEAL OF QUALITY IN ALL HIS VIDEOS IS FRANKIE ON PC !! His Youtube is as follows you seriously wont regret it =>https://www.youtube.com/user/FRANKIEonPCin1080p   "

												You may need a good computer to run this on high graphics for this game. But even when the game is on medium graphics it looks fine. Also away from the graphics, overall it's a good mod/game. Basiclly you playing a apocalypse world of zombies and other people trying to survive, so while you play the game zombies is the not the only thing you need to worry about. Also you need to worry about bandits trying to kill you. (Other players) But also there's good people you can team up with and dominate the map in a helicopter full of people to a bus full of people. So there's lots of things you can do. So I recommend this game although you will need Arma II and Arma II Operation Arrowhead to get Dayz the mod it's fine just get it when it's on sale. Anyway I rate this game a 9.0 out of 10. "

												DayZ is really good game!!! Best way to spend your time with friends. You see that i have only a couple of hours playing DayZ, thats because i play it using DayZ commander, I played it more than 1000 hours! Youll never get bored of it! Some recommendations:1. Be patient (wait for zombies to go away and than go), do not attack zombies whith firearms (other will hear) use hachet or crowbar to attack them.2. Try to find any type of vehicle.3. Do not run in cities or villages.4. Always free space for food and water.5. Whatch out - there are many snipers6. DO NOT TRUST ANYONE - if someone says he or she is friendly you'll probably get killed.7. KILL EVERYONE THAT YOU SEE, OR RUN IF HE HAS A WEAPON.8. ALWAYS LEAVE ONE BULLET IN MAGS, THAN DISCONECT TO LOBBY AND PRESS OK TO COME IN GAME AGAIN, your mag will be full9. Spend some hours in Arma 2 to learn to gear			"

												Overall a unique great sandbox FPS with a lot of potential.Positives:Sandbox, gathering , building, PVP, it has it allNegatives:The game lacks optimisation, hitboxes & otehr aspects are affected,Character animation is slow & sketchy, the the inventory & picking upitems is cumbersome, loading into servers is slow & can be troublesome.If you look past these issues the positives are still enough to warrant playingas the games fun with friends especially, there are a wide variety of serversrunning different mods/featurees to suit everyone.This mod runs far better on Arma 3 & is a lot more optimised & less issues,but the Arma 2 features/mods/servers tend to be prefered by many ppl still.There are only few games like this & they are not as good, even the standaloneisnt as good (yet) & is taking far to long, i've been playing this game for years& its one you always come back too if you game hop.

												Because I use the dayz commander the time played does not match how much time I've actually played. I've put in a good 100+ hours. This mod has a very harsh and steep learning curve if you come from other, more conventional zombie games. It is rewarding when you learn how to play.Pros :- Zombie Simulator- Large map that supports quite a few players- Multiple different game types- Multiple different game maps, I think they are borrowed from Arma 2, but I don't know because I don't really play core Arma.Cons:- STEEP learning curve- Very frustrating when you die and loose all of your loot- Buggy- Most servers are very PvP oriented to the point that there is really no teamwork.

												A must have for anyone who likes the Arma series, this addon allows you to team up with your friends build a base and whilst under constant fear of being sniped you can traverse the map gathering weapons and gear and take on not only those pesky zombies but all the other human players u can find, this game suits the casual gamer to the hard core with some servers going full military and others going minimal its easy to find a server that suits your needs and game style. A definite must for anyone wanting to sit on the edge of their seat or rage as a newbie!			"

												On one hand, DayZ is a military simulator, with all the makings of one: Bullet drop, the constant need for camouflage, and a mind-boggling ammunition system that, while being fair, forces memorization, as each weapon has its own independent ammunition. Sorry, but no shared ammo between multiple assault rifles. That M4 and AK-74 each need their own magazines. On the other hand, DayZ is also a game of survival in a brutal apocalyptic world. Not for a single second will this game hold your hand. You'll be required to cross large stretches of zombie-infested terrain to find food, water, and weapons to survive. It could be argued that your fellow survivors are just as dangerous as the infected. The big question that will ultimately shape your experience in this game is whether or not you will make an attempt to reach out and help your fellow player in his or her mission to survive.As you play, you will generally find that it seems as if the whole game is against you, and is actively attempting to either starve, shoot, or slash you to death. You wouldn't be wrong. Supplies are scarce, and zombies are common. Depending on your server population (and the nature of its community), you may also have anything from massive friendly settlements to small, trigger-happy groups of survivors attempting to forge their own way in the world. The farther you move from urban environments, the harder it will become to find things like weapons, ammunition and medical supplies. This will, eventually, force you into a situation where heading into a city is your only option. This by itself is not necessarily a bad thing: Guns, first-aid supplies and even army uniforms are all rather common in these areas. The only thing to be wary of is the watchful eye of a potential sniper.Your enjoyment of this game will stem only from your eagerness for realism and/or your hunger for a challenge. Play this game at your own risk, for it will be a long, difficult journey. But, if you are successful, you will have accumulated knowledge and power, the likes of which few survivors have ever seen.			"

												I love this game, simply for the fun you can have with friends.Take DayZ: Standalone, for example. That game isn't even in Beta since 3 years!Arma 2: DayZ is just cool because it's already a finished game! Okay, okay, Arma physics sometimes breaks your legs all of the sudden although you fell from a tabel but ... if we ignore that, this DayZ Mod is fun!,Finding gear and stuff takes you long but after all that's real life. You won't have awesome fire fights 24/7.Why I got this mod? From the beginning, I played this game and it just screams good old memories everytime I see the title in my steam library. The days when you could run around in a Squad with 5 people? The people shouting friendly all over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map? Or those times when you found a chopper, laughed your ♥♥♥ off when you realise that you're surrounded by zombies AND the chopper is pretty much useless since everything is broken? That moment when you find an awesome sniper rifle, sniping in a town and than realising that there's bullet drop?This Mod is perfect for people who like a realistic approach towards the whole ""Zombie Apocalypse"" Scenario. Betrayal, greed and hostility is everywhere and this just intensifies the overall game experience. You can't trust anyone. ESPECIALLY those who act like Military ... looking at you Lieutenant Dysteriylz! I'm gonna find you ...Also, the ambient sounds are f***ing awesome!			"

												Can't find any servers, they always say my version or whatever is outdated.. When its not.When I find servers, there are either no vehicles, no english people, no friendlys, too many zombies...ALWAYS MODIFIED SERVERSNO REGULAR SERVERSWHERE THERE ARE DECENT AMOUTN OF LOOT, ZOMBIES, VEHICLES, AND ACTUAL FRIENDLY PLAYERS!If you can find a friendly player, then trust him with your life. Team with him, and watch eachothers backs, because the world of DayZ is incredibly dangerous. You could stumble into a bandit camp, and be shot to death. Walk through a town, and be sniped. Lose enough blood? No problem, you'll only become unconcious... But, the major problem with becoming unconcious, is, if a lone player (or zombie) stumbles across you... you're dead meat. That zombie will rip into your flesh and kill you. However, if a FRIENDLY lone player finds you, they hopefully will heal you and stuff. Because heres how heroes work: Find injured player > heal him > suffer consequences if he is hostile Anyway, its fun, and a great experience if you can find a good server.			"

												Yes, it's bugged and the bandit-to-survivor ratio seems off, and it runs aprox 16-30 fps on my computer. But the game is epic and some of the most fun I've had playing in years. If you're new to this (like I am), install DayZ Launcher, makes everything much simpler. Slow-paced, nerve-wrecking and tons of fun.			"

												This is better than the standalone, by a mile. If you want proof, just go watch gameplay of first the Standalone and then the mod. Way more custom stuff to do, and maybe cheaper depending on your exhange rate and when ARMA 2 is on sale.Don't ever invest in Early Access, unless it's overwhelmingly positive, because it'll never turn out well. Unless you convert the entire engine like Rust and start again from square 1.DayZ standalone sucks, Arma 2: DayZ is miles better.			"

The game never gets boring as it has files upon files of mods you can add to the game - AND PLAY MULTIPLAYER WITH THEM.

												I recommend this game because it is one of my personal favorite survival games.  It most definitely demonstrates what surviving against other people and zombies in a huge open world map would be like.One of the things that really stuck out to me is the fact that you get GREAT FPS, almost no lag whatsoever.  I own DayZ Standalone as well as this, and comparing the two, I've found that the Mod runs so much smoother.  I don't have the best computer, but that just proves my point even more since my computer can still handle the Mod.  And I'm not just saying I get no lag on the lowest settings, I can run the game on the highest video settings possible and it still runs as if I was playing Minecraft on the lowest settings, now that's damn good.The gameplay is extremely good for being a mod.  The mod proposes fair fights for survival against other players, as well as surviving against the environment despite other people arguing against this just because they died too many times.  I enjoy every minute of the game, even when I die.  To me dying in this game just means a brand new start and a chance to get even better gear.  You definitely learn what to do and what not to do.  The game has concequences for your actions as if you were really in a zombie apocalypse, and that just adds to the fact that the game is almost as realistic as you can get.My favorite thing on this game is the size of the map.  It's just huge.  Plain and simple.  You never run out of places to go and boredom is hard to achieve.  The size of cities/towns are acceptable, and the distance between them proposes that ""journey"" aspect that we all love about free roam.  Lastly, the game proposes a challenge.  Zombies are a ♥♥♥♥♥ in the beginning, but once you get weapons and such, you have bigger problems to prepare for.  Sickness, starvation, dehydration and other people.  You always have something to worry about, and that just makes the definition of survival even more present in this game.  It is survival of the fittest, and if you're not good enough, you WILL die.  That just means you have to adapt and learn to become the character you're playing as.Of course I do have a few things that I dislike that I feel like I should share with readers.-The inventory system isn't that great, It's really complicated.  I had a very hard time getting used to it, but after a while I had it down.-Zombie AI blows, it's very hard to melee or shoot a zombie if you're not good at shooting targets that jerk back and forth or do unexpected things such as run away.-The amount of controls you have to learn and master is insane.  But once again, once you learn, you don't forget.-There are so many buildings that you wish you could go into, but you can't.  Cities are made up of a ♥♥♥♥ ton of houses, and other structures but a good number of them are just decoration unfortunately.  This was quite annoying to me.-If you are just starting out, it is a real pain in the ♥♥♥ to try outrunning zombies if you don't have a weapon of some sort.  These cons are most definitely outweighed by the pros.  Watching a tutorial will help with some of these such as the control and inventory problems as well as finding ways to get past zeds when you're a fresh spawn.In conclusion, I reccomend this game for people who love a good free roam apocalyptic PVP survival game with a good challenge.  BUY IT! it's worth it!			"

												This is an amazing game that has alot of multiplayer experience. It may have a few bugs and glitches, but alot better then the standalone, like alot. I would recommend for you to install this along with your Arma II. I hope this review helped you on wether or not to buy the game, and in my opinion its a good game to just play around on. However... There is a few 12 year old admins that just ban people and kick them for no reason, but other then that its good. .-.			"

(okay i admit i got banned for cheating but im clean now)this is a really good gaem to play because it was the start of all the other ones.  yeah standalone/rust/the forest/reign of kings/ark/whatever other game there is or will be...it all started here.most games you dont really care if you die...well in this game you spend hours and hours looting...you sure will be angry/sad if you die.  so it makes the game a lot more fun.standalone even made this even better with handcuffs and drinking disinfectant...you knock someone out or maybe make someone surrender...then you handcuff them.  and you take all their stuff and they beg you ""no please dont kill me!!  take everything i have but let me live!!!  please!!!"" and theyre begging and crying and you can make them drink disinfectant or shoot them or let them go...its the choice that makes it fun...hahaso yeah i would recommend it			"

												This game was the greatest zombie survival i've ever played. Basically Arma II w/ zombies and other stuff. 30/10 recommended. Also has decent graphics, Vehicles, running into a bunch of bandits, teaming up to survive and what not. You also walk around like ALOT until you get a vehicle. The only bad thing about the game is that you need a decent server, that saves your progress and actually WORKS. This is a huge problem. Finding servers are very, very hard. Most of them are HAAAx'd. DayZ commander solves that issue, but it still hard to find a server but way easier and more managable. Now the DayZ Standalone is released is comes back more awesome. Must play.			"

												Not sure if you want to get DayZ Standalone or looking for something with more features?  Then look no further!  The Arma 2 DayZ Mod is great, and has so many different features already implemented.  Base building, vehicles, zombies, zombies, and more zombies!  I will say it is a bit of work to get it going, because as far as I know you actually cannot find any servers by loading up the DayZ Mod.  Here is what you will need to play this mod:-Arma 2 (paid)-Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead (paid)-DayZ Mod (free)-DayZ Commander (free, outside program from steam)You install all those items and then just run arma 2, arma 2 OA, and DayZ Mod once so it can do the first time setup.  Then you will never touch those programs again in steam, you will use DayZ Commander to update and launch the game.  You feel up to all that?  If you do, you like zombie survival, with big servers full of friendly players (or not friendly) then give this a go!  "

But after I got a couple of mates together I was soon finding myself drawn back into it time and time again.Despite the bugs, which can be forgiven because of the mod's Alpha status, this game provides an extremely immersive experience (for lack of a better term). With no missions or story presented to the player, it's up to yourself to decide your goals alongside the basic premise of simply surviving. Perhaps that's not to everyone's taste, but the stories I've been able to tell because of both successful and failed expeditions are amazing. Many a tense moment has been spent risking everything to try and get some powerful weapons or because of a frantic dash for medical supplies while close to death.A steep difficulty curve and frustrating inventory system are totally worth pushing through for some of the most exciting moments I've had playing a game with friends.

												What a nice mod! I've played many zombo games before but this one is just great. The feeling of harsh survival  is omnipresent,    threats are everywhere (either Zeds or mostly other players), a very nice detailled world filled with point of interests, quite simple UI that won't hide your field of view, option to play in third or first person when traveling or in combat and of course lots of looting to be done. Add to that the concept of perma-death a.k.a. when-you-die-you-gotta-start-over-for-real, you really have to evaluate the risks you are taking in-game. Be a Survivor, a Heroe or an infamous Bandit, the choice is yours but we all start as a ""Bambie"". Dayz mod is an impressive game and totally one to be tried. Worth your time.

												Arma 2 brings in a simulation of what it is like to go behind enemy lines in a russian area. The character movement/gameplay is slow as I waited 4 minutes when the coast was clear to move up or the mission would fail, and I know its supposed to be realistic, but for a fps gamer we want it to go fast :D			"

												This game is, by all accounts, the biggest, most grotesque, life destroying, yet so damn fun waste of time you'll ever get aquainted with. With Bandits, Zombies, and ARMA 2's phys engine, you get all the fun of a zombie apocalypse, while remaining perfectly fed, sane, and not being eaten alive in your own home. Hijack cars, kill zombies, get killed by Chernosnipers, this game has it all. And although it nearly murdered my GPU, I must give this game a 9.5 out of 10.

So exciting! My wife got shot over 40 times by men that had a helicopter! they took us into the helicopter, saying were we hostage! Me and my son we so excited that we got a free island tour in a helicopter, the men then took us to a mountain and left us there while talking our maps,food,water, and supplies! :D The natives are a little fiesty but its so fun! we even met a person who was shooting all the 'natives'! My son got his arm torn off by one of them! Our hotel was in Elektro, and it was FREE! There was nobody at the front door nor the check-in table! We also took more pictures at Balota, and Berizno! Its the most amazing vacation you will ever have with the family!I rate this a 10/10!			"

-Disclosure (I only bought this during Christmas, therefore being quite a late DayZ Player.)For a game that has been abandoned by it's developers due to Standalone and Arma 3, I still believe that this game has a good vibe to it. Survival aspects are cool, however my main issues are as of follows;Issues~1. Glitches, granted it's a Mod however, I'm sure if the developers gave the game a few more months to perhaps stabalize it, and maybe code it better? Then maybe it will have an affect on the communities attitude towards the game and perhaps wouldn't have them quitting due to their hard work lost by a zombie that glitched through a wall and knocked them off the edge of a tower.2. Small Player Base, which creates a dead aspect towards Multiplayer. The big servers are your only hope, and even then it has about 40+ players sometimes, and in my opinion it's difficult to find loot on such populated servers meaning your experience isn't as spectacular as you would've seen from perhaps a Youtubers or Streamers POV.In conclusion, I do not recommend DayZ, just because the player base is slowly decreasing, although, my opinion may change in the future. Even though the game is dying, I am not prepared to declare it a bad game. So for the communities experience, I would suggest not buying the Combined Operations Pack which allows you to install DayZ Mod for full price which in GBP is £16.99, however, on sale I have seen it being reduced to £3.49. So perhaps on sale, sure buy it for the sake of it being quite a big PC Game. Rating on gameplay: 5/10 "

												Short version: I started playing this game without having tried Arma II yet. I had no idea what I was doing, got shot at in the first few seconds and then got mauled by a zombie. 10/10Second playthrough, long version. Started off way to the southeast of the map (map takes you like well over a couple hours to cross by the way, it's pretty huge), killed a dozen zombies with a machete and nearly died trying to get into a building. Made my way 3 kilometers north to a major town while being unable to find a single scrap of food and only getting empty water bottles. Killed another dozen on my way sneaking in, filled up my water bottles and had a whole minute to drink before I got swarmed. Racked my way up to ~50 kills while barely conscious before I backed up onto a hospital roof, with the hospital now surrounded by zombies. Ate the food and water I'd managed to scrounge up, slipped down the rear ladder that only had a few zombies by it. Quietly chopped them up and slipped in, to find no medical supplies. Headed north to a military airfield, hoping it had a medical bay. On my way, found a jeep loaded with a rifle and some ammo, stole it and kept heading north. Got to the airfield, picked up an M16 but couldn't get any medical supplies. Headed off to the woods and logged off.Logged back in, drove back to the airfield and got shot by a sniper. Spawned a while away, found a second (glitched) copy of my jeep that someone had taken and crashed to the side of the road, probably dying inside it. Got in, headed back to the airfield, shot the bandit with a full mag from my glock before coming up behind him and inserting a machete into his rectal area. Got my gear back, the medical supplies I no longer needed, a new giant backpack, and a choice of the items from the 4 other dead bodies he'd killed that were laying around. Shanked some more zombies, headed in the woods with a fully loaded military jeep and an assault rifle fitted with a grenade launcher.

												After the hundreds of hours spent playing this game, I can say with full confidence that it is the closest to perfect zombie survival game out there. I've tried others, but the sheer scale of the game is jaw-dropping, and the realism is incredible. However, the bugs, glitches, desync and countless amount of other problems are a drawback, but aren't enough to throw me off. A solid 8/10, but would be much more if not for the problems encountered by most players. I just hope the standalone can impress in the later stages of its development, as it is currently an awful piece of trash, but has lots of potential.			"

												DayZ Mod is a beautiful experience. This is the mod that started the early-access survival game genre. You can expect the same gameplay and bugs that were present when the game came out. I really enjoy Arma 2 and its open world. The loot and zombies are secondary to the encounters and pvp you will encounter on this adventure. I would recommend playing on a vanilla server such as Europa and US434.			"

												DayZ is a brilliant mod and soon to have its own standalone game. Best played with a group of friends/players but can also be played alone. Also be prepared to trek the whole map (which is 100km2 ) to maximise how well you do in game. You do have to be prepared to gather alot of 'loot' and prepare to loose it in a second. The mentality of the players for the game has changed since it's growing popularity and now alot of players will shoot of sight. You might get lucky and get the one friendly guy but that's one in a million.A couple things to note before getting the mod:1. DayZ Standalone Alpha(er) is soon to be released so If you have patience, maybe waiting for the SA is a good idea2. The game is not well optimized with alot of players complaining about FPS. In the open fields you will reach your maximun FPS but towns and build up areas will effect your FPS.3. If you aren't into games which involve talking to people, just be warned that comunication with others players will slow with swapping between different chat channels, talking and moving is slightly complicated.There are alot of other factors that go with the mod like using external programs to search through servers and error problems but google is your friend and you can easily find a fix.

They were killing some guys, when i decided to kill 2 of them, which i did :D ( i killed 2 guys with a glock and 1 had an AK-47, and the other an Lee Enfield) after looting them i noticed there was another guy like 5 metrs behind me telling me to put down my guns. That scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me so i got on my bike whiche was next to me and started to pedal away. I was so lucky that, that guy didnt know how to shoot, but almost killed me, i had 2000 blood left (max is 12000), and a broken leg. i drow my bike in too the woods, patched up and noticed that there was a heli above me and 2 humvees behind me, so i ran farther, i shot the heli, so it would fly away, so it did. But then i remembered the humvees. I ran into the nearest city and hid in a barn, i thought that i lost then, but they knew that i was some where close. i saw 4 of them looking for me and i managed to kille 2 of them and disconnect. the i got on my bike and ran again, till the got bored of chasing me...-------------------------------------------16/10 - would raid with a glock again :D-------------------------------------------------If you want to find out how to play and install dayz mod properly, contact me,plz, il be happy to help you, it wont take much time, depends on your internet connection :)			"

												Better than the standalone from what I heard, the DayZ mod is an extremely well done Arma 2 Combined Operations mod. With the great gameplay and tons of heated moments this game is great for anybody that is into survival and action games. There are some downsides though, for one the steam download is out of date, so you need to use a 3rd party software like DayZ Commander to properly lauch the game you also need a decent computer to run the game efficiently, but if you are really persistant you shouldn't have a problem running it at 30fps on lowest settings using intel integrated graphics 4000, but overal this game is great and much much better than anything else like it. Buy the games and get this mod!			"

												A interesting fun mod that defintely is fun. To get this to work if you cant join servers cause it says bad version or whatever, download dayz commander from the internet ok? then lauch it then go to install/update then if DayZ 1.8.0.3 is corrupt then click fix, after that (THIS BIT IS IMPORTANT) scroll down to dayz epoch then download that cause this will allow you to join pretty much all servers, the download for epoch takes a while but after its done join a server thru dayz commander then if you want to join a different server then you can do it!. REMEMBER YOU MUST JOIN A SERVER THRU DAYZ COMMANDER AND IF YOU GET DISCONNECTED THEN JOIN ANOTHER ONE hope this review/guide helped!			"

												I liked the Idea of the Mod but I'm just going to pick on Gameplay. Imagine you spend 1.5hrs trying to find a gun and you get killed by a zombie or player who you assumed was friendly. The devs have to cut back on zombies and disable their run features, they should only crawl or walk slow. I get it's a SHTF situation but you would survive if you were in a group. Fortunatly for me I often get chased for 10-20 km's by zombies and I do marathons. I would reccomend the Mod, but I would reccomend to balance Zombies, Weapons, Players, Resources, Gameplay			"

I still prefer when there were more Z even if its more laggy!It was all about the Z, it was hard to survive, so getting to hero or bandit was just so freak and rewardful!Install both ARMA II thingy from steam, and pop the commander!Get dayz commander, find the most popular mod for arma II and there you go!Dont waste time on steam with DAYZWithout the Z, it's not the same.But i look foward to play with friends!

												Better than the standalone from what I heard, the DayZ mod is an extremely well done Arma 2 Combined Operations mod. With the great gameplay and tons of heated moments this game is great for anybody that is into survival and action games. There are some downsides though, for one the steam download is out of date, so you need to use a 3rd party software like DayZ Commander to properly lauch the game you also need a decent computer to run the game efficiently, but if you are really persistant you shouldn't have a problem running it at 30fps on lowest settings using intel integrated graphics 4000, but overal this game is great and much much better than anything else like it. Buy the games and get this mod!			"

												A interesting fun mod that defintely is fun. To get this to work if you cant join servers cause it says bad version or whatever, download dayz commander from the internet ok? then lauch it then go to install/update then if DayZ 1.8.0.3 is corrupt then click fix, after that (THIS BIT IS IMPORTANT) scroll down to dayz epoch then download that cause this will allow you to join pretty much all servers, the download for epoch takes a while but after its done join a server thru dayz commander then if you want to join a different server then you can do it!. REMEMBER YOU MUST JOIN A SERVER THRU DAYZ COMMANDER AND IF YOU GET DISCONNECTED THEN JOIN ANOTHER ONE hope this review/guide helped!			"

												Quick Note: I have many more hours in game, however since I started using DayZ Commander  to play DayZ Epoch Servers, it doesn't continue listing.In DayZ, death is inevitable... You'll start of in a massive setting you know nothing about, with no clue where to go or what to do. You'll likely try to be quick on your feet to find some useful stuff to survive, which will more then likely get you killed, and yet, you'll want to try again. Slowly you'll learn it's better to sneak around in the shadows and crawl for hundreds of feet on your belly simply to find some Frank n Beans, then before long you'll be set with supplies, proud of your accomplishments, possibly even finding a nice ride to store your loot and get around safetly until.... An unnoticed survivor in the distance decides to take your head off with his DMR. This game can be brutaly hard in the wrong situations, but very fun and fulfilling in the right ones, just remember the zeds are plenty, and trust no one because most these survivors would kill their own mother for a can of Pepsi.I'd suggest anyone who wishes to play this should get DayZ Commander and update the mod to better versions with more functionality providing more immersion. As stated above, I now play DayZ Epoch, which adds a great deal to the game. I myself have chosen to go onto PvE servers where players team up to survive and take on the Zeds and AI Bandits and love it. This mod will surely give me thousands of hours of gameplay, and not very many games can pull that off for me. I'm way behind everyone else getting into this DayZ craze, I avoided it for a long time because despite all the die hard fans, a lot complained about bugs and issues, but I myself have run into very few bugs (Most of which were on the basic version installed here on Steam) and none of them were game breaking. If you see ArmA2 Combined Ops on sale, buy it.			"

												DayZ Review:I entered the game. I got a message, ""Cannot connect to servers"" I'm shaking. I put on my cardboard decoy of the oculus rift as I enter this zombie infested land. I hear people walking towards me. ""Take the dog out!"" I hear. My friend told me to say I'm friendly. ""I'm Friendly"" I shout. I feel what felt like a punch to my stomach. The man left. I look at the bottom right of my stomach. I'm starving. I can't get to the fridge... It's to far away. I'm also thirsty but when am I not? I swear everything is blurring out... This game is feeling too real. I went down the stairs to see 3 guys, a man who looked old, a young man, and a baby. ""Go upstairs conor"" How did he know my name? I ran in panic and ripped of my Fabulous rift. This is almost as scary as freddy foozbear. 10/10 Best survival game to exsist, better than call of duty- ign			"

												Расскажу вам свою историю.Играли мы с другом, зашли в электро. Лутаем бар и тут со стороны школы раздался выстрел из M16A2.Друг тут же умер. Сижу жду пока противник придет лутать (тогда я ещё не понял, что выстрел был со школы).Я решил посмотреть в окно и увидел паренька лежашего на крыше. Я его высматривал в течении ~3х минут.Он так же смотрел в мою сторону. На тот момент у меня был только винчестер. Я решил рискнуть и высунулся из окна.Я сделал 1 меткий выстрел в голову и парниша умер. Дальше я сидел и ждал моего друга. Как только он вернулся я пошел лутать того паренька. У него была собственно M16A2 и несколько станажек. Так же у нас была большая проблема с водой.У него как раз было несколько банок газировки. Как только собрали всё нужное, мы двинули в пожарку на окраине города.Там мы поели и попили. У нас всё ещё осталась проблема с водой и мы агрили и убивали зомби. Жили ""от банки до банки"". После ~10 минут кемпа в пожарке начался дождь. К большому сожалению я заболел, но у нас как раз была одна пачка антибиотиков. Я вылечился и мы вышли с сервера. Как только я вернулся на сервер (Мой друг зашел позже). Когда я вернулся на сервер, у меня по какой то причине было гораздо меньше крови чем при выходе.Я решил не засиживаться и уходить из пожарки так как сервер был фулловый. Как только я зашел за кирпичный завод, я встретил двух вооруженных парней. Они без расспроса открыли по мне огонь, я дал ответку. Тогда я не знал, что эта Мка стреляет одиночными... Я застрелил одного насмерть, ранил второго, но он меня убил. Когда мой друг зашел на сервер он пошел на место моей смерти. Он обнаружил, что там 3 трупа, следственно паренек который убил меня, умер.Я пришел мы забрали лут и пошли выживать дальше.  Всё всегда по кругу. Вы в топ луте? Вы непременно заболеете. Вы в топ луте? Вы непременно проголодаетесь.10/10 Обожаю эту игру.			"

												If you are wanting a short review before my rant then i will simply say:Good amounts of content but a frustrating and glitchy pile of junk.Dayz may be a popular mod for arma2 but besides the shear amount of content to choose from you would not know it. Most games with cult followings have fan made patches or fixes to polish out the rough edges and make the game more enjoyable.This is not the case with the dayz mod. The game feels and looks terrible it plays even worse.Animations are poor as are the response times when you press a command key.Example you are in a house when a zombie runs inside and approaches you,you hit a key to draw a weapon only to have it take about 10 seconds all the while the zombie is chomping on your neck.Glitches that should have been fixed by somebody or anybody ruin the immersion and make even simple tasks a nightmare. There is no excuse for a game having been out this long to posses such a myriad of faults and glitches.This is assuming you can even get the game to run for more than 30 minutes before it drops you for no apparent reason. can say with certainty that i have spent more time Patching,Fixing ,Updating and doing general maintenance and troubleshooting problems than actually playing the game.How this mod is so popular i will never know it is a over-complicated pile of junk.

												This mod is very good fun, but you need some sort of outside updater like playwithSIX or DayZCommander, because the steam version is 5 some odd versions behind. The vanilla version of DayZ is punishing, but I personnaly like the slightly more difficult Origins mod. Like I said, you'll need some sort of outside launcher to play Origins or any of the other variants, but if you get it working, it's great fun.11/10 Would buy ARMA II CO again just for this.BE WARNED, THE BANDITS ARE COMING!Haha, JKThis game is awesomeGet it.

												Amazing Mod it is so worth it if you can forgive the the bugs and glitches due to it being a mod its an amazing game/mod their are many different types of add on mods that come with the game that make it even more incredible. If you are to get it i reccomend you get Dayz Commander since its easier to find servers and download other mods. If you like zombie survival games this is the best one around. 9/10 highly reccomend			"

												軍事シュミレーションゲーム、Arma2のリアル志向・シビアなゲーム性を存分に活かした、過酷かつ容赦のない激マゾゾンビサバイバルオンラインゲーム。MAPの端から端までリアル4時間。腹も空けば喉も渇き、食料のある街にはゾンビが溢れ、失血や感染のリスクが付きまとう。一度他人に命を奪われれば疑心暗鬼に陥り、他人との腹の探り合いが始まる。""やられる""前に""どうする""かはプレイヤーに委ねられている。全プレイヤー平均生存時間30分。死んだら負け。DayZCommanderでの導入が一番楽なのでお勧め。			"

												The mod have gone thrugh another update and what does it adds? Well.. nothing much, beside that the base building has came back to the game, which I'm not a big fan and it kinda destroys the survival concept of the game.. enough of that for a moment and let's get in to the point of this review and say what the game is real about.It's been a while since the game got their rewards and most you you wouldn't look at it again after.. some other games coming out and removing the AS50 (!) from the game.. I feel like the game has rached gold age again with the update from the last month and they still keep on going with these. From the beginning you will see that this review is delivered for those who actually played the game or got it already in the past for long time but I'll try to turn back in time for a little while because that's what it provides and that's what I think is the most immportant that's left in this game. The game throws us in to zombie land of Charnorus -or/and vice versa- speaking about this as a world makes us think that it must be pretty big thing to move around on (walkin simulator?) and.. yes, it's.. an open world game aswell! With a mixture of realistic, simulator based combat system and variety if immportant to a player needs which can be challenging sometimes to keep up with them while you're running away from pursuing enemies; and there is plenty of them! Starting from your needs and health contidion status to end it on a players that are going for the same building as you are in a hope of finding this valuble loot. You could say that the game is made of such a little personal goals that you are seeking in any part of the game and this would be the best way to put it. Just planing your safe route to the city might be the starting point of this and thinking of whatever is needed to get this sniper out from that hill would be another level of challenging goals that you want to chose from and pick them as their own because anyone can chase them doing it from all sorts of level of the map and the game.One of the game that should get a chance from anyone who played in the past but also someone who didn't played it at all because anyone can find themselfs in the game.

												This is my review of the ARMA 2 Mod called DayZ even though the standalone is already out.I'm gonna start the review off with a story.I had spawned next to Electro with a Large Backpack and a M4A1 Red Dot (Server Settings) I went into Electro knowing how dangerous it is and saw a helicopter land on the roof. Sure I could go try to rush the guy and take it but I had a better idea. I waited about 10 minutes and he got back in. I kept asking him in Side Chat if he was friendly and he wasn't responding. So as he took off I shot at him. After about a round of firing at him his engine cut out and the chopper fell to the ground and blew up. He had jumped out and parachuted nearby so I ran out of Electro. I found a Black SUV with full fuel and working near the fire station and got my ♥♥♥ outta there. As I was driving on the road this other Black SUV came out of no where and rammed me. The guy got out of his car and started to shoot me. He missed me but shot the vehicle. I could've gotten out of the car and attempted to murder him but I didn't instead I drove away and he kept shooting. He even shot a grenade launcher at me but missed *Thank God* and as I was driving away. My car blew up and I thought I died but apparently I lived. I was bleeding fast and didn't have a lot of blood so I had to risk blood bagging and bandaging myself behind a tree. and thats what I did. He never came to look for me. He probably thought I died. After getting to the nearest town I met a friendly who gave me a lift to a base he was gonna assault where they had some good gear. We got to their stash of guns and took a few but just as we were leaving we got shot and I never met that friendly again.That my friends is DayZ. A epic, fun, social, and fantastic experience. I've played a lot of this off of Steam for better performance so that's why my hours aren't that high but I gotta say. If you have ARMA 2 and ARMA 2 OA you better download this and try it out because it's a fantastic experience.			"

												I didn't know what to write for my review so here are some facts about ebola!!!Ebola virus disease (EVD; also Ebola hemorrhagic fever, or EHF), or simply Ebola, is a disease of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses. Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches. Then, vomiting, diarrhea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. At this time some people begin to bleed both internally and externally. The disease has a high risk of death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected with an average of about 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.The virus spreads by direct contact with body fluids, such as blood, of an infected human or other animals. This may also occur through contact with an item recently contaminated with bodily fluids.[1] Spread of the disease through the air between primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions. ♥♥♥♥♥ or breast milk of a person after recovery from EVD may still carry the virus for several weeks to months. Fruit bats are believed to be the normal carrier in nature, able to spread the virus without being affected by it. Other diseases such as malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other viral hemorrhagic fevers may resemble EVD. Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services, alongside a certain level of community engagement. The medical services include rapid detection of cases of disease, contact tracing of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper healthcare for those who are infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution. Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans. This may be done by handling potentially infected bush meat only while wearing protective clothing and by thoroughly cooking it before eating it. It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease.No specific treatment or vaccine for the virus is available, although a number of potential treatments are being studied. Supportive efforts, however, improve outcomes. This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms. The disease was first identified in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in Nzara, and the other in Yambuku, a village near the Ebola River from which the disease takes its name. EVD outbreaks occur intermittently in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1976 and 2013, the World Health Organization reports a total of 24 outbreaks involving 1,716 cases. The largest outbreak is the ongoing epidemic in West Africa centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. As of 11 April 2015, this outbreak has 25,626 reported cases resulting in 10,619 deaths.I R8 A VERY GR8 8/8 PLS DONT H8 AND TRY NOT TO MAKE IT B8 BUT QUICKSCOPING IS MY F8 PEACE OUT GONNA MASTURB8 ON YOUR LAMINATE FLOORING M8!!!!

												Absolute garbage, mod or not. Maybe if you're an autist with an ungodly amount of patience you can find enjoyment, but even then I doubt it. For those familiar with ARMA, it's similar in concept, but the execution is terrible. Interface is clunky and unresponsive, zombie AI is laughable as they jitter and zig zag haphazardly and glitch out uncontrollably. Forget words like matchmaking, navigating to a server through the sea of CU$T0M [300+ ITEMS M0D] SERV3RZ is a struggle in itself (Look into DayZ Commander if you're hellbent on a bad time). Clearly any kind of melee system was not anticipated in ARMA, and it reflects itself in Day Z. This is the worst FPS and survival experience I've played to date. Hyper realism is wasted on sluggish controls and a terrible GUI, you won't have time to enjoy bullet trajectory while you're panicked, starving, and hyperventilating from tripping on your own legs. Prepare yourself to wander aimlessly for hours through the ""massive scale"" in a desolate wasteland trying to figure out the controls (or location) while picking up empty food cans, before you die a hundred frustrating deaths and lose everything-- all the while facing the elistist community. The difficulty lie not in the zombies or players, but in the constant struggle against a buggy, awful game.This isn't difficult in the way Dark Souls or STALKER's Misery Mod is, it's like driving a broken tricyle backwards during a marathon. Even at ultra-low HumbleBundle price, I regret my purchase immensely and I truly misunderstand anyone liking this game.			"

												This game has been a huge disappointment. I wanted to like the game but it is so far behind in development that I gave up waiting. The original developers handed off the game to a new development team who decided to push back the release date because they wanted to use a new engine.

												I don't understand why the movement system and inventory have to be so ungodly clunky. The controls in general feel pretty awful. I've seen better inventories on under-the-radar no budget rpgs, and my character insists on leaning, shambling, and making erratic, unwarranted movements. My only possible explanation for this is that he's doing it to fit in with the zombies. I have never had so much trouble in a game trying to walk (Or god forbid, RUN) in a straight line.			"

												If you already have Arma 2 + Operation Arrowhead you can give DayZ mod a shot, if not I wouldn't recommend the investment.Very Interesting to play during it's release time (at this time I defenitely would have recommend it) but since the standalone of DayZ was released there is almost no more support, developement and players for the mod. Also there is no kind of late-game or long time motivation to play, playing alone is boring and you probably just die constantly. I also don't believe that the mod or standalone will ever get near a final state.			"

												I have been playing a long time using dayz commander not on steam. It is impossible to get started or even enjoy this game if you are going to be playing by yourself. Get some friends or don't play. (iunless you like running around for hours on end and getting shot and having to run around again.)But here's how it normally goes.You spawn in on the coast with nothing but a pistol and a bandage. You run around for over an hour looking for some gear. Picking up a soda here, a can of beans there. BAM! Some fully geared player just shot you before you could even get a weapon. On your second try you spawn in and run around four another 2 hours and finally find a low level waepon like a lee enfield. You then see someone, get excited and say ""hello! are you friendly?"" and BAM!. they shoot you and take your gear without a word. This cycle repeats over and over until you realize you just spent 8 hours running and getting shot on sight and running around and getting shot on sight and running around and getting shot and never really accomplishing anything.  EVERYONE shoots on sight in this game. EVERYONE. Unless you have some friends to cover your back this will keep happening to you. It's not a open world survival game... it's a giant free-for-all deathmatch.  I wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone who is planning on playing it by themselves.  You will get frustrated and bored very quicly.			"

												When you open this game's main menu, you will be bombarded with loud static. Ouch.When I try to connect to a server it crashes. Only after trying a second time will it work.Don't know if this is just me, but I doubt it.The game's default video settings are garbage. The devs expect you to have some sort of super computer to be able to run this. It's horribly optimized. I have a good computer and I had to disable everything.Theres this weird motion blurr effect you will want to disable, too. The game's basically unplayable without doing so.Zombies will target you from miles away. The only way to hope to avoid them is to crawl with z, which is horribly slow and doesn't always work. Once the zombies target you, you will have to run to escape them, which will attract more zombies... they can walk through walls, open doors, climb ladders... there's literally no way to not be killed by a zombie, unless you have a weapon:Items are very scarce and weapons are rare to say the least. You will likely die before finding anything useful. The inventory is hard to navigate, and there is no ""action button."" Instead, you mouse over the thing you want to pick up (unless you are holding a weapon or your flashlight, there is no crosshair to help you with this) and use the scroll wheel to select what you want to do with it. It's irritating to say the least.The game has a day/night cycle. At night it is literally impossible to do anything.Overall this game is really hard to enjoy. I wanted to like it, but it's almost unplayable.			"

												ehhhhhhh, kind of average.If you're into games like Gmod with the sandbox stuff, then I'm sure you'll enjoy it, but the map and realism kind of kills from the fun when you look at how much of it is just driving around and finding weapons and then driving around some more. Now, I don't dislike these types of games always, I enjoyed Unturned since it has more of a ridiculous type of gameplay and has a smaller map, so more of the game is actually spent in the buildings and cities, unlike DayZ. This is really my complaint with nearly every sandbox game, so if you like sandbox games like Minecraft and Gmod, there's no reason you won't enjoy this. If this is something you want, definitely buy it, but try to avoid getting Arma 2 and just get OA since you don't really need it.			"

												Psychopath simulator. If you enjoy walking, eating, drinking and killing then this is the mod for YOU! Enjoy the thrill of walking in a straight line for hours just to be killed by a sniper, EXCITING! Imagine the tension of meeting another player as you yell ""FRIENDLY"" to him, just so you can empty a clip into his head and steal his chemlights.A full set of customization options adds unpredicable and HILARIOUS encounters. One moment you're driving down an empty road with your buddy, the next your dead on the ground from the invincible sniper that spawned out of the blue! THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS!

												This is the best zombie game/mod out there. You are a survivor of a terrible zombie outbreak. You can work with a team, or on your own. Beware though, most people are out to kill you, not help you. If you find a server with DayZ Epoch, it's even better. Base building, traders, what else could you want?There are a few things they could work on though:- A Singleplayer. They should add a singleplayer.- Fix the bugs.Overall rating is 10/10.			"

Download the Origins Launcher (or alternatively get the torrent and extract the @OriginsMod into the ArmA 2: OA Folder) and install the mod. Set Launch Options in ArmA 2: OA to -mod=@Dayz -mod=@dayzoverwatch -mod=@DayZ_Epoch -mod=@OriginsMod (change accordingly and make sure that anything else goes AFTER this). Enjoy! "

												I dont like it, its better to buy the standalone than play this crap. The game is fun but the zombies are horrible. The zombie animations are crap and melee weapons are useless. Its not fun when you're scaveging for supplies and all of a sudden, you are forced to defend yourself with melee weapons that only work at point blank range and aimed center mass ogf the zombie or it will not even hit him.It has a ton of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, making it hard to connect to most of them, but if you actually join one, you realize that the server has been running for 10 hours and almost all areas have been looted clean of supplies. have fun looting empty coke cans all day. I played for nearly 5 hours and i hate this mod. Hopefully the standalone is better. "

												Sure, after all this time the mod is still littered with bugs, but it is still my favorite game of all time. I am absolutely fascinated by it. The graphics, the audio, the ability the game has to immerse you into the world and just how real it feels is worth mentioning all on its own. I felt every emotion there is to feel in this game and loved every moment of it. Its just a shame that its nothing like it used to be with the new modded servers and exploits and all that... nobody plays it for the immersive experience anymore.			"

												This is my first review, and I have to say I am disapointed. I have bounced around games like this such as H1Z1, and I simply cannot stand trying to play this game. Don't get me wrong, after wasting whole days trying to find a server I can actually join, the game can be pretty fun. But it is all not worth it for how much digging, downloading this, deleting this file in these particular orders. I just want to play the game. I have played a total of maybe an hour of actual game time? I've dug around for servers for around 28 hours, according to my AOA log time.			"

												I know this seems like an awesome mod at first (which it is, at times, rarely, but the moments are still there) but after a few days of playing, you start to realize how pointless and hopeless this game is. You find some stuff, you get a weapon, you meet a person and 9 out of 10 times they shoot you on sight. I don't blame them though, cause that's just how this mod is. Everyone you see will either want to kill you or avoid you, but mostly kill you. Even the good guys. Either because they can't trust anyone they meet because they've been betrayed so many times or because you have something they want.I actually recommend this more than the standalone because the standalone is so boring, there's almost no content, it's pretty buggy and there's only one single map whereas in ArmA 2's mod, there's like 100 different maps and people have made 100 different versions of the mod like Breaking Point or DayZero, etc.If you do own ArmA 2 CO and haven't tried this yet then I suggest you do. The game is great both with friends and by yourself, because by yourself you're not drawing so much attention and you can do your own thing whereas with friends you can defend yourself much easier, you can scavenge quicker and you can have a bigger view over stuff, such as one person guarding and the other one looting.I do enjoy this mod at times though, when you just run into some super friendly person and you go on adventuers all over the map only for him to be killed and you scream ""NOOO!"" into the mic while spraying his killers, then crying over his corpse, sucking it up, looting him dry and throw yourself back out in the wilderness, alone and hungry, yet again.

												A poorly optimized game. It won't run properly no matter what rig you have. Terrible gameplay, plagued with bugs (you will find more bugs than zombies, guaranteed) and the main concept is screwed up as the game encourages people to kill each other instead of working together to survive (something that in a real life situation seems more plausible than just everyone killing each other for batteries and soda cans)			"

												Warning, this game is only replayable and can offer the full experience with a group of friends. DO NOT BUY WITHOUT HAVING SOMEBODY TO PLAY WITH. This is a great experience and gives the most lifelike zombie apocolypse simulator. This game has great immersion until you find something quite common in the game, a zombie. These walking monstrosities break the game flow and any sense of immersion. The zombie combat is a mess with the ridiculous hit detection, and amount of hits with a melee weapon or with a gun. Not only the ridiculous combat is a problem but the shotty animations is a huge problem. The zombies with walk over to you, ♥♥♥♥ing flail their arms at you and you take massive damage for an attack that looked like it was done in a 4th of the time that it should. The game is terribly broken and almost all deaths are unfair leaving you in a rage state. This game may be fun to watch but sure as hell is not fun to play/			"

												A really fun and challenging zombie shooter. It is completely different from any other zombie shooter I've ever played, and it can also get really competative. It's an open world map where zombies are dangerous and humans are deadly. Everything is trying to kill you, but you can either be a lone wolf, or travel in a group of friends. However, I would not recommend this game for people who are good by nature, because trying to lend out a helping hand to a fellow survivor will earn you a bullet to the face. This game is great for playing with a friend or two and going out being bandit survivors, working as a team and scavenging military bases and making one of your own. However, there aren't really many servers left and it's hard to find one that works, runs well, has good rules, and has players. 7/10.			"

												Getting the game to even run in the first place was far more difficult than something I'm paying money for should be, but it is a mod so I'd give it a pass due to the ease of finding the necessary information via the community.  Once the game actually starts running though, it is impossible to find a server to actually play on--which is required if you want to do anything beyond watching the menu screen.  I bought this and ArmA and all its extras for $5 on a Humble Bundle sale a while back, and even though I'm sure ArmA is a fine game, I didn't buy the pack for it and I'm not interested in ever playing it--I dislike this game (DayZ) so much, I want my measley $5 back.
