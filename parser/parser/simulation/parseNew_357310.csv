Early Access Review
								I am a Chinese guy and I'm so glad that there is one game about China and its long and complicated history. For a long time, Chinese history and culture seems to be a mystery for the western world, which makes lots of troubles in the international affairs. Now, there is one bridge that might fix the gap. I am so happy about it, even though it's only a game. (Yes, I know the game Romance of 3 kingdoms, but they are different. In this game, I think we could experience more Chinese culture and history while Romance of 3 kingdoms is more like an epic, a novel full of lengendary heros. Heros are more important in that game instead of history and culture.)As for the game, I think it seems like the combination of Civilization series and Total War series.It looks very complicated, a real strategy game. And as for Chinese history and culture in the game, the details are accurate. It starts from the first dynasty of China, Shang, and goes to dynasty Zhou, and then waring state period, including all the major states in the real Chinese history, even Xianbei. For culture part, you could develop Taoism, Buddisim, Confucianism and even YinYang which really suprises me since not many western people know it.  And for the video performance, it's really cool. You could zoom in and out in the game and check all the details of your city and your people. You could see the farmers working in the field and the merchant working in the city, all in details.I just played the game for half an hour and didn't fight in any war right now but I am quite looking forward to it since in Chinese history, people developed lots of strategies about how to fight in the war, how to defeat enemy effectively and wisdomly. The famous and well-known example is the book 'the Art of War' by Sunzi, who was born in Spring and Autumn Period, 550BC. So I am quite curious about that whether we could use strategies in the war and get some benefits from them, use militory wisdom to defeat enemies effectively . I think this game would become a masterpiece if there are more improvements in the future. For example, the game would be better if it has a mini map, an open CG and more tutorials for beginners because it is kind of complicated at the first glance. And there are also translation problems, comparing to the history facts. For example, in the game there is one tribe which is called 'Dog Rong'. Actually this is kind of funny since it looks like the combination of English and Chinese pinyin,'Dog' is English while 'Rong' is Chinese...Actually, it is 'Quan Rong' in Chinese, even though 'Quan' in Chinese means 'dog' in English. In the game, there are lots of these phenomena, the combinations of English and Chinese pinyin makes the game funny for the people who know Chinese history.And also I suggest that it would be better if this game has Madarin version because in China, there are many steam players right now. All of them will be very happy to play such a game. This will also solve the traslation problem. English speakers do not need to read Chinese pinyin which might be hard and inconvenient for them since they might not know how to read Chinese pinyin, not to mention the meaning of Chinese pinyin. For example, in English version, the game could use 'Go' instead of 'Weiqi', 'Taoism' instead of 'Daoism'. They are same things, but clearly, Go and Taoism would be better for English speaker to undertand what they are.Anyway, I will recommend this game to the players who love strategy game and the players who are interested in Chinese history and culture. Excellent work.			"

								Welcome to Umaru's Opinion FinallyI've been anticipating this game for awhile after i accidentally stumbled upon it a few months back, it promises a 4x strategy game thats focused on the civilization of Ancient China, so, does it delivers?Oriental EmpiresLet's check it outThis will be my 1st impression of the gameGraphics ~8/10The 1st impression you get when you jump into the game, is that the main menu is plain, it's so simple, that it feels like the game doesn't promise you much, not only that, the option in the menu also doesn't give you that much option to play with IMO,BUTAs you jump into the game, you can see how detailed the world they've created, as you zoom into the farmlands, you can see  how detail they actually created the world, farmers working on the field, not only that, the City is also beautifully created, as you build new building, you can see that the buildings that's just been build integrated beautifully into the city, now you didn't see that in CIV V. Though the graphics might not be the best, consider the genre and some of the games like CIV V and Endless Legend, you could say that the grapchis of Oriental Empires is Acceptable.The Details on the Soldiers, is beautiful though the battle animation get clunky sometimes, and soldiers went out over more than 3 hexes over the enemy in battle, it is acceptable considering it's a Early access game, i hope this will be patched in the future version of the game.The UI ~6/10Well the UI in this game, well, its confusing,1st of all, there is no minimap in this game, i dunno why they didn't include minimap, maybe you could unlock it when you discover a new technology (which is great IMO) or maybe its just an error that the developer made, but this might also be patched in the future.The other thing about the UI is that is quite frustrating to navigate, and also the lack of hovering tool tip is also frustrating, in other words you need to click and icon to actually shows you what's the effect of the building you wanna build,But after spending some time adapting to the game, i found out that its not as annoying as it was at the 1st time.Another thing, even though it's quite hard to navigate, the tooltip actually gives you the details you need, although some information is still confusing as some details is lacking, but most important information was provided in great detailsThe the last thingWHERE IS THE DECONSTRUCT BUTTONNNDAKJfkaDJIOAPREWGAEO?????? Gameplay  ~8/10The 1st thing i wanted to say to 1st timer in this game, PLAY THIS GAME ON EASY DIFFICULTYIt was because a lack of tutorial sytem in the game, though if you are familiar with games such as CIV V or Endless Legend, or Other 4x strategy game, this won't be a problem,The game itself, is divided into 2 Phase,1st its the building and planning phase, where you build, improve, recruit, plan and set strategyand the 2nd phase is where you watch your action came into play in real time, which is a great addition to the game,a lot of people say that this game is actually a mixed of Total War and CIV V but it think that this game is more like CIV V + Kessen Series back in PS2 eraIt's also quite boring in the first few turns because there's not much to do in the gameTo be honest i actually restarted my games quite a few times after my city is sacked by bandits and attacked by other clans/nations because my city is too far from my capital to be reinforced,also because of my inability to find a Deconstruct button, my Empire collapse because of a huge amount of debt it accumulated.My last game was actually going quite well after i repel the invasion of the Han, though it seems like i will be restarting the game again because i found out that a city could actually use upto 11-hexes of their surroundingsTechnically, a lot of planning is needed in order to maintain a stable empire, overstreched and you city will likely be destroyed, building to close to each other will result with inability to expand, and so on though this actually comes with their own pros and cons and also, a city has an ability to dismantle itself, which could help if you are unable to defend the city and want to save a settler.It's a Hard Game, but it is a fun game. Sound/Music  ~7/10For the sound and music, since the game revolve around ancient China, The music is also some of the soothing classic Chinese musis, which will give a relaxing feeling, though a more tense music will pop-out when you enter the second phase, so, so far so good So, the score for Oriental Empires is  7/10 For nowSince it's a early access game, i will update the review in the future, so, thanks for reading and i hope everyone is having a great day~UMARU OUT`~			"

								It's bad. Real bad.At a bird's eye view, it's a Civ clone, but only in that you can build cities at various hexes on the map and make your way through a simplistic tech tree that effects one or two stats.When looking deeper, it is an empty shell of a Civ game, chalk full of bad design decisions, illogical behavior, bad AI, and the most abysmal combat I've ever seen in a strategy game.Battle is automated. The player has no control over what occurs during battle. That alone takes half the potential strategy out of a strategy title. They make you watch the battle take place in a scene like total war reenacted by your kid sister with stick figure dollies.During those battles you'll see:Troops run through each other, run away into the terrain, run in circles...The AI runs through your full stack army with one troop and takes your city...Your movement gets blocked by continual spam of beaten up worthless units....and other various nonsensical behavior.You'll be saying ""WTF?"" at your monitor over and over, not understanding the mechanics of movement, retreat, and combat, because they don't make sense and they don't match what the help says.I made videos and asked on the forums to get to the bottom of it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqFgm26I7Uohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Mj7MbRfDT8Just as an example of one ""WTF?"", in the last video, the developer explained to me that when an AI unit attacks a city, it doesn't matter that I have an army that outnumbers and out-stats the enemy attacker, that a single one on one unit battle takes place at the gate and if the randomly selected unit of mine loses, my entire army dies and I lose the city...so 40 men, can take 10,0000 and will, completely obliterating your army and your game. You can't do anything about it, because you have no control over combat, you cannot retreat because a single man can block your army of 10,000 from moving. It leaves the player no options. When I heard that, I lost all faith in the game. Such a shoddy, nonsensical design, means someone on the team over there is making decisions like that, that actually get into the game. Early Access or not.I don't mind difficult games. I yearn for them, but being nonsensical is not the same as being difficult....and then there is this really scary blurb:""What is the current state of the Early Access version?“The English language single player version of the game is feature complete, although it may still contain some minor bugs. The game has had several months of beta testing to achieve a reasonable state of balance and tuning, but it’s likely that this can be improved further with feedback from Early Access players.”""If they don't realize what poor shape the game is in after testing, I don't know what hope there is,			"

								At its current state, Oriental Empires is not worth the investment************************************************************************(Edited Spelling)Summary: The ideas are there, but there are tons of factors that make those ideas near impossible to experience.The game seems to be designed to bloom at some point, making the one more turn feel come to mind. Yet there are a lot in the way, dragging the experience down to a slow, slow drag.Almost like the developer is buying time, letting the gamer live on dreams and imagination alone. I have to wait 200 turns to test other factions? When I do get there, will the clunky animation, path-finding problems, lacking diplomacy and economic options be solved? It would make for one of the best games of 2016, but the early access stamp whispers of yet another game being left in development: until pigs fly.************************************************************************Full Review:It's a fun game, and it has potential, but potential has come to  mean nothing for consumers.Empty promises being the standard in the industry.What I hear, is that the game is only lacking multiplayer, and that the single player experience is more or less complete. Now, ironing out bugs and polishing, are what we can expect. Yet there are some flaws that go beyond polishing and bug reports.If the problems are somehow fixed, I will of course make this a positive review, but as things stand, the game is lacking, and left as is, it is simply just another good idea that wasn't given the time and love it needed. It needs to go back into the forge.What needs to be mended:*Combat*Combat needs to be reworked on many levels. It feels rushed and slapped together.The combat AI is really bad. Making total war vanilla combat AI look amazing in comparison.Path-finding is a big, if not the biggest problem. Units will run around aimlessly, run the wrong way: making the choices of ""battle plans"" (harass, charge, flank etc) seem to have no, to little impact at all. You don't control your soldiers like in total war, battles are fought in a cinematic fashion as you end your turn. You can decide what way your troops face, number or ranks, and each units “battle plans”. In theory it is awesome, but what unfolds looks like a pc game to movie by Uwe Boll with the budget of a bag of chips. Beside clunky, limited animations and god awful path finding, combat also has some really bad design decisions lingering. Near game breaking.As an example: single units can take a settlement of four units.A city has four gates, but if a fight is lost at only one of those gates, the battle is over and the city is lost. Now if I have three good units, with one sad sack bamboo spear peasant mob tasked with guarding one gate, I feel hatred for the game when said, ""sad sack mob"" is defeated by a unit that could never best even one of the other three units guarding the other gates. What the hell are the other soldiers doing? Another example:A large amount of solders should be able to interfere with one unit mobs in near hexes, in friendly territory at the very least. Having a large army of trained soldiers, just watching enemies burn the rice fields around them is always frustrating. It's their lifeblood, their money, and their people being savaged. Units jogging around the city, rice paddy hopping (in hexes), to catch looters is ridiculous. It makes no sense. As long as soldiers are present outside the city walls, or garrison, they should be able to defend the rice fields. Why you might ask? There is a meter measuring revolt risk in percentage. When you draft the peasants to fight off the looters, the meter increases. When the fields get burned around the sad sack mob you call an army, and the city lacks food, the revolt risk increases to the extreme. Then if you manage to handle all the damn looters, and ask the peasants to re-cultivate the burned out rice fields, the meter increases as they feel overworked. Making a few single unit looters, a very likely reason for a revolt and the city being lost.If you're lucky you manage to re-cultivate in time without any revolts: I swear, you will see bandits popping up as the revolt risk is high. And what do you think they do?Paddy hex hopping until either your population, or your sanity turn against you.*Actual look and feel of the combat*This is important, as it is a very big part of the game. Cinematic war, you only look to see your men fight, you can't control them during the fighting, so this being poorly polished gives the game a really ugly feel.Units facing the wrong way and shooting arrows through their backs. Chariots spinning to unheard disco tunes. Soldiers running through each other. Zooming in to see fighting being clunkier than a made-for-tv-movie-vhs-tape that someone paid you to see. Units are either marching, or having no idea what animation they are supposed to do, as the swing, stop, spin, and run to the horizon, only to come back like nothing happened. Is this an example of a compete single player experience? The combat looks awful. Animations are lacking.If this was an alpha, and not a game that will soon be released I would understand, but this feels like a cash grab. Is multiplayer with or without the civilization management?If it's only the fighting and war part of the game, the clunky animations and sad sack combat animations will spell doom for multiplayer in a heartbeat.*Diplomacy*The ghosts of total war whisper my name. It's limited to the extreme. This is a game about building a civilization and waging war. Add more options! The diplomacy ai is clearly a b-stard child of total war sneaking into the production. I ask for peace, and I'm refused by a stronger enemy. I get it, I'm there for the taking. What I don't get is why that enemy would ask for peace the next turn and add one single gold coin to the bargain. ""I could destroy you, and that is crazy,  here is a gold coin, call me maybe"".*Economics and the Tech Tree*A lot of buildings cost too much to maintain. Soldiers too. Having markets and bazaars costs more than the economy they provide. While the maintenance of each building makes for a beggar king. The Tech Tree is there to suck the years out of your life with very little change. There's a lot of interesting text to come with each advancement.  Fun to read once, but providing little impact.

								Purchased because the concept of Total-War-meets-Civilization is a good one, as is simultaneous movement resolution, but this is a very unpolished game. Both the TW and Civ elements feel stripped down and dated. Unrealistic behavior abounds, like chasing down tiny remnants of opposing forces turn after turn, or watching friendly formations march through enemy formations with no engagement. Strange bugs like ghost cities appearing on the map.Since the developer claims the single-player game is finished, I have to disasgree and recommend that you do not spend money on this game, especially not $30.

								The game is nice, mostly Civ feel, not at all Total War. In Total War battles require strategic skill, here they are... specific and controlled by AI.The  AI controlling player side of army is straight up idiotic, unpredictable, and ignoring actual formation orders given to units. I have never encountered a strategy game with more frustrating battles.Example 1 - archers (set to harass) and infantry (set to attack) are on neighbouring hexes. Enemy enters adjectent hex and battle begins. The infantry decided to wait the battle over until the archers got beaten up and only then decided to join the fight.Example 2 - enemy bodyguards - 1 unit, arrives to my capitol (with palisade). I give them warm welcome with 1x archers, 2x noble axemen, 1x spears, 1x infantry. Welp, even though whole stack had the order to move towards enemy, actually only archers moved out that way, the others decided they have something else to do on the other sides of castle and so my capitol was conquered with single unit of bodyguards.Don't buy this game until they fix combat, otherwise you'll have to become zen master not to scream at the screen.

								This can be a good 4X strategy game for some people, as it strikes a balance between complexity and enjoyablility (in other words, not too easy, not too hard), so it won't be a regret if you buy it. However, for those who are looking for a decent game experience, I cannot recommend this game due to several reasons:NOTE: The following reasons are ordered by what I think is important. However, if you are concerned about possible false advertising, please make sure you read part 4.1. Lack of tutorial / informative gamepediaIn a turn based strategy you always want to know what's going on as well as the reason behind it. You also want to make sure that what you are doing is what you think you are doing. These require an informative tutorial or gamepedia.If you want to take down an enemy city, you want to know what you need to bring, how a siege can be successful / unsuccessful, what orders to give so that your troops siege the city instead of sitting outside of it. But the game doesn't teach you these things. You have to find out yourself.2. Unpolished UIWhile UI isn't part of the strategy, it does affect your game experience. For now, the game UI is kind of messy, and sometimes you need to click a lot to achieve what you want to do.3. Not really ChineseThe reason I bought this game it that I am Chinese and I wanted to see what game developers can make out of a Chinese topic. But to my disappointment this game is just another 4X game with some Chinese names and Chinese artwork. There's nothing in the game that is unique to Chinese culture or Chinese philosophy.Just change the names and artwork and you get a Roman Empire game, a medieval game, a fantasy game, a space alien game... Well, you get me.4. Grand strategy vs Formation tacticsThe game advertised itself as ""Civ meets Total War"" (I'm sure I read it somewhere; it's not on the store page right now - maybe they changed it). It's certainly an interesting idea, but it didn't really work out. In Civ you manage the grand strategy, give orders, and leave the real fighting to your armies. In Total War you manage the grand strategy in the world map, and manage the tactics in the battle map.This game tries to include both grand strategy and formation tactics within the world map, which is rather a bad move because it doesn't allow much depth for formation tactics, which then makes the formation tactics element useless. I haven't changed any formation option for once, and it's pretty safe to engage the enemy with default options when you have superior numbers. I guess it's only useful when you are trying to get out of a difficult situation, but again, (see part 1.) the game doesn't really tell you what you should do to get the advantage you need.Also, don't be fooled by those screenshots that are close-in to armies, as if those armies are being controlled in-battle (like in Total War). No. Everything is set up before you hit next turn, and you cannot change a thing after it. You can only watch, which is not interesting at all. "

Early Access Review
A 4X tribute to the East, Oriental Empires provides hours of strategic TBS gameplay for fans of the civilization building strategy games. Though you see elements of Civ V and Age of Empires games at times, don’t expect the game to be true to either franchise. Instead, what you find is an experience that comes across as a comic book combined with a board game from another era, and spawned into digital format; born again in some alternate continent’s code of conduct. If you are looking for something different in the world of 4X, this may be for you. At this time, it released in Early Access, only because the multiplayer is not finished. So, only single player is available at this point.Art & Music: In a beautiful world of mountains & rivers, laid out on a map that allows you to panoramically zoom to any degree in or out, the Empires of the Far East come to life in the beautiful scenes that seem to be reminiscent of charcoal drawings. It’s an art style sure to be appealing to everyone. When you zoom in, you become a part of the village & the daily lives of the people. Yet, when you zoom out you see the whole countryside and can plan & plot combat moves & colonization. If you continue to zoom out, you can even see other empires and the cities they are building. All of this beautiful scenery is augmented with lovely tunes from the Orient that are as high-quality as those made by Kairis for Paradox Studio’s lovely music dlc’s. The tunes are lively & provide ambience that certainly makes the gameplay enjoyable.Graphics:With simplified graphics reminiscent of This War of Mine, Oriental Empires makes the story come alive on a map in an imaginative way that can be intensely pleasing for many people. It could be seen as quaint, or maybe retro. It certainly calls to mind playing old Stratego & Risk boardgames. This may not appeal to some gamers, especially the simple characters, who appear as 2d in the bottom corner, & fight in stiff 3d scripted forms. It’s certainly not a Triple A title, but it manages to bring a sense of atmosphere to the world of the Orient. Narrative:The storyline progresses through 5 eras of Chinese & Mongolian history. You are able to play as different factions, and you have some control over when you move into the next era, based on which tech you choose. The techs are limited, but provide story-rich choices to the way you will develop your nation. Some narration appears between eras, and the voice acting is as great as the music. But, don’t expect a Western game set in the East. The game itself & the story are very Oriental in design. Mechanics:The combat allows you to plot all your moves, & then watch them play out before you. This forces you to plan for contingencies. You are able to change the way the units face at waypoints. You are able to select their fighting stance; whether defensive or offensive, in a variety of strategies. And, unlike most games, it seems often that the best method is to avoid conflict, and defend your villages. I’ve seen the raiders act just like huns; pillage, burn, run, &  while you chase after them, another unit is coming in behind to raid your unprotected village. The mechanics are not cookie cutter, and seem to be unique to the game, despite the fact that many components are shared by other 4X games. The tutorial needs work, though there are no bugs at all that I’ve seen. I like the way the advisor stays in the corner greyed out until you need her. Also, all of the overlays are unobtrusive, since they can be toggled individually to allow for great screen shots, which is very important to many people. I wish some of the bigger 4X titles could learn that idea. The biggest problem I see with the game for some is that you need to read the text info provided behind the question mark, in something similar to an infopedia to play the game. It’s one of those TL;DR things that some just won’t care to deal with. But, for me, I read everything from street signs to cereal box small print anyways. In the case of this game, you will probably need to read the more info area to proceed. Also, the advisor seems to offer advice periodically, just sometimes that advice seems to come after you need it instead of before. Pros: *Art style is very engaging*Combat is fun & fresh*Gameplay is realistic for the Far East territory*Interface is user-friendly with total control Cons:*Tutorial is scant leaving a learning curve*Graphics are simplistic *In EA until MP is completeI recommend Oriental Empires for those who enjoy fresh strategic turn-based gameplay set in particular historical locales. With combat and story features, there’s so much to enjoy in this game.  "

								For me one of the best strategy game of the year. Many fresh gameplay ideas along with a great audio/visual presentation and a smooth running game engine.Dozents of different units in 7 tiers (Tribesmen, Militia, Convicts, Nobles, Trained, Imperial Guards and Picked), many tactical options (attack, charge, harass, outflang, ambush, defend, reserve, withdraw), upgradeable armor, naval units...ectI had many epic fights since february and seriously once you played a huge battle in OE, you will not return to the classic 1-Unit per Hex mechanics.The campaign gameplay is full of random events (locust swarms, bad omen, earthquakes, floods...ect) every single one can break your empire in pieces, if you not prepared.You will need a good balance between economy/progress and unrest to be successful. Btw OE have two civilian classes the Nobles and the Peasants, both have separate unrest pools.Edicts can help you in this or that way, but have also a negative (permanent) effect. And many many other nice features. The negative aspects about Oriental Empires (pre Early Access release) are:- a very slow and sometimes a little bit boring beginning ( ~ 50 turns)- the AI needs some improvements- later in the game you have to deal with very long marching distances for your slow armies- diplomacy need more improvements / options- balancing in many areas of the game.  Finally, it´s still a EA game, but unlike many other EA games it´s almost done and it´s very good playable. No CTD in 100+ h playtime and only some minore bugs.Oriental Empires needs some AI improvments and better balance, but I´m sure the devs will fix it very soon.They definitely know what they do.22,39 € ? Seriously, buy it!			"

								Oriental Empire is the kind of game that I've wanted for a while. Yes, I would like to see some more out of it - and perhaps some tweaks as well: but with the short time I've spent playing it I've had a lot of fun! I've done everything from build an extensive trade network stretching from one side of the map to the other, engage in vicious primitive wars (Bronze age) and emerged victorious, and paid close attention to the little details in the map that make this game what it is.But what is this game?I would personally say that this game is a mixture of Civilization and Total War. You kind of get the best of both worlds. The randomized maps and building system of the Civilization games, with the up close and personal combat of Total War! Mind you you can't control your unit movements once they've engaged in a battle (so more like Civ?), but you can set their stances before they engage, as well as what kind of formation they will be fighting it. This combat makes for some epic clashes that can take place in an extensive battlefield that could stretch from the front gates of a city to the far outskirts of it!Though this all sounds really cool I think they're missing out on a few things: the big one being more on-the-map activity! This would be physical buildings with civilians working around them (maybe at the forge, barracks, ect.), a variety of different people - not just farmers, more animals roaming around (not just standing there), and natural disasters that we can actual see. The one thing that they did do very well is the on-map destruction caused by warfare! I also wouldn't mind seeing more commodities. The map feels very bare - with useful resources seemingly few and far between. Maybe as you advance through the ages more resources reveal themselves? However though it could improve, this Early Access title delivers with little/no bugs - and a fantastic time! Right now I'd give it a 8/10!Short list of features I'd like to see:- Dynasties- More resources- More on the map activity- more diplomatic options- unique play styles from different AI- more empire customization- Variety of different citizens (not just farmers and soldiers!)

Early Access Review
								The tagline you see in most of the reviews here on steam is that this is “CIV + Total War set in China”. I’d say the first part of that tagline is inaccurate – this game does not much resemble Total War. If you really want a Total War style game set in China get Koei’s Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, with the caveat that those games are based on historical fantasy and not actual history. That said, Oriental Empires is a good game with interesting design plus a unique setting. Gameplay: In the Grand Campaign you explore a semi-random (resources are distributed differently each game but the map is fixed) map of China that starts in 1500BCE. There are many historically-flavored factions but the differences between them are small at the time of this review and each start with the same setup – a capital city in a fixed, historical, location, a settler, a commander and a faction leader who can also command. The biggest difference between factions is starting location.As you explore you’ll find resource deposits or points of interest your named characters can interact with similar to Elemental or Endless Legend. These points of interest can be positive or negative but at the moment variety seems limited. I’ve only encountered trait increase/decrease, money gain/lose, technology shortcut and map reveal events. I hope they add more variety and take more from Endless Legend/Elemental by including short quests. You’ll also encounter the other factions (no minor factions are present). After meeting a faction you can enter into diplomacy with them but I find the balance within the system to be poor. It doesn’t feel great when nations you meet quickly declare war, march about for a few turns, then accept peace if you offer them 1 gold. Maybe they just wanted the pride of saying they beat you, but with no buff/debuff apparent based on the outcome of a war it seems more likely that they haven’t finalized the faction relationship system yet. After the initial “we hate all our neighbors” round, it is easy to establish peace with everyone near you, especially if you start by offering to recognize a strong neighbor as Emperor – a decision I hoped would carry stronger penalties than a single point off my “authority”. The peace network seems to endure indefinitely (80+ turns in my second game), leading to a rather slow-paced early-mid game where you simply tech, settle new cities and explore. As you found new cities and grow your existing ones, you’ll want to balance a few different factors. Expansion is limited by two resources – you have a “recruitment pool” of units that refreshes periodically (Similar to Medieval 2) so you can’t simply spam settlers and you have the previously mentioned “authority” attribute, which must be higher than the number of settlements you own or you will face penalties to unrest. Authority can be increased via the research tree. Unrest is divided into “noble” and “peasant” unrest with the former being influenced mostly by authority and Edicts – special commands you can issue which enact empire-wide policy decisions and advance you into different ages. Peasant unrest is influenced by how many turns you’ve been giving your peasants tasks constructing buildings, farms, etc. and can be reduced by not issuing such orders for a few turns. If unrest gets too high you start to get bandit spawns, and if the unrest continues you may face a rebellion. There are two types, peasant and noble. If you approach a rebellious stack with your own army composed of 50% or more of the same class of unit there is a chance your army will defect! Your faction leader’s army will never defect however. I quite like this mechanic as it gives a strategic factor to what type of army you send rather than simply picking your strongest units. Cities themselves can be fairly easy to manage– there’s no “upkeep” for the city or population itself so just building farms and growing the population is a decent way to make a profit. Each settlement has a number of slots for buildings (expanding the settlement increases the number of slots) and some of these require upkeep. Don’t build more high-upkeep buildings than you can afford in the early game. There are also tile-based buildings, including mountain shrines, mines and river quays. Production buildings don’t seem to turn a profit until you’re able to integrate them into a trade network and be warned that trade, while profitable, takes a bit of time to build up. Trade is limited by distance but upgraded trade buildings can reach farther. Also, some Edicts have a high maintenance cost while others can introduce new taxes, both significantly affecting your income. Your cities are precious and can be lost to rebellion fairly easily (cities can rebel) but are generally secure from all but a concerted effort from enemy factions once you build defenses. Walls are very strong in this game and can only be overcome by ranged units and, later on, artillery. This defensive strength does contribute to the mid-game stagnation I’ve noticed – cities rarely change hands and wars are more about pillaging land and defeating armies than capturing territory. Armies in this game are composed of a few different types of units (no unique units for factions at the moment) basically divided into noble, peasant or trained/professional class infantry, cavalry and archers. Noble and peasant units can be recruited for free from cities and as mentioned there is a replenishing recruitment pool in each city which is influenced by building choices, technology and population. I tend to specialize only a couple of cities in recruitment as it costs a lot to maintain the buildings and units are only equipped with advanced weapons and armor when recruited. Professional units are useful for all purposes though they carry a high cost while peasant units are cheap and plentiful but weak and nobles are strong but limited in number. Units on the map can be stacked up to 8 on one tile and are influenced by the traits of a character if his bodyguard unit is part of the army.Combat in this is not Total-War style as so many have mentioned. Multiple stacks can participate in a battle, and battles take place on the regular game map (think Endless Legend). Battles are not manually controlled but you can set tactics and army-facing beforehand, giving you some influence over the course of the battle. The system reminds me of Endless Space. I’d like to see more factors come into play like bonuses for professional armies vs. peasants and so on, plus a clearer UI for setting up tactics. Exploration, City Management and War will take up about 90% of your time, but the other 10% isn’t wasted. Research in this game is conducted simultaneously via 4 mostly-separate research trees. I like the system but most technologies and bonuses are straightforward stat boosts or unit/building unlocks. I’d like to see more gameplay elements tied into research. As a note, unlike many other 4X games a full suite of diplomatic options are available from the start and don’t need to be researched. Overall Feeling: This is a slower 4X game than many others in the genre. There is a large emphasis on internal city management and minor wars compared to competitor’s emphasis on technology or outright destroying opponents. If you’re looking for an “exciting” 4X or total war style strategy on the battlefield you may find yourself disappointed. If you want a historically flavored nation-building game with diplomatic and military options, focused more on strategy than tactics, you may have a winner on your hands here. I for one have enjoyed my time playing Oriental Empires immensely and would recommended it provided you are 1) interested in the setting 2) looking for a slower-paced, city focused 4X rather than a combat-oriented one.

Early Access Review
								(This first (but added after initial review): Since I am became convinced that the faults of this game are by design and not fixable (and since the developer seems to think that single player is done - making it unlikely that structural changes to core mechanics will even be attempted) I tried to get a refund. I didn't get it because I played the game for more than 2 hours. My fault for giving the game a second/third chance, I guess. If you don't want to run into the same trap just be aware that you have to make up your mind in the first two hours)If single player is indeed done and they are just working on multiplayer, then this is a bad game.Building buildings is a bad idea more often than not because the huge upkeep costs will ruin you. Even things like market places, which usually help build a working economy, seem to hurt your growth more than they help.The battles are very frustrating. There is no way to lock down enemy armies and they almost always survive the fight. Also the AI (which does all the moving and fighting for you) makes very dumb things... like ignore the enemy bandits that are pillaging your city (right next to your army) and instead attack the neutral player next to your OTHER city several hexes down. I've had to spend like 20 moves just hunting one bandit and I didn't even defeat him, he just retreated to somewhere else. I would really like to publicly execute that general and his entire army for incompetence, but the game doesn't even give you THAT option.Armies that lose their battle don't retreat to your city directly behind them, but instead to somewhere ~1.5 moves away from your city. Which puts you in trouble for next turn because your city is alone with whoever just routed you and you can't get back.And when you got an economy going by cleverly NOT building your cities, then peasant revolts turn 3 of your 9 cities in two turns (one of them your capital - which was fine a few turns before, so no idea what happened there). No warning or anything. And of course the peasants can afford military that you could only dream of (instant full stacked armies). Plus, what would you even use to reconquer? Your capital is the city that was built up to create armies.I mean not that a warning would help. You can't really do anything. I mean you could build a building for a few turns and then raze it after, but the helpful effects are negligible and the costs huge (and the whole idea of building a temple for a few turns to make the  peasants happy and then razing it for economic reasons is idiotic), Seriously, I had a very strong economy at one point, built an Taoist temple in every city, to make my peasants happy, and that alone completely tanked my entire economy.All in all the game continually expects you to make decisions, but all the data required to make those decisions is hidden from you. Like silk for example. Is it a good idea to produce silk? No idea. At this point I think it is probably ALWAYS a bad idea. Building it in every city will definitly ruin you. Maybe it will be feasible to build it once in your empire after you reach a certain size? Or maybe the only point when it is ever feasible is when you have a map buff for silk in one of your cities? But how would you know when? So right now I just avoid it... I mean what's the point of having so many buildings when almost all of them are designed as noobtraps?I am hoping that they will still work on single player because all in all this *could* be a very great game.The similarities with Civ end with the hexes, but the game is pretty much a carbon copy of TW games (right down to the end of turn gong) without user controlled battles (which I enjoyed less every TW game after Medieval II, so not a big loss there) and with faster turns (which is a HUGE plus).

								Solid 4x in ancient Chinese environment. Main difference from other 4x games is innovative combat system which is based not on units direct control but proper ordering and positioning of units on the map. Arrange your armies, set their formation and maneuver and send them to enemy. Battle commences on the end of the turn and its result depends on armies positioning, timings and orders of player units and the ones of the enemy. Sometimes it is a strategic gem, sometimes a mess, but always rewarding. :) Although it is in EA at the moment game run smoothly and there is no major flaws or bugs.			"

								Do not think Chinese Total War, think Chinese Civ. But without the long time span, and with far more immersion. The graphics are beautiful, as is the music. The game lacks a tutorial, but is largely intuitive. You might play 1-2 random map games on ""easy"" to get a handle on the features before starting the game in earnest. OverallThe +- amazing graphics and immersive effect- nice Chinese music- interesting gameplay and concepts. Think CIV 5, but with more depth.- good strateginc balancing. No spamming buildings: the upkeep makes building a strategic choice.- interesting battle mechanics. No direct control, but far more options than in Civ.The -- no tutorial (or maybe hidden somewhere?), only recommends from a nice lady- the number of mechanics could be expanded to avoid making the game repetitive- seasons change too fast, which is a bit repetitiveThat´s about it. Overall, I strongly recommend this.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is awesome. While reviews may be mixed and some can be rather scathing this is actually a very well done game.  It is done in the old style ala total war medieval 2 and civ 2 with more freeform and hardcore systems.  The city building seems to be a bit more like the upcoming civ 6 with a decentralized system rather than an internal system which allows the enviroment to vary your play a fair bit.  The map is dynamic in resources and ""goody huts"" which take place as encounter oppurtunities instead of huts.  However being a historical game the geography remains unchanged each game and depending on your faction choice your starting city will always be in the same place.  Cities expand thier borders not through culture or even through growth but instead through construction.  You have to build farmland to expand your city borders and the maximum distance of this is based on the settlement size which like medieval 2 is tied to population and the act of upgrading the town which also controls the number of buildings that can be supported and how many troops can be recruited at one time.  In this regard it is very much total war.That being said here are some breakdowns of things people have not noticed and have led to poor reviews:1. the game released like 3 days ago to early access and is very much playable despite this more so than most early access games ive played even years after they were released to early access.2. technology is performed by a 4 field system in which you constantly research 1 tech from each field at a time and some things in one field have pre-reqs in another field. some factions excel or suck at researching certain fields and events can cause the speed of research to rise and fall.3. combat is slightly unrefined but is also highly adaptive if you use it correctly.  I left some units in defend stance and told them to attack some archers who wanted to burn down my walls.  Sat there for a few minutes wondering why i lost 10 men and they just stood there.... yeah totally my fault.  More on combat later.4. techs provide a variety of benefits but can be broken down into 4 main effects. culture, authority, military and trade.Culture allows you to combat unhappiness by having a unfiied culture.  Events and tech increase these.  Authority let's you beat down those snobby nobles who dont like being controlled and effectively increase your city limit. Combat are techs that directly affect your combat options by adding or changing units.  Trade affects your ability to produce goods for internal trade or external trade.  Little tip on that research pottery first as it has no upkeep and provides pottery for internal trade early on.  Trade grows the longer it is operational so at first you lose money due to upkeep but pottery is pure profit.Now combat.  It seems this is most misunderstood even among those who spent all morning watching my stream.  Combat has a lot of variety in troop types and capabilities.  Spending time researching the movement speeds, morale levels, defense ability and attack ability is well worth it.  A low morale unit will break long before being killed.  Attaching a general to the army stack helps with this.  A unit that is high in defense ability will perform better in qa defense position but if you place them in defense and other units in attack the other units will move forward on the field and leave the defenders behind.  I hope they add a control for this to force like archers to stay behind defenders or they did and i haven't discovered how yet.  Facing also matters as a unit facing the wrong way will send less men into battle then one facing the right way.  All moves are planned in advance including facing so choose wisely.  Sieges are very realistic as well as I have had an army of 1000 men sit outside my city because they were all infantry and had no way to get through the walls and gates.  Archers can set the walls and gates on fire but upgrading from wood pallisades to rammed earth makes the walls immune to fire.  This doesnt stop archers though.  When attacking a town the number of openings determine how many units can hit the town at one time.  Each broken gate gets attacked and if you damage the walls your units can enter there as well.  With rammed earth archers can only burn the gates not the walls so you need stone throwers to break the walls open and create more openings.  PROS: diverse game with grand potential.pretty graphics even though zooming in on 96% naked dudes is a little wierd and those bucket head guys.high replayability.slow tactile game unlike civ where battles are just rock paper scissors and unit weight calculations.room for tons of improvements and expanded content and even a good start for a whole new kind of series that could keep expanding to be as epic as total war while retaining the 4x nature of civ games.CONS:random bugs as expected in early access like city name plates being transparent and backwards because it didnt load the billboard properly... happened once game reboot fixed.combat can sometimes be a little wonkylack of tutorials gives the game a steep learning curve.no multiplayer yet.half the factions are gated at 200 turns.  Play 200 turns and you unloack them all for use but 200 turns is a feat in it's self.			"

Early Access Review
								At last a game portraying the Warring State period in China. Or as close as it gets.First impressions :This is Early Access but the game feels more polished than some strategy game release lately. Great potential, fresh ideas, could be amazing in MP, i didn't play enough to assess long term replayability though (which is critical for 4Xs)UI :Interface is clean, and user friendly although usability is not on par with CIV, it takes some hours to get used to it.GFX :Graphics are uneven, it's great to zoom down to ground level and see buildings and people almost on scale, and overall the game look pretty. Terrain is not so good and tile improvements feel cheap (ie compared to Civ5). Each turn is a new Season which is quite cool visually (similar to RotK XI), unit details is a bit lacking especially texture feel cheap. Overall, despite these minor issues, it's still quite eye-pleasing. My major gripe with the GFX are the animations, they are choppy and the soldiers feel as rigid as the terracota army. Clashes between armies are not very epic bccause of that, and there can be a bit of benny hilling around too.Economy :Economy is interesting and engaging, it's actually fun to manage at least at the beginning, I don't know how well it scales towards the mid-late game. You have to be mindful of the satisfaction of the Nobility and the Peasants, who both can rebel against you. Nobles will contest your authority while Peasants will mostly complain if overworked/not fed enough etc. Raising armies can be very expensive, and limited income mean you have to carefully decide what to do in the early game, it feels good to develop the land and see your investments pay off after a while when trading routes are booming and your populationg growing fast.War :There are several type of units to train, most unlocked through technology. Units can stack on a single tile, where you can group them into formations and give them different behaviors for battle. The interface for managing units is a bit confusing so i hope they improve that.When you finish a turn all units move together simultaneously so you can intercept or escape enemies, if units are close enough they will engage in battle. Battles atm feel a bit wonky, especially when there is not  a lot of units around. It's hard to tell why they are attacking X and not Y or why they stop moving instead of engaging the enemy. Overall the system feels pretty interesting, but i hope it will be more fluid and understandable in the future. Diplomacy :Typical 4X diplomacy, similar to total war. Basically you have non agression pacts, defensive treaties, alliances, vassalage, tribute, etc. They didn't reinvent the wheel here. Technology :There is 4 trees that you can research in parallel, and there is a sizeable amount of techs in each of them, although there doesn't seem to be a lot of choices, i think gamers will find quickly a critical path to follow in most cases.AI :The AI seemed competent, although a bit weak. In my first game, most neighbors were seemingly scared of me and giving me money for non-agression pacts (kinda like in Warhammer TW at release). And when I attacked one of them he left 2 cities undefended which i could easily take (you can just march into a city if there is no garrison), before bringing his main army.			"

								This Game is pretty great. The only problem I got was getting into the game because many mechanics are different from what you'd expect them to be. I decided to make a short list about the pro's and con's:+ It looks beautiful - Zooming in and seeing every single face is awesome and I love the details+ The battle mechanics - I adore how they decided to make the combat in this game, sth like that in Civ would be amazing+ Tech's - The Tech-tree is divided into 4 parts, each work on their own but are still connected to each other+ Limited buildings - Yeah, I personally like that. You just can't build every building in one city because it has limited space+ Setting and Music - Both are awesome, nothing more to say to that. Never seen a game that is set in that period.+/- Whether you like or dislike the difficulty in this game is up to you. I for myself find it rather ""hard"" especially early game+/- I had a few crashes lately but haven't seen anyone complaining about that so I dont know if it's just me+/- As I said earlier, the game is hard to understand at first. I had several games I messed up by doing stuff wrong that I didn't know are actually wrong or different. I have about 300 hours at Civ 5, about 1000 hours in Total War Games, and this game often beeing selled as ""mix"" of both (which is actually wrong) I went in with the same strategies - My fault tho. - No Total War/Civ Mix - The game has alot in common with Civ (Hexagons, 4k game etc) but not much with TW. I'd rather say it is a ""Civ with new mechanics and awesome combat"".- The combat is sometimes weird - units dont attack each other because sth is in the way, they dont do what they are told to sometimes. The Battle AI struggles alot when facing two armies at once.So in conclusion, the Game is really good and I'm looking forward to the multiplayer. Some minor negative points but still worth a shot since you can always refund if it isnt what you expected it to be.tl;dr The game is good, try it out. Especially when you like Civ 5.			"

								Hmm It's quite nice game. Need some final additions. Has some corner cutting decisions as the whole garrison gets killed if city changes hands. Bye bye leader. Bandits are quite annoing. Labor service malus.But still It's a good 4x game for the price point. I would still wait until relese to get to most of it as this final polish will make or break this game and give it the civ like 4x feel, or make you play few sessions and the unistall. But this is the first game so somethings can be forgiven. Feels bit like playing civ 5 with out the expansions.Some needed additions/balance:1.Hot keys. Allow me to click at some button to go to next city like , and . keys or q,e. Allow to rebind the keys overall. Button for canceling  planned improvents like if you press enter it adds  1 farm more to be build queue.2. Clean up tech tree. The line dont make sense. Make it clear what you need to research the next tech. Like a tool tip you need the following techs. Also it would be nice to be able to see builings from the tech tree. what was the difference between the schools.3. Rework the Labor system. You can have a lot of ""unemployed"" population but still can only build 1 farm at time. I know you can work all the 4 category. but still lot unemployd ppl. This leads to that you dont really need the max distance cities or they will have a large unhappy population what won't never go away.4. Labor service malus. Make the ""tip"" clear that it only drops 1 point per turn. Meaby balance a bit ? Got 116 unhappines at capitlal from it. So it would take the rest of the game not doing anything to negate. Like if you work them too hard you would get a larger malus but if there is a lot of unemployed population it would decrease at increased rate. Or add to some building like admistarition rate or to the leaders virtue. Makes the forced labor  more ""fair"" not so slave work .Give some option to combat this. 5. Bandits. hard to kill so they retreat all around. Pillaging all around. Some way ? to deal with them? Patrol unit, watchtowers?6. Vassals of enemies should be friendly if you are friendly with theirs liege. Or give option to make the  Frindship pact with vassals.7. Option to disable trade routes and a way to redraw them/re-fress. They look bad if you have a road going same distence and the trade route goes on the plains in stead of the road. Also you could include some coloring to trade routes. 8 Some way to see the distance between cities. As  Bazaar(trade building) enables 12 hexes trade routes.But the hotkeys are the most important also button for canceling  planned improvents like if you press enter it adds  1 farm more to be build queue.Will update this most likely to positve as they relese the game.

								I have been looking forward to playing this game for zonks and it does not disappoint. First up it's very good.It looks lovely, no glitches,crashes or lock ups.It runs well and it's easy to navigate round the game. For what you are getting it's reasonably priced. Apparently the Devs of this game are the very same who made the superb ""Medieval  11''.But it isn't a Total War clone nor a Chinese Civ 5 it's very much it's own game and good for them making it so.The music is splendid,I'm deeply in love with my adviser who is as helpful as she is lovely. I snap orders to my troops, right flanking in two bounds,  way you go boys and I got to say they don't actually follow my orders to the letter. Still I have had budding Napoleons issue me a few that I disregarded so can not moan too much there...                                            This is quite a complicated game- it does have good clear instructions but it's a bit different from a lot of other games we all  play.If you are all right with that buy it. It's pretty damned good.....			"

								I need to suggest a two things that I feel could help make the game better.First:-When you get a Vassal, lets have a feature that allows us to give orders to them. i.e. Strategic orders, when I get in to battle and I have a Vassal available. Most of the time they don't come to my aid. Lets make it possible for them to help us in a strategic way so this game could become a lot more fun strategically.Second:-Lets have a feature to cut off the enemies escape. Most of the time I have two set of armies on both side of the enemy. When the enemy escape towards their rear. My second army just lets them go. I rarely see the enemy engage in second combat with another army right after getting out of one.Overall I enjoy playing this game. It's simple addicting. But could be a lot better.			"

								Just wanted to address a couple of criticisms made by a few other people. Some have said it needs a mini-map, zoom out with the mouse wheel and there is the mini-map, game does not need a mini-map, this is similar to how the map is done in Hegemony and a couple of other games. Saw a criticism of the GUI, have to disagree again, this a very elegant GUI and I had no issue with it at all. You can see the indluence of the Total War games in the GUI and even has the advisor in the top left. This is a class A GUI, IMO.I had no issues learning the game so far because it has the advisor and built in help system.This game is an almagmation of Civ+TW+ROTK, etc. and is very well done, IMO. Anyone that likes those games will like this game. The battle system is not like TW and you give formation and stance orders before battles but do no control your units on the battlefield.8/10 maybe 9/10 when finished			"

								This game is amazing and it's not expensive. Now Like most people have said it was just released and has many problems because of that. Multiplayer is a feature but it is not finished as well.Even if you played The Civilization franchise there may still be a learning curve for this game.The game consists of Chinese empires that start with a pre placed city. This city lets you construct buildings for gold and build farms, roads, etc. for free. The cities also use a happiness system involving complex scenarios like blood rain, labor unrest, insignificant authority etc. Some empires will be weak and others will grow powerful so it is essential to learn to control your economy since troops are free to obtain but have salaries. Troops also come with a emperor and his successors that you gain overtime. If your emperor dies he will be replaced but authority will drop and cities unrest will go up. Authority is needed to gain more cities and better approval from nobles. Troops and cities are divided by nobles and peasants so try to appeal to both.There is a tech/culture tree that involves 4 different menus that relate to different things.The games turns run simultaneous and all troops move together. Units can be stacked and move as customizable armies. Zooming in and out or using the play>fastforward>pause buttons can speed or slow a the map like mount and blade.I have figured out how to hack the gold but will not share since the developers probably don't want you doing that at the moment. There is much more about the game by why should I spoil it all for you? Overall I highly recommend this Civ 5, Total War, Mount and blade crossover like game.			"

								Quick Summary: It's a good game that has bugs that need to be fixed and has a learning curve, but it is worth the buy if you like Total War or Civ or both.Long Answer: I love both Total War and Civ so I was excited to hear that there was a new competitor to these two great franchises. Oriental Empires was something new but still holding to old 4X styles. Taking place in ancient China was a great idea. Overall the graphics are great in regards to how many items the engine has to load. Also the ability to zoom in to eye level with your peasants and armies is great for immersion.      But that's all of the good stuff. You want to hear the bad I presume. Well first off, if you played Civ, get rid of all that you learned from it. If you try to expand rapidly. If you try to be super militaristic in the early game. If you try to use your peasants too much....There will be a lot of rebellions. Peasants will rebel if you make them work too much. Seems easy right, just don't build too many farm early on? Well then you have the nobles to worry about.     The nobles will rebel if you don't have enough authority or in other words right to rule. The number of authority you have tells you how many cities you can have without the nobles becoming angry. Early on you won't have many points in authority. In fact even if you do have authority, if your leader dies, you will have nobles come close to rebelling.     If you think these rebellions will be a piece of cake, you would be wrong. Rebels will take your entire city, convert your armies to their side, and ultimately cause you to rage quit. Even the AI has problem with rebels. I've seen powerful groups of nomadic factions grow to be the most powerful force in the game, but the nobles rebel and they are stuck in an eternal   conflict with themselves.      So knowing that, it's pretty easy to stop rebellions from happening actually. Just be smart. Infact all of the other learning curves such as trade, war, and money will be easy if you are smart about it. The only thing I can really warn you about is, don't start next to the White Di or the Zhou. They are usually the factions to become the strongest in China. They do this by taking a whole bunch of cities early on. So do not start next to them!     But that's all I have to say.			"

Art of StrategyOriental Empires feels like a blend of Civilisation and Total War series. Happily sank two whole evenings into it already and plan to explore more factions. Definitely recommend it for strategy game fans, despite one or two issues (as detailed below)Pros Forgiving Movement System Expansive Map & Rewarding Exploration Intuitive UI and Thorough Tutorial & Help System Polished Presentation Set during (what I personally find) an exciting period in historyCons Easy to get into downward spiral of negative income and rebellious cities Expanding your empire becomes harder relatively early in the gameTo elaborate a bit on the above points, I found unlike a lot of strategy games, the movement and combat system doesn't punish mistakes. Being able to set up all your moves, then only have them executed at the end of the turn allows for much easier planning, and means if you make a mistake, you can undo it. Ultimately, that makes executing complex strategies much easier. Related to that, the combat system, even though there's no direct control of the battles, does a good job of simulating interactions between multiple armies on the battlefield.Where I really struggled with this game was in building up an empire beyond the first 3 or 4 cities. A chance famine combined with a random flood event can throw cities into peasant uprising, with relatively few options for redressing that. Equally, making money in order to expand my empire, in order to make more money was a real struggle - Creating a trading network and carefully investing in building more economic buildings didn't always result in increased revenue. Makes it hard to expand to more than 3 or 4 cities, and some of the solutions I've found are counter-intuitive to say the least.Overall - BuyReally happy with this game, despite my frustrations with some aspects of the empire building. Definitely recommend it though to any strategy game fans!			"

								Nice combination of Civilization franchise and Total War (with a little bit of Stellaris) !(Don't forget, it's early access, the game is not in it's final state.)Pros:-It's looks what i'd hoped Civ 6 look like... Realistic, a lots of detail and huges battlefields. A got to say, the devellopers are NOT lazy. Every building and technology have visual impact on the game.-Chinese history, baby ! A lot to learn on the chinese culture and history in this game, it lack of original chinese nouns for     units and buildings tho (with their traduction/pronunciation for moron like me)- Good political and society ideas : Edicts with impact on the population, noble and peasants social class with their needs and interests.- A real 4x game turn by turn with a little twist of real time for the battles, wich is nice !Cons;- The UI is unclear on so many level : there's no icon for ressources you produce, no mini map, the real effect of building/technology are hide behind a very interesting and useless history about it. Tactical information are not displayed (movement cost of terrain, defense advantage of terrain) WE NEED MORE COLOURS/ICONS IN THE UI PLEASE. - The diplomacy don't work very well. Maybe it's work in progress but i didn't manage to negociate with the computer. Even being first in everything, nobody wants to be my vassal or to appoint me Emperor (even after conquering half of their land). You know something's off when you maul a tribe to the pit of death and they don't even are willing to give you a single coin of gold to end the war.- Like a lot of 4X games, it lose of its interest on the late game, i find myself doing useless war and construct farms automatically waiting for the last Era.- I won a cultural vicotry without seaking it, early in the game ( i won on turn 150 and the game last 300 turns) Maybe a little bit of balance on victory condition i guess.

								This game has largely the same factions as the manga Kingdom and plays a lot like Endless Legends/Civ/Total War. I've been following it since it was first announced like two years ago and I think the current result is pretty good, but not perfect. Pros:- fresh setting (as far as I know this is the only other game on Steam besides RTK13 that is set in China)- seamless zoom on a map with Total War level graphics- the combat is simple and easy to understand without feeling like a rehash- costs less than half that of a major game these days- the AI doesn't seem to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like in some games and can be quite aggressive (if you don't have walls and garrisons your cities will be taken)- the main devs designed Medieval 2 and judging from the direction this game is going they know what they're doing- factions can be unlocked rather than hidden behind a paywallCons:- the game stutters a lot- the battle animations are pretty bad and nothing on par with Shogun 2 (but only a bit worse than Rome 2)- construction is hard to understand and not all the math is displayed to the player properly- there's not really a tutorial and reading the guide sucks- the implementation of the tech tree is uninspired and boring- UI is missing features like a mini map, also when a faction declares war on you it's hidden away in the event box, which can be frustrating- turns take a bit too long, i'd like a third speed- some factions are locked which is weird because some of the factions among them like the Qin are quintessential to the setting, it would be like if you had to play as Carthage in Rome Total War to unlock Rome, so that's quite frustrating, imo only the nomad and barbarian factions should require unlocking while the main Warring States should be the default factions- faction abilities are quite underwhelming, they're basically stat buffs- the game doesn't represent all of China, not just Tibet and Xinjiang are missing, but also a lot of southern China, which would be fine if the game only took place during the ancient era, but it's quite weird playing in the imperial age and not be able to expand to Guangxi or Guangdong- no zoom to mouse cursor option- no edge scrolling			"

								A VERY cool little 4X game. It takes a zoom system similar to a game like Ruse, the core gameplay tenets of a Civilization, and adds some flair of its own for a really interesting combination. Coming in as a fan of Romance of the Three Kingdoms games, I'm excited to be able to experience this setting from its roots in the early bronze age all the way through its early post-imperial age, and it's doing a good job of really pulling me into the setting.The addition of characters (including your leader and potential heirs) and real-time military engagements, complete with a plethora of behavioral options for each of your military units, make for a couple of strong layer additions to the traditional 4X formula. Both elements are executed elegantly and feel ""right"" in the context of the game's other systems.Battle is a unique combination of 4X turn-based placement strategy, operational settings and a little luck, as stacks of units form armies that spread across the surrounding area of the map in real time when contacting enemies, behaving in battle according to the behaviors you've set for each unit. I've yet to get to diplomacy or mid-game economics and policy, but according to everything I've seen of the game so far, I don't expect them to disappoint.And just to top it all off, it LOOKS really great for a 444 MB download. It does a superb job of recreating period architecture and regional flora. Seasons come and go, and each is rendered beautifully. On my graphics settings, it's far from graphically groundbreaking, but it looks magnificent in a way all its own.Even more impressive is how it manages to scale everything - buildings, mountains, individual people in units - in a way that makes everything look realistically proportioned against everything else, something most 4X games don't even bother attempting. It makes the micro/macro zoom feature so beautiful. I love being able to observe the vast empire I've built from up high, then step down on the literal ground level to look at a particular city or battle up close. How many 4X games do you know that let you walk the streets of your cities? :)Definitely worth my money. I can't wait to see it at its fully completed state, it's already a fantastic addition to my library.			"

Yeah it is an early release and there are bugs but it is:Pro's:1  pretty to look at-you can almost zoom up a peasants nostril2 deep enough to keep you going-solid tech tree and complexity of societal development 3 allows you a Civ 5 familiarity of game play with combat that blows it out of the water4 Epic Epic scale5 Everybody was Kung Fu fighting and they were fast as lightning wo ho ho ho....Cons1 The AI needs work2 More sound track variation--same mooshu musak over and over3 A tutorial for the impatient who prefer not to read4 A few bugs need fixing like turns-to-completion on out-of-city construction projects5 Mini map would be niceOver all it is the only early release that I bought and did not regret.

								very, very good game. it tackles the period very nicely. music is great, could use more variety though. after about half an hour or so you start to get tired of it. the battle system is very interesting. you can edit formations and which attack style your units will take (for example, you can put a peasant spearment on reserves, a bowman on defense and another peasant spearman on charge) while you can't control them as the battle is going on, it's still very fun. the city management is interesting, though i usually auto manage everything as i'm not good with micro management. the game is in early access, but still playable. there is bugs, but that's to be expected. this isn't like most early access games where they just give up a few months in, Oriental Empires is being developed very actively, the developers are very good with communicating and listening to the community, very friendly. the game is playable to the point to where you can finish a game, but is nowhere near finished. still very fun though, would reccomend. siege system is pretty confusing at first, though.

								WARNING: If you do not like battles where you have no direct, manual control over the tactical outcome, do NOT get this game. Just don't. There are too many 4x games out there where people get it and leave a negative review because they are expecting old school tactical battles. Save yourself the trouble and prevent confusion at the same time.That said, this is a great 4x game for people interested in the setting. The map is massive, and there are a lot of strategic options that give each playthrough a little something different to try. The economic/trade system is abstracted, but it makes intuitive sense and there's some good depth to it, which is what I look for when building trade empires.The tech tree is mid-sized, but I didn't find a tech that I didn't want to use; not a lot of superfluous tech and while specializing in the early game seems important, you'll have it all researched by the ""endgame"".Other than that, it plays somewhat like Civ and/or Endless Legend so if you you liked those games, don't care about tactical battles (or find them tedious), this is a good, solid title to get your hands on.

A few caveats: The early game is ridiculously hard and seems to last a very long time. It took me a hundred turns before I started really going.The AI telegraphs its punches. I had three Chu armies just hanging around outside my capital for five turns, on a countdown for our truce to end. Since defensive armies can be called up immediately, this didn't go well for them.Still, it's great. It's great and I love it.			"

As of right now this game is equivilant to Civ 4 great empire management with a broken combat system, highly recommend if the siege mechanics better explained or fixed.			"

								Definitely a fun game, a slight work in progress but its come a long way from its initial state in only 4 months. its similar in some degree to civ, however it does combat justice (scale of battles are interesting) some tactical involvement wouldnt hurt since its mostly, to me, ""move this unit towards that units square and hope they go into combat"" sometimes it can be clunky and the wrong units engage, only a small issue. It actually takes more than 50 turns to get the campaign in full swing as well, id even say up until turn 100 it may be a bit sluggish but its definitely worth it when you are having grand engangements against other factions. i digress, im rambling, overall i enjoy this game 8/10 for initial release, will easily be a 10/10 with some polishing!

								This game really caught me. The time frame of the game is quite rare. I am already fed up by WWII or medieval Europe title. But this one made me want to dig more in acient Chinese history. Their history, equipment, organization of the army, even their taxation system. Another part that I liked is that this game threw TW RTT battle away and every battle is on the hex map. TW RTT battle is tedious for me to be honest. And the game really made the logic change.The third is the grand campaign's state location is almost accurate(perhaps excluding Ba, which should be the west of Shu)  This gives me feel the touch of that warring state era.Still the game is in early access. I think the worst flaw that dev made is the tutorial is not so intuitive which caused much confusion.  Dev should really look upon updating their tutorial. I understand as boardgame guy, we just read the manual of the boardgame and start playing.  Perhaps many other players are customed to this process.  So most complaint comes from not understanding the game and they don't want to try more or read every word of tutorial.  However, after about ten hours learning, try and fail then try again, I got the logic of this game. which is quite reasonable. I can see the dev modelling intention in this game.  AI of course could be improved to after people are quire familiar with game's mechanics.I really hope the game's multiplayer mode would be released soon to have the experience with human players.

								First let me say I NEVER review anything EVER... but this game had to be. I have been a fan of Romance of the Three Kingdoms (the games) ever since I played the first one in 1989 on NES. I am ALSO a huge fan of Sid Meier's Cvilization games and the Total War games. This game is a pretty good blend of the those game styles (ROTTK, more if you play the yellow turban rebellion senarios). When I first started looking at this game, so many reviews made it sound like you could go on the battle field and command individual units like in Total War, but it's more like Civ where you stack up units and run in hoping good will come out of it. I am still very ok with that. This game is all around good, yeah there's some little shenanigans in it still (mine likes to label my cities with other factions city names overlaying my city names). I like this game because I can play anywhere from isolationism defense all the way to the other side of the scale the whole WAR GO! GO! GO! I highly recommend this game to ESPECIALLY Civ and ROTTK lovers, just dont expect the perfect-ness that are those games, but hopefully in time this game will get all the minor tweaks it could use. Thank you ORIENTAL EMPIRES you have brought back my hope for good strategy games in this genre! I hope this helps anyone stilll on the fence about buying. If the VERY unprofessional review from a guy that just likes playing video games didn't persuade you think of it another way, The new Civ 6 is $60 and all the Total War games start at about $60, Oriental Empires is $25 and so far it's just as good as those SUPER big name guys!

								I'm very optimistic about this game, and will be following its development with great interest. I have only had the time to give it a very preliminary try, but was already impressed by its innovative combination of well-known aspects of some of the best-loved strategy games. The city-management appears distinctly CIV-like, as does the settling of new cities. Map interface and movement of units on it seems mostly indepted to Total War -franchise, but with some differences. Technology tree and research comes across as a combination of both CIV and TW, and the simultaneity of several branches or fields of research not only feels intuitively 'right', but also confirms my hunch (based on such games as Stellaris) that this is the way to go in grand strategy.As for the setting - it astonishes me that it has not yet been treated by more franchises or studios. Originally, I hoped for TW series to feature the Warring States period, but this does not seem the way the company wants the franchise to develop. A pity, as such. So while I'm waiting for Paradox to have their go at the Warring States of China, Oriental Empires is a really wonderful game to have. Thank you and good luck to the developers!			"

								Just made it about 150 turns into my first campaign playing the Shu. After a methodical start I initated an early war against my local rivals the Ba clan. Destroying their forward settlement ensured I remained unchallenged south fo the mountains. Set forth a plan of expansion and trade racking up nearly 10k gold for myself and 1k+/turn income. My lands stretched as far as I could explore under the mountains. Heir was born early and traveled far an wide with under his fathers leadership. Both acquired many boons from travelers they met on their journey adding to our nations splendor. Such abundance gave rise to 9 cities, and 2 new settlers to push our destined boundaries. Peace on all fronts, was maintained with tribute from all three primary rivals. Yet trouble stirred in the forrests when a small bands of  bandits skirmished here and there. They family had nearly mapped the entire southern lands when at the edge of the known world the faction leader succombed to old age. Boom, instant civil war nearly 40 spaces away. The unrest that had been building in the capital finally snapped like the top layer of bamboo on a tiger trap. An 8-peasant spearmen army seizes my capital of Pi and marches on it's twin (but even bigger second city) I quickly muster the heir from nearly half a maps length away, along with all of the bandit killing peasant/noble mix among my other cities. Nearly 20 units on the board but only 4 garrisoned in the city. Rapid recruitment produces an army of 2 nobles and 6 peasants to meet the now named Red Eye Rebellion. An indecisive victory ensues. We route back into the city of Dao but out kill the enemy 4:1. The heir finally makes it to the most Western town of Shu--still several towns away. We pursue again this time smashing the rebels until they flee the field. But wait, one of the peasant armies defects to the rebels. No matter they too will fall under our heel. 4 new troops arrival at the second city of Dao, while the original counter attack presses on. Another clear victory is beset upon the fleeing rabble, we should begin to assault the capital soon. Wait, that can't be. The entire 8 stack defected to the rebels. A combined 14 stack is outside of the second city. All is lost.This game is no RoTK, but valiant effort to fill a space lacking in tactial strategy games. If you need something to stave off your dreams of empire until Mount and Blade II this game might scratch that itch for a short while.I would strongly recommend this during a winter/summer sale but due to the current state of game (bugs and clunky UI) I couldn't stand behind it at full price.

Early Access Review
								It says its an Early Access game, but I feel I am getting a completed game. Great job developers!Some 3 hours into the game, allow me to sum up the pros and cons I can find.Pros:-Great details and graphics (cities, boats, units, etc.)-Total War like combat, albeit it is not as smooth-Its pretty easy to get on with the game, but it requires some thinking on a deeper level on the later stages of the game, especially when you are choosing between getting an extra 10% unrest (which can be deadly...I am currently facing this problem...) or an amazing economic boom.-They do offer a very friendly ""easy"" mode in which other countries will incline to sign non-aggression pacts with you and allow you to develop and get on with the game-There are some historical accuracy, I haven't got much further so I don't know how accurate it can getNow some cons:-Some bugs, when you load sometimes the cities' names are misaligned and another city's name is aligned onto one of my cities...-The unit AI can be some what weird, when garrisons exit a city they don't exit from one gate, so this causes a serious problem which for example, if an enemy is attacking from the North, and you order your garrison to go out into the fields and battle them, the individual units exit through different gates, if it happens to be an archer unit exited from the North, it would get slaughtered by the enemy while your heavy infantry has to circle around all the way from the South gate. I do hope this can get fixed.-The economic system is kind of funny. In the early stages you basically just have to build A LOT of cities to make sure you are ahead of other countries in terms of economy. There is very little trade system involved, there are 'internal trade' but that does not help with your economy (or maybe its just me). Later there is an edict to impose some tax, and suddenly your income can skyrocket to 500/turn in contrast to the 100~200/turn...okay...? but in return this adds 10% peasant unrest.-The character system is odd, there are just random chances characters emerge...I would suggest an overhaul of the character system so it is more like Shogun 2 Total War.I personally think this game has its potential, and its pretty fun to play it even in its current stage. This is what I am going to play for 4X games before Civ VI is released.I personally would like to see DLCs for this game in which the tech tree is expanded to at least the 1800s and you get to battle Western Civs (or play as Western Civs). That would definitely be fun to play. I encourage the developers to take this game to the next level.Edit 9/23: Some new thoughts...-Frame rate fluctuates crazily-Some buildings and upkeep feels overpriced...			"

								Very buggy, but it has a solid concept and a very entertaining battle system.The major bugs currently can be very annoying but once you adapt your playstyle to get around them you can play for days. Although I don't think there's a whole lot of replayability atm.Also sieges are very weird, you need archers or catapults/cannons to attack a city and you don't really get anything for siege equipment. You also need ALOT of units to actually take a city, if you don't have regular reinforcements or don't do more damage than you heal then you're forced to retreat and recover and while you recover your enemies recover as-well. You can't even lay siege and starve them all.I'd love to see more siege features like the ability to create siege towers and fire over the walls while your melee troops build ladders or an earth pile to jump over the walls and throw projectiles at the defenders below. And battles in general are very monotone, units respond all at once and move like robots and their charges don't feel like they have impact.			"

								This is a great game that cater much into the historical accuracy of China. The game is fun and the battle is innovative, but there are some areas that this game will get even better:a) Please make scripts and events for the grand campaign mode, there are many historical events (and most are quite interesting) in the warring states period that I think could make the game 100x more fun, the current campaign mode is no different from the map mode except for the fixed faction starting location. b) Should involve real historical character for each faction.Again, these are just my two cents, I am glad to have this fresh genre in the game industry and I hope the developer will continue to improve the game.

								A cross between Civilization and Total War: Shogun, Oriental Empires has potential, but I can't recommend the game in its current state:* combat needs improvement (particularly city sieges and battle formations);* diplomacy is nearly non-existent;* economy seems broken (markets and the like seem to cost more to maintain than they generate);* skill trees are confusing with little information, so not clear what benefits each skill offeres or even which prerequisites are necessary to select that skill.I want to like this game, but it's just not there yet. I realized it when I was 100 or so turns in and just got bored with everything. Nothing like the ""just ... one ... more ... turn"" feel of Civ or Total War. Hoping the Devs fix these issues so I can change my review.			"

								Once you become accustomed to the UI and get a bit of experience with the actual game it can be a very addictive and an unexpectedly relaxing game.  You may have read some people say that it's  a Total War/Civ  hybrid but that may be unfair/misleading. The buyer should know that the TW characteristics in this game are the earlier old school: micro-management,  natural disasters/events , politics/happiness/rebellions and some locked factions which unlock after you progress in the game.  Don't expect player controlled tactical battlesAlso the game doesn't hold your hand and a lot of players find it difficult on easy. It's early access so it's buggy and by no means perfect.  Despite this it can be enjoyable once you get the hang of things.  Bear in mind that this game is made by a handful of guys and not an established AAA studio so don't have unrealistically high expectations. So if you're a perfectionist looking for a slick, smooth flawless game this probably isn't for you but if you don't mind something a bit rough around the edges then it's worth a try. I've enjoyed it, but it does have some frustrating moments.			"

Early Access Review
								There is a lot this game does right, and it felt lovely playing it for a while. But for me there are too many things that need to be improved before i recommend this game.Improve Diplomacy: I like how the enemy AI is very opportunistic, attacking you when it senses a weakness, but other than that it's very dull and has no depth whatsoever. And no meaning either. I paid an enemy 700 gold (was cheap) for 50 rounds of peace only to have him declare war on me again 5 turns later. He should atleast get some penalty or diplomatic consequences from other nations. It feels like no matter what i do diplomatically, it won't effect my strategy. I can go to war if i want. Or not. It doesnt really change much except how many units i have to manage.Improve Battle Mechanics: And managing these units is just as dull. The different unit strategies are cool and seem to work so-so ok in battle... but in siege mode it's chaos! I don't really know what's going on sometimes. Nothing makes sense and it doesn't feel like a siege at all. How can my archers light their palisades on fire before i reasearched the fire arrow? And how can a couple of peasant rebels who JUST spawned this turn, prevent my main army (who luckily happened to be one turn away from the turned city) from marching toward the city to reclaim it? No matter what I command, my army will be distracted like a moth by a light and chase after those peasants only to have them withdraw and everyone return to where they started at the beginning of the turn. Over and Over, until my main army joins the rebels. I could have crushed the peasants and the turned city but now i've somehow lost everything. The AI priorities are seriously messed up. They shouldn't auto engage like that (or auto pillage farms!). Also, very often during battle you'll have 1 unit fighting the enemy unit while your other units stand and watch, but it KINDA works if you chose 'outflank'. So the strategies seem to work, but the units scatter all over the place because they don't really follow the route designated by you until AFTER the battle.  Improve City Management:City Managment is confusing. What it needs most is some sort of citizen/work management. I completely crippled a city because i built 2 gold mines there first. Then I had no more citizens to build a farm and couldn't grow more citizens. I had to demolish a gold mine and rebuild. Instead of being able to momentarily turn off the gold mine's production. I also don't understand how to give my farmers a break, like the game often recommends me to, when i can't turn off farms or manage anything. Unhappiness just grows silently in the background and i can't really tell where it's coming from except for the very vague info you get. Make it more clear overall, more viewable and more managable.Steam Workshop: If you can't fix this game, maybe the modders will. They will definitely make it more interesting long-term.The game could be really good, and i hope they fix it as it IS early access after all. It would be a shame if it didn't improve. The Civ/Total War hybrid idea is awesome and it feels very nice establishing the first few cities and getting the trade routes up and running and all, a very good pace somehow, but then it just gets dull. It lacks overall depth. The game doesn't reward you for your choices / strategy. You just earn money and build. Neither other nations, nor your army, nor citizens seem to react to anything you do.

								I'm getting a refund. ANYWAYS the factions are just various dynasties that existed in chinese history. Shu, Han, Qin, Zhou etc. It's a random placement on the map with all factions just going ham on each other. Feels like a  shallow civ 5 clone to me. Combat is also horrendous with confusing to maybe even 0 mechanics to it. The tech tree is also very dull for such a historically and culturally rich nation.			"

Right now the music is very nice but monotone, and sometimes makes me feel im in a Cantonese buffet.			"

								Anyone who is reading...The game graphics and concept is very similar to Total War games and Sid Myers Civilization(s) games, as well as the gameplay itself. Its a mixture of both game types put into one and it makes its own unique game version. It has its own features that of its own. The game still has room for improvements, but its still in early access. I def raise my hat to the developers of the game for the graphics and gameplay. I rate this game 8 out of 10 as of right now and if this game continue to deliver after the multiplayer comes out than my rating will be 10. NOTE TO THE DEVELOPERSHope after this project, you will be starting on a new one similar to this gameplay type. I will definetly be looking out for your games now. Good job on your work and hope best of luck in the future.			"

								Game has a solid base that is similar to Endless legend but with the premise of larger armies. Sadly the larger armies while adding a bit of depth proves to be shallow at best. Majority of the game is spent doing nothing but building up an empire. Very little warring early game except for bandits. Instead you will find most games unfinished doing rebellions that spiral out of control with armies that defect so you can't actually attack. None of this is game breaking until you combine the random events with unhappiness ratings you can't control. Essentially your peasant unhappniness could be 50% that you can't control locusts move in it hits 75 then due to lack of food it hits 100 they rebel and half your empire goes with it. Essentially while the mechanics are interesting the above makes the game more frustrating than its worth. The event tiles are barebones and lack any real depth.(Pro)Plays like Endless LegendsLarger armies on screen is interestingGameplay streamlines but their is still some depth to itGood learning curveMultiple play styles(Cons)Large armies just for show Happiness mechanic seems arbitrary with no real player controlArmy leaders are generic and boring serve little real purposeGameplay is excuciatingly slowRebellion mechanic is essentially brokenArmies seldom defeated example units just run 40 times they seldom get destroyedGame has a good premise but alot of the hype seen on youtube etc is just that hype. Game needs some balancing / tweaks along with greater freedom for custom games. "

								What is this game? It's a Civilization-style 4X game with a more robust combat system set in Ancient China. It has tech trees, diplomacy, multiple factions with their own advantages and drawbacks, and much more. It is nearly feature-complete next to a Civ game, but it doesn't have much in the way of a religion/missionary/holy war system (since that really doesn't apply well to Chinese history). There is a bit of a learning curve. You are forced to do battle a lot in some maps, so get it out of your head that you can do the ol' Civ 4 single-base strategy and sit in a corner on your own hoping no one bothers you. You will be harassed by bandits and your territory will be encroached on. If you expand too quickly or overwork your people you'll get revolts.If you're a fan of Civilization and Ancient China and you always wished the Civilization games had a better combat system, but were always put off by the depth and length of the Total War combat system, then this is a game made for you.As for me, this game almost literally seems made for me. I'm a lifelong fan of 4X's and have a master's degree in Chinese Studies. I LOVE this game. It may be my new favorite.But here are some Cons to keep in mind:1. It's in early access so AI has some issues2. Once revolts start happening it's hard to recover at the moment3. There are some balance issues... chariots in particular are not as good as they should be4. There is a semi-steep learning curve (watch a YouTube tutorial or Let's Play first)5. The tech tree is a lot more complex-looking than Civ 5's, but it isn't really. It's cool once you get used to it.6.  Some typos and awkward grammar in the tooltips7. Diplomacy AI seems to need a few minor tweaks, and there should be more indicators about how the other factions feel about you8. The game looks beautiful but some of the factions recycle diplomacy screens, so that feels a bit cheap.For early access I give it 8/10 with hope that it may one day rise to true greatness. I say buy it now, though, because it's really awesome for the price and I want to see some DLC for this bad boy.			"

								overall positive experience.The map was done beautifuly.The fact that all units move simultaniously is excelent it gets rid of the (unfair/ unrealistic) advantage agressing units get in civ.The map is a  verry good size, especialy with relation to troop movement , the time that passes each turn and terrain inhibiters it feels like its taking the amout of time it is supposed to in order to get from one place to the next. (it could be bigger but thats just because i want more ;P)Critiques.left clicking with my mouse can make the game unresponsive, possibly a result of my low tech but could be worth looking into.the millatary units need more options for what orders you are able to give them, i think you are on the right track with the comands that are available, but individual targeting of enemy units within the stack would be nice, battle formations and holding formation is something that is needed.The Ai seems to be lacking a bit, they are too easily manipulated. (diplomaticly, millatarily they kinda just run at the first weak settlement they can get too)eagerly awaiting multiplayer, (the more non ai nations in the game the better) "

								I have been waiting for a game like this for years. China has one of the most influential civilizations in the world and it is showcased in this game. The technology tech tree for example is excellant and shows the various technologies, knowledge and advancements a state can achieve. This gives as well a history of Chinese development to the gamer who has no knowledge of China. The combat system is good, but a few fixes should be implemented especially with sieges which are difficult and complicated. A mini-map would be good, but what has me a little upset is the building system. The upkeep costs is way too much. Buildings that are suppose to help in income destroys your income like for example markets and quays. This problem has to be fixed to make the game more enjoyable as I'm on my 155 turn and only have 19 gold income per turn and can't build any more buildings or upgrade cities due high upkeep. Another problem is revolts in which peasants can take over any of your cities and have a full stack army?? And its difficult to decrease the unhappiness if you don't have the money to build specific buildings due to the upkeep costs. Other than that the game is awesome.			"

								This game is already quite good.  It's basically Civ with a Total War element for smart people.  To all the people giving this game a bad review... GET GUD SCRUB!Seriously though, I think people are disliking the game because it's difficult and not particularly intuitive yet.  That being said, it's lack of intuitiveness comes from it playing like Civ games, BUT HAVING MECHANICS THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRE YOU TO USE YOUR BRAIN.  What a concept!For instance, building every building in your city isn't wise (or possible).  As buildings come with steep upkeep, you actually have to plan out your Empire a bit economically to get the most out of it and turn a profit.  If you space out your cities too much, they will be too far for trade between cities (logical right?).  If you are making silk in every city, then you're trade caravans won't be trading silk between cities (makes sense, huh?).  So therefore you won't get the lucrative trade multiplier on your goods.  Therefore, you need cities specializing in goods and then trading between them to make the most money.The game is highly logical in its mechanics and the way it plays.  Sieges take multiple turns.  Peasants get unruly if you're constantly using them to do back-breaking labor.  Etc. Etc.It's not without its flaws.  The game has a number of bugs, especially once you get hundreds of turns in.  Though, none have been game-breaking.  They're mostly just annoyances that cause you to reload and then it's back to normal.I think with more development this game will extremely outclass Civ and Total War.  Albeit, the intellectual nature of the game's mechanics and it's Ancient China theme will likely not appeal to a huge market.TL;DR If you like Civ/Total War and are someone who enjoys a challenge and has a brain, get this game.  You'll love it.  If you're a pleb, then don't.			"

Early Access Review
								First of all it is more like Civilisation then TW. The battles are real time but you don't give orders to your units during the battle, you give them standing orders before it. Epoch goes from early Bronze age up to the Imperial age, with gunpowder and paper money etc. Aparently there is a difference between Farmer factions and Herder factions, but the Herder factions are locked until you have played the game for 200 turns so I don't know what the difference is. Its good as it is although I have two complaints. One is that there is an effect when you work a city, work as in Build buildings, cultivate farms, contruct roads and so on, where you build up a malus negative effect on the moral of the peasants of that city. The problem as it stands is the malus grows and grows as long as you work the city, and its only by leaving the city to stagnate that the malus decreases. And the problem is that it slowly increases and slowly decreases, so 50 turns of building need to be compensated by 50 turns of nothing. It needs to be rebalanced.The second problem is the balancing of battles, its not a major problem but as it stands you ocasionally get a semi-elite unit holding out against a full stack of milita. Another minor problem is the lack of bridges, although they functionally exist it just looks like you have build a road on the riverbed.Of the positives: the variety of units is quite impressive. Millita, Noble, Trained, Convict and Palace are the recruitment catagories, which alone is special. Then several types of Melee Infantry, Foot Missile, 3 Types of Chariot, Cavalry and Missile Cavalry. All having different strengths and weaknesses. For instance I found that, although Heavy Spearmen are cheap and effective in the Field, when you put them up against Noble Dagger-Axemen (baring in mind that this unit is obsolete at this point in the game) in a seige, the nobles will hold out and kill more of the spearmen then have casualities inflicted on them.The Grand Campaign is all the Factions present in their historial locations on a large map of China and Mongolia. The map is, from my playing of RotK and Grand Strategy games, rather acurate. The Factions have variety, although some are samey, they make up for this in the Grand Campaign by there vastly different starting positions. The other form of game, the Custom game, has several options for map type and environ composition, and full customisation for which factions will be present and will not be present. I honestly cannot think of anything more to ask from a random map generator, except the incusion of a map editor.In conclusion I find this game in its current form to be well worth it's current asking price. Any more features to be included after the writing of this review will be considered by me to be more icing for a well iced cake, perhaps even a cherry on top. I am hoping the devs will be added new factions, such as Korean, Japanese and Thai tribes, as well as perhaps a new epoch.			"

								The game is really good! If you like managing big empires and you enjoy the small details, that game is for you! The game is obviously not perfect (quite expectable as it is in Early Access). The major flaw to that moment is the UI. The rest I am sure will be polished. I can see that game becoming a good multi-player game as it has a feel like being a chess game with development features. An another key point for the success of that game is the modability potential that it has. If the developer will make some parts modable the game will surely become awesome and it will expand it's player base. Briefly,  it is a good beginning for a new developer studio!			"

								This game is both aesthetically and performance related very satisfying to play. For an early access it feels already perfectly balanced.It brings you the calming atmosphere of ancient East Asia, and at the same time gives you a sence of being a grand stratagist ordering your units around and telling them how to act. It has a nice faction unlock system that 'forces' you to play 200 turns with the available ones, before getting to the new (probably more difficult) ones. “If quick, I survive.If not quick, I am lost.Oriental Empires rocks.""― Sun TzuCan only agree, 10/10			"

								Quite Amazing! The best Chinese-Culture-themed game I have ever seen. Even the Chinese game developers cannot make such a piece of work. Yet apparently, it has not go into the depth of the Chinese Tradition, while it only requires 2 GB disk volumn. However, it is still an shining reflection of the ancient Chinese Culture. The pros are definitely overwhelm the cons. BTW, the factions in this game are composed from the ancient feudal states, instead of the historical Chinese dynatsies, which most people have misunderstood.			"

								Can I start by saying: Wow. I cannot believe we have actually got a grand strategy game based on China. That is a rare thing to happen. That's with considering the vastness and depth of Chinese history, culture and the sub continent as a whole. Now to the review. When you first start this, you may find this game rather boring. Theres only a few things to do: Build farms, choose technologies, let your troops explore. What doesn't help with this is the clunky way troop movements work. I am quite suprised that there isn't just a skip button, if you're not interested in the movement/battles. However, when you start being able to do a lot more things the game becomes surprisingly addictive. You will get the similar feeling from any CIV or TW game where you say to yourself: ""Just one more turn"". The only thing I find a little annoying is that the eras seem to not last long and money seems a little too low. Now I like a challenge, but currently for me, it makes more sense to constantly to ask the AI for non-aggression pacts and grow my own economy rather than build vast armies. This is beacuse my budget has only just got to 200+ per turn and still to expand a city takes 2000 so that's 10 turns (With a mximum of 300) to do that. But to be fair, this is also a common problem I have had with TW. I just like to have the ability to build a sizable force and while also having the AI be able to match or do better than that. I don't like running round the map with single units or just garrsoning everywhere. This compounds the effect when they predominantly advertise the game as a wargame. What helps TW is mods and I do hope this game will be able to conjure up a massive mod culture as well. I would also like to see a bigger expansion of the imperial age of China. If they made a fall of samurai style expansion (ofcourse either built into the game or with savegame conversion) to this game, dealing with imperial powers picking at China, while also trying to westernise (while also trying to keep a hold on power), that in short would be my favorite game.Apart from that I think this game has a lot of potential considering it is early access and I look forward to future updates. Now a quote from Sun Tzu ""知彼知己，百战不殆，不知彼而知己，一胜一负，不知彼不知己，每战必殆""			"

								FIrst of all thank you for making a game that base on chinese history. As a chinese, i long for game like this to come out. Thats why i bought the game with the price you putting up.

Proauto Trade route, great idea but... how much are you earning from it?Like how you have both nobel and peasant system.ConLack of information in your overview literaly everywhere.

Yes it give me a brief detail but it doesnt give me any indication how to fix it.I would really like to know the % of me winning when fighting my army vs any enemy unit. Garrison- i though you having army in your city give you some supression. Whats with the low supressiong rate?There is plenty of bug around. Like your tutorial face turn to white after giving hint? sometime, the image of previous game army slot stay to the next game.This is pro mountain city building. there is absolute no way a beginner would actually head for the plain land to settle without a mountain. Beside, back in the history surplus in food actually generate happinessWhy cant i build next to forest, mountain or river?your auto farming kill my mid game. it doesnt care about how sad your peasant is? auto are suppose to help not kill your game?Tax meter? where are they? Auto treasury did not give me any detail or bonus if i lower or increase the button?Please you need more resources and allocate appropirate building for it. why is there random civil building in the map? seriously drop it. make it plain map, not weird  SuggestionI really would suggest you to have a happiness boost building. in the past, there is gambler, brothel for peasant to enjoy, event slave market. this is some of the edict you can put upAbolish slaveEdict of celebrationEdict of Hunting seasonEdict of Heaven blessingThis is my intial review.

								Worth checking out for seasoned 4x fans. Be warned it is unpolished and it can be difficult to parse all the data layers. But once you make it out of the stumbling blocks and the seeming awkwardness of the first 50 turns it starts to shine and I thoroughly enjoyed my attempted play throughs and eventual victory on hard. It does enough new or slightly different that its woth playing for a chance to see a small teams take on the genre imo. The combat and city systems were particularly fun to play with. Will definitely be playing this through again once more when it is launched, probably as one of the herders.P.S. combat is weird and awesome (synchronous orders/move & automated attack phases), remember to use formations and treat the small section of map you are fighting on as the combat map and spread out your giant stacks to fill the combat space, cut off retreats, flank, trigger secondary attacks, etc. Combat maneuvers are a lot of fun in this game and I highly reccomend playing with them and finding out what works for you. Different tacticts for different types of armies etc. "

								For what I have seen so far the game is quite impressive specially for an early access game. The graphic is beautiful for a strategy game, the music really creates the right atmosphere and being able to go in close to the battle and have a total war feeling is a great idea! For a full amateur review you can watch my video, but all in all this is a good game and I'm looking forward to see what will be added and changed during the development of the game. :D

Early Access Review
								Quick overview: This game is incredibly fun to play, provided that you're willing to look past a few pre-release bugs. While I wouldn't recomend that you buy it imediatly, I would definatly keep an eye on it and buy it later once the major bugs are removed.8/10 would buy again.Best part: Civ like play with added depth and detail that make this game unique.Worst part: The battles are incredibly complex, and most of the time I feel like I'm just throwing troops to the slaughter. In depth review:This game most certainly has it's bugs, but considering its only a pre-release I expected as much. Everything from troop movement to events will do something strange now and again, but this in know way interfered with the enjoyment of the game in my view.Everyone seems to agree that it's very similar to Civ in regard to troop movement and placing the cities so I won't go into that as much.The other comparison is to Total War which seems to be a bit more of a debate. The realism and detail is right up there with Total War, but the game play is drastically different. The battles that take place in Oriental Empires take place once you end the turn, and you have no control over the troops movements once the battle starts. You can give them ""orders"" however the troops don't always follow them persay, and it seems to be a jumbled mess a lot of the time. this made it very frustrating when trying to take cities or fending off bandits or rebels. But the frustration made me feel more like a general giving orders and watching as the chaios of battle ensues.Oriental Empires is also a very interesting way of teaching the culture and History of China. Going into the game I knew nothing of either, so I really can't verify whether or not this game is acurate, but I'm definatly interested in finding more about this time in Chinese history.In regards to the art and music, both are incredible. The music is suething during peace times and exciting when battles are enitiated. Also, being able to scroll all the way down to the peasents on the farm is facinating. Watching battles take place as if I were apart of it was awesome. All in all I really did enjoy this game.			"

								Oriental Empires strongly reminds me of a Total War game, except for the very important fact, that it does not present battles as a separate sub-game. Oriental Empires lets you assemble armies from a sizable choice of units. You get to choose formations and move them on a large map of hex tiles, with all your cities, farms, mines etc.Battles are fought when two armies meet. You can seamlessly zoom in on the action all the way and watch the individual men battle it out with the enemy. But you cannot interfere.I am fine with this. I personally want my strategy game to focus on the strategic level of a campaign and not have me fight single battles.However, the battles here confuse me. This is very much due to the  the presentation, the UI,  obfuscating rather than clarifying what is going on. Possibly the underlying systems are also more complicated that they need to be.Example: When are armies close enough to trigger a battle? It's more than one hex tile, maybe two or three. I cannot exactly tell, because of the way movement is handled. During your turn you issue the movement orders, but the execution happens after you end your turn. Then all units from all factions move at the same time and battles get resolved. This looks cool, but apart from pure visuals of the fighting men you do not get any additional information. Why do only some of the troops in my army attack? I have no idea, I have set the tactics for the army to full assault. Additional armies can join a battle if they are close enough. Again, how close?Things get really hard to understand when the battle is about a city. I had a large army camping in a city and wanted to engage a small enemy army approaching in the following turn. However due to their movement range plus the battle range – yes, they do not actually have to reach the city to take it – my army got surprise attacked and wiped out. Wait what? How did my large army with my excellent commander lose?Undefended cities have four gates and I did not assign troops to these locations but kept them in the basic garrison position. Then during the battle the two enemy units attacked one gate each. And my army met them there with one unit each. For some reason my weakest unit was selected to fight their strong unit and that was that.Now, I do not say, that all those systems are bad, I do not understand them enough. But I have my doubts. I really want a game to better present what is going on and why. Why can I not get additional information during battles? Let me click on stuff to tell me stuff.Apart from the battles the game appeals to me more. There is a technology tree to research, cities to settle and to build up, land to develop and an economy to cater for. But overall, while this is fun, it is more on the Total War level of complexity than a civilisation, and in any case it relies on you being able to win battles, a lot.I will check back with the game when it is completely done. I want to see this setting of ancient China done well. Maybe?			"

								Absolutely not recommended. I would love to see either a CIV or TW game set in ancient China like this, which is why I bought this game. However, this is neither of those things, although it tries so hard to be both. The combat is automated, which is very frustrating because the mechanics are very vague and the AI is completely incompetent. Vagueness is a key part of the experience of this game, because although the UI gives some information about things like combat effectiveness, replenishment, trade values, unrest etc, there is no DETAIL. For instance, I know from the UI that army ""readiness"" depletes through movement or combat, and is restored by resting. What is readiness, you ask? I haven't got a clue. It was never explained. A similar one is how combat is initiated - we're told that this happens when armies cross paths during the execution phase, but it's unclear how close armies have to get to each other to actually fight. For more detail on the terrible combat mechanics, I'd recommend checking out some of the other review below, as I'd just be reiterating what they said, but if you don't fancy that and want the short version: it's terrible. The AI has no idea how to use different types of units - it will let your archers/cavalry just stand still and be cut down by infantry, while your own infantry stand around scratching their balls. Enemy factions will take your cities with armies which are 1/10 the size of your garrison. This game was disappointing because I really really wanted it to be good. This is a setting which is underdone in strategy franchises and I was hoping this game would be the thing I'd been looking for, but sadly in this state it is just confusing, frustrating and unbalanced. And if I'm honest it feels as if the game was planned as something better than this, but funding got cut half way through, leaving the developers to try and polish what mechanics they already had into something resembling a game, leaving many of the planned features out of the finished product. Not recommended in this state.			"

								I really did enjoy this game at first but sadly when it came to my first siege the game completly broke down. I was sieging a town that had rebelled against me with two armies full of royal soldiers and archers with fire arrows and siege equipment. The problem then is telling them both to siege the city goes no-where as the units radomly move about attacking walls...and even when the walls go down the army just stands there. Units while fighting have really bad ai such as running past the enemy leaving your one unit to fight an army (they do not like to stick together nor can you command them otherwise). You are just stuck watching them freak out running in randomly to just die.In this state I cannot recommend this game for any price. The AI needs to be fixed and until then the game is not really playable. If they fix this issue I will change my recommendation.4/10 while AI is broken.			"

								This game is terrible in its current state. There is no tutorial, no intuitive interface that tells you why rebels spawn or why there is a limit to the number of units you can recruit despite having enough money. Rebels keep spawning without any warning as to what threshold of disorder will trigger their spawn and when you send armies to intercept them, they keep sending you on a wild goose chase while the enemy faction builds up its army to attack you. All this while, how your unit recruitment cap works is a mystery and you end up fighting an intense war very early because enemy factions spawn too close to your capital and refuse peace.There are background numbers that you have to manually search for to see their effects but these are obfuscated in the primary UI. There is also no indication how fast units will heal and whether they can replenish in enemy regions or not. There is no indication of effective range by which enemy units can be intercepted or reinforcements may join a fight. Although researching certain techs allows you to build bazaars for more money, they cost a ton to build relative to your early income. A huge problem is the mechanics to build up your economy do not scale appropriately to the mechanics to build your military and civil buildings. While this game is not directly comparable to Total War, the costs of early tier 1 economic buildings and units in Total War are reasonably scaled to allow sustainable recruitment during the early game when income is very limited. I have no problems with enemies attacking me early on as long as scaling as decribed above is sustainable and balanced to match the game stage you're in. This is not the case in Oriental Empires. I can see the game intends to create many interesting mechanics, but how these mechanics are related to one another is extremely vague and the lack of a clear intuitive interface aggravates the lack of a tutorial. Unless the UI is improved to present key mechanics info you need to know, provides adequate and clear warnings on rebel/disaster thresholds, and scales expenses appropriately with game stage you're in, avoid this game at all costs.

								Some how I remembered reading somewhere that this game will go up to the 1600 b.c. I also thought this game would be era based, but it's not.  Such as playing the Spring and Autumn Period to the end.  Then either continue or play new to Warring States Period, Three Kingdoms, etc.  Some technology/learning items seem pointless.  You cannot command your army during battle, but a learning item is signaling armies.  Improvements I can think of right now:-There should be more detailed governance.  You should be able to address public grievances with multiple options including ignoring public grievances.  Not being able to control public outcry is not realistic.    -There should be a court hall where ministers, advisors, generals, and the leader disscuss politics.  It should look like the korean/chinese war drama movies.  There should be envoys.-Other nations should have main characters too.  There should historical characters also.  -Territory buidlings should be more detailed and you should be allowed to put the buildings where you want.  You should be able to put walls around your territories.  Have damns, gates, boarder patrol.-You should be able to dig trenches, moats, etc.  -Farming: the irrigation farm is not visible.  -Where are the ladders and wall climbing during siege.  -Horse archers should always be moving and shooting.  -Along with turn number, there should be year labels.  You play for some turns and then all of a sudden your leader dies of old age.  Terrain and graphics are awesome.  The first day I played it, I was very dissapointed.  After a few more days, it's okay.  It doesn't get me excited besides when fighting.  I'm playing this and AOE 2 and AOE 2 is more excited.  I will update more when I can think of more.			"

								What can I say, its an early access game.There are bugs.The combat system has a ton of potential but the unit AI can be...special.  But...The tech tree's are awesome, the game is beautiful, and as it sits right now it is more complete than any Civ game that has launched (you know, release 1/4 of the game and then publish the rest in 3 ""expansions"" that are just features that the core game should have had from the beginning)If the devs don't fix the bugs (specifically the game breakingly derpy combat AI) by release i will regret paying $24 for it and would recommend it for $10ish instead and i will change my review appropriately. EDIT: Not sure how I missed this from the devs--Why Early Access?“Oriental Empires is almost complete, lacking only the multiplayer feature. Since many players will only be interested in single player, we are making it available early for them. The early access period will also serve as a final shakedown period for the game, to help uncover any remaining significant bugs or balance issues that still remain, and allow to us make final tweaks based on feedback from a larger group of players than the beta team.”This game is nowhere near complete.  I have yet to be able to finish a game without it randomly hanging between moves.  The City combat is nonsensical--a single broken unit can take your fully garrisoned city for some reason? Do not buy.			"

								At lost as to how to group units, or how to move unit from one group to another when they're on the same hex. Combat feels wierd and non-intuitive. Notifications are too subtle, but being able to put a tick next to the ones you've taken care of is nice touch.Is there a way to turn on edge scrolling? without having to use the keyboard?I don't mind don't having the mini map, the map itself is cool enough being able to zoom in and out fairly quickly.A lot of times when end of turn is processing, I would get ""Battle at the north"" but there is no battle.It's annoying when you only realise you can't build cities on certain hexes when your settler is already there.Having said all that, so far I'm really enjoying the game. Always wanted a 4x game centered around china. Not just skinning, but the whole tech tree/buildings is about china.  If being able to play it in chinese would be interesting also.			"

								Here are my thoughts on this EA titleOverall its a good game im a fan of turn based strategy games and this adds a new aspect i think to the genre instead of your run of the mill turn based strategy games (i.e. Civilization) you get to play in ancient china which i think is pretty cool you get to experience sort of how things were back then which imho is a breath of fresh air. If there is one thing i dont like so far is the supposed Grand Campaign for single player there is no story or anything that shows the player its a campaignso far its seems like just one big skirmish match against the AI factions hopefully the dev team changes that as the game development continues. Otherwise great game keep it up dev team			"

								This is a very cool start to a game that I think could turn into a great one if it gets some more development love. I broke my rule of not buying early access games because I thought the concept was so neat and I want to see a complete game come out of this.Zooming into the city is an awesome concept and as a Civ player is sort've a dream come true. They still don't feel that alive though somehow - maybe the models are too crowded or something? I'm not sure. Not controlling the armies directly as in TW is not a big deal for me though I think that the probability of success or some other kind of data would help clarify how the selection of the battle tactics used is going to translate to success in battle.Ok, guys, now use our money to make this game amazing!

								This game is NOT a fast pace game. It is really realistic but lacks the diversity need with multiple factions. You really need to click the next turn button for about 50 to 100 turns before you would even think to build buildings. Such buildings would give better income/soilders/increase tech or happiness of citzen/nobles. There are still problems with balance, specifically farming-populations ratio. you would almost need to constantly build farms to increase population for if you don't you risk revolt {basically you lost the city would built to the AI with max soilders ready to possilbly invade other cites}. It is though important to know that historically if revolts did happen they are very hard to put down so I would give points to the game being realistic but not fun. As for battle situations, its again realistic but not fun. mostly would use ambush if attacking to catch ai's of guard. Attacking a city requires archers or seige weapons that would again need at lest 30 turns (archers) to 100 turns (seige weapons) to build and be sent. again very realistic as roads are noe too developed and depending on terrian, may not have a chance to depoly seige weapons. LACKIN are basic seige weapons every army sould have, like ladders and cheap improvised rams usually built on site during a seige. Factions don't feel unique since they ALL  have the same tech and units. Basically single player still needs work !!!!!			"

								This game has problem. The siege is bad design. I have an army of 2000 people with 4 catapult. However I cannot take the castle down. Only 1 group of unit allow to enter the battle at 1 time. Furthermore, the bloody time out in the battle is very annoying. My unit just enter the castle and do some fighting then turn end and I have to repeat that again and again.			"

								Ok...as someone who enjoys strategy games....this game has a few things going for it..but overall...it's just too unpolished and lacking to reach is potential.So for now the pros...Sorta Civ like game mixed with a family system(faction leaders) sorta similar to total war series.Each City is important and unique...as in trade routes wise, if both cities have the same resources, the trade bonus (might be lost) so city specialization is a mustQuest system ( sorta like endless legends or fallen enchantress)Units have stamina (could be a con since its a turn based game)Cons...gameplay is weird...battles are auto ( set a formation fight, and watch )Buildings just dont feel worth while...(600 gold to build a barracks + 50 upkeep a turn for example, making trade ever soo important)Many systems arent fleshed out yet overallLack of unit info and tutorials Verdict/opinionWAIT..or buy now to waste your time and see where this goes			"

								Some how I remembered reading somewhere that this game will go up to the 1600 b.c. I also thought this game would be era based, but it's not.  Such as playing the Spring and Autumn Period to the end.  Then either continue or play new to Warring States Period, Three Kingdoms, etc.  Some technology/learning items seem pointless.  You cannot command your army during battle, but a learning item is signaling armies.  Improvements I can think of right now:-There should be more detailed governance.  You should be able to address public grievances with multiple options including ignoring public grievances.  Not being able to control public outcry is not realistic.    -There should be a court hall where ministers, advisors, generals, and the leader disscuss politics.  It should look like the korean/chinese war drama movies.  There should be envoys.-Other nations should have main characters too.  There should historical characters also.  -Territory buidlings should be more detailed and you should be allowed to put the buildings where you want.  You should be able to put walls around your territories.  Have damns, gates, boarder patrol.-You should be able to dig trenches, moats, etc.  -Farming: the irrigation farm is not visible.  -Where are the ladders and wall climbing during siege.  -Horse archers should always be moving and shooting.  -Along with turn number, there should be year labels.  You play for some turns and then all of a sudden your leader dies of old age.  Terrain and graphics are awesome.  The first day I played it, I was very dissapointed.  After a few more days, it's okay.  It doesn't get me excited besides when fighting.  I'm playing this and AOE 2 and AOE 2 is more excited.  I will update more when I can think of more.			"

								What can I say, its an early access game.There are bugs.The combat system has a ton of potential but the unit AI can be...special.  But...The tech tree's are awesome, the game is beautiful, and as it sits right now it is more complete than any Civ game that has launched (you know, release 1/4 of the game and then publish the rest in 3 ""expansions"" that are just features that the core game should have had from the beginning)If the devs don't fix the bugs (specifically the game breakingly derpy combat AI) by release i will regret paying $24 for it and would recommend it for $10ish instead and i will change my review appropriately. EDIT: Not sure how I missed this from the devs--Why Early Access?“Oriental Empires is almost complete, lacking only the multiplayer feature. Since many players will only be interested in single player, we are making it available early for them. The early access period will also serve as a final shakedown period for the game, to help uncover any remaining significant bugs or balance issues that still remain, and allow to us make final tweaks based on feedback from a larger group of players than the beta team.”This game is nowhere near complete.

								I have had a lot of fun in Oriental Empires so far. Judging from its early access release, I believe balance changes will be coming (which is the only thing I can think of that will need improvements). This game really surprised me with its overall polish and I can't wait for future development updates!

								This game can be fun, but its strategy system is broken.By broken i mean it does not work the way it should.Most common way i lose my game is by pillagers sacking all my land.Random ai units, while exploring, will walk right into your lands and at any tile they stop on will be auto sacked.This makes your people unhappy, and you need to rebuild the farms they sack.Unhappy people leads to bandits spawning and bandits will sack more farmlands making your people more unhappy.If you try to stop the ai from sacking your lands you will be dragged into a war with them, and in a couple of turns you will be defenseless against their mass mini armies.You will lose any units you got to exhaustion from fighting, oh by that i mean by having one of your units fighting one enemy unit while the rest of your units watch them fight while in combat.That drains their strength and soon the many mini armies the ai send will take over your city.This all happens early on in less then 30 turns.Only two ways to deal with this problem, A make a massive army to prevent any ai units from getting on your farms or B let them sack your lands and get ready to deal with the bandits that will spawn.If you ignore that mess then the game can be fun, its defintly a challenging experience that some people will love and others will hate.At the momment i do not recommend this game but maybe multiplayer will make the game better.

This is not complete by any means, and if it is, then this is one of the greatest dissapointments I've ever experienced.			"

								I feel like this game could be fun to play but right now in it''s current state it seems too ramdom. I feel this way because I keep losing towns and battles to what seems to be troops that are weaker and out numberd, this in of itself was not a big deal I just chalked it up to my not understanding the way battles work. The thing that got me the most however is that I go from 600 gold per turn income one turn to having double droughts or some such (I had two drought modifiers on my citys) plus the accompanying food shortage, and now im -1100 gold per turn almost complete civil dissatisfaction. As far as i know there is now way to get rid of now plus 90 unhappiness other then wait it out the only problem with that is i now have no gold and no income and i'm in a war that I was winning untill now as I can't build new troops to fight and I can't peace out of it. The point of this rambling is i don't think this game is ready to be played in any way other then bug checking as it's in early access. so if you'er lookin for a game to just play i say pass on it untill it's done or gets updated alot more it has some fun to it and could be good when they are done with it but right now it's more aggravating then anything.

								Pros:- Attractive game- Can build your own towns/cities- Game mechanics are alright.- Great BGM.Cons:- Units turn to join Rebels if you attack rebels without a leader (What type of mechanics is that??? They just Join the rebels when attacking or being attacked?? Even the General lead 8 unit Hex can join the Rebel straight away after the movement phase!!) Game mechnics vs. Rebels are broken... You'll start to feel fighting Rebels are harder than fighter other States.- Takes a longer time to complete the game vs. Total War series of games. (Good if you're want endless conquest, yet bad in another way cuz you can't finish it)- The time to gather funds are very slow.- Comm Players are very hard to beat in Normal Mode (Their funds seem to gather faster than mine. Look more like Hard Mode rather than Normal.)Conclusion:There are room of space to improve the game - Most importantly the Rebel faction highlight needs to be fix.It's become unplayable when you have a Rebel City spawn next to you and only to realize that your troops are joining them at a higher rate than you put down the Rebels.

A long with how you manage you workers, and farming.Everything is in place to make this a great game with some more investment!I will reccommend this game on the premise that they will not cut and run with the money, I gave up on early access games, but braved it once more.

								This a great game with good accuracy of Chinese history. I really enjoy the scene of ancient china and the background music. While there are some points that should be improved to make the game better:1) Could game publisher add some historical characters? 2) a elaborate tutorial would be useful to introduce every detail of the game. 3) the geographical and historically military passes could be involved to improve the defendence of the countries with limited wealth 4) there are some countries like Qi and Yan missing.

								This is my first ever game review. The only reason i did this because i wanted this game to better whenever it come to full release.In its current state, i rate it 6/10. Here is why1. Gameplay is civ-like. It's not like it borrow simple mechanic from civ but i can tell most core mechanic are civ like except the turn mechanic. Building cities, resource, etc is very civ like. It borrows from civ, but not entirely improve on it.2. Battle is clunky. Not only the animation feels clunky, but say the battle formation and battle plan sometimes not executed correctly e.g i set two units with charge battleplan against one enemy unit with onel ine formation. Only one unit charge, the other unit charge in some seconds after. 3. Ui and guides/ tutorial is minimal. Minimal, not simplistic. No minimap for now so you wont know where u are early in the game. You can get hold later after you understand the whole map as a basis, but if you wanted to go to the other side of the map, it will take time instead of just one click away. This game is guides/tutorial also so minimal you will learn by doing it yourself instead of reading or playing tutorial.4. Inconsistency. This come from the minimal guide and hint in the game e.g you can sometime build a shrine in a steppe hill and sometime you cant. No reasoning whatsoever in the game you wont know until you build a settlement next to it. This also applies to building road, public orders and leader character.I would say that the game is good in it earlier hours but gets boring at later time. It is good if you like civ but cant wait for civ 6 or wanted to play 4x games with other culture instead of europe. In its current state, i wouldnt reccommend if you are looking for replayability. But if youre curious, it is not a bad game, just unpolished. Also, the price it offer is not bad, around 20$ but i get for around 13$ (IDR Rp 159.000) on iceberg weekend sale so that's quite a good deal.			"

								I really reommend this game although I was born a Chinese. The way this game depicts the history of China is othentic and objective, with out speculations that generally adopted by westerners. The Oriental EMPIRE combines the features of both total war and civilization, which offers a chance to challenge your own strategems and skills.			"

								It's quite fun. The map is very pretty and the city management and trade system is interesting. The battle system is weak and doesn't work very well - the one with the biggest army wins, troop variety or strategy isn't very important. I hope the devs work on this. The Chinese setting is nice - the primary campaign takes part on a map of China with all the mountains and rivers in place.			"

								Nov 25 2016 4 / 10  It belongs on $5 to $10 rack. The screen shots and trailers make it look like a game from the Total War series.At best it is a cheap nock off. It has a number of bug's, like armies fighting other armies that are invisable. Also after several hours of play, it will lock up or crash. It does do auto save every turn, so when you reload the game, you don't loose more then 1 turn. All battles take place between turns, and you have little if any control once the battle starts. This game is playable. But, it getts bouring even for an empire building / conquest game. There is no story or plot. The general's are basically all the same. They just level up and that's it. This game is not worth anything near the asking price.Go buy Rome 1 or 2 , Shogan 2 , Medevil or any of the Total War series instead. Some of them are under $10 only because of their old release dates. Even the old one's have better gameplay the this over priced nock off. "

Maybe it is just my game play style but I found the advisor gives bad advice and when you do follow the recommended action, such as reducing the work pressure on your peasants the unhappiness still continues to climb. There are much better similar games out there, don't buy this. If you do buy it and find you don't like it, please be aware that if you play it for more than 2 hours you cannot get a refund.			"

								It's as vanilla as they come and offers very little in the way of replayability or any sense of progression. I've played nearly every 4X game in existence and I'd put this in the lowest 10% of 4X games. Bugs abound, city spam is unchecked, combat is ugly and janky, and the tech tree consists of many ""techs"" that simply add to made up statistics. Everything people look for in a 4X game simply doesn't exist here, especially any sort of replayability. This game is far from finished, despite what the developer will tell you. Not recommended.

								A fun, challenging 4x game. It kinda feels like Civ 5 and the Total War series had a baby. The interface and gameplay still have some rough spots but not enough to hamper gameplay and I would imagine most of them will be smoothed over by release. Not as polished or beginner friendly as Civ, but it makes up for it with some unique twists. I imagine multiplayer will be very tense because balancing internal unrest vs external pressure is very important in this game. The game gives you a good feel for just how precarious 'civilization' was at the dawn of recorded human history.It's worth a spin if you are a dedicated strategy gamer with a fondness for history.

								This game is.... average, BUT its fun I guess.Good Stuff+ Not really a big learning curve in the stratagy genre so pretty easy to pick up (about as easy to pick up as Total War Shogun 2). + somewhat addicting. Not like Civ but ehNow for the bad- Soldier AI is autistic and doesn't really fight as a unit- The grand battles are less epic and fun because of the poor AI. - Optomization is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Frame drops once the FOW gets reduced (I'm hoping by the full release it gets fixed)- soundtrack is really meh. Crusader Kings 2 had incredable music while OE's soundtrack is mundane- Like Civ 5, but less detail in the micromanaging. This would be fine but you need to know certain details in order to really be successful- Like Total War Shogun 2 but less impressive graphics and combat is more like watching a poorly directed cutsceneWhen I read the description for this game and saw the trailers, I got hyped. I thought it would be combining both the amazing stratagizing from Civ and the epic combat from Total War into one epic masterpiece like Mount and Blade (minus your own character). But its not. It's mediocre as far as stratagy titles go. 6/10 (not a 5 because the game is fun, just not impressive. It's something to play, but not something I'd talk about or remember 5 years from now) "

								First of all, let me get the most important point out of the way.  This is an excellent example of a ""just five more minutes"" game.    The economic system is excellent.   The equivalent of ""goodie huts"" (from Civ) are interesting and add spice.  The tech trees (all 4 of them) are inter-related and you must use them properly if you want to do well in this game.  I love the ability to customize games.  (Remember this:  Continental map, huge, All China terrain, and seed of 666666.)  The one down side is that the battle AI still needs tweaking.  I mostly play on easy mode (most games I like hard) because of this.  I've read several of the negative reviews.  Either the writers had unrealistic explanations, or they didn't delve deeply enough into the game (yes I'm including the one with almost 60 hours of gameplay).  There's a lot of depth here and economic strategy can be just as important as military.  Polish is needed in several areas.  HOWEVER you should recall that the game has only been out on Early Access for a week.  It's highly playable now, but, if you like a completely polished game, wait 2-3 months.  Even with its flaws, it's already a lot of fun.			"

								I had waited for a game like this, covering ancient Far East Asia (Mongolia-China) and after playing a few hours on it, I will admit... I was thoroughly impressed. There are hiccups of course... the game just got released in an early access so.... what do you expect?Level of Detail: 4/5, You can literally zoom into you're towns and cities, seeing every building and the citizens doing their own thing. Farmlands actually have moving people ploughing away and bands of wild horses just graze around in their pastures. Nearly everything is possible to zoom into and see... from great monestaries to the tiny little country-side Gers and Mansions. You can also see your troops, they are individually unique (for the most part) although their combat mechanics are quite basic (charge to enemy, poke him with spear, then poke again).Gameplay Mechanics: 4/5, You're peasants build farms, mines, roads, shrines, pavileons, monastaries and chop down trees. You can select various buildings to build in your cities to improve trade, defense, peasant/noble happiness, available food and military buildings to improve your forces. You can engage in diplomacy, form alliances or vassals, ask nations to accept you as the Emperor or simply form a non-aggression pact. The Technology Tree is split into 4 groups, each can be researched at the same time. They unlock various Edicts (that you can choose to decree to give great bonuses) as well as many other economic, military and social technologies.The AI: From my playthrough, I would say the AI is decent, they would do what you'd expect them to do.... chomp down on the weak, or suck up to the strong... but I did encounter some interesting times such as an allied nation working with me to take down a peasant rebellion... but rather than taking the city himself, his forces allowed me to take it. The AI have also given decent amounts of money to aid me in difficult financial situations. I have noticed however... that the AI seem to have an almost unlimited amount of wealth as wars CAN last a very long time unless you severely out-number and out-gear the enemy faction.AI Bandits and Rebels also take opportunties to raid your farms but are slightly... stupid when it comes to a fight, they are willing to dive head-first into a fight that severely outnumbers them.End of my review, I personally think it is a fantastic game and recommend any and all to at least try it... it is NOT a combination of total War.. it is more like Endless Legends, Civilizations and Nobunaga's Ambition combined.

								I agree with a prior review. I understand this is an early access game.These are the issues:The Combat AI is in need of major work. Formation settings don't hold. An archer unit assigned to harrass engages enemy in melee instead of backing off to attack ranged. While the infantry sits idly by and watches the whole situation unfold. Archer unit gets wiped out - like that wasn't expected. Archers against armored foot soldiers don't tend to fair so well. Units walk towards another unit and then walk away for no apparent reason. Two armies will walk right through each other and not even engage. There should be a group army command that tells all the units to act as a whole, instead of ordering the whole group do something and then sit and watch the individual units do whatever they want. When units from other factions attack each other on your territory, they walk right through your walls like they aren't even there. (Pathing issues).The above issue is probably why Civ is like it is.The excessive amount of rebels that are constantly waiting to attack your cities is well excessive. And when your city starts a rebellion... you lose the whole city, without being able to suppress the revolt. I was attacked by multiple large units of rebels from the first day in the game with no units. The rebel units were stronger than the actual faction armies.The automated features don't appear to work. I set the AI to growth and nothing gets done, no farm building, no buildings, nothing. I had to manually control multiple cities by myself (which I can do), but auto governing actually working would be nice.There should also be a retreat option when in combat and a verification of your formation prior to entering battle. Field commands are needed to make the battle a little more controllable.I love the concept of this game and do believe it has potential. The price is a bit high for this early of access, and is not really something someone should spend their money on just yet. Give it time to get better and then buy it. Till then just follow.The company should not require the money to make a good game, they should make a good complete game to get that money. Because if you put out a quality product... people will buy it.I will recommend this game, but advise you should wait for it to get better.			"

								Interesting time period, challenging in my opinion. Its addictive and very beautiful graphics, if you played civilization before you will love this. Early stage, future updates. You might wait if you want a finished product, but its worth buying now if you cant wait.			"

								First of all, let me get the most important point out of the way.  This is an excellent example of a ""just five more minutes"" game.    The economic system is excellent.   The equivalent of ""goodie huts"" (from Civ) are interesting and add spice.  The tech trees (all 4 of them) are inter-related and you must use them properly if you want to do well in this game.  I love the ability to customize games.  (Remember this:  Continental map, huge, All China terrain, and seed of 666666.)  The one down side is that the battle AI still needs tweaking.  I mostly play on easy mode (most games I like hard) because of this.  I've read several of the negative reviews.  Either the writers had unrealistic explanations, or they didn't delve deeply enough into the game (yes I'm including the one with almost 60 hours of gameplay).  There's a lot of depth here and economic strategy can be just as important as military.  Polish is needed in several areas.  HOWEVER you should recall that the game has only been out on Early Access for a week.  It's highly playable now, but, if you like a completely polished game, wait 2-3 months.  Even with its flaws, it's already a lot of fun.			"

Early Access Review
								A fun, challenging 4x game. It kinda feels like Civ 5 and the Total War series had a baby. The interface and gameplay still have some rough spots but not enough to hamper gameplay and I would imagine most of them will be smoothed over by release. Not as polished or beginner friendly as Civ, but it makes up for it with some unique twists. I imagine multiplayer will be very tense because balancing internal unrest vs external pressure is very important in this game. The game gives you a good feel for just how precarious 'civilization' was at the dawn of recorded human history.It's worth a spin if you are a dedicated strategy gamer with a fondness for history.

								This game is one of those games that substitutes cheating style game mechanics that dont make sense to give the appearance of a tactically difficult scenario. But then you realize that if you dont play the game exactly like they designed you lose. I mean for instance, they have peasant and lord inf. If you fight rebel peasants with a peasant army, the peasant army will betray you... even though that would never happen in reality. Soldiers dont just betray their armies because somebody in their social class dislikes their army... ♥♥♥♥ing idiots. Add some options to counter this.. such as Bashar al Assads method. He kept all his soldiers and their families isolated from the general populace so it was easier for him to order them into a genocidal rampage. But you didnt do stuff like that and your game is terrible.			"

								I had waited for a game like this, covering ancient Far East Asia (Mongolia-China) and after playing a few hours on it, I will admit... I was thoroughly impressed. There are hiccups of course... the game just got released in an early access so.... what do you expect?Level of Detail: 4/5, You can literally zoom into you're towns and cities, seeing every building and the citizens doing their own thing. Farmlands actually have moving people ploughing away and bands of wild horses just graze around in their pastures. Nearly everything is possible to zoom into and see... from great monestaries to the tiny little country-side Gers and Mansions. You can also see your troops, they are individually unique (for the most part) although their combat mechanics are quite basic (charge to enemy, poke him with spear, then poke again).Gameplay Mechanics: 4/5, You're peasants build farms, mines, roads, shrines, pavileons, monastaries and chop down trees. You can select various buildings to build in your cities to improve trade, defense, peasant/noble happiness, available food and military buildings to improve your forces. You can engage in diplomacy, form alliances or vassals, ask nations to accept you as the Emperor or simply form a non-aggression pact. The Technology Tree is split into 4 groups, each can be researched at the same time. They unlock various Edicts (that you can choose to decree to give great bonuses) as well as many other economic, military and social technologies.The AI: From my playthrough, I would say the AI is decent, they would do what you'd expect them to do.... chomp down on the weak, or suck up to the strong... but I did encounter some interesting times such as an allied nation working with me to take down a peasant rebellion... but rather than taking the city himself, his forces allowed me to take it. The AI have also given decent amounts of money to aid me in difficult financial situations. I have noticed however... that the AI seem to have an almost unlimited amount of wealth as wars CAN last a very long time unless you severely out-number and out-gear the enemy faction.AI Bandits and Rebels also take opportunties to raid your farms but are slightly... stupid when it comes to a fight, they are willing to dive head-first into a fight that severely outnumbers them.End of my review, I personally think it is a fantastic game and recommend any and all to at least try it... it is NOT a combination of total War.. it is more like Endless Legends, Civilizations and Nobunaga's Ambition combined.

								Really like this game :)...It's just my cup of  tea :) Being a long term Civ fan :)But be warned...It is brutal...Even at tutorial level... I have restarted campaign 7 times so far, having been crushed by swarms of AI opponents that you cannot possibly hope to match... and after only a few turns.Would love to see the content, but still have no idea what's in store...and it seems i never will    !!I shall recommend it for it's potential....But at present , it's ridiculously hard.

								Great game, just the authority system needs to be revamped so theres still the risk of revolt, which would be historically acurate, but so your not confined to the space and number of cities you can settle. Other than that the games good.			"

								Good game!Some suggestions:1. Nomads are too strong. They don't need to build farmland but have 2 food from every land grid. So they don't worry about plunder but can develope well. Farming nations should gain more food from farmlands because farming is more efficient.2. Add Wei, Zhao , Qi and Yan. (7 powers of the Warring States : Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei and Qin)3. Add some special units for nations in early times.4. Add some historic campaigns. "
