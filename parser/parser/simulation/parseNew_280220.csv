												I hate this game. You should never get it. Seriously. Once you have this, it will be a time sink forever. You can never finsh this game. It's a deceptive little game - you may think - ""oh, there are only 23 missions in the Story  then I'm done.""  But it's not so easy. Along your way you will unlock untold millions of additional maps. Then you can't stop playing them.I have been playing Creeper world since 2009 and I can't stop. I need to join the Creeper World Anonymous club and confess ""Hi, my name is Karsten and I can't stop killing Creeper.""You can play in the Tormented Zone if you are a masochist and like inflicting pain on yourself. Some worlds in there are documented unwinnable[knucklecracker.com] - but that won't stop you from trying - it didn't stop me.Occasionally venture into Prospector zone and pick up a few Artifacts of Odin - the mightiest weapons mankind did not invent. Try out the Alpha sector. Made by those early beta testers. Made to be difficult. Make sure you try Virgil's Brainic map. Just to see how weird you can get.Like Shooters? Try out the Credits mission.  Hey, my name is in there somewhere - so are all the other beta testers. :)If that's not enough, go dial up your own maps in the DMD (Dial Map Device), Here you can make a world with the click of a few buttons. Add ingredients to suit you and cook up a hard challenge or a speed run - win it, name it and share it with all us us addicts. Oh wait, I'm trying to stop playing. Don't share it.Finally, if you are creative, inventive and perhaps you like to add custom units and styles, make your own map in the Projects Editor and share it in Colonial Space. Here there are no rules. Maps are all over the place, fun, hard, tricky, unusual, huge slog-fests, or tiny puzzles. As large as 256x256 or as small as 20x20.  Don't say I didn't warn you. This is where ""map rage"" goes to live after you discover it at Farbor (the timed mission in the Story arc).I would tell you more, but it's time for my fix and Im heading out to the DMD to get a quick fix.Oh yes, ""Hi, my name is Karsten and I am killing Creeper.""

												I think Creeper World 3 catches a lot of people off guard because of the cheap price, low resolution graphics and understated appeal. It also gets called a Tower Defense game a lot, which does the unique strategic components a horrible injustice. Instead, Arc Eternal is a laid-back thinking mans' RTS with unprecedented play-more value and excels as a game you can sink some time into in the form of a well thought out and strictly controlled approach, or as a casual attack on a map every now and then. It's like Civilization V in the respect that you'll launch it for a quick 20 minute game and find yourself embroiled in the relentless depths of an alien planet fighting to make a foothold on a section of map on the 4th planet of your 3rd star system 6 hours later, wondering where the time went.The amount of content in here is staggering, and the campaign provides such a good learning curve and introduction to the new structures and some possible strategies that can't be praised enough. There's also an engaging backstory in the main campaigns which help you feel isolated and alone while fighting the uncaring, unforgiving creep, and while the dialogue is cliche at times, it helps bolster the already engaging gameplay and add a little depth.HighlightsThe best part of this game is simply the gameplay. While the tower defense mechanics have been done to death and don't offer anything particularly insightful, the different natures of the two opposing forces here make for a level of adaptable strategy that you wont see in many games. The structures are all balanced and simple but effective additions like Terraforming and one-use items make for even more ways to play and even more things to spend time working on.The sheer amount of content is the other great part of this world, and deserves praise.* The first port of call is the Arc Eternal which acts as the campaign mode and teaches the player the basics and structures, and consists of 9 star systems for a total of approximately 50 levels.* There's the Alpha Sector which includes many early maps and a ton made by the alpha and beta players.* The Prospectors Zone features procedurally generated maps.* There's Tormented Space for those seeking challenge which includes maps from hard to literally impossible.* The Dial Map Device acts as a map generation tool and lets you play more specific maps.Mistakes & AnnoyancesFor many, the simple enemy A.I. is an issue here, and it can be argued that the very flat nature of the enemy intelligence makes for a somewhat bland approach. I'd counterargue and say that this game is more about finding solutions you like, and/or finding the optimal or most efficient route to victory and that the focus doesn't need to be on the creep.* The difficulty curve isn't very smooth, and you can find yourself struggling way beyond what you'd expect in some of the later campaign missions, or struggling to overcome frustrating maps. There are also several outright impossible missions which nobody has yet been able to find a solution to.RecommendationsArc Eternal comes priced at £10.99/14.99€/$14.99 and while it contains a huge amount of play time, including a main story of at least 15 hours, it's still probably slightly overpriced for most players when compared against competitors. It's one of those games which you'll either love or hate, and so playing the demos listed below, or the flash versions of the developers other titles before making a full priced purchase is recommended.* If the huge amount of content included by default wasn't enough for you, there are a ton of user maps too with different types of play. There are even Play as Creeper style maps.* Some of the earlier titles are also available for free play in Flash on Kongregate[www.kongregate.com].* There are demos of all 3 of the Creeper World games available on KnuckleCrackers' website which are much shorter.More Reviews Like This  Underrated & Hidden Games on Steam  "

												Nearing the end of a mission, I look at the way I have networked my collectors across the map. How I have inched my way from one edge to the other, covering everything in my wake, destroying the creeper in my way.And I realize, the creeper and I, we aren't so different. "

												Creeper World 3 is a very innovative strategy/TD game which resolves around fighting a very unique enemy using a variety of weapons, including a 4-6 hours story, two entire galaxies to conquer, random map generator and tons of insane custom maps (most of which powered by practically limitless custom programming language). I've been a huge fan and supporter of this series ever since I've found Creeper World 1 on Kongregate. The game is worth every cent and if you're a fan of non-hardcore strategy games (or a time attack player) who likes territorial expansion and variety then this is a game for you! If you're a story kind of person then I recommend starting from the first title to understand it all.			"

												Damn. This. Game.Avoid it all costs. There is a good chance, if you were born before the 90s,or even after, have a history of strategy games addiction and are sufferingfrom the almost always fatal 'just one more turn' syndrome; well, this gamemay eat your soul. That what is left. As for it being real time, you'll just beadvancing your defenses one tiny bit more, just getting that one upgrade,maybe, yeah, well, that strategic position and then, then call it a day.You know what? From that position, the other two, just saying, be a matterof minutes, at most. Well, that was fast, I might just set up initial positionson the next planet, for tomorrow. Huh, when I set the alarm clock I still hadeight hours to sleep, now there are only five left? Damn it! I'm not going toschool anymore! I won't talk about the gameplay. Things are already worse as they are now.Don't let yourself get fooled by it's uniqueness, the well balanced challenges,the well worked out story line or even the insane replayability. You've still got the chance at a life! Don't waste it! I almost escaped.But I did reinstall Creeper World. And I will be in Arc. Eternal.  "

												Playing TD's as a youngun, who recently discovered the wonders of the internet, were absolutely incredible times. But I always got a bit tired of the repetative movement of putting down another tower, upgrading them blah blah blah.... and then just leaving the game to run it's course, throwing wave after wave of enemies until your computer began to stutter and lag behind as it was somehow managing to cope with an incredible array of pixals being thrown into your eyeballs. I am mainly talking about the infamous Bloons TD, which will always remain my favourite TD, although there are others. However, this game is a little different in that respect. I like to think of it as a combination of a TD and RTS, in the sense that The Creeper, some blue liquid thing, is not stuck on rails and just has to get from A to B as it floats down a path ignoring all defences on its journey, it is instead open to go where it pleases, only limited by the geography of the landscape. The RTS element in the game is the fact that you build up cannons to protect your 'base' and resource collectors. They take time to build and must be placed strategically in order to maximise the efficiency of your defence and keep The Creeper at bay. After that, you must push forward and move your defences forward even more. But they can get delinked from getting resources, so extenders are put in place. On large maps, it can be very rewarding seeing a huge web of links and seeing your packages of Anti-Creeper and firepower flowing down these pathways. In later missions, more enemies arise and give even more things to think about when planning out defences, but don't worry. A reasonably nice variety in defence types can help with that. But you'll have to play it in order to find out what.			"

												***Written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a unique tower defense game/RTS that is more tower offense than defense, something I haven't seen before. You are a captain of a ship who has just woken up after a very very long time in cryo sleep and in the time you have been gone humanity has vanished as all the civilasations that once were have been wiped out by the creeper, a strange organism which destroys everything it touches. At the time of writing this review I have only put in three hours and have barely scratched the surface but as you can see from other reviewers' play time there is a lot to this game and a lot of replayability.+Nice pixel graphics+Simple UI and great controls+A very interesting story +Interesting concept, instead of building towers in the path of an oncoming enemy you create networks of towers and take the fight to the enemy. There are small enemy towers which emitt the creepers which gradually spread across the map, using towers you have to beat back the creepers until your network of towers is close enough to use a special offensive tower which destroys the emitter. The gameplay is quite hard to explain and I probably haven't done it justice so it's best to watch some gameplay videos.+Your towers can be moved as the creepers are beaten back out of range of your towers+It's challenging without feeling too difficult or unfair+The mission menu is an interactive starmap and you get to see your ship travel from one planet or star system to another+Nice soundtrack+Can be paused at any point during a mission+You can create and share your own levels-Either some people are god-like at this game or the leaderboards have been cheated-If you make any mistakes with what you build early on in a mission it usually ruins your chances of winning, for example if you don't build enough reactors at the start and you run low on energy later in the game you will most likely be destroyed. It adds another layer of difficulty but it can be pretty annoyingVerdict:9 An absolutely brilliant game that is more like an RTS than a TD with an impressively good story, a must buy for fans of either genre.El K.

												This is not a traditional tower defense game.  You don't build mazes.  You don't upgrade towers.  There are no units to attack.  Yet, it contains a lot of the same mechanics as TD games:  you build towers which attack for you;  you decide whether to spend or invest resources; you strategically place towers at the right places and times.  Thus, I don't feel uncomfortable categorizing this in the Tower Defense genre.The game goes like this:  you expand your base to earn resources.  The larger the surface-area of your base, the more resources-per-second you earn.  Meanwhile, the ""enemy"" is simply a geyser of fluid (called ""creeper"") which spreads out in all directions.  If the fluid touches a tower, that tower dies.  You use your towers to push back the fluid, so you can get close enough to destroy the geyser(s).On paper, it sounds stupid.  But then again, I would have said the same thing about TD games at first, and now they are my favorite genre.In reality, this is a fantastic game.  The game constantly introduces new gameplay-elements throughout the campaign, keeping it fresh and unrepetitive.  The levels are never too easy, but also never too hard (the main campaign, at least).  And after beating the campaign, the game opens up hundreds of levels created by the developer, his friends, beta testers, etc. giving this game immense replayability.I've played a lot of TD games, and this is one of my top 3 TD games of all time (just behind Pathery[www.pathery.com] and Entropy TD[www.teamliquid.net]).  If you enjoy TD games, I personally guarantee you will enjoy this game. 10/10			"

												There's hundreds of hours of strategy madness in this thing. The ~40 hour campaign is just the tip of the iceberg. There's also a random level generator (with parameters and user ratings), a level editor with online sharing, all sorts of weird alpha levels, a mashup with Gauntlet in the credits screen(!), and two other flavours of endless levels that I haven't bothered clicking on yet.Right, the game. It's a bit tower defence, a bit RTS, and a bit of logistics / network optimisation... because your base is a router. The villain is a fluid (a refreshing change from zombies), and you can terraform the map to direct your liquid foe into reservoirs for ease of blasting. Just look at the screenshots and you'll know right away if it's your thing or not.Creeper World 1 and 2 are now available on Steam also, but start with this one as the gameplay matters more than the story (which is pretty minimal).

												What a great game! I've put quite a few hours into it. For those of you put off by the fairly simplistic graphics, don't be! It's the gameplay which is the real selling point of this game.For those of you on the fence, imagine attempting to fight a tidal wave. With guns. And mortars. And another tidal wave of your own. And sometimes really big guns. The Creeper is a living liquid that makes Tiberium look like a small chemical spill. It's coming for you from all sides and directions. It cares not for the small base you've built, only for consuming everything.So dig in. In some levels you'll have to do this quite literally, as terraforming is a tool at your disposal. In some levels you'll be hanging on by a thread, almost consumed the second your power goes down to build that reactor you need to expand. In other levels, you will actively hate the liquid that is all set to consume everything you've worked so hard to create.But you will love every second of this game.A really unique concept which will keep you entertained for hours on end. Gets a 9.5/10 from me!One more thing! As mentioned to me in the comments, there is a demo version of the game on Kongregate. Check it out if you're still undecided!			"

Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal  I think that Creeper World 3; Arc Eternal may be one of the greatest games that currently exist. I will add a TL;DR at the end.Gameplay  Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a perfect mix of RTS and Tower Defense along with aspects of slight management. You fight against a liquid like and versatile foe known as Creeper. This game has infinite, and I do mean nearly infinite replayability. Once you finish the base story you can go and do thousands of more missions created by the creators and the community. This is the best strategy game I have ever played. There is not much in this world like being completely surrounded by Creeper and slowly, ever so slowly pushing back and destroying every last piece of it. There are tons of ways to beat levels whether you want to attack swiftly with risk or play for a longer game to build your layout to counteract the ever attacking foe. You can even create anti-creeper or terraform the land around you to add even more to this games amazing functions. Overall this game has a very unique and formidable foe and is the best and one of the most exhilarating strategy games I have ever played. Graphics/Sounds  I love the look of the creeper, weaponry, even the terrain. The music fits with the game giving an adventurous and formidable feel of the unknown. Pros/Cons   Pros  + Unique game playstyle + Enormous amount of replayability + Addicting + Ranges from super easy to maps where you will wonder who was sadistic enough to make it+ Huge amount of maps to play+ Good story+ Map editorCons  - May becomes repetitive to someFinal Thoughts I remember playing the first Creeper World on kongregate and thinking ""I love this game, holy crap it's amazing"". Next came Creeper World 3: Abraxis and I played it the moment it was available and again loved it but wished there was more than the 12 missions and then around a year later I got Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal on steam.  I love the game, just love it. This is definitely one of my favourite games to ever play. I also found out a while ago a new game which I think is called Particle Fleet is being developed by Knuckle Cracker and I really hope it makes its eventual way onto steam since it looks amazing. This game to me is a piece of true satisfaction and fun. This is a mix of two of my favourite types of games which are RTS and Tower Defense and it has combined those two perfectly in my opinion.TL;DR  Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a great mix of RTS and Tower Defense games. It has a unique and constantly attacking foe known as the Creeper and is an astounding strategy game. If you are unsure whether to get this game or not check out Creeper World 3: Abraxis on kongregate to get an idea of the basics of the game and general gameplay.			"

												So, I got this game on sale for about 5 dollars, and thought is might be interesting for about a day. Boy, was I wrong. I was thinking I was going to play for four or five hours. Boy was I wrong. I didn't think it was going to be an interesting game. Boy was I wrong. I didnt think there would be such a simple, yet so cool and complicated enemy. Boy, was I wrong. Never, in a thousand years would I ever expect to get such a high Dollar to Hour of Play ratio. Normally you probably wont get a 1:1 ratio for most games. But this just blew me out of the water, to realise that there are developers out there who make great games, and don't money wh*re the sh*t out of them. So from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank the developers of this game, for being able to give me 50 hours (At the time that I wrote this) of fun, and I damn well would have paid the full price for this game, if I had known how great it was going to be. It is worth every dollar, and I can't wait to see more from the company.			"

												What happens when you combine a tower defense game with supreme commander?Creeper World 3 happens, and if you like any of the two before mentioned games then you should have a great time with this one!You will not fight brain dead enemies who just walk down a single lane. Instead you have fight in all directions against a nano-machine like blob that is ever expanding across the battlefield. Add in attack robots, airstrikes and other nasty suprises and your in for a tough but fun game!Contentwise Creeper World 3  offers quite alot for such a small title. A campaign with an interesting story (yes a td/strategy game with a story) unlockable bonus levels and the ability to create and share your own maps with the rest of the community.All this combined will give you HOURS of challenging fun and replayability.The sound effects and overall visuals are pretty basic but they get the job done. The soundtrack on the other hand is quite nice despite just having a handfull of tracks.			"

												A true indie gem.  The tags say this is a tower defense game, but it is really it's own thing.  I suppose tower defense is the closest thing to what it is but it is a bit misleading.So what it is?  The premise is you have to fight back the creeper, which behaves pretty much like water pouring out of a spout (or more than one most of the time).  It slowly spreads from it's source, and is stopped by walls and higher ground until it fills up the area below and reaches the correct height.  To fight this, you build cannons, mortors, flying craft, anti-creeper producers (your beneficial creeper than cancels out the other creeper) and a few other weapons.  These are your ""towers"" but they are all mobile and can be placed anywhere they fit.  To support them you need to produce energy, which comes from nodes that cover the ground and reactors.  The nodes link up to others and need to link back to your base to produce energy and supply your troops.  Reactors don't need any ground to cover and produce more.  Troops out of supply will soon use up there reserves and will no longer be able to use their abilities.So for gameplay you will slowly spread out over the map, extenting your network and fighting back the creeper until you reach the sources and take them out with special weapons.  That's the basics but there is more.  There is a scripting language for the maps that lets them bend the rules.  There is one, non-story level where you control a man through a maze who shoots and finds keys for instance.  To top it all off, there are literally thousands of maps (most likely, I didn't count).  The main story is only a very small part of the game.  After completing parts of it other areas open up, which are basically user created maps, beta testing maps and challenging maps.  If you like the game enough you could spend thousands of hours on it, I'm sure.  I was content with just the main story and a few other maps though.If this looks at all interesting to you, do yourself a favor and pick it up.  It isn't even expensive.			"

												Slamming down a review like Pogs right now.. And I've only (shamefully) played less than 3 hours, BUT I'M QUALIFIED. This game is great :P I wanted my review to be my original thought about the game from looking at the screenshots, which was:""What are tho.. Ah, so.. The lines mo.. uh.. Wait, then those bubb, er.. And they.. ? What is tha.."" :PIn short, this game is about the primal fear of water ruining your cool stuff. Imagine your kitchen. Its awesome. Except now you've decided to catalog your prize comic book collection, THE WHOLE THING. Its going to take a while. The table is piled so full that you've had to start making piles on the floor here and there. Suddenly, your child drops a full glass jug of apparently antique milk and it shatters!! *suspenseful music* Now, the antique milk hasn't splashed on your comic books.. YET!But its spreading!! And, lucky you, besides collecting comic books you also design small functional mortars and cannons that fire small liquid-absorbing sponges, all supplied by intricate wiring relays that transport power from a central battery. For the sake of cohesion we'll say you developed the sponge cannons because of your mortifing phobia of dish cloths, also, so you can't just mop the liquid up.. *cough* If you're quick enough, you can set up an intricate web of relays linked to your tiny armada of sponge-launching war-machines aaaall along the kitchen floor in a milk-encircling radius and potentially combat the comic-ruining liquid menace before your precious copy of Jurrasic Park #1 is ruined.That's what the game is about. Yep.In all seriousness I think its pushing it to call this game a tower defense game.. I tend to reserve that title for games with MUCH less features and elements involved than this, particularly concerning tightly placed pathways. As stated elsewhere, if you have any doubts about purchasing, the first two games are on Kongregate free to play, and there is also a demo of this game on the devs website. But you don't need a demo. Did you need a demo when you decided air was good to breathe? Did you!? ;)Also I wanted to mention that til this game showed up on Steam I had no idea it existed, so there is that :> I'm fresh as a daisy to this and can already smell the deep possibilities here and have barely touched the main campaign just yet, but I still hope the dev isn't fully done adding to the main game, especially since its life on Steam has just begun.. Now if I can just muster a little focus and make time for myself to play..			"

												This game is insanely addictive.  The levels that come with the game should be winable by most people once they get some experience.  The ability to make your own levels and the built in system to view and download levels that other people have made is great.  It gives you endless game play. Not only that, but a lot of the user created maps are insanely hard. :)  Gives your brain a good work out.			"

												I've been a fan of the series since the original.In a nutshell the game is hard to put in a nutshell. It's vaguely reminicesent of tower defense titles, but with an absolutely monstrous, game-defining twist. The enemy is not units, but rather Creeper-goop that covers the map and damages or destroys your structures on contact. The game is to fight back, and then destroy the goop spigots-""emitters""- or complete other objectives. The structures and enemies are all very simple and direct in their purpose and utility. The game itself however is extremely various in difficulty based on the map itself-size, features, and the strength of the emitters. There are additional enemies in addition to the emitters but they are not in all maps.  The challenge of the game is all about defending yourself while you build your energy resources up before you push to destroy the emitters. Later, you can redo the maps to attempt to do so faster. The game has a great custom map communtiy and a custom map generator after you finish the decently long and challenging campaign. Replayability is top notch.I've gotten more fun and more hours out of this than a shameful number of AAA titles. All things considered, absolutely amazing for an indie. I've had no issues with bugs, and the developer has been pretty good with support for those that do find them.The only downside is there is no direct multiplayer of any sort. However, it really doesn't detract from all that you're already getting in this well-fleshed out title. Newbie Tips:-There is no such thing as too much energy -Stick to high ground when you can-Don't land near emitters-Don't build too many structures at once-Don't botch your startup-If you don't push, you can't win "

												Okay! Time for another review.   This time: Creeper World 3.  I'll just start right out by saying that I freaking love this one (and also that I've played it for more hours than it shown here... I hate pointing that out, but people get all weird about it).Creeper World 3 is, at it's heart, a tower defense game.  The absolute most basic concept of placing towers or turrets to defend against an advancing foe is here.  And of course you have energy and such to manage.  But that's about where the similarities to normal TD games end.The heart of CW3's genius is the enemy you face, simply known as Creeper, or Creep, whichever.  Instead of lots of seperate enemy units running at you in lanes (which ALWAYS seemed so freaking stupid to me in other TD games) the Creeper is a sort of... blue/purple goo.  EVIL goo.  This stuff spreads pretty much like you'd expect a liquid to, and the game renders/simulates/whatever this liquid really, really well, over a landscape that consists of varying levels of elevation (or sometimes, blank void areas that nothing can flow into or land on).  Your main targets in most maps are Emitters... big spiky blue things that are the source of the unending slime.   They just keep pumping it out, non-stop.  Since the Creep is pretty just a mindless liquid, it's behavior is very predictible.... but the fact that it's a liquid means that it can flow pretty much anywhere.  This is not a foe that's restricted to pre-set lanes.  And remember, this stuff JUST KEEPS COMING.  Sure, maybe a deep gorge might hold it for awhile.... but as it keeps pouring into that, eventually, it'll overflow.  It can get anywhere, eventually.Fortunately though, breaking the norms yet again, you also have the ability to work anywhere on the map.  Your towers are not restricted to specific spots like in most games, and this is the other half of the brilliance of the game.  If there's available space, you can build something there.  And most of the things you can build are actually pretty darn small... you can fit TONS of things around, which you'll be doing.Just dropping towers isnt enough though.  Like I said, the Creeper NEVER STOPS COMING.  As long as emitters exist, they'll keep making more.  They'll never stop until you destroy them.  So you cant just hold a defensive line forever.  And this is why, unlike other games, you're actually expected to ADVANCE, taking more and more territory for yourself, and reaching and destroying each emitter or other major enemy structure.  To accomplish this, your turrets can fly.  You can uproot them at any time, and give them orders to move to any other spot where there is room.  It's simple, and you'll find yourself doing it really, really often.   It's a major part of the game, and has alot of possible uses.Of course, you have your limitations.  You only have so much energy to go around, and this energy is generated by your ""network"", made up of collectors (pull in energy from the surrounding landscape), reactors, and relays, among other things.  Collectors and relays create lines between them; energy and other resources can flow along this spiderweb of nodes, usually in the form of little colored spheres or blocks.  For the most part you really only use energy when something is requesting it; when building a new object, or when an old object needs a refill on energy/ammo/ore/whatever.   So your energy usage will leap up and down depending on what you're doing... dealing with it isnt simple as your network grows into more and more of a hideous tangled mess.  And there's so much more than just that... the network is complicated enough, but the game has tons.... and tons.... of different mechanics and turrets and gizmos to use or deal with.  There are things like Strafers, which arent turrets at all but are planes that launch from pads you build, which will go off and perform strafing runs against the goo in whatever area you tell them to.  Not everything is a tower.  That fact adds even MORE complexity.   On the other side of things, not every threat is the Creeper itself.   Early on you'll be introduced to Spore Towers, for instance... nasty structures that sit there for awhile charging, before letting off this huge blob through the sky towards your structures.  Or a variety of other things that exist to assist the goo and make your job so much more difficult.  The good thing is, the game does a really excellent job of easing you into all of these different concepts.  The campaign is very good at teaching you.  However, one way or another the complexity is very high here.  Be prepared for a complex challenge.... but that's what you want, isnt it, from a strategy game?  The best part though is that this game has incredible replay value.  After you're done with the campaign, there's all sorts of other stuff to do.  Including downloading and playing maps made by other players, or using the random map generator (which in itself is very highly customizable, so you get the sort of map you're looking for) to create new challenges for you on demand.  I've seen plenty of players get hundreds of hours out of this game... the replayability absolutely is backed up by the game's incredible depth and potential for challenge, and is something you can just keep coming back to.And one other thing I'd like to point out, and this is possibly the best part for me:  This is a very ACTIVE game.  Alot of TD games have you sitting around waiting for stuff.  But this?  No.  There's always something for you to DO.  When you're not setting up defenses, you're pushing forward.  When you're not dealing with your towers, you're expanding your network, or perhaps changing Strafer/Bomber routes, or dealing with an unexpected breach in your defenses, or perhaps using your terraformers to deform the terrain or build walls (yep, you can do that in this).... and all sorts of other things.  If you ARE finding yourself  in a dull moment, typically it means there's stuff you COULD be doing... you just arent.  And that can come back to bite you pretty hard, so you want to make sure you're always aware of your options at all times.  Really though, the game's flow/pace is superb.  Always something happening and always something to do.... no moments of sitting there and waiting.  Oh, and you can speed up time, too, if you want.  I never really do that myself though.  And there's a ton of approaches to every situation.  Your playstyle is up to you... the game generally doesnt force you into specific approaches.Oh, and a word about the graphics:  They're fantastic.  This is a colorful, VIBRANT game, where everything stands out, yet is very easy to differentiate.  It's super easy to see what everything is at a glance.  Overall I really just freaking love the way this game looks.  Overall, I really cant recommend this game enough.  This is a brilliant strategy game that breaks so many of the usual rules of TD games, replacing the broken bits with new bits that are so much more awesome and fun than the old bits.  If you love strategy games of any type, if you love a challenge, and if you want some real, major replay value, something you can constantly come back to.... you'll find it here.  I cant recommend this enough.Just... try not to move your towers directly ONTO the goo.  That's just embarrassing.			"

GeneralAt the time of the writing of this review, I've currently played a mere two hours of this game. I am hooked. Although the videos of the game make it look complicated and mask its true nature, I can assure the reader that it feels like a proper tower defence game. I am a big fan of the StarCraft ""turret defence"" games of old, and I'm particularly enamoured with TD games which allow you to maze. This game may not involve mazing, but you can freely place buildings and ""towers"" anywhere you deem fit. Do not feel dismayed by the lack of monsters and lack of paths. The ""creeper"" (which is the enemy) is a creative way of presenting said enemy. It is much too easy to think of it as StarCraft zerg creep to be honest, and needless to say it is not nice stuff. I feel that this game has been lovingly crafted, and I'm looking forward to the replayability that other reviewers have mentioned.GameplayYour objective is to defeat the creeper on each world. You do this by building up an energy grid and using that energy to build and maintain various weapons (akin to the traditional TD tower). These weapons can move to a new location as you push the creeper further back, and they can be upgraded at the forge.ControlsYou use the keyboard and the mouse. All of the buildings, and many actions are linked to hotkeys, and those hotkeys can be rebound. Unfortunately the build menu does not tell you the hotkey when you hover, so you must go into the key bindings menu to discover what the hotkeys are in the first place. However, once you've learned them they are easy to get along with.StorylineThere is a plot in the Arc Eternal galaxy. It is fairly basic, and mostly explains the existence of the creeper. I didn't know what precisely was going to happen, but I certainly had a general idea of what direction the plot was going in. But this isn't the sort of game you play for the plot after all.SoundThe music is fun, it's energetic. However it is very repetitive. If I play this in the evening, I go to bed with the music stuck in my head.GraphicsThe graphics are pleasant and functional. Things seem a tad fuzzy if you zoom in really close, but I personally like to have an overall view of the map and so I don't zoom in close. Otherwise, despite all the layers upon layers of creeper, the game runs quite well for me and is not laggy.Pros+ non-traditional tower defence+ free placement and movement of ""towers""+ can rebind hotkeys+ default hotkeys make sense once learned+ make your own maps and play others' maps (great replayability)+ wide range of difficulty level (depending on map)+ first levels of campaign form a tutorial on how to playCons- music is repetitive- hotkeys are not immediately obviousHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you. It’s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.Footnotes* Any prices that I mention are in CDN because that is what I see. The primary price I list at the top is the price that I bought the game at.**I will not be keeping an eye on whether the links are up to date, so if they are broken I apologise.

												An interesting take on the tower defense genre.  In a lot of ways it plays a lot more like a conventional RTS, with interesting resource management, movable units, and requiring the player to offensively attack enemy structures, rather than sitting back and waiting.   Instead of fighting discrete enemies, you battle back a flow of liquid-like creeper.  Most levels have multiple viable strategies to beat them, giving the player a lot of decisions on how to tackle a level.  The game features a massive amount of content, with a lengthy, well written campaign, along with nearly infinite player created and procedurally generated levels.			"

												I found this gem in a bundle that I had purchased. It's a mix between an endless tower defense and a real time strategy game. a purple ooze gradually expands and you have to defend against it and attack it, slowly expanding and growing your base. I did feel like eventually I found a strategy that would work against most maps. Defend as large an area as you can, and then slowly but surely break through and take what you need. Part of the challenge comes in defeating the maps as quickly as possible, but if you take it slow, you'll eventually be able to beat any map which isn't time based.			"

												So basically, it's an RTS with a twist - the enemy is (mainly) some toxic slime and you need to get rid of whatever is spewing it out. There's a fluid mechanism that makes it possible for the slime to build up and spread out, which is kind of neat (e.g. if you're on top of a hill, the slime will take longer to reach you and it flows into cracks and valleys first).So, the one player campaign begins nicely enough, you get introduced to units and game mechanics. The story is also interesting (and is mainly what kept me playing). However, it seems that on every mission there is always something new; a new unit or building you need to take into consideration that does one special thing which you need to take out some specific enemies. They're not exciting or add much to your strategy, except ""to kill unit X you need unit Y"". Which doesn't give you much choice of an attack strategy at all, except to build whatever is required to make it through the level.And this is where the game fails the most - every level is a grind. You quickly set up your defense perimeter, but once you manage that, it's slowly building up an attack force and inch by inch moving away enough slime to get to an ""emitter"", destroy that, and do the same for any other stuff you need to destroy. You know you'll make it, it just takes time and there aren't many surprises.So, on top of not being very challenging or exciting except the first five minutes of every level, it takes between 45 minutes to over an hour to finish one. When you're finally done trudging through, you breathe out in relief - not satisfaction. Then you get annoyed because it has taken so damn long, and 90% of it was just waiting for things to happen.So, to sum it up:Yays:* Interesting campaign story* Fluid dynamics are niceNays:* Levels are a grind* Too specialized units make things more annoying than exciting* Tactics are more or less the same every level* Takes too long to finish a level* Only exciting first couple of minutes on every level, after that it's just routine			"

												9/10, would highly recommend.I remember playing this game many years ago, loving the fresh take on the typical flash-based TD genre. Being the third iteration of the game, it returns to it's roots after the admittedly mediocre sequel.With classic gameplay from the first, a new campaign, new features and enemies, and a gazillion new user-created and randomly generated levels to play, this game is almost infinitely replayable.I only have one issue with the game: Difficulty.You are expected to play agressively and take risks against the already agressive creeper; I find this quite difficult as a player who likes to take things slow and cautiously, but that's just me.Overall it's an amazing game and a fresh take on an over-used genre.PS. If you enjoyed the sandbox TD style of this game, you should check out 'Harvest: Massive Encounter', another favourite of mine.			"

												Don't be fooled by its rather plain appearance. This is one of the most addictive and stellar strategy/defense games on Steam.Struggling to build a small base and inching forward against an overwhelming and powerful enemy only to eventually gain the upper hand and wipe it of the board with massive power is satisfying again and again and again and again.There is a lengthy campaign, hundreds of bonus maps, an active hub with constantly updated and often stellar community maps and basically infinite, auto-generated maps.This is a stellar game and an absolute steal for the price.

												Absolutely smashing. One of those rare pearls that leave the plot, graphics and narrative to the background and focus on pure gameplay. Additionally not only does this game reward borderline autistic heat gradient calculations but it also offers ample oppoturnities to roleplay as a mentally ill commander that has peculiar obsessions when it comes to unit deployment. Shooting blue mass of mathematics with red things of reduction has never been more addictive.But infinite replayability isn't enough for the Creeper World community. As such you are able to enjoy a continous flow of new maps tailored by the active community members. Do you enjoy tough-as-nails survival campaigns? Situations where you aim to clear the field expanding from a small but indestructible base with the computer assisting you? Well sure as **** no you don't you casual Dota 2 babby but in a review these kind of questions are supposed to be purely rhetoric.			"

												Although some levels can get a bit grindy, the devs and level designers have taken great pains to ensure that you're constantly facing new challenges and new situations. Arc Eternal has some twists that Abraxis seemed to be lacking - most problems in previous iterations of the series could be solved with ""add more gun.""Story's alright - better than I expected, actually - the user made levels and Alpha sectors have no shortage of additional challenges, and overall, Creeper World will more than pay itself off in entertainment.For $15, you're getting something pretty damn sweet.

												Probably the most unique RTS I've ever seen. The increased variety of scenarios possible compared to the first Creeper world provides depth of gameplay beyond the options of rush to the objective or turtle your starting position until you steamroll the neverending tide of creeper trying to drown you (not that either of those can't be fun).

												This is possibly the best (and hardest to beat) tower defence game you can buy.  It tries to differentiate itself from the traditional TD format, instead of minions running down a set path - there's creep.  The creep acts as a unified ocean, which you have a huge arsenal of diverse towers to deal with it, with.If you do happen to buy this, I recommend you over to the knuckle cracker website and buy the trilogy, it includes all 3 creeper worlds $10s off with a free steam key.

												(日本語レビューは下のほう)This Strategy game is about fighting liquid-like enemies called Creeper, which aren't explosive but dangerous enough to damage/destroy your buildings on touch.Game is relatively simple : Build a network of Collectors for more energy. Have some turrets to keep Creepers at bay. Advance to their Emitter and destroy it with Nullifier(its range is short and takes time to activate, be sure to deal with creepers first).It contains more than thousands of official levels, short maps are finishable within 3 minutes or so, and some epic maps would take 2 or more hours. There's even a leaderboard competes for ""time taken to beat the level"", and some people seem to be really good at finding clever tactics or optimize their moves.The game has a built-in map editor and script editor, which allows you to make interesting maps once you know how. I'm hoping to see good levels to play.12/10, One of the best RTS I played in all the time. I played all the 3 series of Creeper World, and love it best.--------------------------------液体状の敵「クリーパー」と戦うRTS。緑色の爆発する皆のアイドルではない。ゲームプレイは比較的シンプル。「コレクター」を建ててエネルギー供給とネットワークを作り上げ、各種砲台でクリーパーと戦う。どんどん前線を押し進めてクリーパーの発生源である「エミッター」を破壊する(ただし破壊できる「ヌリファイアー」は建設に時間がかかる上に脆いので、発動までちゃんと守ること)。マップは公式で用意されたものだけでも数千以上あり、３分程度で終わる小型マップから数時間かけて攻略する難易度や規模のマップまでバラエティは豊富。クリア時間を競うリーダーボードもあり、上位のスコアの異常な速さは戦略の自由さと効率化の重要性を語っている(チートの線も否めないレベルってのもあるが)。あとマップ/スクリプトエディタも同梱で、作られたマップを公開、他者のマップをプレイして評価できる機能もある。これからのコミュニティの動きに期待できる。個人的点数は12/10。「最高のRTS」と聞かれたら挙げられそうなレベル。３作ともプレイ済みだが、３を一番薦めたい。			"

(creeper emiter in game).  The enemy has no AI but use gravity against you.  In fact, gravity with good map design makes game hard but simple if your base  is lowest level of map and creeper masses are coming from uper hill, you get my drill.

(Also,  Big thank you to the one of the sweetest guys in the world for buying this for me before I could buy it for myself!)@ 9 hours in--I flat out knew I was going to love the third installment of the creeper world saga; but I was unexpectedly blown away.  I was pulled right back into the story and found myself once again needlessly spending 30 + minutes covering planets in collectors and eliminating all traces of  creeper before clamming my wins just because I could. Quickly new mechanics were introduced and my strategies needed to be adjusted, keeping the game play from being stale for returning players.  The game includes a awesome tutorial for new comers … but I would start at the beginning of the story and pick up the 3 pack (for just a few bucks more) at the developers site: http://knucklecracker.com/The game is a must buy for lovers of strategy and tower defense games.

												Good.No, I'm talking /really/ good.I've followed this game ever since it came out as a small flash game on the whateverso game sites. It was amasingly simple but had this level of depth that not many other games at the time has, yet after a full release of the game and the founding of Knucklecracker it got even better! I'm going to ignore CW2, even though it introduced a pethora of great ideas, I personally thought it was rash and unpolished. Then they released CW3, and OH MAN this is a good game. not only did it finish up the ideas from 2, it also inserted it into the CW1 style, top-down, tower offence gameplay, and added an open code CRPL engine so that content creators can program ideas and new gamemodes into the system. This is a great game, it's all I can say.  Although I wished it kept all of my stats when it transferred it over to steam :<			"

												Creeper World is technically a tower defence game, but unlike any other you've played before.In a normal tower defence game (and even abnormal awesome ones like Defender's Quest) you'll have enemies coming towards a point or object you're defending and you're tasked with fending them off by placing towers either along a pre-defined path or by creating that path using walls or the towers themselves (this is known as 'mazing').In Creeper World there is only one enemy, the Creeper. The Creeper is a fluid of alien origin and malicious intent, it absorbs and destroys anything constructed it touches. This changes the entire dynamic and feel of the game.The goal (in most levels) is to activate totems that are strewn about the (bird's eye perspective 2D) map without having your base be destroyed by creeper. Creeper flows in continuously from spawn points and you build out a network of structures from your command ship to fend off the creeper (or even destroy its spawn points). The buildings are either combat focused (the traditional tower defence type towers) or utilitarian.Because the resource system is quite different from a regular tower defence game as well (and is surprisingly similar to Supreme Commander / Total Annihilation instead), you have 'Energy' which is used to build structures, arm your towers and charge up totems. Energy is stored in your command ship and then flows along the nodes formed by the buildings you created, like a spider web that slowly grows outward (and not unlike the creeper that slowly washes over the map).A simple level progression would be to land your command ship at a strategically good location (high ground, remember that your enemy is basically a liquid so it'll flow into the low spaces first), start building collectors (buildings that gather energy from their direct surroundings) and laser towers to protect the collectors which you slowly move up with the front as the collector field grows in size (all offensive towers can be moved across the map whenever you want).Of course things get far more complicated later on, with the addition of new towers including mortars, bombers and snipers. New enemies like a creeper-formed network that will always transmit the creeper even if it's uphill, building-disabling enemies living on this network and even aerial creeper that will occasionally spawn from specific enemy buildings and head for your base.All these things (and a lot more) are slowly introduced over the course of an excellent 30 or so campaign that even has a pretty engaging storyline (the game is set thousands of years after Creeper World 1 and 2, so you don't need to know all that much from them to get the gist of things. Unfortunately they were never released on Steam. For a sample of the gameplay from Creeper World 1 and 2 (and even 3, in case you want to try it out) there are in-browser options available here[www.kongregate.com]).There is one mission right at the end of one of the two branches of the game's plot that is very different from the others though, and not in a good way. Unlike pretty much the rest of the game it has a time limit, and a harsh one at that. In the rest of the game (especially within the campaign) it's pretty hard to lose as long as you take things slow and don't over-extend yourself. This one mission completely messes that up and asks you to rush in and beat the clock. It's not a bad concept I guess, but terribly executed and I ended up downloading an in-mission savegame in order to bypass it because I just couldn't beat it.Other than that single (but major) gripe there is nothing but praise for this game. The campaign mode (which will last you a good long while) is only the tip of ice berg, as there are thousands upon thousands of additional levels that you will need a lifetime to complete. These range from fun levels the beta testers came up with, to nasty challenge levels the creator put in, to a whole universe of bonus levels, to procedurally generated levels. There is also an in-game level editor, complete with a way to directly share them with others and play their levels and tools to change anything in the game.Go give the game's free version a shot, and if the gameplay at all grabs you this is an excellent value purchase. Just remember that there's one super annoying mission in the campaign mode.			"

												Graphics... ""functional""Story... ""there"" ;)most people will see this and switch to the next game and thereby miss one of the greatest games available at the moment. There is so much depth and replayability in this game it's a shame that its presentation prevents it from reaching a larger audience. Having played computer games since the early days of the C64 I saw this game in a bundle somewhere and immediately knew I had to have it. Luckily for me it even was available in a Linux version and for virtually nothing - considering how much fun I had with this game since then I feel like I robbed the developer! Needless to say that I recommend this game to anyone that has some affinity to tower defense or strategy games in general. Even if you are turned off by the graphics - give it a try! If you don't like it you wasted a (compared to the full price titles) tiny amount of money, but if you don't give it a try you might miss out on a gem that will give you many hours of enjoyment ;) "

												While my playclock there is probably half again what I have actually played, I have played a lot of this game. I have a few top 10 high scores (look for Seika), I've completed the story, and whole heck of a lot of missions in Tormented Space area (hard mode), so I have quite a bit of familiarity with the game.Pros:-A unique take on strategy that generally emphasizes resource and space management more than managing unit tactics, and the enemy is a rather literal tide rather than a more discreet set of units-Huge array of playable content, with a wide variety of maps.-Once you clear the main campaign, there are three main modes of pre-constructed maps. Prospector Zone has literally hundreds if not thousands of hours of content, Tormented Space exists for a good challenge, and Alpha Sector has some interesting and often difficult custom maps.Cons:-There is little to no AI to speak of. Certain types of enemies are capable of either roaming around randomly, and another will target random sections of your grid, but otherwise, the enemy will follow a strict pattern every map. Except for speed running, there is little point to replaying a map.-Music will get repetitive.There is a mute button for a reason.-Once you clear the main campaign, there are three modes. Prospector Zone is where much of the game's content lies, but the (generally) lower difficulty and lack of custom scripting means that most of these maps will get boring and repetitive. Tormented Space is not always the best tested: Some maps will feel almost as easy as the tutorial, while others are quite literally impossible without cheating (there is a thread on the Knuckle Cracker Forum dedicated to which maps are super difficult, which are insanely difficult [often requiring odd tricks in order to even stand a chance], which are possibly impossible, and which are undeniably impossible). If I have any complaint about Alpha Sector, it is that many of these maps were designed by some of the best players to be at their level, so it can be hard to make progress through those missions.The game can feel repetitive, particularly playing too much in too short a time, but the game has kept me hooked. I would recommend playing this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles and strategy, or who likes playing unique games.			"

It's quite satisfying to take back ground from the creeper, and when one word is safe, jump right into the next. One more level. I don't think I've played the other Creeper World games, but it feels like after years of making them they've got a pretty good handle on what makes a Creeper World game work in that regard.I've just finished the main Arc Eternal campaign, after 27 hours. (I play defensively and pause a lot. Your mileage may vary.) The campaign is pretty good at making each level just a little different, providing some new element of challenge and giving you a new ability to use. Some levels are more different than others.The game's weakest moments, I think, are the maps that become simply an ocean of creeper. Any distinctive features of the terrain are all but lost under the sea, as you slowly entrench and advance. Maybe more aggressive tactics could prevent ending up in that situation, but since I wasn't actually losing those battles, I didn't give up and try different techniques. Then came along a different map that makes things interesting again.This isn't the sort of game you play for the story. Yet there is a story, told in bits of dialog at the beginning and ending of levels, which shows some significant thought has gone into the lore of the Creeper. I might have appreciated it more if I was familiar with the other games, but it provides some interesting atmosphere.I can't comment on the other content outside the main campaign, but there seems to be a lot of it, with a strong focus on giving the community powerful tools to make more.I played this on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04). Everything ran great there; the only hitch I found is that after switching out of the window with Alt-Tab, I had to hit Alt again after returning to the game to get the keyboard input recognized correctly.To sum up: Surely not everyone likes this style of game. But if you're interested in this sort of thing (which you likely are, if you're looking into the reviews), I recommend it without reservation. It's an excellent implementation of the idea.And also very good if you want to forget to eat or sleep.			"

												Creeper World is a unique take on the traditional tower defense game.  Instead of fending off waves of path-following zombies, you must protect your command center from the countinuously flowing of Creeper.If you enjoy defense games, this is definitely one to try out, and there are a few other versions of this game available for free online if you're not sure you want to invest the money.//==========//   Good//==========+ Unique take on tower defense games+ Story mode + replayable levels//==========//   Bad//==========- Mediocre graphics- Story is somewhat difficult to understand- Free online versions with similar content			"

												Creeper World 3 is, by far, the most unique game to be found in the Tower Defense genre. Manage supply lines and fueling costs as you take the fight to the enemy; balancing defense with offense. The enemy in this case is an ever-pooling substance which enroaches on the planet. Perfectly simulated, the entity overflows and spills out into the environment in a believable manner. It's up to you to repel and, eventually, destroy it at the source. Pros: + Great difficulty curve. Not too hard, not too easy. + Brilliant concept.+ Managing supply and energy costs is fluid and satisfying.+ Presentation is simple and effective; height/depth is easy to see at a glance.Cons:- Lack of tooltips can lead to confusion.- Where did the last 3 hours of my life go?

												NOTE:while this game might not look like very much at first, i feel like i have played enough of this game to give a few pointers if you are considering buying it or not. What i thought to be a simple game actually turned out to be quite a complex game.it's a very good game, especcially the fact that you cann access other people's map in-game, as well as creating yourr own.it is usually a very casual game, (except where the missions are timed) which you can take at your own pace. it's not really a tower defense game, more like a resource management/strategy game.couple that with the fact that you get a liqud enemy and that the terrain has a extreme impact on gameplay, it makes it a very fun and different game, and can be VERY replayable, due to the Dial Map Device system, which means that you can make map as challenging (or as easy) as you like just a bit of a note: this is quite a niche game, and is not worth full price but is definately worth it if it is on sale.EDIT:just a bit of a side note, i have never enountered a game quite like this, so i would recommend at least watching a video before making a commitment. Although this game might seem quite 'samey' at first, there are thousands of levels to be played in various areas. And if you ever get bored of the actual game itself, there are various gamemodes that the community has made up, eg playing as the creeper.			"

												Own the whole series. Worth your time and very addictive. CW 3 greatly expands on the game play in version 1. Version 2 was a bit of a detour (fun nevertheless) in the sense that it changed the game play. Version 3 gets things back to building energy grids and deploying weapons. Also technically it runs a lot smoother than the first two versions, which were flash based. My four year old imac has no problems running version 3 full screen whereas version 1 and 2 I could not run fullscreen.			"

												Great game, great value for money, extremely addictive and eats the hours of your day like minutesDon't let the simple graphics style put you off, this game plays a lot better than it looks. From simple early levels the game introduces new weapons and options into your arsenal and steadily picks up the difficulty. Gameplay is very good and purple goo makes a surprisingly scary enemy, especially in later levels where the flow of creeper encroaches on your base frighteningly fast.Value for money wise this game really is great value. When I bought it it was marked down slightly to £10.70 and has already surpassed my requirement of giving me an hour of gameplay for every £1 I spent even if I'd paid the full priceIf I had to put an arbitrary score on the game I'd happily give it a 9/10 on it's engaging gameplay, ability to make hours pass like minutes and value for money, only missing out on a point because it could maybe have been a little prettier to look at			"

The game is an interesting take on strategy games. If I had to describe how I feel about the gameplay, I would describe it as an RTS that can function as a turn based strategy game.			"

												The Creeperworld series is by far one of my favourite time wasters. Like others that I have read, I played the first 2, including the extra missions, all on Kongregate and eagerly awaited this third installment. I'm so glad to see it here on steam as the Dev can finally make a decent buck from his amazing efforts!What makes Creeperworld games so unique amongst other tower defence games is the energy currency system. Unlike other games that require you to save your resources, research, etc etc until you can build what you want, you have the ability to build straight away and as many of each structure as you like. The danger lies that the energy required to build, is the same energy required to fire weapons. So if you exhaust too much energy into building, you will surely die! This is balanced by the fact that the more ""collectors"" you spread across the map, the more energy you have, so there is always an incentive to keep building! Although not as graphically amazing as some TD such as Kingdom rush, Giants and Dwarves, etc or even the older Dune 3D, Starcraft, etc, etc it makes up for it in fantastic TD gameplay. The second installment of the series seemed to push for better graphics, though this actually seemed to tear away slightly from the charm of Creeperworld and I am personally glad to see an this version return a bit truer to its roots... With one great advantage... NULLIFIERS!! You can explode those nasty emitters. Something that you dreamed heavily about in the first game. There are a bunch of new features in this third game all which so far (I know it's still early for me) are very welcome imrovements. One of the best improvements has to be the TERP that literraly allows you to redraw the level!! No space for that turret... No problem, I'll just terraform some extra land in there :) It's a low price for a game that will guarantee you hours and hours of addicting gaming.			"

												A few months back, I bought this game after seeing it featured on a Let's Play channel that I follow. I loved it. Now it's featured on Steam, and that was worth me buying the game again.. :VEssentially, Creeper World 3 is a simple, yet very addicting RTS game. Your task: to liberate planets from the Creeper, which is a living liquid substance that had flooded and destroyed civilizations for millions of years. The story mode campaign is pretty much an extended tutorial that teaches you about all of the gear and units that you will acquire along the way. Once you have gotten so far into the story mode, you can unlock access to other Zones, which is where the game truly opens up.These Zones have tons of star systems, each with their own collection of planets. Basically, you are free to explore hundreds (if not thousands) of levels of Creeper-fighting goodness. There is also a Map Editor mode in which you can create your own maps to upload to the community. You can also download maps that others have created, and rate them. If all of that still isn't enough, there is a ""Dial Map"" service, which is a seed-based random map generator. So many potential battlefields..So, yeah. Great game. Keep on fightin' that flood!			"

												Creeper World 3 is an interesting variation on tower offense... You build towers to limit the spread of ""the creep"", something that spread like goo over all areas of the map like the Flood in Halo, except smaller. Weapons can limit them, but the only way to stop them on a world is to destroy the creeper emitter on the world by building a nullifier near it. However, nothing can survive in the creep... thus, you need to build a network of nodes to power the turrets, push back the creep, and eventually reach the emitter and shut it down. As you advance from world to world, system to system, creeps get... creepier. They get spore throwing towers (shoots a blob of creep anywhere on the map), but you get beam towers to defend against such. The defense ""digitalis"", which was supposed to destroy creep at the molecular level, had been subverted and now creates ""pathways"" to spread, but cannons and such can roll back such until you can destroy the digitalis emitter. Runner nodes generate small runners that can suicide, but you have ""sniper"" turrets against such. Then ""glider"" nodes with weapons defend against intruders near its paths. To counter those, you get better turrets. Mortar (ignores terrain), sniper turrets (mentioned before) that goes after runners and such but limited to line of sight, beam turrets against incoming spores (some are launched up to 4 at a time), sprayer to spray ""anti-creep"" (AC), bombers to drop larger qty of AC, strafer to slow a valley of creep, Guppy transport to move AC, energy, or ore around maps that has disconnected islands, Big Bertha cannon (takes out a big chunk of creep), better control nodes (longer range) and much more. Your command module along with collectors and reactors generates the power to power all the turrets. The trick is find control terrain to limit the creep to a section of the map, then roll it back section by section, by controlling key terrain much like all RTS games, without running out of power. You are some sort of warrior awakened after millenia of sleep, only to find desolation all over the galaxy, ruins everywhere, signs of combat and creep everywhere as well, shields and warp inhibitors did not save the worlds, but your strategy and deployment of units may. As you advance from world to world, star system to star system, your encounters gets worse and worse, enemies gets more and more complicated, but you get more and more toys to play with. While graphics are low-fi and 2D only it does not distract and in fact, keep the frame rate high and creep is sufficiently creepy enough. There are also visibility options to turn stuff on/off to help visualize the battle, with zoom. However, there is no edge scroll... You have to use WASD to scroll if you are zoomed in. It is different enough from regular tower defense to give you a good challenge, but it does get a bit boring after a while, or frustrating, as energy management is crucial, and there is no manual. Read beginner's guide on Steam before getting started. Verdict: Try. It is a very unusual RTS.			"

												I've got 90+ hours on this game and that's just since it became available on Steam. This is an amazing RTS game. Think of a tower defense / base building game. You have to be careful with your resourses and either turtle or blitz the enemy spawners. The enemy in this game is more like a liquid that flows around the maps however their are other types of enemies (aerial, and ones that disable your equipment for a brief time.)The story is amazing and one of the best features is the robust map building engine. The game comes with it's own language for programming how the enemy responds and reacts and you can do some very interesting concepts. Thousands of player-created maps that you can browse through, download, play, rate... just well thought out and well done.If you enjoy this game, I'd highly recommend buying the first two as well.

												I like tower defense games though the genre is generally a bit stale at this point. However I really like Creeper World because it's not really a TD, but still sort of.http://played.today/creeper_world_3_arc_eternal.html

			The game I played today is called Creeper World 3. It's a pseudo-tower defense supply line management kind of game where you build to defend yourself against the ever growing creep on various worlds.

												I've pumped a lot of hours in this game for a simple reason: it's lots of fun!The game doesn't punish you for playing slow on most maps (I'm a huge turtler), but finishing a map fast (for a higher score) is a real challenge. There's a huge number of maps included and then there's tons of community maps to download as well, the possibilities are near endless.If you're looking for a game that you can both play leisurely or intensily, this is a good candidate.The story is fun, but not something you'd write home about. What really makes this game is the simplicity of the enemy: liquid. Yes, you're fighting, what seems like, a dangerous blue liquid.Enjoy.			"

												I have played all three Creeper games, and loved them all. I liked the first better than the second, so when the third returned to the same style of gameplay, yet improved, buying it was a no-brainer.I have played many hours on number 3 before it gor released on steam, and more after.Most levels consist of establishing a beach head / base then beating back the unrelenting flow of creeper. When you reach their spawners, you can destroy them. When the last is gone, you win the map. Other levels have a master spawner that when killed destroys the others. Do you head straight for this one, or soften up the resistance first? The choice is yours.Your main recource, energy, is often the most deciding factor.Pro's:- Nice long story arc.- Endless ways to complete levels.- Replayability to beat your previous best time.- Level editor.- Big community of custom levels.- A ton of levels ship with it outside of the story arc.- Programmable units (for custom levels).Con's:- Easy levels can get repetetive (""Just mopping up"")- Some of the smaler maps are insanely hard (could also be a Pro rather that a Con... ;-) )Graphics / sound:The game has simplistic graphics which is nice to look at, and more importantly, not so dazzling and cluttered as to confuse you. The soundtrack is good for the first few hours, but wheres a bit thin as the hours rack up. It can be muted in favour of what ever you like.I give this game 10 / 10 , It is one of the few games I keep returning to for another couple of maps.(PS! Creeper 1 and 2 are not avaliable on Steam. Visit knucklecracker.com if you are interested)			"

												What a game.I wasn't familiar with the previous titles in the series, but this is absolutely great.Admittedly the game isn't really pretty and might put some people off, but gameplay-wise this is a gem.I mean... how many games do you know where the main mechanics are attrition, network building and logistics?At the start of the game I completely disregarded the story, but I quickly found myself wanting to know more... and the story is actually well-written and interesting! Which, I have to say, was a surprise (the game would have been as good without any story whatsoever).Also, the pacing is great... every level holds a new mechanic, a new unit or a new obstacle to overcome.The content is also monstrously gigantic, with custom maps, challenges, etc.Now, not everything is perfect... the instructions on how to play are way too vague and the lack of tooltips coupled with odd terminology makes it a bit hard to get into. The UI is functional but could have been better.Also, people who might panic when there's too much much stuff going on might not like it...Despite all of this, it's still a fantastic experience and real surprise... especially considering that nowadays games tend to fail to hold my interest for more than a couple of hours.I'll be keeping an eye on knucklecracker's future endeavours.

Your enemy is the liquid creeper and you must stop the ""valves"" of creeper.

												Creeper World 3 is a game that will catch you off guard. Unless you played the flash versions- then It's just more of the same, in an extremely good way. Beyond Creeper World's flash-era graphics, midi-era music, and long dialogues of exposition that seem to go on for ages, is a complex fun game that is more than your average tower defense.I feel like it would almost be putting Creeper World to shame by simply just calling it a tower defense. It's more like it's own unique style of RTS, pitting you against the mysterious force simply called ""The Creeper"" (aka water) that is constantly spreading at an alarming rate. Your goal varies from mission to mission, either a simple one such as ""Get from point A to point B, destroying everything in your way"" to ""activate these 6 thingies, go over here and kill this, and then do a loop formation with your towers and then go...."" etc etc. The game varies it's missions very well, making every planet seem like a distinct new world with it's own gimmick rather than just something thrown in a level generator. The towers are extremely situational, and I actually like this more- there's no ""Jack of all trades"" tower, forcing you to vary your strategy depending on what is happening in front of you.This all sounds very complex, and possibly at the later levels it is. But as of writing, I have not completed the first sector as I am taking my time enjoying each level, and it is quite managable. I have not tried the extra features that seem very interesting such as DMD, Colonial Space, and Tormented Space, simply because I do not want to spoil the towers for myself- but these seem all like extremely cool features to add replayability to the already large campaign. DMD Allows you to name a randomly generated map after beating it, allowing other players to play and rate the map and name for themselves. Colonial Space is a sector of space only containing user generated maps, and Tormented Space is full of hard bonus missions.Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a beautiful game so far. It's mediocre graphics might not seem like it's worth 15 dollars at first glance, but this is much, much bigger than one might expect. If you like the base game, there is infinite replayability here with much more towers and many more planets to explore.			"

												Creeper World 3 is an interesting variation on tower offense... You build towers to limit the spread of ""the creep"", something that spread like goo over all areas of the map like the Flood in Halo, except smaller. Weapons can limit them, but the only way to stop them on a world is to destroy the creeper emitter on the world by building a nullifier near it. However, nothing can survive in the creep... thus, you need to build a network of nodes to power the turrets, push back the creep, and eventually reach the emitter and shut it down. As you advance from world to world, system to system, creeps get... creepier. They get spore throwing towers (shoots a blob of creep anywhere on the map), but you get beam towers to defend against such. The defense ""digitalis"", which was supposed to destroy creep at the molecular level, had been subverted and now creates ""pathways"" to spread, but cannons and such can roll back such until you can destroy the digitalis emitter. Runner nodes generate small runners that can suicide, but you have ""sniper"" turrets against such. Then ""glider"" nodes with weapons defend against intruders near its paths. To counter those, you get better turrets. Mortar (ignores terrain), sniper turrets (mentioned before) that goes after runners and such but limited to line of sight, beam turrets against incoming spores (some are launched up to 4 at a time), sprayer to spray ""anti-creep"" (AC), bombers to drop larger qty of AC, strafer to slow a valley of creep, Guppy transport to move AC, energy, or ore around maps that has disconnected islands, Big Bertha cannon (takes out a big chunk of creep), better control nodes (longer range) and much more. Your command module along with collectors and reactors generates the power to power all the turrets. The trick is find control terrain to limit the creep to a section of the map, then roll it back section by section, by controlling key terrain much like all RTS games, without running out of power. You are some sort of warrior awakened after millenia of sleep, only to find desolation all over the galaxy, ruins everywhere, signs of combat and creep everywhere as well, shields and warp inhibitors did not save the worlds, but your strategy and deployment of units may. As you advance from world to world, star system to star system, your encounters gets worse and worse, enemies gets more and more complicated, but you get more and more toys to play with. While graphics are low-fi and 2D only it does not distract and in fact, keep the frame rate high and creep is sufficiently creepy enough. There are also visibility options to turn stuff on/off to help visualize the battle, with zoom. However, there is no edge scroll... You have to use WASD to scroll if you are zoomed in. It is different enough from regular tower defense to give you a good challenge, but it does get a bit boring after a while, or frustrating, as energy management is crucial, and there is no manual. Read beginner's guide on Steam before getting started. Verdict: Try. It is a very unusual RTS.			"

												There's a link to my review in the Steam description above, but I figured I'd post some content here as well.""When it comes down to it, “Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal” keeps the addictive quality of the original alive and then some.  The extra content is just icing on the cake and almost assures return visits. In terms of whether or not it is suitable for kids, I’d have to go on record and simply say, “yes”.  There is no blood/gore and as an added bonus, it promotes critical thinking in that you’re forced to tackle maps in a systematic way.  Coming at the creeper from one side may not work, for example, but establishing a foothold elsewhere might be what you need to advance.  In a sense, this game is not only a real-time strategy/tower defense hybrid, but it’s also part-puzzle and will certainly make you think.  This combination is great for kids and adults alike, in my opinion.  All in all, “Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal” is a brilliant addition to an already fantastic series.  While this game is without a doubt a keeper, there’s a free demo on the official website (link below) should you wish to try before you buy.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/creeper-world-3-arc-eternal/

												Bringing something new to the tower defense genre, Creeper World is ultimately about logistics. the key to every level involves establishing and expanding a production base of energy and ore, building and defending a transportation network to bring those materiasl to where they are needed, and deploying a variety of defensive systems to repulse a predictable but overwhelmingly endless flow of purple goo.Graphics are simple yet functional, soundtrack is good but repetitious and the game lacks any voiceovers. In a stricly technical sense, this game belongs in the 90s. However, the excellent design and level of refinement more than make up for the lack of luster and polish.All in all, it would be a decent buy at the price asked ($15) as of this review, but it's currently (Summer 2016 Sale) $3, which should make this a no brainer for any tower defense fan,			"

												RECOMMENDED WITH WARNINGSI am frustrated with this game. Because:When I first started playing it I thought it was going to be my new favorite game. And it was for like a week. But of course the ""introductory phase"" is never the same as when you get into the ""meat"" of a game, and that's where things got frustrating.Mainly cuz it's just boring. Feels like a game in search of an x-pack (at least one x-pack!) Not enough diversity in terms of friendly or enemy units/activities = not enough diversity in gameplay overall = game gets boring real quick.Map-wise, no complaints about the amount of content. There are hundreds if not thousands of maps I have not played, and theoretically unlimited content via parametric map generator and fan-made content. But the actual gameplay is so boring I would basically have to force myself to play it at this point. (Achievements, u know...)The usual response to the ""boring"" complaint is that ""you are playing it wrong"". (IKR?) People apparently get a kick out of playing this game in a ""speed run"" style, because high scores are based on speed. At that point, though, it becomes more of a puzzle game and those just don't interest me at all. (Or at least, they interest me extremely rarely...)One thing that might alleviate the tedium a little is if there was smarter UI logic/assistance when it came to placing your collectors (basically solar power plants which you have to at least attempt to place somewhat optimally or they are useless). Right now you can semi-automatically lay them out in a line. This game would be less of a criminal against humanity if you could quickly lay them out in a grid. (i.e. keep the exact capabilities of the current placement ""tool"" and just make it work in 2 dimensions instead of just 1.) I find myself spending a lot of time doing these tedious set-ups at the beginning of each map, that practically take as long as the gameplay portion.But of course the pros are like ""you are not supposed to be building 200 collectors and spending 45 minutes on a single map!""  OK, but even when I play short games, the setup takes too long.........So, while I ultimately don't ""NOT RECOMMEND"" this game-- as critical as I am, it actually takes a LOT for me to ""NR"" --if I was looking for a pure Tower/RTS-defense kinda game... I'd appreciate the advice if someone told me my time was probably better spent elsewhere.(And that being said, I'm not 100% sure but I think I got this game in a bundle and probably effectively paid <$1 for it so .. not like I rly regret buying it anyway. I just regret becoming infatuated with it before I knew what it really was.)			"

												Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a under-the-radar tower-defense game that is both fun and challenging. It's basic yet complex appearance may overwhelm those new to the genre, but Knuckle Cracker did a good job on slowly pacing the user into the concepts around Creeper World 3. The graphics of Creeper World 3 aren't anything extraordinary but they are pretty solid. The terrain is in a variety of colors and the illusion of layers is clearly there. The various tools and weapons stand out from the terrain and are simple to realize through the variation in shape and color. While everything looks basic throughout the game, the graphics are crisp and clear - and that's good enough for a tower defense game. The core gameplay of Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is one that is new to me. While I have played other games in the same sort of genre, Creeper World 3 is unique in the sense that it's attempting to fuse both Tower Defense and Strategy-Simulation. While the majority of tower defense's have you place your weapons on a certain path as enemies start to come at you on a predictable path - Creeper World 3 is adds a refreshing twist. Your enemy is the creeper. The creeper spreads outward in all directions, covering the terrain and destroying everything in it's path. It is your job to use the weapons at your disposal to take out the source of the creeper - being the emmiters. While it may not sound that hard, which it really isn't at first; the difficulty begins to ramp up. It will be very challenging for newcomers - including me at times, but I never really felt that the game was cheating. I also realized what mistakes I made if I were to fail. Throughout the game, you will play a variety of maps with the inclusion of the story. The story arc is the weakest point about this game, it's very forgettable and did nothing to increase the immersion or gameplay. It's a good effort nonetheless. The mouse controls are also great - with the ability to pause the game, plan you moves and move your units around where you please. Overall, the core mechanics of Creeper World 3 is great and will be something for all games in the similar genre to beat. The audio is good for a game like this. In all honestly, what can you expect. The music is fine with the occasion of it being repetitive. I found myself turning off the music at various times. The sound effects are pretty simple. Nothing special here.Creeper World 3's greatest strength is it's value. Like Skyrim, Portal 2 and Torchlight 2 before them, the sheer amount of user content is mind-blowing. At a cheap price of $15, it's pretty hard to not pick this one up if you are a fan of the genre. There are an abundance of maps, both pre-made and user-made all varying in difficulty. It's also good to note that some maps have been known as unbeatable. A random map generator is also here as well as an in-game editor to create your own maps for others to try. Creeper World 3 also has over 130 achievements for those who are into them. In conclusion, Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal was one of the more surprising buys for me. I didn't think I would enjoy the game this much. It is something I will continue to play for years to come.

												I've been very interested in the Creeper World trilogy for as long as I can possibly remember. I first found a flash game affixed on the engine used in Creeper World 1, Creeper World Training Simulation[www.kongregate.com] on Kongregate, and ever since then I had been searching vigeriously for more Creeper World flash games. Next up was another game created by the engine used for Creeper World 1, Creeper World: Evermore[www.kongregate.com]. Following up on that, I also discovered Creeper World: User Space[www.kongregate.com]. Shortly after, I finally found a flash game affixed to the engine Creeper World 2 was made from, Creeper World 2: Academy[www.kongregate.com]. I had a lot of fun messing around with the anti-creeper there. Eventually, I learned that there was a Creeper World 3 hidden somewhere on the internet, and I looked everywhere for it. Soon, after visiting Knuckle Cracker's website[knucklecracker.com], I learned that Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal had been Greenlit on STEAM. I rushed to get a STEAM Card from Gamestop, and IMMEDIATELY bought Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal without even a second thought. When I started playing, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Not for one second, not for my mom, not for my dad, not for my brother, not even to marvel at my chihuahua when he was rolling over in my room behind me, trying to get my attention. I could not stop for anyone. The story is amazingly well put together, and innovation and the quick thinking strategy it forces you to endorse while playing is absolutely indescribably amazing. I couldn't stop playing No matter how angry I got, or how far I progressed only to have the creeper destroy everything I have built and worked so hard for, I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING!! .... I'm sorry, if I keep this up, I'll be ranting on about how awesome this game is for days.			"

												Try the online versions of this game. This is a nice strategy game mostly build on suply lines to me. This is a good price for this game, it has a ok story that you have to read though and can be very difficult. This also suports creating your own maps and downloding tons of other peoples map with simple mulitplayer to see who can finish it the fastest. Do try the free games online and see if you want to support them by buying this game. This does not add that much but it does give you a full big game instead of going online website. However the inteface scale is kinda small and not a lot of mouse overs for the units and some controls could be better. This game makes up for it by having a great window mode and can easly play while doing other things. Overall this game to me is worth the price and is one of my favorite online website games and now I can run it easier and have so much more content.			"

												A surprisingly satisfying experience, Creeper World 3 combines a compelling mystery-story about an enigmatic and impossibly powerful enemy with the satisfaction of a tower defense game that allows you to precisely nail that moment of satisfaction that comes when you just barely gain the upper hand, and turn the tables on an opponent that has had you against the ropes for most of the battle.......or at least that's what I experienced with my turtle-style gameplay; blocking off key points and slowly amassing an economic juggernaut that allows me to employ brute-force tactics and give the enemy a taste of his own medicine, so to speak. The story I found to be equally enjoyable, so much so that I found myself making sure to play through every planet of a given sector in a single session just so I could move on to the next and hear more of the narrative. It also included a worthwhile (if a bit predictable) twist at the end.9 / 10			"

												(Originally posted April 3 2014)I just finished the main campaign of Creeper World 3 today, a unique tower defense/RTS game that uses a thermodynamic simulation to control the ""Creeper"", a fluid–like substance that must be combatted to conquer the game's levels. A return to the top–down perspective of the original Creeper World, this game also incorporated many elements of the previous sequel, Creeper World 2 (which had a different perspective and significantly different mechanics).While I enjoyed this game very much, my biggest complaint is that the performance suffers when you have too many units built, which hampers my preferred turtle/juggernaut strategy. On some of the large maps, even playing at 4x speed the gameplay would slow to an interminable pace. Aside from that reservation, I'd certainly recommend this game, particularly to RTS and tower defense enthusiasts. The story is bat♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy, but who plays this kind of game for the story?			"

												This game is so good!  It is by far the best of the Creeper World trilogy, all of which were highly enjoyable.  I completely devoured this game - I had a huge craving for a particular mood of space game, and this more than fit the bill.  The story is very compelling and almost haunting.  The incredibly far future setting is complemented superbly by the details and artifacts strewn across the many worlds.  Its practically awe-inspiring.Another thing I have to say about the game is that the design and coding is perfect - I never found a single bug, and was extremely pleased by all the things I could do with the interface that I wished I could have done in the predecessors.  An excellent job all around![Note: I played this originally off Steam, and love it so much I'm replaying the campaign on Steam]			"

												Creeper World 3 is a fun and innovative take on the strategy/tower defense genre. Your main enemy is an ancient, liquid based entity that spreads throughout the universe, destroying all in its path. In order to kill the Creeper, you must build an energy network, build turrets to push it back, then destroy its source. There are a wide variety of tools at your disposal, various types of turrets, shields, terraforming devices, attack craft, and even the ability to manufacture your own creeper, to name a few. This creates considerable depth, by giving you the choice how to tackle the various missions.On the subject of missions, there are a lot of them. In addition to a main campaign (which does a good job of introducing players to the nuances of the game and the many units), there are several other sectors, numerous community made maps, and a dial a map function which allows for map generation. In short, there's a lot of hours fun to be had. In addition to great gamplay, the visuals are nice, and there's some really great music to play along to. I've encountered no bugs in my time playing. This is a game I would unconditionally recommend to strategy & tower defense fans. Even if strategy isn't normally your thing, CW3 is quite different from the usual fare, and you may well find something here to your liking. Well worth checking out!			"

It stands on it's own as something completely different from any other game out there.   It is well made.   You can see the parts that the developers really focused on making something fun.    The graphics and sound are not the top, but then again they don't need to be for a game like this.    It is very hard to describe and there are A LOT of different things in this game.   It is not a short game that you will beat in one weekend like most Tower Defense games.   I'll be returning to this one from time to time.    I replay and revisit games like Defense Grid when I am interested in Tower Defense.   This game has earned it's spot as one of those games I expect to revisit frequently.Do I recommend this game?

												Quite the addictive Tower Defense esque game. I am writing tower defense esque, because you are not exactly fighting waves of enemies, but instead you are fighting waves of goo. The goo is generated by one or more spawner on a topographic map. The spawner acts as well for the liquid goo that is starting to slowly spread from its origin and you are tasked with destroying the spawner.In order to destroy the spawner you have to build an infrastructure that can fuel and provide your military forces (Towers) the necessary energy to stem the tide of the goo. You start from your own base/spaceship and extend from there, building collectors and relay stations in order to gather and transport energy to the guns. The guns once build have to be provided with energy in order to shoot. If the goo touches the base of the installation, the installation gets destroyed.As mentioned before, you are fighting on a tophographic map, which means every map has several layers and you can for example use the high advantage of a plateau in order to attack the goo beneath it. The goo, behaving like a liquid has to fill the entire level, before it can advance in height, which can be used by the player via terraforming the level.A quite addicting little game. Although, little might be a bit confusing. There seem to be at least 250 levels in the game, and for the hardcore, there are time attack leaderboards.			"

For example, I'm about 5 levels in and I just realized I can move turrents around after placement. And another level I kept failing at because I didn't realize that I could build on top of higher ground - it looked like the creeper had to go through the canyons, so I thought I did as well. But once I got past those issues, I cannot stop playing.			"

												Pretty much the greatest part of the Creeper World franchise. In this game, you have to build a network of structures on different worlds you come across and complete the objectives in each level. You enemy is a blob with liquid physics that flows across the land and obliterates everything it comes into contact with. The story is decent, the levels are excellent, the concept is very original and quite frankly, this is just an excellent game. Hundreds of hours of gameplay here, I would absolutely recommend it!

												This is 3rd in the Creeper series and it shows; headline feature from previous entries now casually sit in your tool box, and years of polish and good UI choices run through the experience.This is the Creeper series at it's very best,The core game is a pseudo tower-defense game, where the enemy ""creeper"" is modeled on thermodynamic movement (enemy propagates through the level like heat through a medium), and your personal infrastructure in modeled on packet switching.The benefit of this is a game that's a very unique variant on the genre, and visually is wholly singular. Packets zip about your network as they beat back the horrors of living entropy!Worth highlighting is the story; minimalist in a very impressive way. A few text back-and-forths at the start of a level are all you get, but they deliver fully on the feeling and weight of being trapped at the end of a dead universe; alone in the empty infinity but for your sole friend.It would be nice if production values were a little higher. Sprites could be better; and the music though good, does get repetitive with it's few songs. Though the core experience is never deeply hurt by these weak points.The game's single biggest flaw is in it's dynamics. If you survive the first few minutes of a fight it becomes a rather rote process of slowly expanding your territory, until 30-60 min later you've zapped the last enemy. There are frequent small decisions to make, but very few large ones. Despite the narrative weight of the-end-of-all-things and the cool high-energy packet switching & blasting of your little empire, the game ultimately feels like a casual experience. Mellowly click away, pruning your little bonsai death machine until you've won. A fine experience, but RTS and 4x fans will be yearning for more difficulty and substance.Though some will wish it had more challenge, ""Arc Eternal"" is still an excellent little game! (And it's probably cheep by the time you read this.) Its uniqueness makes it well worth your time and money!			"

												This is a curiously addictive game and a complete surprise to me. I had no idea it existed before I tried it based on user reviews, and I ended up having a really good experience playing it. An unorthodox take on the tower defense genre, with strictly utilitarian graphical presentation and a very deep strategic layer, it is a game I'll definitely return to in the future!Recommended!			"

Although the graphics aren't anything worthy of praise, it's an incredibly simple but effective demonstration of raw real time strategy gaming. The Campaign itself isn't too challenging, but beyond that there are tens and potentially even hundreds of missions which are playable beyond the Campaign, many of which are incredibly challenging in their own right. The economy system is incredibly similar to the likes of Supreme Commander. If you don't mind minimalistic graphics and love a good real time strategy that's really easy to pickup, but difficult to master, then Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is the game for you.			"

												This is one very addictive game!I fully recommend it!To sum up what you do in this game is you fend of creepers, which advance across the map as a fluid. Some maps also feature spores and other special units to mix up the challenge.Your goal varies, sometimes it is to wipe out the nodes that spawn the creeper. Sometimes you just need to unlock a shield bubble(which usually is at the far end of where you can land).To help you out with this you got different types of turrets and some units you can build up.In order to win you can usually choose to go either turtle mode or just rush. Some maps force you to play extra aggressively, otherwise you will be overrun if you try to turtle.Most importantly is to keep that production going so you can support whatevery style you choose.

												Despite the title, this game has nothing to do with Minecraft! This is the first game I've bought in a long time at full price,  and it's worth every penny.Creeper World 3 is a pausable RTS-type game with aspects of tower defense at its core, combined with a physics/fluid dynamics twist. The game is very well done, challenging and packed with a number of game modes, along with a powerful integrated editor. It's not ridiculously complicated with dozens of units or a mad clickfest where you need millisecond reaction times to survive -- those games are not really my style, but Creeper World 3 is very satisfying. It can get hectic, but there's always time to pause and breathe.Terrain (including terraforming), energy networks and advancing your weaponry all play huge roles, and you will definitely be pondering strategies on every map. This is not a puzzler, there's not a single ""right way"" to win each map; given enough time, often times even poor strategies can grind out wins. That translates to a lot of flexibility and support for different playstyles and setups.As the title suggests, this is the third entry in the series, so there's a level of polish and streamlining over the previous titles. There are a huge number of community-created maps, variable-driven procedurally generated maps, and advanced scripting options available in the editor to create a large variety of scenarios beyond just basic maps. You could basically play this game for the rest of your life and always see new content. Steam cloud, achievements and online leaderboards round it all out.Try the free demo at the developer's site to see if it hooks you like it did me: http://knucklecracker.com/common/demo.php "

												In three sentences this game is one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time. Taking a genre that has seen little inovation in recent years and turning it on its head. Expect a fun and challenging game, with an interesting story and a truly staggering amount of dev and user created levels. If you want a new challenge in a game type you like, then this RTS is well worth a try.A slightly more detailed opinion on the game is as follows.Creeper World 3 may be the third in a series but this is the first I heard of it. I enjoyed this game so much i really want to play the other two. The gameplay is fresh and an easy to follow inovation of traditional RTS's. With a story mode that doubles as a tutorial, new tech is introduced at a steady and not overwhelmin pace, but not too slow either. Instead of mining traditional resources you mine energy(for the most part) which maily takes space, the more space you have the more possible energy you can get, using traditional looking turrets and air craft you have to defend against an insidious liquid like enemy that flows from a central point, trying to take over the level. From a gameplay perspective this game is well worth a go if your a strategy fan, and if you simply want a game that provides a challenge without being overly frustrating then this may well be a good game for you.There are many features that will draw people from a leadership board, to simple but not old looking graphics, a different take on the RTS genre and of course the obscene amount of levels created by Devs and Users.On the probems side of this game, there are very few, there is one level that universaly hated for being bery hard and in many people's opinion impossible, this of course is wrong, its simply very hard. The repetative nature of so many guns constantly firing is very frustrating but they have made it easy to mute the sound. I certainly recomend this game as its deffinatly made it into my top favourate strategy games, and has just made it into my favourate games of all time. So what are you waiting for watch a video of the game and buy it. Its deffinatly worth the retail value, let alone a sale price			"

So simple and yet so addicting.Play thousands of player created scenarios, billions of random maps or create your own with powerful tools.Only con is you have to complete specific story (tutorial) missions to unlock all functions (but it is not very long and it is useful for new players).Best of all there is unity demo to try (you can also try first two just for fun).

												In a sense, this is a tower defence game with a fair bit more respect to enemy pathing than just having them walk down long narrow hallways, ignoring the things trying to kill them. If it's still available, I'd recommend playing Creeper World 3: Abraxis to get a feel of how Arc Eternal plays. In terms of longevity, there's hundreds to thousands of maps available in Arc Eternal, which are thinly hidden behind the campaign.			"

												I started to play just to pass 15 minutes, and the next time I looked on my watch I'd played for 3 hours... I won't espouse the dirt and glory of this game in great detail, others have done that far better than I, but I will add to the chorus of people saying they enjoy the game. It's resource maagement on par with StarCraft, at least in the early phases(as you go later you'll probably amass a literal sh*tton of them).It has a bit of normal tower defence, but the important part isn't to kill the enemy fast, it's to not die quickly. If you manage to dig your claws in you can soon push into the enemies rank and destroy them for good.(I have not finished the game, I'v just played enough hours to know I like this game. Please consider buying a game that doesn't have the looks of the shiny AAA games, but more than makes up for it with personality.)			"

I like the concept, the story is quite nice as well. I honestly tried to put myself in the main character's shoes. I like the music as well, although i found the list of songs a bit limited so far.All in all i'm very excited i bought this game.

												Creeper World is a tower defense with very unique gameplay and design. Unlike most tower defense games your enemy isn't a horde of monsters, but is instead a steadily expanding mass known as 'creeper'. Defeating the creeper isn't as simple as having strong towers - you have to know how to hold back the creeper while expanding your own area of influence, taking into account the the creeper will ooze in from multiple angles and will build up in areas of low elevation to eventually climb up onto higher ground. Your own building mechanics are quite interesting as well. Instead of having independent towers, you instead build a web-like network of resource gatherers, utility structures, and attacking towers. Managing this web can get quite tricky at times, because all resources must flow through a command center and take time to traverse the network. Done incorrectly you could end up building a tower but not being able to arm it in time to defend against the creeper. Also, while the creeper acts as a steadily growing mass, the player often ends up mirroring the creeper in many ways. Collectors - the primary resource generator - are most effective when spread out, forcing the player to expand their area of influence if they want more resources to spend. There are also many resource deposits around the map which must be contested, forcing the player to expand their area of influence even more. Aiding this playstyle is the fact that attacking towers can be respositioned, allowing you to leapfrog towers to slowly but steadily push the creeper back.Overall the game is an excellent example of a unique twist on a genre and very polished gameplay. It's an extremely satisfying game to play and I highly recommend it to anyone who finds the concept interesting. Don't worry about not playing the previous games - they give more of the story, but this game is fully functional as a standalone experience.			"

												Hello, guys!I really can't even how good this game is. I've played CW2 before, so I didn't hesitate to buy this game as soon as I've noticed it.What is CW all about? It's an interesting strategy, where you don't fight against enemy units similar to yours, but massive amounts of creeping blue goo. So it feels a little bit like tower defence, but really innovative one.The in-game economy system is quite simmilar to one from Supreme Commander (which I loved too!) and it's based more on flow of the resources than stockpiling them. This approach forces costant action, which is nice.So, does concept still feels to You boring? Fear not, as so far every single map is quite diverse and suprises me with something new (I've completed about 30% of game, and CW2 which was quite brilliant too!). Your enemy sometimes spawns various units too, and the goo doesn't always act like it's expected to. The game has its own plot, which is not that plain. There are no cosmic civilisations fighting against each other. There's no war, humanity lost against creeper long ago. You've been asleep for 5 billion years. All you can do is crawling through ruins of ceased race of humans, and try to make sense of what happened. Why do I even mention history in such simple game? Honestly, because at this point I am simply curious how will this story end.The only 2 downsides I've noticed are:-crappy, plain graphics. I don't think it matters though, as this simpleness comes in one package with perfect gameplay and practical interface.-lack of multiplayer. Seriously, guys, I don't care, add it somehow!What do I say at the end? Mabye I'll describe my general feel about it. This game feels like the best flash game ever, but with large campagin and saving and stuff. Buy it. Do it. I don't think anyone would regret doing it, except if it makes him fail his exams or sth.

												Creeper world 3 is an exciting, TD/RTS game.  Although the concept is simple (destroy a blue, water like substance, 'Creeper') the story is well designed with a big twist towards the end of the campaign. The aim of the game is to build towers to defeat the creeper and destroy the creeper emitters. You unlock these towers by finding them on different planets, as you fly around space. Hundreds more levels were created for you to play after the campaign, some taking hours to complete. You can even create your own missions, or play other peoples creations, meaning you will never run out of content.Creeper world 3 can be a bit slow at times, so you may not enjoy the game as much as some people. But I certainly think it is worth the £10.99.(Don't be discouraged by my small amount of time played, most of my time played is on another profile)			"

												I had the chance to play the first Creeper World back in those good ol flash days. I was profundly impressed by the concept, fluid defense! I got quite hooked for a while, and then there came the following games and expantions, i often wonder where did this guy get all those great ideas for map creation. Then, a few days back, i saw this on steam, i didnt even saw the presentation, went straight into ""take my money"" mode. Now im scared, this game is HUGE, many new things have been implemented and a wide array of old stuff is in the game, for those new to creeper world, my advice is: have patience. The game has a long chain of ""tutorial"" missions (not a handholder, the missions are actually fun) Once you get into the game itself, things start getting interesting, and you really start strugglin with the choices you have, power management becomes a real issue, air raids become a fear, and the tides keep rising, ever flowing, overflowing!!! Just play the game guys, if you are not sure, look for the flash games of creeper world, if you like tower defense in general, this will revolutionize your perspective.			"

												First off, play the preview/demo if you haven't already.  It gives you a very accurate feel for how the full game plays (minus some of the story bits).  If you enjoy that then you will love this game.I gladly spend hours and hours on this game; sometimes spending over an hour on one map.  Aside from basic landscape changes there really is a lot of variety in how the creeper will advance across the map, which truly requires a new strategy for each map.  I also find the difficulty level good as well.  There's also a random level generator, which may not provide the same challenge as the planned maps, but it still gives unlimited replayability.Other than maybe the tedious dialog of the story missions I really have nothing bad to say about this game.

												I've been very interested in the Creeper World trilogy for as long as I can possibly remember. I first found a flash game affixed on the engine used in Creeper World 1, Creeper World Training Simulation[www.kongregate.com] on Kongregate, and ever since then I had been searching vigeriously for more Creeper World flash games. Next up was another game created by the engine used for Creeper World 1, Creeper World: Evermore[www.kongregate.com]. Following up on that, I also discovered Creeper World: User Space[www.kongregate.com]. Shortly after, I finally found a flash game affixed to the engine Creeper World 2 was made from, Creeper World 2: Academy[www.kongregate.com]. I had a lot of fun messing around with the anti-creeper there. Eventually, I learned that there was a Creeper World 3 hidden somewhere on the internet, and I looked everywhere for it. Soon, after visiting Knuckle Cracker's website[knucklecracker.com], I learned that Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal had been Greenlit on STEAM. I rushed to get a STEAM Card from Gamestop, and IMMEDIATELY bought Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal without even a second thought. When I started playing, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Not for one second, not for my mom, not for my dad, not for my brother, not even to marvel at my chihuahua when he was rolling over in my room behind me, trying to get my attention. I could not stop for anyone. The story is amazingly well put together, and innovation and the quick thinking strategy it forces you to endorse while playing is absolutely indescribably amazing. I couldn't stop playing No matter how angry I got, or how far I progressed only to have the creeper destroy everything I have built and worked so hard for, I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING!! .... I'm sorry, if I keep this up, I'll be ranting on about how awesome this game is for days.			"

												Simple game, really. The only difference in levels are the levels themselves; using the same tatics will get you through most of the game. Yes it is repetitive and yes it isn't graphically next gen, but it is incredibly addictive. If you wish to pass the time and have some money to throw around (or get it at $5 during a sale) then I recommend this game.			"

												I found that most levels you won or lost within the first couple of minutes.  If you were able to build a base that could survive the initial contact with the creep then you would 'eventually' win the level.  Dispite this simplicity, I found it to be an enjoyable game that I would recommend to anyone.			"

												Pretty much the greatest part of the Creeper World franchise. In this game, you have to build a network of structures on different worlds you come across and complete the objectives in each level. You enemy is a blob with liquid physics that flows across the land and obliterates everything it comes into contact with. The story is decent, the levels are excellent, the concept is very original and quite frankly, this is just an excellent game. Hundreds of hours of gameplay here, I would absolutely recommend it!

												This is one of the best tower defence type of games I have played. Your enemy is creep, which is some sort of fluid. Levels have emitters that spawn creep and you need to build walls, shields and guns to keep your base safe. Eventually you need to destroy emitters to win the levels or collect story mode items. Highly addictive game, with tons of user made levels and random map generator. Overall very big surprise for me, unique creep really makes the game fun to play.Iso recommends!			"

												Try the online versions of this game. This is a nice strategy game mostly build on suply lines to me. This is a good price for this game, it has a ok story that you have to read though and can be very difficult. This also suports creating your own maps and downloding tons of other peoples map with simple mulitplayer to see who can finish it the fastest. Do try the free games online and see if you want to support them by buying this game. This does not add that much but it does give you a full big game instead of going online website. However the inteface scale is kinda small and not a lot of mouse overs for the units and some controls could be better. This game makes up for it by having a great window mode and can easly play while doing other things. Overall this game to me is worth the price and is one of my favorite online website games and now I can run it easier and have so much more content.			"

												If you're a fan of tower defence games then I highly recommend you try this, especially if you're looking for something different.Gameplay: 8/10Visuals: 5/10Story: TL;DR/10The gameplay is an excellent take on the tower defence genre. Your enemy flows like water over the mountains and vallies of the terrain as you fight them back and shape the terrain to keep them out and direct the flow as you pierce forward to destroy their source. Gameplay is kept interesting through unique gameplay elements on specific maps (Such as a map with an orbiting planet past the borders that attracts the tide of enemies towards it as it spins) and a decent array of towers which offer multiple ways to complete any challenge.The visuals are what let this game down and make it feel like someone's first tower defence game made in flash, at first glance. Pixel art while low resolution can be hard to master, having the visuals of a game like FTL would make this game look incredible.Gameplay tips:Terps can be toggled between shaping layers or the closest blockSprayers can be set to ""always on"", I suggest flooding your base with AC and letting it overflow to expand your bordersDon't be afraid to pause and plan with TAB or PSet up a few Berthas and aim them at spawn points, with enough you will slowly drain the map			"

												This is 3rd in the Creeper series and it shows; headline feature from previous entries now casually sit in your tool box, and years of polish and good UI choices run through the experience.This is the Creeper series at it's very best,The core game is a pseudo tower-defense game, where the enemy ""creeper"" is modeled on thermodynamic movement (enemy propagates through the level like heat through a medium), and your personal infrastructure in modeled on packet switching.The benefit of this is a game that's a very unique variant on the genre, and visually is wholly singular. Packets zip about your network as they beat back the horrors of living entropy!Worth highlighting is the story; minimalist in a very impressive way. A few text back-and-forths at the start of a level are all you get, but they deliver fully on the feeling and weight of being trapped at the end of a dead universe; alone in the empty infinity but for your sole friend.It would be nice if production values were a little higher. Sprites could be better; and the music though good, does get repetitive with it's few songs. Though the core experience is never deeply hurt by these weak points.The game's single biggest flaw is in it's dynamics. If you survive the first few minutes of a fight it becomes a rather rote process of slowly expanding your territory, until 30-60 min later you've zapped the last enemy. There are frequent small decisions to make, but very few large ones. Despite the narrative weight of the-end-of-all-things and the cool high-energy packet switching & blasting of your little empire, the game ultimately feels like a casual experience. Mellowly click away, pruning your little bonsai death machine until you've won. A fine experience, but RTS and 4x fans will be yearning for more difficulty and substance.Though some will wish it had more challenge, ""Arc Eternal"" is still an excellent little game! (And it's probably cheep by the time you read this.) Its uniqueness makes it well worth your time and money!			"

Because of this game Steam is convinced that I like Tower Defence games...I don't, I just like Creeper World series, that's it.In Creeper World games, you set up energy collection grid and use collected energy to beat back titular creeper, the blue, oozing fluid whose behaviour (according to extras from CW1) is described by modified heat transfer equations. Every building and weapon costs energy to build, and most cost energy to maintain, forcing you to constantly expand to new areas to build new collectors/reactors to beat creeper back by few tiles more until you can escape (CW1) or kill it for good (CW2/CW3)That's it. But the way Creeper interacts with shape of the map means that there's a lot of strategy involved: where do you set up a defence? Can you cover the valley with collectors AND fortify it before creeper floods it? Do you go for tight grid of expensive but efficient and easily defensible reactors or for wide and redundant but hard to defend net of collectors? What combination of weapons will you use? How many blasters? Mortars? Sprayers? Maybe use Bombers, Strafers and Cargo planes to open another front on top of the hill instead of fighting uphill? How do you handle valley and mountain ranges?Not to mention player-made maps of all sorts, including puzzles, ""play as creepers"" and tricky maps with lots of unexpected scripting.Bonus highlight of the game is CRPL = Creeper Reverse Polish Language, a built-in scripting language giving map creators total control, even roguelike maps can be made.I wholeheartedly recommend entire series, available from creator's page.

												Reminds me a lot of a game I used to play back in the day called 'Colors of War.'  On the off chance that you have any idea what that game is, and enjoyed it... Then get this game. For the majority of you that never played it, the concept was about trying to paint the map in your color using bizarre means, all while fighting off the enemy colors and trying to retain the grounds you gained, in real time. Arc Eternal builds on that same concept.There is an enjoyable trance this game seems to lull me into. It feels like a familiar formula, but plays out in a nuanced and original fashion.15 bucks is a pretty steep price for what it is imo, so I would snag it on a sale. I'd drop a 5 dollar bill on it any day though.			"

												A seemingly simple, easy to pick up RTS with mechanics that afford incredible depth. Reminiscent of Total Annihilation (intentionally so, given the inclusion of the signature bertha cannon) and the under appreciated gem perimeter. There is a great amount of value here for a game of this type. Each level in the campaign introduces a new unit or a new mechanic or just has some kind of unique property to make it interesting which is really the key to any decent RTS campaign. After you 'finish' the main story there is a bounty of user designed maps, wacky beta tester maps and 2 'sectors' of conventional maps with a specific goal in mind, not to mention the ability to design your own maps. Not only is the replay potential limitless it's also really good content in its own right, some of the use made maps are really fun and if you beat it in the fastest time you get to 'claim' it as your own.If you're into oldschool RTS like red alert 2, starcraft or the aforementioned TA this the ultimate indie game, you wont get a better experience for your money.  I honestly can't believe this was developped by one guy given the amount of content squeezed in and the elegance of the design.			"

												Unique and addicting, this tower defense game ranks up there with the very best in its genre.  Instead of fighting off enemies one at a time while they march on a base, this game has players holding back seas of purple slime.  Depth, density, and volume are all significant factors when planning your strategy against the slime emanating from various points on each map.  Where players are usually expected to only defend their base in traditional tower defense games, Creeper World has the added final, and extremely satisfying, goal of pushing through the slime and destroying the source. If that was all there was to this game it could still easily be considered great; its community support through the map editor and its features however, makes it fantastic.  Players can create generated maps according to specified criteria, design maps from scratch themselves, and then upload all of these in-game to be played by the community.  It's one of the most simple and easy to use map editors I've used - I just jumped right in and never even looked at the tutorial.If you like tower defense games, this is one you want for your collection.  And if you don't like tower defense games and you're still reading this review it's probably because your noticing how uniquely awesome this game is and you haven't even played it yet.			"

												Fighting against evil ""water"" instead of units in this tower defens / strategy game hybrid is interesting. The campaign functions as a sort of tutorial and is very well done. New tech on each planet keeps things interesting and the opponent gains more tricks over time as well - it's not the usual increasing numbers, but actual new abilities.			"

												This is the most satisfying single player experience I've had in a long time. Base building has never been this fun. The main story is actually pretty interesting, and after that, there are a ludicrous number of additional maps to play. Visuals are clear, and the music is top notch. Highly recommended!			"

												     This game is insanely addictive. I will be honest with you I just got this game today and I've already played for five hours nonstop. First game I've marathoned the day I aquired it since DF: Masterwork. There is so much content already in the game plus you can create your own maps and play on maps created by others! The brain twisting resource management in this game is incredible and the music is pretty good too. Maps can take an hour to complete sometimes but you can save mid-game so it's amazingly flexible. Fending off blue goo is fun, but what if you want red goo? You can even customize the colour of the creep! It's really cool and super fun to play. Not for casual gamers or hardcore shooter fans but if you like strategy games this will take you to a new level of tower defense.			"

												Most fun I've had with an RTS in ages. You don't have to be any good at strategy games to win at this, but it will take a long time to win if you're terrible like me. Less tedious micromanagement, more economy and map control. Most games play like tug-of-war in an attrition style tower defence format. Every win feels satisfying as the AI can't cheat and the levels are well designed.Very addictive and a bargain at full price. Similar to the first Creeper World but better in every way.			"

												This game has a thrilling story with a presentation that I absolutely love in strategy games, and it reminds me in this of one of my favorite RTS games, the first StarCraft. The gradual tech and story progression with each - sometimes long, sometimes difficult - mission, adapting to and overcoming the new challenge, is just very enjoyable for me. Now that I finished the campaign, though, I feel I have only scratched the game's surface. With all the user-created maps, and extra map packs the game provides, I am already returning for more challenges.A criticism I'm reading in the negative reviews is how the game is the same grind all over again. Building up basic macro and defenses, and then progressing with micro as you upgrade your tech. For a game where every map is different, leaving a wide array of viable strategies and tactics to the player, I find this a very bad point. The SupCom-esque resource system, the focus on map control and relentless assault make this game very interesting, and even the initial 'always repeated' steps come in a personal flavor and depend on the map. The graphics may look abstract and weird in the screenshots, but they quickly make sense when playing the game. The terrain layers are also very consistent. And honestly, I found a salvo of Bertha shots' dispersed Creeper very satisfying to watch. There's few things like it.If you're interested, watch some gameplay videos or just wait for a decent sale. I got it at -90% so sales do get decent! There's little room for disappointment at that price, and maybe it will cause you yourself to write a positive review in time.			"

												Unique and addicting, this tower defense game ranks up there with the very best in its genre.  Instead of fighting off enemies one at a time while they march on a base, this game has players holding back seas of purple slime.  Depth, density, and volume are all significant factors when planning your strategy against the slime emanating from various points on each map.  Where players are usually expected to only defend their base in traditional tower defense games, Creeper World has the added final, and extremely satisfying, goal of pushing through the slime and destroying the source. If that was all there was to this game it could still easily be considered great; its community support through the map editor and its features however, makes it fantastic.  Players can create generated maps according to specified criteria, design maps from scratch themselves, and then upload all of these in-game to be played by the community.

												One of the best and most unique indie games I've played.  While on its surface it may only look like a simple tower defense game, it brings an incredibly unique spin to the genre by completely removing the upfront cost for buildings in favor of an energy management system, and by having a fluid enemy.  Endlessly replayable, with hundreds of included maps, and thousands more community-made maps available for download.  And if that's still not enough, it comes with a map editor and a procedural map generator, which allows for essentially limitless possibilities.  Don't worry if you've never played Creeper World 1 or 2, the early missions have a tutorial, which walks you through the possible uses for each building.			"

												I remember playing the first Creeper World when it was just a flash game, good times. But huge huge improvments. This game is all I can ask for from the dev of this game. The art is well done, controls, sounds, alot of stuff. Not to forget to menton that there is 100s of hours of content for this game like story, level editor, free mode, all sorts of game modes! I did not think twice buying this.My rating overall is 9.5, why -5? Multiplayer would be cool, but I kinda understand how hard it would be, but still perfect singleplayer gameplay is enough. If you like RTS and a hard stragity based game, this might be just for you! (Later in the game it gets insane almost) Phew that map Farbor you will never forget about it, I almost gave up and it was only like level 10 out of ..50.. or something! And that's not even going to be the ending you can play unlimited of custom maps that people made and such! The community is awesome to.If you get this game get ready to be addicted for awhile, I suddenly got out of orbit of the addiction somehow.NOTE!: If you are thinking of getting this game but you don't know then go to Knuckle Cracker looking for Creeper World Evermore (it's free) if you don't like that very much you might wanna keep your money in your wallet.

												I've always had a thing for RTS and Tower Defense games, and so when I first found Creeper World on Kongregate, I was overjoyed. There were many different versions available freely there. Recently, I decided to purchase the third installment to see how it was.There is much to love about this game. The game follows more or less the same rules throughout, but the final two story missions are definite game changers. I've seen many complain about losing on the second to last mission due to time constraints - I myself lost the first time around, but with a little advice I figured out how to beat it. The consistency of the gameplay can make things a little drab if you play too much, but if you enjoy one level, you're likely to enjoy a whole lot more - and there are a whole lot more. There's an practically endless array of levels once you beat most of the story. You can binge play or play a game every once in a while - either way, it will take you a long time to run out of official maps, and you'll never run out of custom ones. The game isn't all too challenging if you remember to pause frequently and keep tabs on the Creeper and your resources, but there are more difficult levels available if that's what you're looking for. The graphics are solid - nothing incredible, but well-done nonetheless.			"

												A seemingly simple, easy to pick up RTS with mechanics that afford incredible depth. Reminiscent of Total Annihilation (intentionally so, given the inclusion of the signature bertha cannon) and the under appreciated gem perimeter. There is a great amount of value here for a game of this type. Each level in the campaign introduces a new unit or a new mechanic or just has some kind of unique property to make it interesting which is really the key to any decent RTS campaign. After you 'finish' the main story there is a bounty of user designed maps, wacky beta tester maps and 2 'sectors' of conventional maps with a specific goal in mind, not to mention the ability to design your own maps. Not only is the replay potential limitless it's also really good content in its own right, some of the use made maps are really fun and if you beat it in the fastest time you get to 'claim' it as your own.If you're into oldschool RTS like red alert 2, starcraft or the aforementioned TA this the ultimate indie game, you wont get a better experience for your money.  I honestly can't believe this was developped by one guy given the amount of content squeezed in and the elegance of the design.			"

												I love Tower Defense. I played Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2 almost only for the Tower Defense maps. Its pretty much my favorite type of games after platformers and RPG.I say this so that you understand that when I say this is the best Tower Defense game I have ever played, it means a lot. The concept of the Creeper is just so unique and honestly really creepy and for the first time in a Tower Defense, none of my tower felt useless or overpowered. And right now, I'm 13 hours into the game and I dont think I have even done a third of the game yet. If you like Tower defense games, there is no reason to not get this game, especially for this price.			"

												This is the most addictive tower defense mechanic I have ever found. My only criticism would be that the custom maps are a bit limited in size, but then I understand the need to keep performance stable on older platforms. Especially when using UNITY 3D with C#. I know its an impossible hope, but if this game were expanded in scope, via a DLC, proper expansion, or even stand alone (+ additions) I would be more than willing to pay again for it. If you are in any way interested in the evolution of tower defense mechanics, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.			"

												SUMMARY: A unique and interesting RTS/tower defense sci-figame. You use nodes to create webs which energy then passes through to power your weapons/defenses and beat back the ever-encroaching purple creeper ""mist"". Its addictive and you will have the temptation to go ""one more level"" everyime you think you're going to quit. The graphics and sound are adequate, but not great, But who plays these games for the graphics? If you are an RTS/TD fan, this game is defintely one to pick up even at full price. It's tiny bit pricy at full price for those who arent die-hard fans of RTS/TD games, but if you see it on sale, get it!MAIN:This game is fascinating. Its a really unique RTS/tower defense, the style of which vaguely reminds me of the Zerg in the original Starcraft. But there are no barracks for units, no movable parts. No vespene gas.You have awoken in space after a 5-billion(!?) year stasis sleep, to find that the Creeper has again rampaged around destroying humanity's galactic empire. Of course, you must stop them. Its kind of difficult to explain how this game works without seeing it, but I'll do my best:The Creepers have emitters which slowly start filling the map with purple stuff. If this purple stuff touches one of your buildings it is destroyed. You need to destroy all the emitters to progress. Sometimes there are other objectives as well.So you build a command center far away from the emitters. Then you start building nodes and weapons such as cannons. Each node creates lines to the nodes next to it, and power flows through these lines from the command center to your weapons/cannons as well as newly placed buildings to construct them. Cannons cant link to each other, but only to nodes and relay nodes. So you want to build as many nodes to create a web, then a front line of weapons to hold off the onslaught, slowly building more relay nodes and weapons as you manage to beat back the ""purple mist"". The nodes also generate energy, which you need to power your cannons and build things quickly. Build too fast, and your energy goes out of balance, weakening the ammo resupply to your cannons and allowing the evil purple stuff to overrun them.There are also specialty nodes, such as relays which speed up energy transmission to new nodes and weapons, reactors, which provide lots of energy, special weapons, and many others I havent seen yet.Theres a lot of strategy, figuring out the best place to put your nodes to create fast transmission of power as well as beat back the purple mist, but not overbuilding so you end up overrun. Missions are timed, although as of yet I havent seen any where you ""must beat the mission in (x) amount of time"", but I wouldnt be surprised if they were out there (I hate those types of missions...I'm naturally a careful player who tries to do/see everything in any game I play. I HATE being rushed.). The fun of being timed is a global leaderboard where you can see rankings of how fast people have beat the missions.The graphics are nothing to write home about, just little representations of the terrain, units, your node web, claimed territories, ect. But who cares? The strategy is what matters here, and I'll take gameplay over graphics any day of the year.Sound is the same as graphics. Its ok, but nothing spectacular. Lots of pew pew and booms.Overall, this is a unique and interesting game. There appear to be many many levels to play as well as a storyline. Its really fun, and if you see it on sale is a must buy for any RTS/tower defense fan.			"

												Worth every single penny. This is one of those games that has so much content in it that I wouldn't hesitate to buy it at full price. I have played this game for over a year now and my only regret is not buying it sooner. There are literally thousands of hours of content in this game and tens of thousands of user maps and procedurally generated maps as well as several hundred maps just in the story mode and arcade mode. As a plus, the story is one of the most compelling and original that I have encountered in the genre. A must buy for any strategy afficionado.			"

												Wait for it to go on sale unless you absollutely feel you will like this game. For those who love tower defense and strategy games in general you will love this game, even though it is rather short. The main bad thing is the difficulty curve that starts out very easy for the first fourth and gradually increases until around two thirds of the way through where it shoots up extremely. Graphics are very simple but acceptable and the soundtrack is very good, though extremely limited. For anyone who isn't sure i would play the flash game version thats about seven levels long on sights like kongretate and armor games before making your decision.			"

												A good game, but with issues in its ""packaging"".I knew the series from the previous Flash chapters. The developer did a good job adding enough elements to this episode to keep the gameplay interesting throughout the campaign.It's an interesting strategy game, where you know how the enemy will behave from the start (since it follows fluid physics) and yet every map requires you to think about how to approach it with the land provided and the techs unlocked. The gameplay is solid, it is decently challenging for a first walkthrough (yet nothing a player with any experience in the genre will not be able to tackle) and offers a chance for speedrunning/score attack replays of existing maps. Apart from the campaign (which took me somewhere between 8 and 10 hours at a leisurly pace), the game has a couple extra modes with different objectives, for even more longevity.The problems I have with the game are mostly outside of the gameplay itself. The game asks for a relatively high price tag for a series evolved from a Flash game, but does it add enough to make it reasonable? In my eyes, it doesn't.The storyline is ridiculous, it pretty much revolves for the entire campaign around the idea of ""I lost my memory, what's all of this?"". You could skip every dialogue in the game and not miss anything relevant. The only campaign progression is the gradual introduction of more buildings and techs.Which leads to the second point: after you unlock everything and you figure out which approach works best for you, most of the extra modes are more of the same. Which is good if you want to play more on different maps, but it lacks the tailored scenarios of the campaign. Still, it's good to come back from time to time for a map or two and have a large selection of unexplored locations.The graphics haven't improved in a relevant way compared to the Flash chapters. The soundtrack is very limited and you will get bored of the few track really fast.All things considered it's still a game I'd pick up, but at a sensible discount, since it's reasonably fun to play for a while but lacks the added value to justify the price point.

Creeper World 3 is quite a unique game, it feels like a tower defense game mixed with real-time-strategy elements.Like in most other RTS games, you have to build a base, though here it is more like a 'power grid', which is essential to power all your defensive and offensive structures. The main difference here though, is the enemy. Instead of tanks, humans or monsters, you have a lava like liquid, that slowly creeps its way to your base and tries to 'fill' the entire map.It's called 'The Creeper'. I know, it sounds like the name of a cheap 60s horror movie, but it's not.Anyways, most of the time you'll build turrets, mortars, jet fighters and bombers to defend yourself from The Creeper. But usually that's not enough. You also have the option to 'terraform' the environment. That way you can either dig trenches, or, which is a lot more effective, raise the terrain to wall off your base.The whole process is quite a lot of fun, especially when you unlock things like the Bertha, which is a giant cannon, or the Thor, which is a giant spaceship with multiple turrets that rains death from above.The thing I like the most about Creeper World 3 is that you can play whatever way you like. This might be the slow and defensive way, or the fast and offensive way. This is quite important if you care about getting in the top 10 list of each map. These lists are primarily sorted by how much time it took you to complete the map, though to be honest, you'll have a hard time beating the best times, since they're usually around 20 to 30 seconds for each map. This is especially frustrating because I doubt those times are legit most of the time.All in all though, Creeper World 3 features a huge amount of content, which is good if you like getting your money worth. It's also bad if you want to 100% this game, because judging by the amount of levels, it might take you hundreds of hours to do so.There's also the fact that you can make your own maps, and play other players maps right inside the game. This gives Creper World 3 almost infinitive content, though some player created levels might be too easy, or even impossible to beat.Conclusion: Amazing game with an enormous amount of re-playability, easily worth the full price if you're a fan of tower-defense/RTS type of games.

												So, first things first, this game is not the best written and graphically designed, and that probably turns some people off. I am very pleased that I fall outside of that group because it is a terrific game. The basic mechanics are all easy to understand, shooting the creeper makes it decrease in level, creeper moves like a fluid (though I've heard it's simulated more like heat. But for all gameplay purposes you can think of it like a viscous fuid) to fill in gaps, you need to send out packets made from energy to supply turrets, construction and other things. Then as these gameplay elements start to overlap the interactions between them get more complex. I won't go into too much detail but there is a special type of terrain that promotes the creeper to flow along it. This may completely throw what you were doing previously because suddenly you have to be cautious with the fact that it is much harder to clear the creeper.The main draw of the game to me was the resource management system though, which forces you to manage between the space needed to get energy, how much you can afford to defend with that energy, and how you can expand from there. It is very easy to find you've just spent half an hour gradually shifting around units to allow you to push forwards, but all of that time feels engaging.Overall it's a very engaging game and at £12 it's decently priced for the amount of gameplay contained within.

												Have you spent hours of your life on flashplayer tower defense games and wouldn't go back and change a second? Then this is the game for you. This game... has an enourmous ammount of worlds for you to conquer and will have you playing for many hours. Pros:  Game runs well even on slower computers. Well balanced difficult game.Has all the feelings of a good flashplayer tower defense. Cons:Few towers (really for the number of worlds you can conquer you have 3 types of ""Towers"").No upgrades for towers.""research"" Is very limited.Online scores mean absolutely nothing because people can cheat and all the highest scores are completed in 0:00:00 seconds. (They beat the level before they even start) Catch this game on sell and you will get your moneys worth out of it if you like playing Tower Defenses. DO not get this game if you want to compete with high scores or are looking for a more complex/strategy based tower defense.  "

												Creeper World combines strategy, resource management, and meditation.Ok, technically you can just crank up the speed to remove some of the meditative aspects, but usually on those levels I'm too busy micromanaging my energy flow moment by moment to do that.If you've played the other Creeper World titles you'll already be familiar with the franchise approach - the enemy is simply evil water, and you're equipped with a variety of anti-water weaponry that costs energy to use, while you seek to reach and destroy the faucets that spawn your dire nemesis.With a reasonable single player campaign and a huge quantity of additional levels, there's plenty to keep you busy.  Level quality can vary a great deal, with some really clever ones, and some that are truly just boring, with little to warn you which will be which. Even so, if you enjoy this sort of challenge, you'll find you have a lot of quiet moments of personal accomplishment where you puzzle out some elaborate resource management or timing issue.  The game has a lot of depth, and even once you've polished off the campaign, there is loads more playtime to be had.Overall, good stuff.  If you enjoy strategic puzzles and resource management then this is an easy buy.			"

												Throughout the storyline, this game is good. Then you get to the alpha sector. Dumb levels put is there just to be annoying. They spam you with everything possible.

												I used to play this ditty on Kongregate! KnuckleCracker still knows how to impress.You've watched the gameplay, you get the concept - you're fighting a blob; storyline irrelevent. Figure out where to land your HQ and lay out some power infrastructure. Get to the point you can build two power structures at once, build a few sets of two. Construct a laser and mortar, click ""stop resupply"" and when they're built - figure out which one you need first - click ""disarm"" and then ""resupply"" and then do the same for the second weapon. Construct a third weapon, your choice, I prefer mortars over lasers 4/1 so I'd make two mortars.The trick with mortars and your power supply is, they recharge faster than they fire. So you can pinch off their supply, use it to construct and power other buildings, and stop them - then resupply the mortars more quickly than over-loading your entire power supply would. By playing ""half-court"" with the power supply, I have been able to greatly improve my speed. Some levels that I've thought were impossible, I've re-visited and been able to beat; some are still impossible.Some cheats must exist because of high scores. High scores mean nothing though. You play, you win and lose, you have fun, you get frustrated, you leave, you come back and figure out a new layout or move on. It's a good game. I play it often - I mute the music and watch TV on an adjacent screen though. Too much of the music will kill your brain like bathsalts.			"

												I never played the first two Creeper World games. I didn’t even know Creeper World was a thing, it flew so far below my radar. The third came highly recommended to me by someone and it was on sale, so I figured why not. Trying new things is part of the fun of gaming. Thankfully, you don’t need to have played either of the previous games to enjoy Creeper World 3, as it has a mostly self-contained plot.There’s no getting around it: the game looks ugly. The graphics are utterly functional, and that’s it. But this ugly duckling has a supernova of elegant swans that explode from its superdense core the moment you start playing. Arc Eternal follows a well-written science-fiction plot as you fight an enigmatic foe known only as “Creeper”.You can place turrets, mortar launchers, build bombers, cannons, and terraform the terrain to redirect the Creeper’s endless flow, provided you have the resource generating capacity to sustain it all. By the end of a mission, the sheer scope of your network of energy-producing Collectors can be impressive.The campaign is lengthily with many unique map elements. There’s a huge amount of side-missions and bonus content if you’re up for it, and the Dial-a-Map Device can generate infinite random missions.  Creeper World 3 is impressive where it truly counts.

												Contrary to ""overwhelmingly positive"" status, i am going to give the game a downvote.Everything that is written in positive reviews is true, except for one thing:Unless you are looking for some kind of self employed challenge (win before certain time limit for example), every single map (with exceptions where it is not possible by design) is winnable with:Build reactors, mortars, more reactors, do some upgrades, then more mortars, and more mortars and MORE mortars.And that is is, no challenge, no evolving A.I., no strategy required. Other units are useless and unused - well, again if they are not needed by map design.You have to employ snipers on maps with ""bugs"", anti-air guns where you are being pressed by spores, and planes/berthas on maps made of ""islands"". But that does not change your strategy, it just adds a tiny mix of certain type of gun to the ""build mortars and win"".The only mission i actually had to adjust over time was the last mission of the main story AGAINST Loki. But even then it was just a bigger mix in overwelmingly prevaling ""mortar combat"".So after a certain time the game becomes dull and the only challenge are map conditions where you are forced to do something before you can ""mortar them all"".It is a shame, really. The overall concept is very nice.---- SPOILER ALERT ----And i was able to win last mission as Emperor doing this:Move around not to get hit and destroy the right lower AA gun.Place the ship outside the range of other guns.Set time to 4x (only needed to make things quicker.Press the mouse button that fires the gun (and leave it pressed whichever way you like), so the creep is constantly renewed below the gunshots.8Hrs later (2Hrs on 4x speed) - victory, the map was  completely flooded by the creep :)The only thing interesting about it was to see how the creep and anticreep collide and how the ""fluid physics"" works in game.

												So far i'm loving this game, i picked it up during the steam sales for like 2 bucks but its worth so much more than that. The gameplay is a interesting mix of towerdefence\survival\rts similar to infested planet but controlling structures instead of a moving team, if you enjoyed infested planet i'd highly recommend this. The approaching doom of the creeper goo gives you a survival feeling i haven’t seen many games be able to recreate.While i'm a firm advocate of ""gameplay before graphics"", i can’t help but feel that this game deserves better graphics, not to say that the gameplay is effected, but the gameplay is so nicely polished it would be great to see graphics that match the high level of gameplay, Its ovbious that the creator is probbly more comfortable with programming (I'm sorry if you're not!) which isnt nessisarily a bad thing because the gameplay makes up for it massivly, but the graphics in their current state are kind of plain and the looming doom of the creeper sludge or whatever it is, isn’t quite captured as well in its current opaque single colour state. Regardless I’ve been enjoying the hell out of the gameLastly, i would love to see more types of items to defend with, aside from using the anticreeper goo turrets and the jets, i found the game mostly revolved around the standard turrets and mortars, with some specialty units thrown in that are only situational, they're fun but more variation would be nice. Also the block building thing is overpowered as hell, really needs some sorta finite resorce to stop you from just cheezing it and building a 10 high bridge all the way to the spawners, i'd like to see it cost more or be limited somehow because it makes defending way too easy, maybe combine it with the ore production so it costs a bit more, I’m a bit of a turtle style builder but this gives you way too much control. But yeah buy this game!! "

												After having read the enthusiastic user reviews, i was sure to have a lot of fun with this game.Some hours later, i cant exactly share this view.The games plays always the same: Protect yourself to a degree, where the enemy (brainless creep, which just grows) isnt able to get in your base, then destroy him step by step. I really am missing some personality, some intelligent behavior, like f.e. in Ai War.Dont get me wrong, its not a bad game. But it is not a great game as well, but just another turret offense/defense game, which additionaly suffers under terrible graphics and a bad interface.I seriously cannot recommend it for the price of 15$, regarding what (great) games you get for that amount.Still, if you can live with the terrible presentation, and regarding the playtime you will have with this game, easily a couple of dozens of hours, just to finish the campaign, and after that, dozens of user-made content awaits, i can recommend this game, if you find it on sale...

												It's an okay game. The mechanics are a fun take on the traditional tower defense game, and there are a lot of different buildings available. However, the game turns into a grind fest after you stabilize on a level. The formula is: buy as much econ as you can without dying, then at the last second buy towers to keep yourself alive. Sometimes this is difficult, but I rarely lost levels except for when the layout was something I hadn't seen before (for example, some levels have space between usable areas of land). As long as you don't overbuild, there are almost no scenarios where a previously defended area will get overwhelmed. It would be nice if there was better scaling over time or perhaps momentum mechanics (so if you screw up while expanding it can cause damage to the rest of your structure). I'm probably only 1/3rd of the way through the game, but it's gotten a bit too repetitive to see through. Oh well. Don't recommend unless you're looking for a side game while watching netflix or something.			"

												A very good game, combing the somewhat basic tower defence, with a slightly more complex RTS element, creates the perfect game with loads of replayability, since you can create your own maps, randomly generate one, or just play through the thousnds of included maps. Would be nice to have a mobile version, as it would suit tablets perfectly. but thats not going to happen... :(Overall, a solid 10/10, not seen a single bug having play many hrs, and every map brings a new element to the game.worth monyz.

What I liked: Simple Concept, Challenging Gameplay Good variety in weapon for TD(Tower Defence) Open ended stratergiesWhat You Need to Know: This is a hybrid of a TD and RTS, you use towers and ships, but there are no lanes and level up of  towers Your main enemy is the creep, which is a purple fliud that is like a great wall that is constantly attacking you You do have other things that mix up the the enemy tactics, such as spore towers, difficult spider web bridge things with stunning robot spiders and a few others You can make your own maps with a built in editor, which is easy to use or just use the random generator to quickly play limiteless maps, and even play other peoples maps There is no one way to win the maps, you can play it like you want, not forcing you down one path to beat a mission Your main goal in every mission is to destroy the creep spawners, and other towers, leaving a ring behind for each one that you can use to upgrade whatever turret placed in it.( SUPERCHARGE BABY!!) One of my personal favorite TD/RTS games I played this game alot already before on steam ( So hours played is not my true time) A game that can be as easy as you want or as complicated as you want to make itMy Score:A+Paid $1.50Completed in: 15 hours/b]Games similar:  Infested Planet Supreme Commander AI War: Fleet Command "

												This is a great tower defense styled RTS. Your risk of dying/being overwhelmed is very minor, but the real challenge comes in figuring out how to do the levels in the quickest and most efficient manners, so that you can learn how to conquer and beat the player created maps in Arc Eternal.

												8/10In Creepers your constantly under attack from a constant flow of blue mass, rather than the traditional waves of enemies, it's your task to hold it back while gathering items or force you way into the mass, to blow it all up.creepers is a breath of fresh tower-defense-air, every level present you with an interesting story and exiting challenges, the play style is casual, build your defense and slowly progress towards your goals, this game is really about defense, there's nothing more enjoyable, than slowly progressing into the 'blue' by moving towers, shoot a path, build platforms and repeat, sounds a bit boring?, but it's far from it. Creepers is all game mechanics, something it does very very well, graphics is not worth talking about, like in Prison architecture it does it's job and works flawless, it's not in the way and you quickly forget about it, still i would like to see some improvement here.The campaign offers hours of challenging game-play, if that's not enough for, there are hundreds of levels build by users.so why not 10 of 10, on game-play i'll give it a 9.5, but this is the third game in the series, you would think by now graphics would be on the agenda, especially the interface, which is a big mess, it never went beyond the mockup stage, which is sad, because it sends a signal that ""we just don't care"", they should.there are much more to be said about Creepers, but honestly i'll rather play the game than write about it, so off i go.if you like tower defense games and games like Infested planet, this one is for you, but be warned, it is a time-robber ;).

												I'm enjoying this game, but I really don't like being forced to go through the campaign (which has levels that can become quite tedious).  There's no access to some advertised features until the campaign is finished.Okay - if the campaign is good, let it stand on its own two feet.  Don't use it as a ""job"" the player has to work through in order to get to the features that looked interesting.WHAT THE GAME HAS TO OFFER:This is a subtle balancing act between building up energy and mining operations at the right pace versus building up weaponry.  What I like about this game is the subtlety.  You might be tempted to build a lot of things only to run out of energy and then nothing gets done.There are also interesting fluid dynamics to work with/against.			"

												Excellent strategy game that gives you the tools to beat levels however you can.  There are multiple ways to win every level. It just depends on what you want to try. I'm a huge fan that allows emergent strategies instead of having a cookie cutter strategy that wins everytime.  The game comes with so many different levels, plus the user created content provides amazing replayability.  Get it while it is still on sale! However, it is worth more than it's $14.99 sticker price as well. "

												So far i'm loving this game, i picked it up during the steam sales for like 2 bucks but its worth so much more than that. The gameplay is a interesting mix of towerdefence\survival\rts similar to infested planet but controlling structures instead of a moving team, if you enjoyed infested planet i'd highly recommend this. The approaching doom of the creeper goo gives you a survival feeling i haven’t seen many games be able to recreate.While i'm a firm advocate of ""gameplay before graphics"", i can’t help but feel that this game deserves better graphics, not to say that the gameplay is effected, but the gameplay is so nicely polished it would be great to see graphics that match the high level of gameplay, Its ovbious that the creator is probbly more comfortable with programming (I'm sorry if you're not!) which isnt nessisarily a bad thing because the gameplay makes up for it massivly, but the graphics in their current state are kind of plain and the looming doom of the creeper sludge or whatever it is, isn’t quite captured as well in its current opaque single colour state. Regardless I’ve been enjoying the hell out of the gameLastly, i would love to see more types of items to defend with, aside from using the anticreeper goo turrets and the jets, i found the game mostly revolved around the standard turrets and mortars, with some specialty units thrown in that are only situational, they're fun but more variation would be nice. Also the block building thing is overpowered as hell, really needs some sorta finite resorce to stop you from just cheezing it and building a 10 high bridge all the way to the spawners, i'd like to see it cost more or be limited somehow because it makes defending way too easy, maybe combine it with the ore production so it costs a bit more, I’m a bit of a turtle style builder but this gives you way too much control. But yeah buy this game!! "

I'll be honest I got this game mostly because of its cheap price and it is tagged as an RTS, but this game has really suprised me, I have never played a game quite like this and I will probibly even after completeing the campaign, continue playing this into the new year.

												This game fills the hole in my heart left by Command $ Conquer 4. It's fun, challenging, and has a nigh infinite amount of variables to keep it fresh and interesting, including a random level generator and tens of thousands of player-made levels. The writing in the story campaign is awful, but thankfully you don't need to know any of it and it's all skippable. There are also free demo versions of the game you can find on steam or the internet, so try those out before you buy.			"

If you only have 3 hours left to live there problebly better ways you spend your time if you want a game to draw you in for hours at a time i can hartly recomend this game  "

												Really great game. You can play very fast by utilizing the pause button often, or you can play methodically slow on most missions. Creeper world 3 offers tons of play hours, new content and challenges. The steam achievements for the game are well thought out, with a variety of achievements focused on different aspects of the game, and at different difficulties. The story is brilliant. Unlocking tech gives you an incentive to keep playing, and each mission reveals more of the story so that you can't wait to get to the next planet to discover what comes next. There are even options to finish the story in a different way. Overall this is the best $5.00 I spent on steam, and I love every aspect of the game.			"

												The perfect blend of RTS and Tower Defence. Each level is unique and can be completed in many different ways. The story is more or less interesting, and as you progress - many additional modes open up with hundreds of new levels. There are literally millions of user-created levels, and an editor for you to create your own levels. The graphics aren't in a very good resolution, but that's not a big deal, the general concept is nice and everything is pretty beautiful. You can easily loose dozens of hours on this, it makes you want to come back, even after some time. Definetly recommended, worth every cent!			"

												This is a weird little entry from out of nowhere, but it's pretty fun to play with.At it's core it's a tower defense, but it's got a real bend to it. Instead of fighting discrete units you're battling an all-consuming goo that spreads rapidly across whole planets. As you can imagine, you're going to need quite a bit of firepower and miscellaneous technology to win.A refreshing take on the genre that avoids being the same as its peers enough that it's definitely worth picking up.

To call it a tower defense game does not do it justice. It's more like a C&C/TA game with some TD aspects. Anyway, if you are curious about this game, look at the ratio of postive to negative reviews.			"

												Really neat game, has a decent story.  Unique take on tower defense, you're basically fighting a creeping liquid type monster.  I got about halfway through it and lost interest, the graphics were a little to non-AAA for me I think -- but that's just me.  It was a good value and maybe I'll go back to it someday.			"

												This is a weird little entry from out of nowhere, but it's pretty fun to play with.At it's core it's a tower defense, but it's got a real bend to it. Instead of fighting discrete units you're battling an all-consuming goo that spreads rapidly across whole planets. As you can imagine, you're going to need quite a bit of firepower and miscellaneous technology to win.A refreshing take on the genre that avoids being the same as its peers enough that it's definitely worth picking up.

												Reminds me of an old X11 multiplayer game. This is a addictive game. It loads fast, which I love. It has a great progression, and a storyline which has got me hooked. To call it a tower defense game does not do it justice. It's more like a C&C/TA game with some TD aspects. Anyway, if you are curious about this game, look at the ratio of postive to negative reviews.			"

												An interesting take on sunken/tower defence games. You can get through most of the game by turtiling if thats your style. You slowly get worked into what each unit does and how they work. The campaign is 25 levels long but there are other levels in there such as a huge galaxy of challange maps and some maps made by beta testers as well.			"

I would recommend this game only to hardcore strategy player or very patient one.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by Creeper World 3. I've always been a fan of tower defense style games, and creeper world mixes up the formula a bit, adds a few elements that are almost puzzle-like, and ties the whole package up with a story that I found novel and refreshing. There are no ""lanes"" or marching mindless enemies, but there is a network of towers that will desperately fire a nonstop barrage to hold back the enemy long enough for a careful strike against their resource nodes. You hope. For a faceless enemy, you truly feel like you are facing down an infinite and eternal threat. There was never any hope for survivival in this unforgiving universe, but you will carve out a section of peace in your small quadrant for as long as you are able. For what alternative can there be.AI War is similar, and a little bit better, but I am glad I stubmled upon this all the same.			"

												Having completed the story campaign (20ish missions of 15-40mins each) I found myself more annoyed than pleased.The problem lies in the fact that to once the initial rush of the creeper is stopped (first 5-10 mins of a map) the map is essentially won, and yet after that point 3/4 or more, ones time is simply grinding the rest of the map down.Now this can be said for many games, but they often have some diversity in the opposition or tricks up their sleeves that might turn things around. No so here, the ""water/fluid"" bases enemy is faceless and anonymous, simply a fluid that floods the map as water poured over a surface would. It never does something as such. It is simply there and spreads a poodle, that your job is to clean up.So once the initial rush (catching the falling pitcher of water before it floods your house) is over, you then spend some very real world boring time cleaning up, lots and lots of it.That is not to say it is a bust, It'd actually go for a neutral on it if I could, since it does have its ups too. But in the end I plunged for a thumbs down for the simple reason that games should not be work, but entertainment, this one lacks a middle game and end game on the maps to be the latter instead of the prior.

												I love tower and defense type games especially the ones with high complexity. For all of Creeper World's unique building types, interesting building connections, and neat other ideas -- you're still fighting water. The story tries to turn the ""purple water"" into a menacing all encompassing alien blob, but it doesn't behave like one. Heck, the water moves in a really non-aggressive way like waves lapping at the shore. If you want a game with AI that adpats to your playstyle, look elsewhere.The most stressful time in any given match is the first few minutes when you're building your base up. I've hit restart numerous times because of acting too slow (mostly since I'm watching TV at the same time); however, once you're up and running defeating creeper is not really about strategy or skills, it's more like a waiting game. You'll be slowly grinding out the time of waiting for buildings to construct or moving your buildings around. The only way this game is interesting is that it allows speed players to post their completion times for everyone to see.While I do fawn over pixel art, Creeper World is very dated even for pixel graphics. There are loads more mobile games that look better than this. I will say that the strongest aspect of the aesthetic is the soundtrack. I never felt bored with the music and it gives this emergency type of rock background in the environment. Nontheless I turned it off so I could watch TV and youtube.			"

												tl;dr: I paid 2 euros for it. Got my money's worth but not much more than that.One of the more innovative takes on the tower defense genre, but not without its flaws. There are no waves, just the relentless Creeper that keeps flooding the levels at a more or less steady rate. Meanwhile, the player builds all manner of defenses and the infrastructure to support it. It becomes a tug-of-ware between how much creeper is created and the player's ability to destroy it. Due to this mechanic, the hard part is usually the beginning, the containment of the creeper. Once that's done, the player would begin building more and more weapons to turn the tide in his favor. It gets a bit redundant, but luckily the devs have spiced things up a little with creative level design.But that's just one way of playing the game. The other is to rush everything in minutes and ignore most of the depth the game has to offer. The worst part is that the tactic for rushing is pretty much always the same.Having spent hours defeating single levels with the first method, I feel kind of cheated. I like the base building aspect in games, because it's rewarding to see the tide turn in your favor. But why would you do that if you can negate the tide before it rises up?			"

Creeper World 3 is a great game if you don't mind playing only single-player, which I think is a tough sell for modern day RTS games (or even tower defense, if you wanna classify it in that bin). It is certainly an interesting concept that works and there is alot of game to be had here, complete with online leaderboards to compete with friends/the world for best level-completion times. While I enjoyed my time in Creeper World 3, I don't think I will  ever get my full moneys worth of fun.The goal is to build and power a multitude of units to combat the creep (akin to the creep in StarCraft). The main mechanic is based off of various geographic levels, or topography, where the creep gradually covers the entire surface of the playing map - or you fight it off and kill it at the source. That is the main enemy.Pros:+Really fresh concept that works well+Tons of replayability and truckloads of units to build and strategies to master+Great value for the price - that is if you don't mind playing a single player RTS for hours on end+It is quite funCons:-Leaderboards are not enough for me-Having a relatively non-mobile enemy for every map can get dull (sometimes the creep has projectiles, etc., but in the end it is pretty much all the same)-Interface needs worth, in example it would have been nice to have mouse-over hotkey help, etc.-Graphics feel datedI can understand why this is one of the top rated RTS games on Steam, but and the end of the day, I need a bit more out of an RTS for any kind of sticking power. I think the enemy needs more complexity.			"

												If you want it, you've already got it, beat it and got the T-ShirtFor those of you currently unsure of Knuckle Cracker's newest escapade: A resounding 'meh'.I absolutely suck balls at RTS's, not sure why, I just do. While there is some innovation in Arc Eternal (as with all formulaic games like it), it's mostly the same as before, both a blessing and a curse.While the gameplay is fine, it's how it plays that I don't like. Arc Eternal is constant grindfest through the levels, all the same. Get collectors, build turrets, stabilize, then branch out. It's a slow, slow game out there, and that's going to make it or break it for you. While others may relish in it, I can't. Everything is so painfully slow and repetitive, after the initial hour or so of 'Yes! New creeper world!', it became possibly my worst gaming experience, after possibly the end of HL2: Episode 2 and Deus Ex: Human Revolution.For extra salt in the wound, if you overextend by a ♥♥♥♥ing millimeter, the game cuts your ♥♥♥♥ing hand off, your last 30 mins of work explodes in purple creeper, and I almost screamed with rage. For that price tag? No way, just go play one of the free ones online or something.			"

												I could see myself playing a little bit more, but considering the 2 hour limit in order to get a refund, I'll rather stop now. In order to still somehow write a meaningful review I've read a lot about what others had to say (both good and bad) and watched videos online.The problem for me is simple: Every mission is the same basic concept + you are not fighting against any sort of AI, but against some fluid goo which always spreads, you always stop, and then you grind your way forward to destroy it. It's weirdly enjoying and at the same time surprisingly non-engaging. You could play it while watching a film, especially once you have set up base. I can understand how people sink hours into it, just how some people sink hours into mindless point-and-click games, but I see no strategic depth here.Positive Reviews actually acknowledge that to some degree, and the ones talking about any sort of ""strategic depth"" do a bad job explaining what exactly they mean, while the bad reviews are criticising the same thing, and some of those people have clocked considerably more hours than me.This + looking at videos online has led me to the conclusion that these basic game mechanics don't change, sure there are buildings to unlock, and some tools you have to use in certain situations, but I can't see any possibility of strategic depth with this kind of concept.It would get a good review for 2,49$, maybe for 4,99$ even, I could see myself playing it for a few more hours or sometimes to just waste time, but for 14,99$ I expected more. So get it while on sale, and stop before the 2 hour mark to rethink your investment. It's somewhat enjoyable, but more of a time-waster instead of an engaging game that will make you think.			"

												I was having fun (kinda) until I got to a hard level with a stupid, short time limit. Restarting it several times, losing every time and being stuck because I didn’t reach the level of excellence the author thought was required to play his game is not my idea of fun. Especially when it takes 35 minutes per try. (And no, there is no difficulty setting to make the game easier.)If you want to know more about the game just search for creeper world on the web and try the free Flash versions. I totally recommend them.Edit: to make things clearer: this Farbor level forces upon you a completely different play style than ALL levels of ALL the previous games in the series as well as this one, and it is NOT fun at all. It is also much more difficult than the other levels.It took me almost one year to finally manage to beat Farbor and get to the final level which requires you to go watch a let’s play on youtube to know what the ♥♥♥♥ you must do to win. Stupid, stupid, stupid.Also something I didn’t say originaly is that the dialogue/story in this game is a PAIN. You’re being thrown a completely stupid long story with weird and useless names that make no sense, it’s very hard to follow it, but you HAVE to read it because some important gameplay information is sometimes hidden inside the text. Seriously it sucks. Don’t buy this game.			"

												i don't recomed this because it has no skill and twice every level you get an achievement sure it's hard but in the same way 1000 addition problems are hard it takes a half hour to inch your way around, over all i'd say its worth oh $2.50 or so... don't get me wrong i love tower defense games and the idea of water as the bad guy was neat but it was poorly done. i know its hard to make a game and all but i'm saying is that somewhere it went wrong and no one caught it.

This is entirely player-versus-computer, although there is the option of creating maps and playing maps created by other players to increase replayablility.Overall, it's a suprisingly engaging and polished game coming from an indie developer and lives up to the quality of the other games in the series.

												This is a gem of a strategy game. It's a RTS Tower defense-esque game, this might not sound like a good idea, but it works beautifully. There are two main mechanics that I will address:1. The Creeper. This is your enemy, it's a liquid entity that creeps forward from spawners, slowly covering more and more of the stage. You need to build towers to fight it back, and in turn advance farther along the stage yourself. Creeper would be very difficult to deal with if it didn't obey the laws of physics. Basically, in order for creeper to overflow onto a higher level of terrain, it has to have nowhere else to go on its current level. This leads to some fairly interesting placements, like a very powerful spawner at the bottom of a deep crater. There are plenty of other enemies too, runners and digitalis namely. Runners just run along digitalis and need to be destroyed with sniper towers, they can't directly destroy your towers, but can stun them long enough for creeper to overflow onto them. Digitalis is a kind of grid-like enemy that conducts creeper and prevents towers from being built, trust me, it's more difficult than it sounds.2. The Network. This game has parallels to a tower defense game, but calling it one doesn't do it justice. The biggest conventional differences being: Towers are networked, they have to be connected to your base to function; Towers can be moved freely, even off the network, albeit with limited ammo; towers use energy, constantly.The biggest difference as I stated is the network. You have to build collectors and relays between towers to provide pathways for the ""packets"" of which there are three types, ammo, construction, and totem. This means you can't just build towers in the most strategic spots right away, you have to build out to them, often fighting tooth and nail to get to them. Additionally, these packets cost energy, which is distributed evenly between the active types of packets, energy is obtained through collectors, which collect energy across an area, and reactors. Collectors gain no benefit from overlapping area and should be spread out, they are also one of the main staples in your network of towers. If you get too ambitious with your expansion, you'll enter energy starvation, where packets are produced less efficiently and you run the risk of your blasters running out of ammo and the line being pushed back.Between the campaign mode and the hundreds of other levels in the game + fan made ones, you could get hundreds of hours out of this game (I didn't because I just played creeper world 1 and 2 before it and was done after the campaign). Having played all three games, this is the best. Even at full price, I think you'll get your money's worth, this is a difficult game, you will need to think strategically and act quickly. It's a refreshing change of pace from most RTS and tower defense games in my opinion.			"

												This game is now my favourite time-waster. It's pretty simple: you and your enemy both occupy a small world. Whoever takes control of the world wins. Each world takes about half an hour to conquer, so it is a nice destraction if you have some pastime to spare. The game is balanced, and the number of ojects to build (about 30) makes it enough to keep it interesting.			"

												I have personay put hundreds of hours into the three free flash based games, and I loved them all. I saw this game on steam and had to have it. Much to my delight, It has more content than all the previous games, COMBINED. This is a unique kind of tower defense (TD) game, with a much more organic feeling enemy than 'I just follow these paths regardless of the danger to my health.' That single change from the normal TD lets this game have so much more complex and involved levels. The towers range from simple towers like the blaster and mortar, to more complex ones such as the strafer and the XL cannon you get later in the campaign (Called Thors Hammer, if I recall correctly). You also have to manage your infastructure, otherwise your towers will stop working properly, and you WILL die (or at least lose a lot of ground). I love this game, and I hope you can at least give it a try. While this version has no demo, just look up the other Creeper World games online, those should suffice as a propper demo.			"

YouTube™ Video: Game Spotlight: Creeper World 3 Arc Eternal 

			Views: 977		

			Creeper World 3 is what happens when cellular automata takes over a strategy simulation. Instead of discreet units that attack your base, a fluid-like substance spreads over the terraformable...		

Creeper World 3 Arc Eternal is a fluid time strategy game,that is a game where you can pause and even speed up the time, just like in city builder games.Creeper World 3 focuses heavily on base building. All buldings need to be connected to a resource network and many of the buildings can be moved in a way similar to the Terran buildings in StarCraft. The main enemy is the creeper, which is a fluid flowing out of emitters.This fluid will flow downhill which is usually towards you. You cannot build in creeper and it destroys your buildings if it touches them.The maps have 10 height levels and you can build terraformers to change the terrain gradually. This gives you tons of tactical options. The simplest example would be to build yourself a high wall as protection against the creeper. Beware that creeper levels accumulate and if you do not destroy some, it will flow over your precious walls.You have various guns and mortars in your arsenal to destroy the creeper and you can even deploy your own anti-creeper, but this is just pushing back against the endless flow. To stop new creeper from forming, you need to push towards the emitter and build a special building, the nullifier, and protect it until it powers up enough to destroy the emitter.There are other interesting foes and obstacles, which I will not spoil here. The bread and butter of the enemy is the creeper emitter. Most of the tension for me was usually in the early game, where I needed to stave off the creeper while building my resource economy and it's often about eeking out tiny little advantages until I could stably match the creeper. After that, the aggressive phase starts. There are dozens of interesting story missions with diverse leveldesigns where you need different strategies to win.After beating the story missions, which took me about 30 hours!, you have a sheer endless supply of challenge maps, as well as tons of user generated maps. Though I find that the challenge maps aren't as diverse as the story maps, so once you find your dominant strategy, they tend to play out similarly. Creeper World 3 is also an excellent podcast game, since all relevant information is presented visually.The game gets a clear purchase recommendation from me.You can play the demo version beforehand, you can find that on the developer's website.Creeper World 3 has a crazy high rating of 97% on Steam, which I think is because the Trailer shows you exactly what you can expect from the game.

												If you ever wanted to be immersed in an strategy game/tower defence then creeper world 3 is for you.Altough it's a little weird to start with as soon as you get into the game you will bee just sucked into itn completly.You will want maybe to play for 20 min but you will be wondering after 5 hours what have you been doing all this time.The game is wonderfull and it has some nifty graphics perfect for this hybryd of a game.Now to a little more resume on why you should or should not buy this game based on specific aspects:Pros : -has imense choice in strategy and very variate-confers immersion like few games out there-the soundtrack is just wonderfull i  don't think i will ever get bored of it-the way the game evolves each mission adding 1-2 more elemnts and teaching you how to use them makes for one perfect learning curve up to the point where you know everyhing and want to play custom maps-altough it may look the same the game offers immense diversity based on the maps each requiring a different approach,and you will probably have alot of content especially if you plan on playing custom maps and/or make your ownCons : - yes the actions do feel repetitive at a certain point-you will fiind yourself more then ever using the same strategy if you dont like to experiment which will become dull -it doesn't have the feeling of fulfiness if you spend a small amount of time in it-time consuming (it does eat alot of your time )-(personal issue) when i tried to alt tab it froze my pc and i had to restart everything when i was just finishing a hard level.  That in the context of a super high end computer,so you might see this types of bugs you can avoid them by not trying to  alt tab,move between games etc,but still not really nice to have them.Overall  this game sure packs alot for the money spent on it I advice buying it for every guy that's a fan of strategy games even if you only like tower defence,it won't feel like a tower defence trust me it will feel just perfect.If you enjoy games such as EU IV ,Hoi 3 this also brings an appeal to grand strategy in some sort of way.Remember christmass is coming and there might be just your perfect gift for you or a friend of yours who is in to this types of thing.

												Look, this game is not for everyone but if you like this style of game I feel like this is the gold standard.  Basically you play a series of maps that involve building power generation and defenses to fight off the invading creeper (basically purplish goo) and destroy their spawn points.  Every level more or less follows this model and yet every one feels unique.  The main mode stiches these maps together into a story about the origin and goals of the creeper which I also found light-hearted and entertaining.  I highly recommend it.			"

												I must say this game hides quite well behind apparent dated graphics and, let's be honest, pretty ugly UI. It grows on you however, as a long form strategy game unlike any other I've played before. I also found myself enticed by the story and the imagination therein. Some missions are challenging, but when you get past those hurdles you realise it's fair difficulty, and most of the time it's simply your build order that might need revising for that mission.It's somewhere between Total Annihilation and Starcraft. The only thing that really bothered me was the music.			"

												I always love a good genre-bendre and this one is interesting. Instead of just building towers along a route to mow down enemies, you build movable towers to gradually beat-back the spread of purple goop. You have to manage power and supply lines as well. Quite fun.Graphics aren't stellar but they don't need to be. Som games need to look good and some don't. FPS and other action-oriented games all almost always more fun if they look better. Some games don't benefit much from a visual upgrade.After playing more-recent shooters, it's really hard for me to play through (for example) Dark Forces. One of my favorite games of all time but it's such an eyesore that it's hard to play. CW3 could look as nice as Starcraft 2 but that wouldn't make it a better game; it would just make it a better-looking game.They could maybe charge a few extra dollars if it looked like SC2 but then I'd complain that it wasn't worth the price.Good game, CUSTOMIZABLE CONTROLS, fun (but skippable) story.

												Creeper World 3 is very similar to Creeper World 1. For those who haven't played Creeper World 1:You need to build and defend a little city from a relentless flow of blue goo whose physics behaves like water. You can vaporize it with lasers, blow it up with mortars, hit it with air strikes, and even terraform the landscape to trap it--for a while. The catch is that all of these things require energy, and you've got to find a balance between building up your energy supply while also building up your defenses. If you don't have enough of one or the other, the never-ending flow of creeper will slowly overwhelm your city. It's an excellent strategy game that combines defensive thinking and resource management.For those who have played CW1:This is mostly the same game, but with a story-mode and plenty of new levels. There's also a few new toys to play with, like ways to generate your own ""anti-creeper,"" ways to terraform the terrain, and even ways to fly energy packets to remote areas that are not connected to your network. The creeper also has a few new tricks including ""digitalis"" which spreads faster and is harder to destroy but is limited to pre-defined paths, and ""runners"" which are little mobs that can temporarily disable your structures. I could knock the game for not being more innovative, but I liked CW1 enough that I thoroughly enjoyed having a similar experience again.			"

												This game is awesome!! There is a Campaign, which has a story you probably only understand if you have played the previus games, but the story is just basicly a big tutorial introducing you step by step to every unit and taktik. the graphics are bad for today but it just doesnt matter because you wont have the time looking att the landscape because after the campaign there are hundreds of levels to beat and only a few are easy , also usergenerated content. I wont say anything on how this game works because you should see it in the trailers and gameplays etc. A little note: You can beat nearly every Level in ca.20 minutes, but only if you are realy good. Most of the time it takes 45-100 minutes to beat a single level, so you will need some time.			"

												Playing the series since the first Creeper World and I must tell you that you can't possibly get bored from it. I have played at least 200 hours off-steam and I would do it again. It doesn't matter if you are slow paced or not, this game is bloody addicting. I strongly recomend this game to any RTS fan. Word of warning though, it will sometimes make you hit your cat with a broom out of pure anger, but you will always go back to it after a couple of hours. Do make sure to try out the Colonial Space (user worlds) missions, as there are some of the most challenging maps there are :)If you have been reading this whole thing, including this sentence, BUY THE GAME ALREADY. (seriously, do it)(hell, I can't wait for Game 4 ;) )			"

												This game combines the best of tower defense and real-time strategy games into an immensely enjoyable and challenging experience that any fan of such genres can truly enjoy.You are given the task of creating defenses to repel the Creep. Which is basically a water-like substance that destroys all life. Your towers can shoot and repel the liquid as it gets close, but any lone tower can become swamped and overran by too much creep. So you need to strategize and plan how to best overcome your challenging situation in each mission.The campaign is fantastic, and the story that goes with it is even pretty cool, more than I expected out of a game I originally knew nothing about.If you are unsure of this game, play its predecessors for free, they are browser games, some of which are hosted on the developer's site, Knucklecracker.

												This game has a good campaing(especially if you've played the previous creeper world games in the browser), it's really dificult to think of a similar game, because Creeper World is very unique. And it really is a game that has strategy all over it, and the good thing is that you play the game strategically without even noticing, since it's really hard not to stay completly focused on what your doing and have fun at the same time.The game also has a ton of missions, and i mean a ton, from very easy to holy s***, level editor, the players can create maps and share their missions, so it means hundreds of hours of fun. Some people may find this game a little repetitive, so it's better to look for Creeper world in the browser to ""test"" if you like, if you do than there's way more fun ahead for you here on CW3. I totally recommend.			"

												The best game i have every played (i have about 50 hours in this game out side of steam) 1000000000000000000/10I would recommened it no matter the person even if you hate video games or have never played one yet (but play creeper world 3 abraxis or the demo first so you are familiar with the machanics)The actual review:Story: This game takes place 5 billion years after CR2, that's all the story for now because i don't want to spoil things.Gameplay: Every level except for the 2 systems leading to Prospector and Tormented zone, and the system which has Farbor in it introduces new mechanics. Such as Vapen which gives you your final command node, or Arca which gives you Thor. The gameplay is mainly build weapons to fight off various enemies and advance.The enemies are runners, spores, and the creeper. In addition to this you also have digitalists which can transport creeper over terrain instead of the creeper having to flow over. Many levels will introduce a new mechanic whether it's a permament enmy, a new tech, or a custom enemy, such as Ormos which has no emmiters, but creeper stuck in space and will come down once you land. Also on Ormos you get Terps whichcan terrraform the land. The terrian is in 10 levels. 1 being the lowest and 10 the highest, the previously mentioned digitalists can ignore this boundary and can jump terrain even if the emmiter strengh is at 3 (yes in the main campgain there are emmiters that emits 3 creeper every five seconds). You paint the terrian with whatever level you want it to be and the terps will slowly work on it. This can be sped up by a powerzone. The terps reqiure energy and the area they are terraforming cannot be covered with creeper. The powerzone enhanch all of your units abilities such as being able to make terps work faster and have a longer range or turning the motor into a fast firing, long range beast. The creeper is like CR1 so nothing to say there. However, the runners must be connected to digitalis to spawn and to survive. The runners will come out of runner nests and will stun your units, the best unit to kill them are snipers. The spores are like the ones in CR1 and CR2 they must be killed by beams and will drop a payload of creeper if not destroyed. The AE fields prevent your air units (guppys, bombers, and strafers) from flying over them. Your air units are guppys, bombers, and strafers. Guppys will transport  packets to your units such as AC, energy, or ore. Bombers use AC to spray down AC on an area and are the most powerful air unit. Strafers use energy and are essentually fighters. AC is short for anti-creeper and is gained from ore which comes from ore mines which can only be played on special spots or else you would win every mission too easily. There are 2 AC units, sprayers and bombers. Sprayers will spray AC that automatically fights creeper. It works like the AC from CR2 and it will protect your units if creeper hits them meaning that reactors will be safe if ac is on them. The main units are collecters, relays, reactors, blasters, motars, and nufflifiers. Collecters, will give you some energy and will expand you energy network, place these as far away from each other as possible since the energy production doesn't stack (they collect energy from an area like the ones from CR1). Reactors can be and should be placed in tight packs since they always give .4 energy, that can upgraded in the forge or using power nodes. Blasters have to have a line of sight and fire fast. Motars don't have to have a line of sight. Nuffelers can destory emmiters. The forge can upgrade things such as packet  speed, energy effifency, or weapon range (and yes move speed does apply to guppy's).  This review is getting very long and i covered most of the things i wanted to covers so now onto bugs.If you bugs in this game record a video, upload it to youtube, and send me the link.Oh and this game has maybe 30 story levels, 30-100 alpha levels (levels that were made in the alpha) a random generator, close to a thousand user-made maps some of which allow you to play as the creeper, and 2 areas with thousands of levels which add a new mechanic in addition to the regular stuff and an extra credits mission which turns it into a third person shooter so maybe 10 or infinity hours of content for you to play until you get bored			"

												A simple yet amazingly versatile concept: Build against goo.In Creeper World 3 you take command of an automated base that gathers energy and ore and uses it to supply a diversity of weapons and utility tools, such as terraforming, to survive an seemingly endless onslaught of an oozy, purple substance called ""Creeper"".Much like the Creeper that some of you know form Starcraft, this slow flood will damage your buildings.In order to obtain, hold or destory a range of objectives, you will have to protect your base by clever build defences, until it provides enough energy to conquer and scrub-free new land. New land means new buildingspace and more energy and the circle repeats till victory.The strong side of this strategy puzzle game is, that the way you expand is totally up to you.Artillery and dropping additional bases is my recommended tactic.It is not an easy game.Players of Starcraft or similar micro/macro skill based RTS games will probably enjoy the level of APM that is needed to hunt the online highscores in this game.Apart from being a challenging and fun strategy and puzzle game, Creeper World also has an own storyline.A space captain and an ancient AI take on a seemingly hopeless battle against an alien race that teleports emitters of Creeper onto every planet which ever existed. As they try to understand the relentless hatred of their alien adversaries, the duo of lone survivors discovers a conspiracy that seems to be encoded into the very fabric of the universe itself.It tends to stretch dialogues to create tention, which works but is a bit exhausting. Also the characters are aggressively unaware of the mysteries that surround them. But perhaps that's just me. "

												The Flash games were amazingly fun to play, and when I bought CW3:AE, I thought it would be nothing more than an expansion of Abraxis Stimulant. I wasn't expecting many new features, and not many more were added, but this was fine. What CW3:AE did add, however, was an incredibly entertaining campaign, a fully fleshed-out map editor, a fascinating overarching story, and an experience that, although relatable to Abraxis Stimulant, felt completely refreshing and fun. If you haven't played the flash games, I certainly reccomend playing those first, and playing those first certainly impacts a player's skills within the game. However, AE did an amazing job of ensuring that all players will be able to enjoy the game, reguardless of experience in the previous games.			"

												Ignore the play time reported by Steam... I bought this game direct from the developer's website and played it for quite a while before activating it on Steam.  Plus, if you consider the first two games and the free versions on Kongregate, I've easily logged a hundred hours or more in the whole series.I'm not a huge fan of tower defense or RTS, but this game combines the two genres in a way that is incredibly fun.  The basic plot is that a ""grey-goo"" type of substance, called the Creeper, has taken over the galaxy, and it's up to you to fight back.  You plop down a Command Node, build a few Collectors to generate energy, and try to keep from being overwhelmed until you can build up enough to go on the offensive.  However, there is enough variation in the game mechanics that each map presents a new challenge and a new puzzle to solve.There is one map (anyone who's played the game long enough will know the one I'm talking about) that really ruins the fun and actually put me off the game for a long while.  Unlike the others where you can take your time and develop whatever strategy you want, this one is a timed mission and a pretty tough one at that.  So consider yourself warned...But otherwise, an absolute joy to play and definitely a strong addition to your library.			"

This game is a huge improvement to the entire series with many more weapons, buildings and even more bases! You will fight your way through many different worlds taking advantage of the terrain and different power-ups found of left by the creeper you have obliterated. You could go in head-first and attempt to destroy the creeper or you could wait until you have the resources for a swift and quick victory. How you play is your choice.			"

												I figured this would be a small game to idle some time on.  Surprisingly, I am terribly engrossed in it!  When I watched the videos, it seemed a bit on the busy side, but I decided to take a chance.  The story 'Arc' has me terribly curious and I hope I haven't figured it out yet, but it is going to cause me to play through until I find out exactly what happened and is happening.  I have found it can be very easy to turtle up and then slowly inch out.  I have only managed once to rapidly pump out some guppies and smack down those nasty creeper spore towers.If you love Tower defense style games, you will certainly enjoy this game.  Pulls you in like Defense Grid did with the story, but is a more free-form playstyle.  I highly recommend.			"

												A simple battle of attrition.  I do wish that Creeper expands faster as each mission goes on, but the story is suprisingly engaging and there's a real challenge in trying to speed run the missions.  There is also plenty of content to enjoy, and plenty of varied units, each with their own pros and cons.  Missions are as easy or hard as you want to make it.  The music is very fitting and fantastic.  The graphics are simple and adequate.  Pick it up if you're a fan of tower defense games and games similar to that genre.			"

												Fantatic game, value for money is out of this world and the more you play the more it 'creeps on you'The gameplay is great, the maps challenging, the music is somewhat repetitive as there is about 3 tracks but you can always switch it off and play your own music.The Story is DUNG, It is absolute dog crap, I cannot stress how bad the story is and how boring it is. You will never feel connected to the characters, You will never give a damn about if the die a horrible death or live on an island paradise. The dialogue is bland, the story is (I repeat again) $hit, it REALLY IS. The game designer could of written, oh my god there is this purple crap from space and I'm a new character who know jack $hit what it is (even though this is the 3rd installment), it would have been better than the garbage storyline and even worse ending these complete AMEUTERS have written... now I've got that off my chest.The Game is great, it's something diffrent in RTS's because you can take your time or really try push and beat your times  without too much pressure (no point in beating world times as EVERY score of the top times have been hacked, another negative, you will never finish the easiest stage in 26 seconds but the hardest stages in the scoreboards have 'apparently' been done in those times )... even though the game has so many mistakes the gameplay is something  you can't miss as a true RTS player.

												One of the most fun and unique RTS/Tower defense games I've ever played. Basically, you're fighting a liquid. This liquid flows from higher elevation to lower elevation (like liquid does). There are emitters that pour this liquid out of them at specific intervals. You have several ways of corraling and destroying this liquid. Destroying thin liquid with laser turrets, deep liquid with mortars, or distant liquid with strafers. Corraling liquid with terraformers to lower or highten the terrain or shields that shove the liquid around. Or, even combinations of the two with anti-liquid that doesn't damage your towers and can destroy the bad liquid.There are several play-modes too. The campaign starts you off with very little unlocked and very easy missions. As it progresses, you unlock more turrets, learning what each does with the missions getting harder and harder. Eventually, you have nearly everything and the missions have reached alarming difficulty, requiring epic strategy to beat, making each mission defeated a great accomplishment and very satisfying.Colonial Space has a huge array of player created maps given ratings for each one with varying difficulties and extreme customization for each level.Alpha Sector is filled with misisons created by alpha testers of the game.Tormented Space and Prospector Zone have maps randomly generated by the engine.This game is all about strategy, and nothing to do with luck. Love it.I may be a little biased though, I've followed this series of games since the first. Creeper World was unique and amazing. Creeper World 2 was... okay, he took some aspects of the first one and made a different type of game that wasn't as well balanced nor built. But Creeper World 3 went back to the original gameplay of the first one, and he added many things to it, balanced it out, and made it a whole lot better.			"

												Review written after 10 hours of play.  Summary, well executed, fun and satisfying game but turn the volume down.  Interesting RTS that doesn't follow the usual formula.  You are fighting against a rising liquid tide and have to plug your defenses then expand outward.  Has a simple yet effective art style that conveys all the information you need.  Playstyle is reminiscent of tower defense but more immediate, at the same time levels can often feel like a puzzle.  This combination means finishing a level is usually very satisfying.  The game does an excellent job of gradually introducing the mechanics and units and the levels where they are introduced do a good job of teaching you how to use them effectively without holding your hand.  The creep behaves intuitively leading to emergent strategies that the game never outright tells you about but make perfect sense, particularly as regards the terraforiming.  You can make walls and trenches to control the flow of the creep, or push back an area then build walls around it to expand into a large pool.  So far the levels have been varied enough that each new level has made me think 'ah interesting, how am I going to deal with this?'    About the only negative I've found is that the sound design.  Weapon sound effects can be very repetitive, especially when you are in the late stages of a level and have many mortars and strafers firing at once.  Also the music while by no means bad is very penetrating and booming and combined with the sound effects can be extremely irritating for other people in the house who aren't playing the game.   Easily sorted by turning the volume down and the games other qualities make this a relatively minor grumble.			"

												Argh...its like crack, I tell you now - stay away!In all seriousness, its very engaging in many ways. To me, it is the logistics of war, abstracted into a fight against the ""grey goo"" of science fiction. You begin by dropping on-planet, setting up energy collectors and ore mines, and trying to stay one step ahead of the goo by running relay lines (think high-voltage lines) to power the various weapon systems you'll need to fight it. Cannons, mortars, sprayers, and other tools are at your disposal. Interestingly, you are able to reposition them as the situation on the ground changes. From there, it is a systematic war of resources and logistics to reach the Emitters that produce the Creeper/Goo. You then build a nullifier which charges up and fires a high-powered beam into the emitter, destroying it.I'll be the first to admit I haven't made it far yet. Two hours in, and several missions in the story mode. I love every useful goodie I find on planets and put to use as I go. I'm sure there are many others out there to find. Icing on the cake to me. It's fun without being overly complex, and very easy to get caught up in the deadly ""just one more turn"" syndrome.For two bucks, hours of fun. Grab it and give it a try...if you dare! *Muahahahah!*			"

												A brilliant take on the tower defence genre which melds RTS and TD perfectly. Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is hideously addictive and great fun.The graphics and art are mediocre at best, but don't let that put you off; if any game proves the 'graphics aren't everything' trope then this is it.The campaign is a touch short, but there is a level editor and the facilities to share your own creations and download other people's. As a result, replayability and longevity are very high.Buy this now, if you like strategy games you won't regret it!			"

												I always love a good genre-bendre and this one is interesting. Instead of just building towers along a route to mow down enemies, you build movable towers to gradually beat-back the spread of purple goop. You have to manage power and supply lines as well. Quite fun.Graphics aren't stellar but they don't need to be. Som games need to look good and some don't. FPS and other action-oriented games all almost always more fun if they look better. Some games don't benefit much from a visual upgrade.After playing more-recent shooters, it's really hard for me to play through (for example) Dark Forces. One of my favorite games of all time but it's such an eyesore that it's hard to play. CW3 could look as nice as Starcraft 2 but that wouldn't make it a better game; it would just make it a better-looking game.They could maybe charge a few extra dollars if it looked like SC2 but then I'd complain that it wasn't worth the price.Good game, CUSTOMIZABLE CONTROLS, fun (but skippable) story.

												Good game. I was quickly hooked on the campaign but then I got to Tormented Space which seemed impossible. I went to the prospector zone and it had many planets that were all too easy until I ran across Molreport which again was impossible. Seems like the planets are either too easy or impossible once you finish the short campaign which ends without a word of explanation. I have only seen a small fraction of the Arc Eternal universe so I don't know if there are going to be more challenging planets. I'm beginning to think that like most games that rely on user created maps, that there is a lot of tedium. You'll have to look hard to find challenging games once you finish the short campaign. There isn't a lot of variety in the buildings. If you zoom in close there isn't anything to see. There isn't much in the way of detailed tool tips. That's too bad because specific information could make a difference. I enjoyed terraforming my way into enemy territory but building shields is faster and less complicated. You just build millions of generators and then shield your way into the deep stuff and rip out the bad things by the roots. Bombers, straffers and guppies are there but they are rather tedious and much less effective. I didn't see people putting up lots of experience nodes to capture that might encourage you to level up your ore and AC carrying capacity in order to launch a big D day type invasion. I would highly recomend this game at the sale price especially if the professional types are going to build a longer campaign that is as delightful as their earlier campaign but this is not up there in quality like Mount and Blade or Kerbal Space Program. If their mission was to show those corporate types that they could do as good a job as any big studio, they didn't succeed. If Stardock is the MacDonalds of gaming then these guys are the Chinese takeout that opened on the corner with the crispy vegetables, delicious sauces and suspiciously slippery meat.			"

												If you ever wanted to be immersed in an strategy game/tower defence then creeper world 3 is for you.Altough it's a little weird to start with as soon as you get into the game you will bee just sucked into itn completly.You will want maybe to play for 20 min but you will be wondering after 5 hours what have you been doing all this time.The game is wonderfull and it has some nifty graphics perfect for this hybryd of a game.Now to a little more resume on why you should or should not buy this game based on specific aspects:Pros : -has imense choice in strategy and very variate-confers immersion like few games out there-the soundtrack is just wonderfull i  don't think i will ever get bored of it-the way the game evolves each mission adding 1-2 more elemnts and teaching you how to use them makes for one perfect learning curve up to the point where you know everyhing and want to play custom maps-altough it may look the same the game offers immense diversity based on the maps each requiring a different approach,and you will probably have alot of content especially if you plan on playing custom maps and/or make your ownCons : - yes the actions do feel repetitive at a certain point-you will fiind yourself more then ever using the same strategy if you dont like to experiment which will become dull -it doesn't have the feeling of fulfiness if you spend a small amount of time in it-time consuming (it does eat alot of your time )-(personal issue) when i tried to alt tab it froze my pc and i had to restart everything when i was just finishing a hard level.  That in the context of a super high end computer,so you might see this types of bugs you can avoid them by not trying to  alt tab,move between games etc,but still not really nice to have them.Overall  this game sure packs alot for the money spent on it I advice buying it for every guy that's a fan of strategy games even if you only like tower defence,it won't feel like a tower defence trust me it will feel just perfect.If you enjoy games such as EU IV ,Hoi 3 this also brings an appeal to grand strategy in some sort of way.Remember christmass is coming and there might be just your perfect gift for you or a friend of yours who is in to this types of thing.

												Really unique and fun strategy game, completely caught me by surprise! It's tagged as tower defence and RTS but it feels very different. Instead it almost feels like a ground combat version of AI Wars, the opponent has very simple and predictable behaviour and you need to slowly chip away at their defences. It feels super rewarding slowly gaining control of an entire map.Also found it very easy to learn :P Seems to have a very smooth learning curve, and save states help a lot too.			"

												This game (and the series itself) is in my top 3 tower defense games ever.  Defenders Quest, Defense Grid and Creeper World.  This game is the most unique form of tower defense of the three however though.  You have no lanes, no creeps to kill.  You have the inexorable press of the liquid enemy pushing against you.  Its a fantastic series of games and each one has its own concept that makes it unique.  The second one is side down instead of your standard top down tower defense.  Im really hoping the rest of these end up on steam too.			"

												I hate to say it but Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal might have ruined me for all other Tower Defense-related games TT_TT The Tower Defense genre has become rigid and formulaic over the years, the core gameplay has become ridiculously arbitrary. CW3 has re-introduced a sense of urgency to the core gameplay of the genre, in a fresh new way. Players of CW3 are only limited by their own creativity; I've barely scratch the surface of the single player campaign and I have already developed my very own unique way of strategizing and dealing with the Creeper.The depth of the core gameplay is intelligently designed and built, and the soundtrack is beautiful and albeit repetive, fits perfectly with the non-stop strategizing action. How will you approach the existential problem that is the Creeper? Stretch far and thin for some quick advantages, or build up a defense to nurture an unrelenting force against the ever-growing blue goop? You decide.5/5 Thumb up and yes, yes, yes.			"

												This game is one of the most enjoyable games i have played in a long time. To beat each level you have to decide where to start, and what to build. the enemy is both fun to play against, and difficult, and is a very well designed enemy overall, after all what could be more terrifying than a force that just keeps coming untill you destory it completely.Anyone who is considering buying this game i highly suggest you do, having beaten the campaign i can tell you there are tons of extra missions, the claim of ""billions"" by the devs does not seem inaccurate so if you enjoy strategy games you can more than get your money's worth.

I get stuck on a level, rage quit, leave it alone for a few weeks, then play it agian becuase I felt drawn to it. If a game does not make you do this; I think its a waste.

That's possibly my biggest gripe, I would have liked to see them innovate a bit more for a standalone game. But I guess if it's not broken, no need to fix it, right?			"

												Creeper World 3:Arc Eternal is a unique game because your enemy is an unstable creeping liquid. The goal of the game is to generally set up towers to defend yourself while advancing upon the creeper to take out the emitters. While this may sound boring, the story and various levels provide a unique blend of strategy and split second decisions. This game is a definite buy for any fan of tower defence games.			"

												What a pleasant surprise with this game.  The campaign is amazing.  While the game mechanics are quite simple, and can easily get boring (seen with the 100s and 100s of extra fun maps to play) the single player route is executed perfectly.  While the story is simple, it's intriging and kept me playing to the end.  Very fun game to play though will admit the replay value is not high.  Once finished you probably won't play again for a very long time.			"

												This game has always been a favorite of mine ever since it appeared for free as a flash game. Even when the game only had 10 levels or so, I still sunk hours into it. Now, after discovering it on Steam, I don't think I'll ever play a different game again. Apart from the shear number of levels, the level design - coupled with all the great new units - is so amazing. Every map is unique and has a different way of approaching it, and even then you're free to progress as you please. I could easily, and have, play 2 or more hours on a single map and barely even notice the time passing. If you love RTS type games, or tower defence, or any kind of strategy game, this game is for you.			"

												At first, the Creeper World series seems like it is nothing more than a Flash/Unity casual game.  Digging into the game a bit deeper shows that this series has more depth and play time than some AAA titles that have been released recently.The Campaign mode is vastly improved over the first 2 iterations of the game, and if the previous 2 games are any indication, the Community will be able to provide ample amounts of entertainment.

												When I first saw this game all I thought was, ""I played this in browser, why should I waste money on a browser game?"" It is NOT like the browser games. It provides many more levels and a continuation of the story that was hinted throughout the browser games. This is 100% worth the buy. I get stuck on a level, rage quit, leave it alone for a few weeks, then play it agian becuase I felt drawn to it. If a game does not make you do this; I think its a waste. This game delivers many levels, new weapons, and a planet hopping thing which I like a lot.			"

												I bought this awhile back after being a big fan of Creeper World 1 & 2, and the developer managed to top himself with CW 3. The game is addicting and has amazing replay value, I love jumping into it to to kill some time with a casual game, and the system requirements aren't too bad.Far and away my favorite feature is the new ""Colonial Space"", which allows you to download User-Created maps. More to the point the game supports custom scripts in mods, which means that dedicated users have been able to add new game mechanics to their custom maps to implement new superweapons, enemies, or even to allow you to play as the creeper! I haven't even finished the campaign, I just endlessly play custom maps. My only complaint is you're required to complete the game's tutorial missions in the campaign before you can play custom maps.As a side note, I originally bought this game when it was standalone, and got a free Steam key when it became available on Steam, so kudos to Knuckle Cracker for that.

												I really enjoy the Creeper series of games. It's tower defense, offense, area control and resource managment all in one. And it isn't always easy, it actually takes some strategy, planning and timing to win some levels.The only negative is that once the tide of battle is flipped you've won but have to mop up which can be a little dull. But that's the last phase of what was most likely a difficult, multi-attempted board.Creeper World 3 is an unbelievable amount of content. I've spent 40 hours in it so far and I've completed the main story, but I havn't scratched the giant universe of levels, or the user submitted levels.			"

On the pictures it doesn't seem that good, but once you play, the graphics make absolute sense. With the graphic style the Devs chose, they have made it very easy to control all of the map.I like the story, even though it is cheese. It does add to the whole experience.So far I had no crash and didn't find any bugs! So the Devs have done a great job in programing.I highly recommend this game to any strategy gamer out there! . . .			"

I really cant fault this game in any way, the maps range from huge to small always different in terrain types and the AI is a meaty challenge but not over powered unless you let them reach it. This is by no way a tower defence game for those of you on the fence the premise is simple build a manic web of power supply hubs to feed power to your base and take care of the objective at hand by any means.Good variety in what you can use.The story it top you get sucked into it.This is one of them games that will never get old hope to see more sequels well worth the asking price.Creeper world 4 will be biblical10/10			"

It might seem that it would get boring quick since the enemie is just a creeping mass of goo, but all the levels in the campaigns are different and the user created content is simply amazing.The only bad thing about this game is that some missions seem impossible, but it just takes a little bit of thinking to figure out the trick to beat it.9/10			"

												Creeper World 3 is a very innovative and original real time strategy game where you fight a mass of liquid known as the creeper. The game requires the player to handle critical situations and establish footholds. You really need to think about your moves and you can pause your game at any time. The games has a classical cult following, with plenty of user made and reviewed content. The supplied single player campaign is also fun. If you want to try something new, I can definitely recommend this game: 80%notes:•	An extremely low budget indie game, so expect according graphics and sound•	for CW 1 & CW2 vets: the game goes back to CW1 overlay and is a complete remake of CW1 with lots of added features. If you didn´t like CW2, you will like CW3 that much more and vice-versa. "

												This is a really great game and its cheap too.This is a rts like game where you build a base and a bunch of ""towers"" that you attack with.  There are no units like tanks or infantry you make, just various units like turrets, mortars, reactors, etc...I didn't find any map, but one challenging, however it was still a fun game to play.  The story is interesting as well.  If the videos look interesting to you, then go ahead and buy it.			"

												Simply one of the best tower defense / real time strategy games there is. A well polished balance meets a quite interesting backstory. There are few elements compared to similar games like Plants vs Zombies, but that is a minor drawback. The game is almost the same as the first in the series, and you don't need to care about the backstory at all, that are the only major downsides to me.			"

												""You Vs the Blob""Creeper World 3 is a delight to play, the various modes and tools make for a great rounded experience.Campaign: The story of the game is discovered piece by piece, each level add little things as you are introduced to new towers, brings variety with occasionally slightly different objectives and few levels feel like you have played this before. Even the wider galaxy maps vary enough to warrant a look through. Each level has it's own leader board, and while most levels are hard to lose, you can be overrun and set back (mostly costing you time) if you don't pay attention to the whole level.Editor: The Editor provided allows for easy placement and adjustment of basic objects. but there is a deeper level if you look into the forums, you'll find out quickly that you can run custom scripts and make your own objects (or just fiddle with what others have made if you lack the programming knowledge)You can also publish your levels with ease and keep an eye on the scores and times that people who play it post.This game is not for everyone, if you love tower defense and Real Time Army management games, you should be able to enjoy this game.

												If you want a challenge that is equivalent to the little Dutch boy plugging a hole in the dike with your finger but with a space age twist, look no further.The challenges are nearly bottomless, whether you are challenging the leaderboards or simply cruizing the in-game galaxies for completion. You can even create your own maps to challenege everyone else.The only problem is that the challenge almost entirely disappears as soon as you fight the creeper to an equilibrium. Yes, the back-pressure will build, but 90% of the time you are built up so much that the pressure never overwhelms.			"

												It is a strategy game that plays differently than any other.  You are not trying to outsmart an opponent, you are trying to survive a literal flood until you can push back.  Sometimes this will take only a little time and sometimes, you will desperately try and get a head for an hour or two and then get in a position where you can win.  Either way, it makes for a fun game to play.			"

												Wow, Creeper World 3 really got me! It is like a mix between tower defense and strategy.A little introduction: You are building towers, which have to be connected to with your base so they can get energy while they get build up. The enemy has points where he spreads his influence over the map and you have to destroy this points. The gameplay evolves level by level, but in a pleasent dimension.It is simple in handling, but it is really demanding in gameplay. I really like it and I recommend it to every tower defense fan! :)			"

												This game has always been a favorite of mine ever since it appeared for free as a flash game. Even when the game only had 10 levels or so, I still sunk hours into it. Now, after discovering it on Steam, I don't think I'll ever play a different game again. Apart from the shear number of levels, the level design - coupled with all the great new units - is so amazing. Every map is unique and has a different way of approaching it, and even then you're free to progress as you please. I could easily, and have, play 2 or more hours on a single map and barely even notice the time passing. If you love RTS type games, or tower defence, or any kind of strategy game, this game is for you.			"

												This game is like a much more relaxed real-time strategy because through most of the campaign your biggest challenge is not reacting quickly but reacting appropriately to the approaching situation or immediate threat. Most of your units are in fact structures, slowly spreading and building up your base across the maps. Once you've finished the campaign, there are tons of extremely difficult challenge maps, some very interesting player-created maps, and more. You definitely won't run out of content, and this game is easy to pick up as well. If you're looking for a RTS that is almost all macro and doesn't require tons of hours to get the hang of, this is a good pick. Doesn't have multiplayer though.			"

												The third game in the fantastic creeper world series. It takes the gameplay of the original, and builds on it; interestingly, it gives you all of your old toys pretty quickly. The anti-creeper from the sequel makes a return, and works quite well. The level design was decent, although there were times when I felt it could've used work, and I rarely found it necessary to use more than one control node, with the exception of the timed missions.The story was the weakest part, having reduced the cast to just two members: Abraxis and his ship's AI. There's some good world building, but I think it could've been greatly expanded upon, and the twist ending was really unexpected, and felt out of place. I'm not fond of stories that retcon their own history. If you want a great story, I'd recommend playing the original, which is still the best in this regard.I was honestly hoping for a longer experience overall, but there is replay value in the form of custom community maps (still haven't tried it yet), as well as a random map generator which need to be unlocked through the campaign. Something I'd love to see is a massive map, spanning several screens in size, with complex terrain and hidden secrets buried around the map; the only time you excavate anything in game is during the last level.On the whole, fans of the genre will enjoy this, just don't expect any literary awards. 8/10.

												I played creeper world 1, 2, and sim a long time ago on Armorgames or Kongregate, can't remember which now...  Either way it doesn't matter, this game is great, imagine a TD game in which you can move your towers, and you must create the most efficient supply lines you can, get upgrades, manage the production and consumption of two different resources, all in real time!  There is however a pause button, which I use often, and it makes the game managable if you like to think out your moves carefully, or if you like turn based games.  The sheer amount of things you need to think about makes this game great, and it's not overwhelming because you are introduced to new features in a logical and smooth buildup, just how a good game should be.  If you think this game might be interesting, look up creeper world 1 2 and sim on the internet, they're all free, and I promise you, this game will sell itself.			"

												Ignore the play time reported by Steam... I bought this game direct from the developer's website and played it for quite a while before activating it on Steam.  Plus, if you consider the first two games and the free versions on Kongregate, I've easily logged a hundred hours or more in the whole series.I'm not a huge fan of tower defense or RTS, but this game combines the two genres in a way that is incredibly fun.  The basic plot is that a ""grey-goo"" type of substance, called the Creeper, has taken over the galaxy, and it's up to you to fight back.  You plop down a Command Node, build a few Collectors to generate energy, and try to keep from being overwhelmed until you can build up enough to go on the offensive.  However, there is enough variation in the game mechanics that each map presents a new challenge and a new puzzle to solve.There is one map (anyone who's played the game long enough will know the one I'm talking about) that really ruins the fun and actually put me off the game for a long while.  Unlike the others where you can take your time and develop whatever strategy you want, this one is a timed mission and a pretty tough one at that.  So consider yourself warned...But otherwise, an absolute joy to play and definitely a strong addition to your library.			"

												If you've played Creeper World before, know that this is an excellent sequel. If you liked it before, you'll love this.If not, then you're also in for a treat! CW is very, very good. People compare it to tower defence, but I usually describe it as a computer network fighting a liquid. The lines you see in the screenshots are the links between your units - if a unit becomes disconnected, it won't get resupplied and will eventually become defenceless. So, keeping supply lines going is incredibly important. The other thing is that your primary enemy is a corrosive purple liquid - it has no AI whatsoever, it just flows following the terrain. (Or sometimes it moves in other ways - the more scripted maps can have it behave in stranger ways.) The third thing is that terrain is everything. Perhaps the best defence in this game is just a really high wall... until the creeper overflows it!This is a game about attacking, not defending however. Pushing forwards, often uphill, can be very tricky because most of your units can't attack upwards, and the creeper naturally flows down on top of you. Then you have to handle beach landings, and spore towers that will dump creeper right in your base, and runners that stun your units, and then all of these at the same time, uphill, with a time limit, along with all kinds of one-off scripted challenges too!Later in the campaign you'll unlock units that can modify the terrain (slowly) and let you build a series of stepping stones above the creeper, or build walls to protect your home, or produce helpful ""anti-creeper"", or send supply ships to bridge between islands, or try to push the creeper away with force fields, or all sorts of other cool things. The fact that it's so freeform lets you find a style that's comfortable. I'm a big fan of terrain fiddling myself.Seriously, this game has so many original ideas, and it's executed really well. Perhaps not the prettiest of games, but it's very clever, and it'll make you feel clever when you finally conquer a map that's taken you hours. I can't recommend it highly enough.			"

												Argh...its like crack, I tell you now - stay away!In all seriousness, its very engaging in many ways. To me, it is the logistics of war, abstracted into a fight against the ""grey goo"" of science fiction. You begin by dropping on-planet, setting up energy collectors and ore mines, and trying to stay one step ahead of the goo by running relay lines (think high-voltage lines) to power the various weapon systems you'll need to fight it. Cannons, mortars, sprayers, and other tools are at your disposal. Interestingly, you are able to reposition them as the situation on the ground changes. From there, it is a systematic war of resources and logistics to reach the Emitters that produce the Creeper/Goo. You then build a nullifier which charges up and fires a high-powered beam into the emitter, destroying it.I'll be the first to admit I haven't made it far yet. Two hours in, and several missions in the story mode. I love every useful goodie I find on planets and put to use as I go. I'm sure there are many others out there to find. Icing on the cake to me. It's fun without being overly complex, and very easy to get caught up in the deadly ""just one more turn"" syndrome.For two bucks, hours of fun. Grab it and give it a try...if you dare! *Muahahahah!*			"

												If you like tower defense games and are not sure about getting this game, try out the free flash versions on other game sites first (though Creeper World 2 has a slightly different style than the rest).  The Creeper World series is quite removed from the usual TD formula, and might be a little off-putting at first.That was my experience at first too.  But once I got a hang of the game...collector placement, understanding creeper dynamics...things took on a whole new level of strategy, and it was FUN!That said, if you're a fan of those games, you'll surely love this.  It has more story, more features than any of its predecessors.  Getting it at a discount is just icing on the cake.			"

												I have been following this game ever since  I found it on kongregate so many years ago, and now, I absolutely love and hate this game for the reasons I did when it all began. The story line is amazing from the start, and if you don't mind F2P games, I recommend checking out the previous versions of this game. This series however has always had one point in which I can not play it anymore, the story line ends! My favorite part of this game was learning the path that everyone had to goto, and seeing it all connect was amazing I am just dissapointed it ended. Wonderful Game!The only pomblem I have had with this game is that after you finish the story and continue onto alpha, and tormented and such; the player made levels, need some way to stop these unbeatable levels. I think that if you create a map, you should be able to complete it before publishing.			"

												This is an awesome and very addicting game that I was fortunate enough to have come across on the flash game website Kongregate.  Once I discovered that there was a full version with hundreds of maps (not including custom user maps) I didn't want to wait for a sale and bought the game immediately.   It's totally worth it in my view.  Visit Kongregate to try out 12 maps, or visit the Knuckle Cracker website for a demo to see if you like it.  I don't know how or if the website demo and the Kongregate version differs from one another.			"

												A simple yet amazingly versatile concept: Build against goo.In Creeper World 3 you take command of an automated base that gathers energy and ore and uses it to supply a diversity of weapons and utility tools, such as terraforming, to survive an seemingly endless onslaught of an oozy, purple substance called ""Creeper"".Much like the Creeper that some of you know form Starcraft, this slow flood will damage your buildings.In order to obtain, hold or destory a range of objectives, you will have to protect your base by clever build defences, until it provides enough energy to conquer and scrub-free new land. New land means new buildingspace and more energy and the circle repeats till victory.The strong side of this strategy puzzle game is, that the way you expand is totally up to you.Artillery and dropping additional bases is my recommended tactic.It is not an easy game.Players of Starcraft or similar micro/macro skill based RTS games will probably enjoy the level of APM that is needed to hunt the online highscores in this game.Apart from being a challenging and fun strategy and puzzle game, Creeper World also has an own storyline.A space captain and an ancient AI take on a seemingly hopeless battle against an alien race that teleports emitters of Creeper onto every planet which ever existed. As they try to understand the relentless hatred of their alien adversaries, the duo of lone survivors discovers a conspiracy that seems to be encoded into the very fabric of the universe itself.It tends to stretch dialogues to create tention, which works but is a bit exhausting. Also the characters are aggressively unaware of the mysteries that surround them. But perhaps that's just me. "

												What is great about this series is that you can see how its experimentation in flash form has helped devellop a great product. This game is very much a mix of CW1's top down, land control based system of energy gathering and CW2's annihilation of creeper based victory. It also adds a great deal of things to make the whole package more attractive : great camera control, a worldload of maps (although many are a bit boring - my advice after finishing the campaign is : play the alpha sector first, it's the most interesting), graphics have been greatly enhanced too. They are still very basic, but much more fluid than in the first one. Animations especially.A great timesink. If you're not sure, there is a demo kicking around.			"

The interface is easy to use and very effective, the maps in the game advance in difficulty to adjust the players progress.Don't be fooled by the simple graphics! On the pictures it doesn't seem that good, but once you play, the graphics make absolute sense. With the graphic style the Devs chose, they have made it very easy to control all of the map.I like the story, even though it is cheese. It does add to the whole experience.So far I had no crash and didn't find any bugs! So the Devs have done a great job in programing.I highly recommend this game to any strategy gamer out there! . . .			"

												I really enjoy the Creeper series of games. It's tower defense, offense, area control and resource managment all in one. And it isn't always easy, it actually takes some strategy, planning and timing to win some levels.The only negative is that once the tide of battle is flipped you've won but have to mop up which can be a little dull. But that's the last phase of what was most likely a difficult, multi-attempted board.Creeper World 3 is an unbelievable amount of content. I've spent 40 hours in it so far and I've completed the main story, but I havn't scratched the giant universe of levels, or the user submitted levels.			"

It feels as though they took a step back in the innovation of the game. I know the second creeper had some mixed reviews, but still a fantastic game nonetheless.

The campaign itself has hours upon hours of gameplay, not to mention the extra level packs and the hundreds upon thousands of fan-made levels. This game is well worth the price. The Creeper World series has always drawn me back again and again and it never disappoints everytime I plant my command center and begin the battle against that awful blue goop.			"

												(Before edit, play time was 150-170 hours)You get one very nice campain.The game has an integrated map editor and you can play the custom maps made by other players.There are also two areas with lots of auto-generated maps, some of them very difficult and few of them impossible.I recomend the campain for those who like tower defense and strategy games.I recomend the extremly difficult maps for those who like to discover alone how to improve and optimize.I have not played yet any of the player made maps, so I can tell little about them. I know that you can use scripts and custom images when you create the maps so possibly the comunity maps might be interesting too. You can rate those too and I seen a thriving comunity there :)Edit:(08-Oct-2015) Play time: 209 hoursI made two maps, a normal map and one with scrips.The programming language used in scrips is based on ""reverse polish notation"" concept: - you put the values into the stack and the operand afterward on top of them- the operand will combine the top elements (these are consumed)- the result is being placed back to the top of the stackThe concept is very different from normal programming languages. They say on the wiki that you do not have to be a programmer to learn this language.I say this is true for any programming language. And after you learn it, you are a programmer. Not an experienced or profesional one, but a programmer nevertheless.Regarding the maps: I made them for myself, as hard as possible. Some people do not like hard maps.I will continue occasionally to make maps inbetween other games.I avoid playing custom maps to avoid being influenced by their ideas.			"

												One of the most fun and unique RTS/Tower defense games I've ever played. Basically, you're fighting a liquid. This liquid flows from higher elevation to lower elevation (like liquid does). There are emitters that pour this liquid out of them at specific intervals. You have several ways of corraling and destroying this liquid. Destroying thin liquid with laser turrets, deep liquid with mortars, or distant liquid with strafers. Corraling liquid with terraformers to lower or highten the terrain or shields that shove the liquid around. Or, even combinations of the two with anti-liquid that doesn't damage your towers and can destroy the bad liquid.There are several play-modes too. The campaign starts you off with very little unlocked and very easy missions. As it progresses, you unlock more turrets, learning what each does with the missions getting harder and harder. Eventually, you have nearly everything and the missions have reached alarming difficulty, requiring epic strategy to beat, making each mission defeated a great accomplishment and very satisfying.Colonial Space has a huge array of player created maps given ratings for each one with varying difficulties and extreme customization for each level.Alpha Sector is filled with misisons created by alpha testers of the game.Tormented Space and Prospector Zone have maps randomly generated by the engine.This game is all about strategy, and nothing to do with luck. Love it.I may be a little biased though, I've followed this series of games since the first. Creeper World was unique and amazing. Creeper World 2 was... okay, he took some aspects of the first one and made a different type of game that wasn't as well balanced nor built. But Creeper World 3 went back to the original gameplay of the first one, and he added many things to it, balanced it out, and made it a whole lot better.			"

												Pretty much the same Perimeter (http://store.steampowered.com/app/289440/) ripoff as the first game.Yet while the only innovations in the first game was liquidity of the Creeper and packets moving through the network itself, this game also introduces Guppies (certainly copied from StarCraft II) and Anti-Creeper (first appeared in the second game of the series).So what's the result of the formula plagiarised and refined? It's totally awesome. "

												If you've played Creeper World before, know that this is an excellent sequel. If you liked it before, you'll love this.If not, then you're also in for a treat! CW is very, very good. People compare it to tower defence, but I usually describe it as a computer network fighting a liquid. The lines you see in the screenshots are the links between your units - if a unit becomes disconnected, it won't get resupplied and will eventually become defenceless. So, keeping supply lines going is incredibly important. The other thing is that your primary enemy is a corrosive purple liquid - it has no AI whatsoever, it just flows following the terrain. (Or sometimes it moves in other ways - the more scripted maps can have it behave in stranger ways.) The third thing is that terrain is everything. Perhaps the best defence in this game is just a really high wall... until the creeper overflows it!This is a game about attacking, not defending however. Pushing forwards, often uphill, can be very tricky because most of your units can't attack upwards, and the creeper naturally flows down on top of you. Then you have to handle beach landings, and spore towers that will dump creeper right in your base, and runners that stun your units, and then all of these at the same time, uphill, with a time limit, along with all kinds of one-off scripted challenges too!Later in the campaign you'll unlock units that can modify the terrain (slowly) and let you build a series of stepping stones above the creeper, or build walls to protect your home, or produce helpful ""anti-creeper"", or send supply ships to bridge between islands, or try to push the creeper away with force fields, or all sorts of other cool things. The fact that it's so freeform lets you find a style that's comfortable. I'm a big fan of terrain fiddling myself.Seriously, this game has so many original ideas, and it's executed really well. Perhaps not the prettiest of games, but it's very clever, and it'll make you feel clever when you finally conquer a map that's taken you hours. I can't recommend it highly enough.			"

												An awesome game for fans of defense, strategy, and single-player RTS games.  Near infinite replayability beyond the campaign levels with extra-hard levels/custom-created maps (the game has its own scripting language that diehard fans are exploring tremendously).Pros:-The liquid-based enemy of the Creeper is totally unique-Satisfying ""combat"" and a real feeling of accomplishment that is visually rewarded when overcoming an obstacle (Your energy grid and supply lines grant amazing visual feedback)-Surprisingly deep decision making for some of the harder maps, but everything is always fair - no cheap shots or surprises-Play at your own pace, pausing to build or plan ahead, and saving/loading whenever you want (You can play a mission slowly and safely and eventually overcome anything, or push yourself to the limit and try to beat them even faster or more efficiently)-Low cost for the amount of replayability offered-Highly customizable - Sound, controls, visibility/colors of elements on the game screenCons:-There's a definite learning curve beyond the main missions that may seem off-putting at first - complexity of units, resources, mechanics, terminology-Fans of defense games with direct player combat/intervention (FPS controls or special abilities) may not like the nearly fully automated weapons/enemy-The art style is a bit simplistic, even if you're a fan of pixel art-y or tiny models, and can cause the visuals to blend together for new players-Some of the sound design can get repetitive, especially when you've got large scale bases and battles			"

												I've been playing this game series for years on flash game websites. This game always manages to entice me to come back to it. It really accomodates a variety of playstyles, from the slow methodical domination strategy, to the clever direct to the goal strategy, from brushing through and taking the point loss to end the map quickly to micromanaging every frame of the game. With the addition of player created maps into the mix it gets even more fun, I've become addicted to the special game modes available in the player created maps specifically one where your role is reversed, this is a great game with simple enough mechanics to learn but the option to find levels that rely on tactics that are hard to master.

												Super fun, casual game. Seeing your nodes spread across the map is very fun, while not so difficult as to be frustrating. The campaign is fun, and the story is interesting without distracting from the gameplay.If you have never played this series before, its an asymetric real time strategy game where you fight the ""creeper"", which flows into the map with a variety of weapons while securing land which you can use to gather energy and power more weapons.

												For any fans of strategy games, Creeper World 3 is really enjoyable. There are flash versions of Creeper World that can serve as a demo if you're not sure about getting this game. This is entirely player-versus-computer, although there is the option of creating maps and playing maps created by other players to increase replayablility.Overall, it's a suprisingly engaging and polished game coming from an indie developer and lives up to the quality of the other games in the series. Definately recommended.			"

												The beautiful successor to Creep World 1, that being CW2 was much different. This game is an RTS pseudo-tower defense game in which you battle pure entropy in liquid form. The creeper is a seeping goo spawned forth from emitters as a tidal wave sort of attack, which has killing countless civilizations before you. The gameplay consists of placing down your command node and building web-networks of energy collecters, ore mines, mortars and blaster turrets that you then use to advance on the creeper, slowly pushing it back and keeping it at bay while you build a nullifier to destroy the emmiter producing it. It's challenging and addictive 11/10			"

												If you ever wanted to be immersed in an strategy game/tower defence then creeper world 3 is for you.Altough it's a little weird to start with as soon as you get into the game you will bee just sucked into itn completly.You will want maybe to play for 20 min but you will be wondering after 5 hours what have you been doing all this time.The game is wonderfull and it has some nifty graphics perfect for this hybryd of a game.Now to a little more resume on why you should or should not buy this game based on specific aspects:Pros : -has imense choice in strategy and very variate-confers immersion like few games out there-the soundtrack is just wonderfull i  don't think i will ever get bored of it-the way the game evolves each mission adding 1-2 more elemnts and teaching you how to use them makes for one perfect learning curve up to the point where you know everyhing and want to play custom maps-altough it may look the same the game offers immense diversity based on the maps each requiring a different approach,and you will probably have alot of content especially if you plan on playing custom maps and/or make your ownCons : - yes the actions do feel repetitive at a certain point-you will fiind yourself more then ever using the same strategy if you dont like to experiment which will become dull -it doesn't have the feeling of fulfiness if you spend a small amount of time in it-time consuming (it does eat alot of your time )-(personal issue) when i tried to alt tab it froze my pc and i had to restart everything when i was just finishing a hard level.  That in the context of a super high end computer,so you might see this types of bugs you can avoid them by not trying to  alt tab,move between games etc,but still not really nice to have them.Overall  this game sure packs alot for the money spent on it I advice buying it for every guy that's a fan of strategy games even if you only like tower defence,it won't feel like a tower defence trust me it will feel just perfect.If you enjoy games such as EU IV ,Hoi 3 this also brings an appeal to grand strategy in some sort of way.Remember christmass is coming and there might be just your perfect gift for you or a friend of yours who is in to this types of thing.

												Good game. I was quickly hooked on the campaign but then I got to Tormented Space which seemed impossible. I went to the prospector zone and it had many planets that were all too easy until I ran across Molreport which again was impossible. Seems like the planets are either too easy or impossible once you finish the short campaign which ends without a word of explanation. I have only seen a small fraction of the Arc Eternal universe so I don't know if there are going to be more challenging planets. I'm beginning to think that like most games that rely on user created maps, that there is a lot of tedium. You'll have to look hard to find challenging games once you finish the short campaign. There isn't a lot of variety in the buildings. If you zoom in close there isn't anything to see. There isn't much in the way of detailed tool tips. That's too bad because specific information could make a difference. I enjoyed terraforming my way into enemy territory but building shields is faster and less complicated. You just build millions of generators and then shield your way into the deep stuff and rip out the bad things by the roots. Bombers, straffers and guppies are there but they are rather tedious and much less effective. I didn't see people putting up lots of experience nodes to capture that might encourage you to level up your ore and AC carrying capacity in order to launch a big D day type invasion. I would highly recomend this game at the sale price especially if the professional types are going to build a longer campaign that is as delightful as their earlier campaign but this is not up there in quality like Mount and Blade or Kerbal Space Program. If their mission was to show those corporate types that they could do as good a job as any big studio, they didn't succeed. If Stardock is the MacDonalds of gaming then these guys are the Chinese takeout that opened on the corner with the crispy vegetables, delicious sauces and suspiciously slippery meat.			"

												Probably the best game that I've played this year! Bought it while it was on sale, and it turned out to be something that I'd pay the full price and would still get way over content/cent I'd get from most other titles.+ The variety of units is just enough for the game to always have a choice of what to do next and how to complete particular map.+ Rather interesting story mode, followed by tons of randomly generated maps, AND some really challenging ones made by alpha testers.+ Map generator - even more content!+ Map creator and user-created maps.- Only one song for the entire game, playing on every level. It's quite long, dynamic and really great, and takes really long to get old, but after 60+ hours I wish there was more music.- Game really has only a couple ways to challenge you - Creeper and Digitalis with Runners. Most of the challenge comes from the map itself. Some story and player maps have very diverse objectives and obstacles, so if you got bored, go to Alpha Sector or Colonial Space.- Some maps can take you up to 2 HOURS to complete!- If you are a completionist type of guy - good luck to you XD ! I doubt I'll ever complete any sector besides story one.Seriously, this game is awesome and you should buy it. If you like strategy games. that is.			"

												This is actually quite a good game, once you go through couple of the first missions. Through the campaign it keeps things fresh, throwing your way new challenges every time. And the best part is that it does not hold your hand. You can spend all the time you want in any mission and beat it in a way that works for you. It can be quite meditative experience. You can spend hours to build all the terrain to the highest level, and fill map with reactors, or not. And after you beat story mode there is a map editor and an endless amount of user-generated, auto-generated and other maps. So you can sink a ton of time in it. Price is good too, especially on sales.If you like tower defense games or something like Perimeter, you'll probably enjoy this game.The only problem I have with that game is its achievements. A lot of them are stupid, grindy or just unachievable. It is just too easy to cheat in that game if you want to do so. So leaderboards are filled with cheaters. If you don’t care about achievements just ignore this part.			"

												I always love a good genre-bendre and this one is interesting. Instead of just building towers along a route to mow down enemies, you build movable towers to gradually beat-back the spread of purple goop. You have to manage power and supply lines as well. Quite fun.Graphics aren't stellar but they don't need to be. Som games need to look good and some don't. FPS and other action-oriented games all almost always more fun if they look better. Some games don't benefit much from a visual upgrade.After playing more-recent shooters, it's really hard for me to play through (for example) Dark Forces. One of my favorite games of all time but it's such an eyesore that it's hard to play. CW3 could look as nice as Starcraft 2 but that wouldn't make it a better game; it would just make it a better-looking game.They could maybe charge a few extra dollars if it looked like SC2 but then I'd complain that it wasn't worth the price.Good game, CUSTOMIZABLE CONTROLS, fun (but skippable) story.

												I must say this game hides quite well behind apparent dated graphics and, let's be honest, pretty ugly UI. It grows on you however, as a long form strategy game unlike any other I've played before. I also found myself enticed by the story and the imagination therein. Some missions are challenging, but when you get past those hurdles you realise it's fair difficulty, and most of the time it's simply your build order that might need revising for that mission.It's somewhere between Total Annihilation and Starcraft. The only thing that really bothered me was the music.			"

												Verdict:Buy it, especially if it's on sale!Pros:- Relaxing, yet rewarding, RTS experience- Campaign missions are interesting and unique- 100+ hours to complete the campaign missions (probably, not done yet)- Map maker- Community-made maps- Random map generator (a.k.a. Dial Map Device)Cons:- Storytelling tries to be way too ""epic"" but is simply tedious (maybe the later missions will make up for it?)Review:This game is a perfect match for me. It's an RTS, but you basically set your own pace, so it's much less stressful than something like StarCraft. Don't get me wrong, I love StarCraft, but Creeper World 3 somehow manages to make the RTS experience relaxing and rewarding at the same time.At the time of writing this review I have about 19 hours in the game, and I've barely scratched the surface of the content available. I'm maybe 1/4 of the way through the campaign missions, and have yet to play any of the thousands of player-made maps, or the practically infinite map generator called Dial Map Device.The campaign missions are interesting, and somehow keep surprising me with new challenges. The storytelling is pretty bad, though. I feel like writer tried too hard to make it feel like a super epic novel, but it just ends up being tedious.Overall it has been well worth the $2.99 I paid for it. Having experienced it, I would have easily paid full price for it.			"

												Charming game with unique gameplay and a weird captivating story. The only downside I would say is that the pause-play mechanic that essential to gameplay isn't fully captured in the scoreboards. Actual gametime would be just as interesting if not more than in-game time.			"

												I enjoy playing this game inbetween league queues. Its like a mix between an RTS and a Tower Defense game. Hard to explain. Anyway heres the breakdown:Pros:- Lots of Replayability- Challenging- Main campaign takes a long time to beat- Really addicting once you get the hang of things.Cons:- Challenging?- Takes many attempts at that start, because there isn't a decent tutorial.- The story is pretty negligible.

												its fun but it has some things that i hate like fabor a timed world when i like to do this slowly and see my base and build 60 power base with walls of guns so fabor was like GO GO GO and i was all like no no no so i did not beat the game . but its fun and even when i make a huge base it still runs no frame drops.

 TL:DR	 - It's a good strategy game, well polished with few issues if any, and it's quite fun, it's worth the money, and will offer many hours of gameplay with thousands of missions to choose from, including player made missions.This game is very much worth both the money spent buying it and the time spent playing it. It is a major time sink, hours go by without me even noticing. There's hundreds, even thousands of different maps and missions to choose from.Personally my favourite section is the player made custom maps and missions, they feature many different scenarios and events, even some new things not present in the base game like new units and new enemies. It's really great seeing all these things people have made, there's strategic maps people have made where you have to plan ahead and think carefully, wacky maps that are fun and light hearted, play as creeper maps where the role is reversed and you are the creeper assaulting a base, custom scenarios of different kinds made by people, it's all varied and quite fun to play.Another feature is a random map generator, where you put in the features you want, like map size, terrain type, and other variables, and the generator will create a random map based on what you want from it. For people who want a challenge, there's a section of the game dedicated to randomly made extremely difficult maps, some of which are literally impossible, others close to that. Most of them can be done, but they require a lot of thought and careful action to get there. For people who want a more casual experience there's a section dedicated to easier maps that have items called ""artifacts of Odin"", and the goal is to collect these items scattered throughout the various planets. There's also a campaign which features some interesting levels which teach you the game, some of which are quite tricky.The premise is that there's this entity called the creeper, that has been ravaging the universe for a long time. It spreads from planet to planet, creeping across like a liquid, and it is your job to simultaneously put up a strong defence to hold back the tide and to also effectively assault the source of this enemy. It's a cross between a tower defence, real time strategy and management sim all in one. You have to position your units, manage supply lines, organise your base, respond to the changes of the battle, manage your resources, extend out in an effort to attack whilst at the same time making sure your defences will hold. You have to be careful with what you do and choose a playstyle, do you turtle up, building up a strong defence capable of weathering the incoming assault at the cost of allowing the creeper to multiply thus causing future expansion to be slower, or do you reach out early for a preemtive strike, weakening the creeper early or gaining a strong foothold, at the risk of overextending and leaving gaps or weaker parts of your defence? There are different ways of playing this all depending on your own individual playstyle and what is better for the map you are playing.You can play this at your own pace, there's the option to play it at normal speed, 2X, 3X or 4X speed, and you can also pause the game and issue orders whilst paused, useful for assessing the situation on a large map where a lot of things are happening at once and you need to be controlling the battlefield in all these areas simultaneously.In terms of stability, this game is very stable, there's few bugs (I'm not even sure I've noticed any), it runs well and doesn't require high specs. It's a lot better in this regard than many big name titles made by whole studios, and this was afaik made by one person. There's a fair amount of UI options and a few graphical options which are all quite nice to have.			"

												If you are a fan of the series, I don't think this will disappoint you. You have a great campaign that I feel tells a great story, not only that but it allows you to pick up and play a randomly generated mission and challenges. If you are new to Creeper World, pick it up cheap in the sales, still worth it. 10/10 Would creep again.			"

												This might actually be my favourite RTS(ish?) game.The gameplay is only singleplayer and very much oriented around building a defense grid to resist and overcome a stream of Creeper. The Creeper is a liquid like entity that will accumulate and destroy your buildings if your defense isn't up fast enough.One of the features I think it the coolest about this game is the terrain. Heigh can vary between 1 and 10 and will didctate how the Creeper will flow on the map. It's also possible to terraform it to create things like walls or flatten the place where you want to build.But walls won't help you forever. Creeper isn't limited to the height of 10 and will accumulate untill you destroy all the spawners.That's the basic of it. There is also a few more ennemies and you have about 11 buildings to adapt to each scenario.The main story is cool. The first half will introduce you to new features and the second half will have unique levels to challenge you, especially toward the end. The whole thing is lead by a mysterious sci-fy story.And the best part is that the story is the small part of the game. After the few hours you need to complete it, you have countless more missions to play and also user-created ones.Nice defense RTS, tons of content. It might not be for everyone but check it out!			"

												I always love a good genre-bendre and this one is interesting. Instead of just building towers along a route to mow down enemies, you build movable towers to gradually beat-back the spread of purple goop. You have to manage power and supply lines as well. Quite fun.Graphics aren't stellar but they don't need to be. Som games need to look good and some don't. FPS and other action-oriented games all almost always more fun if they look better. Some games don't benefit much from a visual upgrade.After playing more-recent shooters, it's really hard for me to play through (for example) Dark Forces. One of my favorite games of all time but it's such an eyesore that it's hard to play. CW3 could look as nice as Starcraft 2 but that wouldn't make it a better game; it would just make it a better-looking game.They could maybe charge a few extra dollars if it looked like SC2 but then I'd complain that it wasn't worth the price.Good game, CUSTOMIZABLE CONTROLS, fun (but skippable) story.

												I must say this game hides quite well behind apparent dated graphics and, let's be honest, pretty ugly UI. It grows on you however, as a long form strategy game unlike any other I've played before. I also found myself enticed by the story and the imagination therein. Some missions are challenging, but when you get past those hurdles you realise it's fair difficulty, and most of the time it's simply your build order that might need revising for that mission.It's somewhere between Total Annihilation and Starcraft. The only thing that really bothered me was the music.			"

												A deceptively engrossing and story-rich tower defense that's not exactly a tower defense. Build nodes, manage power, and strategize against a fluid antagonist in increasing levels of complexity. New node types, enemy types, mechanics, and environmental factors get introduced at a steady trickle, alongside a sci-fi storyline rife with mystery and intrigue. If you're the type to like TD games and are looking for something fresh, unique, and has a lot of depth, this game is a must buy -- especially if it goes on 80%+ off sales.			"

												A simple battle of attrition.  I do wish that Creeper expands faster as each mission goes on, but the story is suprisingly engaging and there's a real challenge in trying to speed run the missions.  There is also plenty of content to enjoy, and plenty of varied units, each with their own pros and cons.  Missions are as easy or hard as you want to make it.  The music is very fitting and fantastic.  The graphics are simple and adequate.  Pick it up if you're a fan of tower defense games and games similar to that genre.			"

												Fantatic game, value for money is out of this world and the more you play the more it 'creeps on you'The gameplay is great, the maps challenging, the music is somewhat repetitive as there is about 3 tracks but you can always switch it off and play your own music.The Story is DUNG, It is absolute dog crap, I cannot stress how bad the story is and how boring it is. You will never feel connected to the characters, You will never give a damn about if the die a horrible death or live on an island paradise. The dialogue is bland, the story is (I repeat again) $hit, it REALLY IS. The game designer could of written, oh my god there is this purple crap from space and I'm a new character who know jack $hit what it is (even though this is the 3rd installment), it would have been better than the garbage storyline and even worse ending these complete AMEUTERS have written... now I've got that off my chest.The Game is great, it's something diffrent in RTS's because you can take your time or really try push and beat your times  without too much pressure (no point in beating world times as EVERY score of the top times have been hacked, another negative, you will never finish the easiest stage in 26 seconds but the hardest stages in the scoreboards have 'apparently' been done in those times )... even though the game has so many mistakes the gameplay is something  you can't miss as a true RTS player.

												Creeper World. (This is a review for the trilogy which you can get through links on the developers website for about $25 and includes a Steam key for the third game, which is the only game currently on Steam)The Creeper World trilogy are RTS games, with a twist. The enemy is not (most of the time,) a specific unit, but instead a wave of blue goo that must be held/pushed back in order to achieve your goals. There are enemy units later on in the second and third games, but every level will be about beating the goo to some extent. The feel of the game is somewhat similar to a tower defense game at times, but not so constrained. Most of your 'units' are emplacements/turrets, albeit ones that can usually be moved when you need them somewhere else. The complexity of the game increases throughout the series, (so I would recommend starting weith the first game and playing through the trilogy,) but never felt stale even in the first game. The second game changed the style of the game somewhat, and whilst interesting and fun, it wasnt as engaging as the first game, and fortunately the third game returns to the style of the first. Dont get me wrong though, all three games are good. There is a story, but its a minimal affair, a paragraph or two at the start of each mission, sufficient to add a bit of colour, but ultimately nothing to get excited about. There are also downloadable demos for each game available on the developers website if you want to have a go and see for yourself. http://knucklecracker.com/ including a web based version of the first game.So, any drawbacks? The graphics are simplistic but functional, the same is probably true of the sound effects/music. but I tend to turn it off and listen to a cd anyway. The interface is a bit basic, could do with a bit of love and a bit more control, ie text sizes etc, but other than that, its an RTS and its a good one, with map editors, a lot of missions built in and literally thousands of player generated maps too. As such, it is absolutely recommended.			"

												I love this game. The gameplay is unlike any other and is so innovative. The story missions are mostly tutorial missions that add more technologies but they also introduce a new custom element to the game every mission. One one mission it's creeper that appears across the entire map but is spawned by a single emmitter that you have to fight to get to. On another you have to eliminate all creeper on three different structures to active a weapon powerful enough to let you push to the boss of the map.Those custom elements are done through a simple coding system which is why I keep playing the game. The community made maps which are easily accessible through the main menu have custom elements that are new and exciting. One popular one is getting to play as the Creeper. In another popular mode, you fight a creeper powered version of your own units. There's so many awesome community made maps that I love playing which is why I keep coming back to the game.			"

												Totally and utterly addicted for labor day weekend.Only problem is the frontloaded difficulty curve: Bascially once you've entrenched and held a position you can no longer lose.Also, gameplay regresses towards the end of each game. With very few exceptoins, it just becomes slow enchroaching in the same style every time.A lot of the features only really work later on, at least most games. Which of course means, you don't use them until you've already won. (Terraforming, I'm looking at you!)Still, completely lost myself to this game for 3 days. Totally worth.			"

												One of my all time favourite games. Probably the most original and replayable tower defense out there. Single player it can stand tall together with strategy games like starcraft or age of empires without shame. 100% achievments took me 450 hours. I suppose it can be done in half that time. There are tons more content even after the achievements. The biggest problem is probably how the ruleset is almost identical on every map.Suggestions for the creator. Multplayer: Allow comments on map. Notify players when their map has a comment or time is beaten. Notify players when their time is beaten. List maps with newly beaten highscores. Rank players on how many 1st rank they have on maps. Chatroom? There is SO much that can be done for a competetive multiplayer scene in this game. The current DMD is pretty bare bones. Go steal some inspiration from super mario maker or similar. (How about co-op maps? Too difficult?)Map making: Ditch the obscure scripting language for javascript or similar. Allow multiple map campaigns that allows some progression. Where the outcome in one map can affect following maps. For example custom tech tree unlocked over several maps like in the original campaign. Or campaigns where the final map can be played from start, but can be made easier if you choose to beat other maps before it. Or variable prices, or unit prices or unit strength. Or pretty much anything to mix up the normal gameplay. I think this gameplay is too unique to just let it sit and spoil. Please go make a sequel. Please.			"

												For what this game is, I found it worth the money; a good distraction for the couple hours that I poured into it.  It's a nice upgrade over the free Flash game that introduced me to the series.  If you're curious about the game, give the Flash game a try to get a feel for it.  It's that same mechanic with a little more polish, a cheesy but engaging enough storyline, and more levels.  Nothing more, nothing less.			"

												I may only have 80+ hours on steam, but I have played countless more hours. I crave laying down defenses in the perfect arrangement to complete tougher levels. I love builing random maps and testing my skills against other peoples devillish creations. Creeper World 3 is a rare gem in the indy scene with an unforgettable unique style of play. It is a MUST PLAY!			"

												This game is like a much more relaxed real-time strategy because through most of the campaign your biggest challenge is not reacting quickly but reacting appropriately to the approaching situation or immediate threat. Most of your units are in fact structures, slowly spreading and building up your base across the maps. Once you've finished the campaign, there are tons of extremely difficult challenge maps, some very interesting player-created maps, and more. You definitely won't run out of content, and this game is easy to pick up as well. If you're looking for a RTS that is almost all macro and doesn't require tons of hours to get the hang of, this is a good pick. Doesn't have multiplayer though.			"

												8/10. Excellent tower variation, map variation, and general enjoyment. See expanded below.Did you know this thing's earlier installments are available as flash games? That's how I first started playing th Creeper saga, and when I ran across this one on steam, I bought it without a second thought. That happened to be a great purchase that I have long enjoyed. In this game, you take on the role of the universes ultimate tower-defence gamer, protecting your command centers from an ever increasing biomass of pure evil long enough to extract data from the doomed planet and warp to the next system. The tower defence aspect of this game is great, with new weapons, reactos, and offensive technology unlocking progessively and adding more and more layers to the game as the difficulty ramps up.There is a story, which is what's driving you to keep playing missions: the promise of destroying the un-destroyable Creeper once and for all. Guided by a redoubtable A.I, your lone ship treks across the galaxy trying to unraval the mystery of the Creeper.Overall, a solid game. After the campaign is an endless array of maps, some dev made and countless other community made. The repetitivness of mission objectives can get boring,  but put it down and come back tomorrow and you'll keep having fun.			"

												I figured this would be a small game to idle some time on.  Surprisingly, I am terribly engrossed in it!  When I watched the videos, it seemed a bit on the busy side, but I decided to take a chance.  The story 'Arc' has me terribly curious and I hope I haven't figured it out yet, but it is going to cause me to play through until I find out exactly what happened and is happening.  I have found it can be very easy to turtle up and then slowly inch out.  I have only managed once to rapidly pump out some guppies and smack down those nasty creeper spore towers.If you love Tower defense style games, you will certainly enjoy this game.  Pulls you in like Defense Grid did with the story, but is a more free-form playstyle.  I highly recommend.			"

Only difference: CW and CW2 are free to play flash games and can be found on web sites like Kongregate, and CW 3 has a fifteen dollar price tag..That price tag has stopped me from playing it until now. Summer sale. 90% off. Everything else that I've picked up recently has sat untouched because of this game.I'm about four hours in right now and have just scratched the surface of the campaign, and there are several different game modes that I know nothing about yet :)			"

												I enjoy playing this game inbetween league queues. Its like a mix between an RTS and a Tower Defense game. Hard to explain. Anyway heres the breakdown:Pros:- Lots of Replayability- Challenging- Main campaign takes a long time to beat- Really addicting once you get the hang of things.Cons:- Challenging?- Takes many attempts at that start, because there isn't a decent tutorial.- The story is pretty negligible.

												One of my all time favourite games. Probably the most original and replayable tower defense out there. Single player it can stand tall together with strategy games like starcraft or age of empires without shame. 100% achievments took me 450 hours. I suppose it can be done in half that time. There are tons more content even after the achievements. The biggest problem is probably how the ruleset is almost identical on every map.Suggestions for the creator. Multplayer: Allow comments on map. Notify players when their map has a comment or time is beaten. Notify players when their time is beaten. List maps with newly beaten highscores. Rank players on how many 1st rank they have on maps. Chatroom? There is SO much that can be done for a competetive multiplayer scene in this game. The current DMD is pretty bare bones. Go steal some inspiration from super mario maker or similar. (How about co-op maps? Too difficult?)Map making: Ditch the obscure scripting language for javascript or similar. Allow multiple map campaigns that allows some progression. Where the outcome in one map can affect following maps. For example custom tech tree unlocked over several maps like in the original campaign. Or campaigns where the final map can be played from start, but can be made easier if you choose to beat other maps before it. Or variable prices, or unit prices or unit strength. Or pretty much anything to mix up the normal gameplay. I think this gameplay is too unique to just let it sit and spoil. Please go make a sequel. Please.			"

												If you liked the original Creeper World, this is the game for you. While the graphics aren't stunning and the story isn't exactly immersive, the gameplay is simple and you can easily spend hours on just one level (out of hundreds of available levels). This game is a perfect twist on the classic tower defense game, where it's easy enough to learn in minutes, yet each level brings new surprises. I feel like Creeper World is one of the best time-killing strategy games, as I can easily sit down and play through three levels, taking anywhere from twenty minutes to two hours apiece. Without a doubt, I would highly recommend Creeper World III to anyone who liked the original.			"

												Got through the campaign, and man... THAT PLOT TWIST! I LOVE the story of these games! Played through them all, and now, the grand finale... Just. Wow.Gameplay; similar to the first game, which was better than the second, in my opinion. The ability to terraform and to place repelling shields gives a new, great way to play! Makes things a lot easier, though. In the first game you could place a bunch of cannons to just keep things at bay, in the second you had the option of a shield-block and/or anti creeper, but here, it's a much more simple way off telling the creeper to ♥♥♥♥ off by building a real physical wall infront of it!Soundtrack; great, as always.Visual; the option to remove visual things, or to make things transparent is AWESOME! Too much clutter from time to time? Just make things transparent/invisible!Also, the amount of extra content? Frickin' fantastic!10/10! Love it!			"

Shields pushes out or destroys your anti-creeper.Some of the graphics are weird. One of the buildings has a rotating tower with static shading that rotates when that building starts rotating.You can assume that everything else is a-okay. Get it on a sale maybe?			"

												Some are calling this tower defence. I'd call it real-time strategy. Regardless, I don't normally like tower defence or RTS, but this game is the exception to both. Maybe that's because this game takes those ideas and adds a simple but robust concept for the enemy units that you're fighting against.The best news for you is that you can play a free demo of all the Creeper World games on the web via Flash or Unity webplayer. If you want to find out what people are gushing about, just go try the demo. You don't have to download anything (other than the browser plugin), just play it in your browser. If you like tower defence or RTS, definitely play the demo. Even if you don't, but you're somehow reading this out of curiosity for this game, try the demo anyway. Take if from a guy who normally dislikes both of those genres, and just look at how many hours I've played Creeper World III.This is essentially a much-improved version of the first Creeper World. The game has a built-in map editor, and also seed-based procedural generation for random maps. This is in addition to hundreds of pre-made maps of varying difficulty.As of the time of this writing, this game still has an active community of dedicated and gifted players who are still adding custom maps each day. There is much opportunity for modding. In addition to the map editor, there is a built-in scripting language so you can essentially reprogram the game (within limitations I imagine, as I've never personally experimented with it), and I've seen players come up with some very creative ideas such as maps where you play as the Creeper and maps where the enemy has units similar to your own that are controlled by AI, maps with fog of war, maps with booby traps, and the list goes on. The mods and customization make available endless hours of entertainment.			"

												The Creeper series is in a sort-of RTS style, with no AI. Creeper is represented as a blue fluid that damages player structures when it comes in contact with them. It spawns at set intervals, gradually filling the entire map if left alone. The general objective in Creeper World 3 is to battle through the Creeper and destroy the spawners by building nullifiers next to them.The game can get quite challenging, and perhaps impossible, if the player has trouble getting enough resource production to output enough damage to Creeper before it engulfs the player's base. Like any RTS, there is a build order to learn and practice, but one key difference is the pause button, resulting in a less intense ""RTS"" game. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay, not including user-created custom levels. Nice concept and fairly engaging story.The original concept for Creeper World 3 can be found on Armor Games, where a series is dedicated to the blue fluid, so start with those shorter titles if you're not ready for Creeper World 3.

												Awesome.  Most fun you can have with 1980 graphics.After you've won on the campaign one of the regions you can explore is called tormnented space.  Lots of the missions there are close to impossible;  rarther annoying if you have even minor OCD.			"

												Look, this game is not for everyone but if you like this style of game I feel like this is the gold standard.  Basically you play a series of maps that involve building power generation and defenses to fight off the invading creeper (basically purplish goo) and destroy their spawn points.  Every level more or less follows this model and yet every one feels unique.  The main mode stiches these maps together into a story about the origin and goals of the creeper which I also found light-hearted and entertaining.  I highly recommend it.			"

												A simple battle of attrition.  I do wish that Creeper expands faster as each mission goes on, but the story is suprisingly engaging and there's a real challenge in trying to speed run the missions.  There is also plenty of content to enjoy, and plenty of varied units, each with their own pros and cons.  Missions are as easy or hard as you want to make it.  The music is very fitting and fantastic.  The graphics are simple and adequate.  Pick it up if you're a fan of tower defense games and games similar to that genre.			"

												The game has very simple game mechanics, build an engery and weapons grid to take over the land.  The game isn't simple because every level something changes.  Sometimes the enemy, you, or both get something new to build that entices you play this map different than the last map.  (OK, well, sometimes you are forced to play differently when the enemy gets a powerful improvement.)  Thumbs up for the campaign mode.If you view the screenshots of the game, you will see the graphics are by no means elaborate.  That is OK because once you start to play the game you will appreciate every graphic element that does exist.  Eye-candy would end up just being visual clutter that wouldn't help the game.  Thumbs up for the graphics being just what they need to be.The audio and music is appropriate for the game.  Thumbs up for audio.A game like this doesn't really need a story.  I appreciate the good attempt to create a story that not only explains the game overall, but explains the new elements of each level.  Thumbs up for the story.In total that is four thumbs up, so I am out of thumbs.			"

												So there you are, looking at this game like you're some kind of hot shot. ""Oooh, look at me! I'm so badass! I could lift ten times my weight before breakfast!"" Well, time for a wake-up call, sweetheart. With this simple, yet surprisingly hard to master little gem, you'll be doing war against the Creeper, an ever evolving, ever growing purple monstrosity, like the Smooze if it was genocidal and emotionless. You'll be taken back by how much strategy you have to implement to wage your war against the creeper. See, unlike your average RTS/tower defense, you can't just rush guys in and tire the enemy out. No, he'll be doing that to you. You have to cleverly work a way around using a multitude of offensive and defensive technologies. Standards like shields which protect you from the ever-increasing reach of the Creeper, to aerial units which provide ground support, and a landing pad for you to stage a beachhead against the amorphous beast. If you think you're Mr. Bigshot after hearing that, then prove it. Beat the creeper and send him to the reaper!With that all said and done, I fully recommend this game. Especially when it took me about 15 hours to complete my first playthrough. I have to say that's not bad at all. And looking back, i even had tons of replay value checking out the other game modes, such as custom maps made by the developers, and those made by the community. Gotta really appreciate the simplicity of the game, which lends itself to such enjoyment.EDIT: And after almost 100+ hours of enjoyment, I think I may be addicted.			"

												Some are calling this tower defence. I'd call it real-time strategy. Regardless, I don't normally like tower defence or RTS, but this game is the exception to both. Maybe that's because this game takes those ideas and adds a simple but robust concept for the enemy units that you're fighting against.The best news for you is that you can play a free demo of all the Creeper World games on the web via Flash or Unity webplayer. If you want to find out what people are gushing about, just go try the demo. You don't have to download anything (other than the browser plugin), just play it in your browser. If you like tower defence or RTS, definitely play the demo. Even if you don't, but you're somehow reading this out of curiosity for this game, try the demo anyway. Take if from a guy who normally dislikes both of those genres, and just look at how many hours I've played Creeper World III.This is essentially a much-improved version of the first Creeper World. The game has a built-in map editor, and also seed-based procedural generation for random maps. This is in addition to hundreds of pre-made maps of varying difficulty.As of the time of this writing, this game still has an active community of dedicated and gifted players who are still adding custom maps each day. There is much opportunity for modding. In addition to the map editor, there is a built-in scripting language so you can essentially reprogram the game (within limitations I imagine, as I've never personally experimented with it), and I've seen players come up with some very creative ideas such as maps where you play as the Creeper and maps where the enemy has units similar to your own that are controlled by AI, maps with fog of war, maps with booby traps, and the list goes on. The mods and customization make available endless hours of entertainment.			"

												Great game with a TON of replayability. Mostly because I doubt most people will ever beat everything thing there is too do. Great story and execution. Can be very easy to very challenging. Some maps have even been considered impossible to beat, but don't let that discourge you. It's an awesome game. Had to mute the music after a while though because one of the songs reminds me of the ♥♥♥♥ Judge Judy theme song and broght back bad memories of being a kid stuck inside during the summer all day with smoker parents who watched Jerry Springer and other junk.9.99/10 because ♥♥♥♥ JJ.

												Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal brings me back to the old Starcraft PvE games, the Starship Troopers-inspired maps where the Terrans you had to defend against hordes of Zerg. Except in Creeper World, it's not Zerg but slime. Purple slime inching toward you and piling over your walls.This is the first int he series I've played but it has been fantastic fun. It's quite easy to play on laptop without twitch reflexes because you can pause at any time. True, once you get some techniques down, it can be tough to find some challenge in the later maps of the storyline, but it looks like you can make your own and there are community-ranked maps if folks want something really punishing.All in all, a really good investment so far.

												I love this game. The gameplay is unlike any other and is so innovative. The story missions are mostly tutorial missions that add more technologies but they also introduce a new custom element to the game every mission. One one mission it's creeper that appears across the entire map but is spawned by a single emmitter that you have to fight to get to. On another you have to eliminate all creeper on three different structures to active a weapon powerful enough to let you push to the boss of the map.Those custom elements are done through a simple coding system which is why I keep playing the game. The community made maps which are easily accessible through the main menu have custom elements that are new and exciting. One popular one is getting to play as the Creeper. In another popular mode, you fight a creeper powered version of your own units. There's so many awesome community made maps that I love playing which is why I keep coming back to the game.			"

												Creeper World. (This is a review for the trilogy which you can get through links on the developers website for about $25 and includes a Steam key for the third game, which is the only game currently on Steam)The Creeper World trilogy are RTS games, with a twist. The enemy is not (most of the time,) a specific unit, but instead a wave of blue goo that must be held/pushed back in order to achieve your goals. There are enemy units later on in the second and third games, but every level will be about beating the goo to some extent. The feel of the game is somewhat similar to a tower defense game at times, but not so constrained. Most of your 'units' are emplacements/turrets, albeit ones that can usually be moved when you need them somewhere else. The complexity of the game increases throughout the series, (so I would recommend starting weith the first game and playing through the trilogy,) but never felt stale even in the first game. The second game changed the style of the game somewhat, and whilst interesting and fun, it wasnt as engaging as the first game, and fortunately the third game returns to the style of the first. Dont get me wrong though, all three games are good. There is a story, but its a minimal affair, a paragraph or two at the start of each mission, sufficient to add a bit of colour, but ultimately nothing to get excited about. There are also downloadable demos for each game available on the developers website if you want to have a go and see for yourself. http://knucklecracker.com/ including a web based version of the first game.So, any drawbacks? The graphics are simplistic but functional, the same is probably true of the sound effects/music. but I tend to turn it off and listen to a cd anyway. The interface is a bit basic, could do with a bit of love and a bit more control, ie text sizes etc, but other than that, its an RTS and its a good one, with map editors, a lot of missions built in and literally thousands of player generated maps too. As such, it is absolutely recommended.			"

												The Creeper series is in a sort-of RTS style, with no AI. Creeper is represented as a blue fluid that damages player structures when it comes in contact with them. It spawns at set intervals, gradually filling the entire map if left alone. The general objective in Creeper World 3 is to battle through the Creeper and destroy the spawners by building nullifiers next to them.The game can get quite challenging, and perhaps impossible, if the player has trouble getting enough resource production to output enough damage to Creeper before it engulfs the player's base. Like any RTS, there is a build order to learn and practice, but one key difference is the pause button, resulting in a less intense ""RTS"" game. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay, not including user-created custom levels. Nice concept and fairly engaging story.The original concept for Creeper World 3 can be found on Armor Games, where a series is dedicated to the blue fluid, so start with those shorter titles if you're not ready for Creeper World 3.

												Ok. Creeper World 3 is an amazing RTS. You need to build your base, collect resources and build defences to protect yourself against the overwhelming enemy that quickly grows in power and takes over the whole map. When you grow strong enough, you start pushing back, shooting your way through the enemy forces. You need to make sure that your assault is well covered, is connected to the supply line and that you won't run out of resources at a critical moment. You shoot down air units and lauch air assaults and bombarding deep in enemy territory. Oh, and NEVER forget about defending your land. A small mistake can be enough to screw up your plans.It's extremely satisfying when you capture land and push further into the enemy territory, and destroy they structures. The game combines moments of despair, heroism and triumph. But there's one important detail.You don't fight humans, but blue alien mass that spreads extremely fast and destroys everything in it's path. But despite this you still feel like you fight a war against a much stronger enemy.The amount of different things you need to keep track off, the gameplay focused on tactical planning, the awesome music that's both dramatic and badass...Oh, and did I mention the crazy amount of content? There are thousands of maps you can fight on in the official campaigns, and there's also a level editor and a random level generator.In short: great RTS with a truckload of content. Buy it now.			"

One of the best strategy games on SteamMany survival/strategy games are like drowning. Such games play out as a constant desperate struggle to stay above water, with no chance to breathe, until you are eventually overwhelmed and die a horrible death.Creeper World 3 is more like walking a tight-rope. At any time you can pause, catch your breath, and steady yourself for the next step. The risk is when you start moving. It is always a delicate balance - if you go too fast and overextend yourself, you will lose ground instead of gaining it. This is strategy at its best.If drowning sounds like more fun, don't play this game - it isn't for you.The diverse selection of units - each with its own distinct role - enables several rewarding strategies. The level terrain and enemy placement strongly impact tactics, so every mission feels distinct.The game includes more missions than you will ever play, a level editor for making even more missions and sharing with the community, and an option for procedurally-generated levels as well. You will never run out of content.Creeper World 3 features satisfying and refreshing mechanics you will find in no other game. My first experience with it was overwhelmingly enjoyable. As I mastered the mechanics, it felt less novel but no less satisfying. Years later, I still dedicate time every month to purging more creeper.			"

												Last night I played this game in my sleep!I currently have absolutely no time to play games and just wanted to open this one up real quick to have a look, after I purchased it. I have now logged 15 hours in 3 days...I love RTS games, but most are too fast-paced and click-heavy for my taste. This game allows you to play at your own speed (some people go for speed runs, I prefer to slowly build my base up) and choose your strategy.I play this instead of sleeping and when I do sleep, it doesn't stop. I have a problem.			"

												It is vaguely tower defense...  you cannot control the path of your enemies with your towers, nor does your enemy have a path at all.  Your enemy is ""creeper"" - an obvious ripoff in name and behavior of Starcraft's creep.  It is goo which expands from a central point.  The goo will destroy your towers so you must keep it at bay.  The whole game is about first protecting your base from the goo then slowly pushing the goo back until you destroy the enemy target.  The graphics are a la 1989.  The gameplay is simplistic.  There is a lot of content, though.  If you are tolerant of poor graphics and this style of game sounds interesting, then it'll keep you occupied for a decent period of time for a low price.  I found it underwhelming, possibly because I like the more traditional tower defense, but I have played it a lot.			"

												Talk about addictive...Haven't played a ""just 5 more minutes"" game since Dune II (or Master of Orion II but that was turn based and a completely other kind of game). This game has a lot of resemblance with Dune.Lots of people tag it as tower defense but I don't really agree. For starters, you are the attacker and there really aren't towers. But most of all, tower defense is about repetitiveness, about more and more units attacking in the same way, where this game, also predictable because of its nature with physics, has a much more broad attack style.So what's it about? I'm not really into the story, but it seems some kind of (underground?) monster has some arses in planets and from those asses, it is spreading some kind of liquid. Physics make sure that these fluids flow and spread over your planet, destroying everything that is not planet, wall or enemy on its way. Your weapon against this fluid is some kind of weapon drying it out. Well, not one kind, there are a lot of types and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. It's your job to eradicate these squirters from these world, making sure life can start again on those planets, although some planets have gone too far for this and are only to be cleared of the monster for the technology that is left behind there.This game is terribly addictive. I have played it a lot offline first (bought it through their website to have it DRM free) and activated it with a key on steam.			"

												CW3:AE is simply amazing and addictive.I remember playing CW1 long ago and loving every bit of it and though CW2 was very different i'm glad they went back to the original style with this one. It's like a mix of TD and RTS, it's like someone looked into the future of Tower Defence and brought it back into the present.Besides the campaign and the surprisingly deep story, you have hundreds of handcrafted maps and thousands of random pre-generated maps(normal and challenging) and a map editor to share your maps with others. Basically, there is enough to play here.In terms of play styles you could go for a speedy/aggresive or tactical approach, but there is an odd satisfaction of systematically taking over the map bit by bit, freeing it from the ""Creeper"". With the addition of being able to terraform the landscape things get very interesting, going from building your own castles/fortresses to creating artificial chokepoints for the Creeper to simply making the map right out flat as you go along.All in all i would very much recommend getting it on or off sale, but as i said it's quite addictive.

												Well nothings Much Left for me to said since Store already told Most of the games play and it's unique mekanism So I'll say that this games was a series games .Means it have a ""Story line"".Before Creeper World 3 :Arc Eternal Launch in stream it have be started for as far as I know.story so far...As a Web games In story of your ascendant that have to fight[still the games play was focus on flee-surviving] with a really limited tech [many of the tech was presented on older version like the core unit collecter] with out knowing what they are really fighting to.So with a really limited knowlage about they enermy names ""creeper""they stand no chance on fight[As reveal some point on games that not only your ascendant but nearly all civilization was also effected].So In creeper world 2 redemption one of the main hero manage to find a way to destory the ""creeper spawner"" Know as ""spawner"" and the discovered of the anti creeper.with Both technology they manage to fight back the creeper.BUT Still the creeper does evolve and did really somehow overwhelm  and whip out the humanity again.So the rest is your to discover.

												I saw the word ""Creeper"" in the name and was curious if some kind of Minecraft ripoff had made its way onto Steam.  What I found was a highly addictive and unique stragegy game.You face the creeper: a flood, literally, a fluid enemy pouring across the battlefield from emitters.  Later encountering corrupted machines and other new threats and rule-bending forces.  Your typical mission begins by dropping your HQ either far enough away or on defensible enough terrain to build up your economy and weapons to begin pushing back.  Branching out your energy network to lands secured by weapons fire (or other interesting units and abilities) to allow units to operate further and further afield, advancing step by step, until close enough to set up a special unit to destroy its source.The games many maps are very diverse.  Fighting on all sorts of mundane and exotic planet surfaces, fragmented worlds, moons, asteroids, vast artificial structures etc.Your economy is energy.  You recieve a constant income of energy from collectors and reactors, which require either plenty of creeper-free land or large investments of energy.  Energy functions as the building material for units and their ammo.  Losing a chunk of your income, or a link in your network of collector and relay nodes, or just spend it on doing too much at once and your weapons will have only several seconds worth of stored energy before that wall of firepower becomes a trickle, or nothing at all.The main con with this game I think is that, with the exception of a few time sensitive missions, you are very unlikely to lose once you have built a decent defense early in the mission.  Once that is accomplished, a player be as slow and patient as they like, lazily inching things forward one at a time as much as terrain allowed.I might have played CW3 that way, and been left with a feeling I wasn't challenged, and that there weren't many important strategic decisions to make... if not for one simple feature: leaderboards for best completion times.  This is one of the few games that have managed to interest me trying to get into the Top-Whatever ammount.  I recommend doing so, it greatly enhances CW3's challenge and replayability.Unfortunately, the leaderboards are polluted with illegitimate scores, particularly in the main campaign and most popular other maps.  I mean times well below what it takes to build, charge and fire a single nullifier even in the best conditions filling the Top 10's and 20's; with legitimate champs finding themselves in around the Top 30's... so at least it's still meaningful to be in the Top 100's.

												This might actually be my favourite RTS(ish?) game.The gameplay is only singleplayer and very much oriented around building a defense grid to resist and overcome a stream of Creeper. The Creeper is a liquid like entity that will accumulate and destroy your buildings if your defense isn't up fast enough.One of the features I think it the coolest about this game is the terrain. Heigh can vary between 1 and 10 and will didctate how the Creeper will flow on the map. It's also possible to terraform it to create things like walls or flatten the place where you want to build.But walls won't help you forever. Creeper isn't limited to the height of 10 and will accumulate untill you destroy all the spawners.That's the basic of it. There is also a few more ennemies and you have about 11 buildings to adapt to each scenario.The main story is cool. The first half will introduce you to new features and the second half will have unique levels to challenge you, especially toward the end. The whole thing is lead by a mysterious sci-fy story.And the best part is that the story is the small part of the game. After the few hours you need to complete it, you have countless more missions to play and also user-created ones.Nice defense RTS, tons of content. It might not be for everyone but check it out!			"

												Pretty neat game. I first found it as a flash game a few years back, then a while ago I found the flash game again and though, man this would be a cool full game. A quick search on steam revealed that it was!The gameplay of this game is simple, your enemy works exactly like water and will flow out across the landscape dropping into and quickly filling up holes, or build up so much to climb up to higher levels. Your job is to create a defence that blasts back the ""creeper"" until you can get close enough to destroy the source.With a campaign, different modes, and a user created content section, this game has infinite playability, and I found to be a ton of fun, even though sometimes a single level would take me 3 hours (I like to play really conservatively) I found the game to be a ton of fun, with little to no issues I could find. I would definitely recommend.  "

												The game is exactly as shown in the video trailer above. It's true that there are two playstyles: stalling for energy and speedrunning each map; but i think the two of them are valid and you can have fun playing the way you prefer.The game's content is nearly infinite so you'll be able to play all the time you want, althought the game mechanics are practically the same throughout the end-game. So my advice is that if you are not sure to buy it even after watching the game trailer and reading the reviews you can go and play  the other games of creeper world to see if this game fits for you. I'm 99% sure that you will love it!			"

Are all at your disposal to keep back, and annhilate the creeper and it's tools!!Every mission is different, every map is unique, and there are thousands if not millions of player created maps in addition to the tutorial, campaign, and different sectors. If you enjoy tower defense, a bit of micromanagement, strategy, an adaptive enemy, and so much content that you'll be happy for weeks, hell, even if you enjoy factorio, you'll probably enjoy this game just as much as me. It's what I searched for in a game for a very long time, and now that I have it, I am playing it as much as I can, and loving every second. 10/10			"

												This is a fun game, a credit to Indie development.  No reason to add to the many positive reviews, except to make a recent one.  The worlds are being covered in alien goo, and it's up to you to drive back that goo.  With a description like that, it could be a dull game, but it isn't.  The game is well crafted.  It isn't gorgeous, but it's good enough.  The gameplay is what it's about anyway.  After each map I have to snap out of a pleasant daze - the game's tempo and sounds keep me completely absorbed in the action.A note about comparison to Particle Fleet: Emergence, by the same developer.  I recommend buying this one first, if you are trying to decide.  CW3 does a better job at explaining the universe that both games take place in, has better writing, is easier to learn the mechanics.  Graphics quality and depth are similar in both.  CW3 focuses on ground combat, PF:E on spaceship combat.  Both are good games, but I had trouble understanding PF:E until I played CW3.  Now I look forward to completing PF:E as well.			"

												I've been playing this game series for years on flash game websites. This game always manages to entice me to come back to it. It really accomodates a variety of playstyles, from the slow methodical domination strategy, to the clever direct to the goal strategy, from brushing through and taking the point loss to end the map quickly to micromanaging every frame of the game. With the addition of player created maps into the mix it gets even more fun, I've become addicted to the special game modes available in the player created maps specifically one where your role is reversed, this is a great game with simple enough mechanics to learn but the option to find levels that rely on tactics that are hard to master. I would definitely recommend this game to anybody.Just don't up the game speed on larger maps or else you'll actually slow down the game if you don't have the computer for it.			"

												A game in which you literally defend against waves of enemies and in which your base truly gets flooded.In Creeper World 3 you are in the middle of the ""man vs nature"" conflict. You are the man, and the nature is a purple, mindless goo that just spreads everywhere - unless you stop it.And somehow despite the poor, if not awful, graphics, despite the awkward UI and despide performance issues, I find myself draw to this title more so that to any other tower defense game. Perhaps it's the joy of building your energy network, perhaps it's setting and fighting for the the perimitier, or perhaps it's the slow and steady reclaiming the world from the goo after you manage to hold it off.Give it a try, especially if you like tower defense games, but are tired of playing the same one over and over, just with different skins.

												This game is on my all-time favorites list. I've been heavily, heavily invested in this series since 2009 with the first game, and it got better with every installment. I'd have to say this one is my favorite, def. Playtime is at most a third of my actual playtime since I got this game before it was on steam. The story is so good as the close for the three-game epic through the  entirety of the human race. You really need to play the first two games, esp the initial one, to really appreciate the progression for the protagonist, but the gameplay gives it an excellent stand-alone experience. Bless Knuckle Cracker. Please play this game.			"

												I dislike these type of pixle games and purchased this game only because of its high rating, despite being burnt for doing the same thing multiple times before.It was a worth while risk and I am still happy with the chance I took with this game.It didn't look much like a 'story' based game but the tale it told was mature, engaging, and well paced.The gameplay would normally be repetative in this type of game however it managed to avoid multiple pitfalls.There is enough challenge where I failed around 40% of missions but never felt frustrated, surprisingly enough.There are a lot of extras after completing the main game which I still play sporadically.I don't think I will ever replay the whole campain again but I would still enjoy it if I did replay it.My personal ""Top 10 Hidden Gems of all time"" "

												First off let me tell you that I love this games concept.  the turret deffense along with leaderboards and other things make for a rather interesting game.some key things I have to dissagree with on the concepts.1) leaderboards are broken.  how can you beat a level in less than a min.  it takes more time for your orbitals to land than some of these people took to beat the levels.  I call foul.2) Campaign - It seems choppy at best, and broken as worst.  sure I was able to beat it.  but most of the items you have at your disposal and the fact that even two ore harvesters cannot support one single ore spitter for continuious fire is sad.  then there are the titans.  Useless in ever case.  even on the missions you may want them they take too long to fire, the creep comes back too fast even on 1x speed to do anything tactical with them, and the last one is only for the end mission, you don't even get to use it on special missions after you unlock it.now for the reason that this game is great!1) it has user/mod like interface.  looks to me (haven't finnished all bonus sectors yet) that you get to make and share with other players in these maps.  maybe they just modify/test them first to make sure you don't screw over the comunity, but this is a rather interesting idea.2) the story is actually decent.  Sure it may seem obvious at times, and others down right boring.  However, if you decide to read it all (storyline) you get an interesting story.  one worth talking about to friends and family.  Just like when you read a good book, or new article.3) Replayability - Sure the leaderboards are broken, but you can still post your times and strive to improve them, come up with new and interesting ideas on how to beat the levels, and even strive to limit yourself in ways not ment (like only cannons and solor collectors)In the end this game is worth picking up, yet I would think nothing more than $10 for the short campaign limit, but the extra sectors do make up for the loss in gameplay.  Just wish they had some kind of RPG element sector where you gather things/currency and use them to improve/unlock different items to use in the next mission (like if you could boost yourself with a starting ammount of energy or something)  of course this would destroy the leaderboards in that sector, but that would be something like score rather than just time (like -points per sec and +points for builds and kills.  Also give you a point handycap for bonuses, and a point bonus for detriments)Anyways if you like Tower Defense or base building you may want to check this game out.			"

Sometimes you can blitz right though and everything seems to be going your way.  But its always a ton of fun.			"

They destroyed 2nd part, because they changed the mechanic, but fortunately, they came back to the primitive idea in the 3rd part. And it is awesome. Upgraded, more levels(+community levels) and purely amazing. The game may not look good, however it's simplicity really helps. You can control the battlefield easily.

Actually what it really reminders me of is Command and Conquer of 20 years past, when you would build a series of walls and turrets into the enemy base.  In fact that is pretty much what Creeper World is about, probing for a weaknesses in the enemy line and then pushing out into it with your different structures to crack the defenses apart.			"

												If the idea of high res eye candy is a requirement for you, do not get this game. However if gameplay and mechanics are important, (like they are for me,) this is a great strategy game.The campaign will take you a few days to get through (depending on how much time you devote to it each day.) However, there is so much content available through additional ""official"" scenarios and fan made maps (there is an editor) that you will not have time to ever look at all of them, let alone play them all. (and most that I have played are quite good.)Right now, the spiritual successor, Particle Fleet: Emergence is also available on steam. While having similar concepts there are plenty of differences. I would suggest getting both. Both games are very good in their own right, if you like one, you will like the other... and different enough to justify having both.			"

												This is a rare, and very dear feeling when you think ""this puzzle is impossible"", and then you think some more and say ""wtf, what's the trick?"", and then ""okay, there is no trick, it's just very hard"", and, lastly, ""OK, this was hard, but I did it"" and that is  awesome.			"

												This is the King of all Tower Defense games. It is a classic, in a league of it is own. There is nothing else like it. Incredibly addictive, well worth the low cost. If you like tower defense this can entertain you endlessly... Highly recomended to TD and RTS fans.PS: Please make Creeper World 4! I will give you all my money for Creeper World 4!			"

												This is a great game. I like versions 1 and 2 better (version 2 is a completely different game) but this game is great. I wish that they had an in game description of what each unit does like they did in the origional two. It's kinda frustrating to have to leave the game itself to look up the new thing you just unlocked. Could certainly use a better intro to the content.			"

												I first heard about this series by playing the free demos of the first and second one online. I enjoyed them for a long time, and eventually found that this was at the time the only full game on steam. I hadn't bought any of the full games yet so I didn't know the immensity of the game. Although story mode is small but interesting, the rest of the game contains an unfathomable amount of levels, along with the ability to play levels made by yourself and others online. The levels can range from easy or challenging, and this game is more fun if you enjoy having to meticulously fight back agains the opposing creeper and plan your infrastructure. The soundtrack has only 2 songs that play during levels, but they are substantial enought that you will never get tired of them. The story is a little hard to understand because I didn't play the first 2, but the ridiculously large years (evidentally this is trillions of years in the future if not more) make it hard to fathom the amount of time passed, wich is kind of cool.TL:DR Creeper World is a great game that provides countless hours of engaging playtime.

												The game is based on a mechanic that invents a completely new ""enemy"" on the tower defense or RTS genre. The enemy is a liquid that you have to fight back and survive. I love the series and have played through all of the entries. But to be honest, Creeper World 3 was... a disappointment. This one I like the least in the series. I suppose my problem here is lack of innovation. I felt like there was nothing new to the game compared to the old ones. I think I was already waiting for something new but all I got was second base and improved graphics. Even the engine is the same. I feel like I still want to see one more game from the series. But with added content. Not just million maps that in the end, after a few games, are all the same. I want more mechanics, maybe different types of Creeper, more tech, more weapons, maybe upgrades for the weapons, ""smart"" creeper that activly tries to fight back with different mechanics and weapons and not just flop the predictable way where the game stays hours in a stale mate, and more!I recommend the game but I find the older ones to be more intresting			"

												This game is on my all-time favorites list. I've been heavily, heavily invested in this series since 2009 with the first game, and it got better with every installment. I'd have to say this one is my favorite, def. Playtime is at most a third of my actual playtime since I got this game before it was on steam. The story is so good as the close for the three-game epic through the  entirety of the human race. You really need to play the first two games, esp the initial one, to really appreciate the progression for the protagonist, but the gameplay gives it an excellent stand-alone experience. Bless Knuckle Cracker. Please play this game.			"

												I dislike these type of pixle games and purchased this game only because of its high rating, despite being burnt for doing the same thing multiple times before.It was a worth while risk and I am still happy with the chance I took with this game.It didn't look much like a 'story' based game but the tale it told was mature, engaging, and well paced.The gameplay would normally be repetative in this type of game however it managed to avoid multiple pitfalls.There is enough challenge where I failed around 40% of missions but never felt frustrated, surprisingly enough.There are a lot of extras after completing the main game which I still play sporadically.I don't think I will ever replay the whole campain again but I would still enjoy it if I did replay it.My personal ""Top 10 Hidden Gems of all time"" "

												First off let me tell you that I love this games concept.  the turret deffense along with leaderboards and other things make for a rather interesting game.some key things I have to dissagree with on the concepts.1) leaderboards are broken.  how can you beat a level in less than a min.  it takes more time for your orbitals to land than some of these people took to beat the levels.  I call foul.2) Campaign - It seems choppy at best, and broken as worst.  sure I was able to beat it.  but most of the items you have at your disposal and the fact that even two ore harvesters cannot support one single ore spitter for continuious fire is sad.  then there are the titans.  Useless in ever case.  even on the missions you may want them they take too long to fire, the creep comes back too fast even on 1x speed to do anything tactical with them, and the last one is only for the end mission, you don't even get to use it on special missions after you unlock it.now for the reason that this game is great!1) it has user/mod like interface.  looks to me (haven't finnished all bonus sectors yet) that you get to make and share with other players in these maps.  maybe they just modify/test them first to make sure you don't screw over the comunity, but this is a rather interesting idea.2) the story is actually decent.  Sure it may seem obvious at times, and others down right boring.  However, if you decide to read it all (storyline) you get an interesting story.  one worth talking about to friends and family.  Just like when you read a good book, or new article.3) Replayability - Sure the leaderboards are broken, but you can still post your times and strive to improve them, come up with new and interesting ideas on how to beat the levels, and even strive to limit yourself in ways not ment (like only cannons and solor collectors)In the end this game is worth picking up, yet I would think nothing more than $10 for the short campaign limit, but the extra sectors do make up for the loss in gameplay.  Just wish they had some kind of RPG element sector where you gather things/currency and use them to improve/unlock different items to use in the next mission (like if you could boost yourself with a starting ammount of energy or something)  of course this would destroy the leaderboards in that sector, but that would be something like score rather than just time (like -points per sec and +points for builds and kills.  Also give you a point handycap for bonuses, and a point bonus for detriments)Anyways if you like Tower Defense or base building you may want to check this game out.			"

												An excellent game with nicely paced progression.You'll rage during some levels but once you complete it you'll realize it wasn't hard at all.The game forces you to try new strategies and use all your capabilites - no one approach beats all levels.Recommended.			"

												Pros:A unique blend of RTS and Tower Defense is an innovative twist on a tired genre.  Seriously.  I'm utterly shocked nobody else has stolen this and applied their own game to it yet.Maps vary wildly in difficulty, taxing your ability no matter how experienced you are at the game.Cons:*If you have a technical issue, the developer's response will be ""It works for everyone else, it must be a problem on your end.  Good luck fixing it.*  If you buy this game, try it immediately to make sure everything's kosher, so you can return it if it something doesn't pan out.Story is short and painfully one-dimensional.Balancing issues abound.  Since the enemy never gets any stronger, and you never stop getting stronger, surviving the first few minutes is tantamount to winning the map; Clearing emitters is a formality.Some maps are 100% objectively impossible to beat.Certain achievements aren't so much ""achievements"" as ""medals for playing a really really long time.""--That said, the game is worth playing for no other reason than to experience the unique gameplay.

												Amazing strategic tower defense but utterly unique with its grey-goo style enemy. Evokes the AI gone wrong scenario that you struggle against. Each level, trying to establish a bulkhead before you're taken over. Usually once stabilized you can push forward without fear of being overrun but still racing against the clock and any surprises in store. Haven't really got immersed in other TDs with enemies that span periodically to march single-file down an alley of death - such non-strategic thinking (no timed runs or efforts to undermine the offense battery) that it breaks my suspenion-of-disbelief. On the other hand, the premise in this game does feel plausible.			"

												Tags : Casual - Puzzle - VisualAdditional Tags : Tower DefenseCreeper World 3 is a connect the dot puzzle/tower defense hybrid with a thin sci fi post apoc plot.Different dots have different specialties and pipeline ammo to your guns from your HQ/Engine. Your goal is to shoot at basically a water spill to prevent it from spilling then plug the source by rolling it back carefullyThey went through the hassle of remaking it in unity. I played a couple matches, its not great by any means but it does accomplish what it set out to do and does provide a fair distraction but can only be enjoyed in short bursts before it gets really boringIt is debatable if this game is any better than a flash game offering. My guess is not but I will play more to test it out			"

												This is a neat game, lots of fun.The steam achievements are awful. Enormous waste of time - tons of grind/repetition. Otherwise I'd give it a thumbs up - if you don't care about achievements, give it a go. If you're a completionist / 100%er, avoid it!			"

												The slow and steady creep of your eventual demise is highly compelling. Will you solidify your defenses first and eventually overwhelm the creep with superior economy? Or will you blitzkrieg the closest emmiter to gain an early advantage? Balanced, well polished, and simple to understand mechanics combined with creative maps, both from the developer and community, make for high replayability and creativity.Easily my favorite tower defense since the days of Warcraft 3.
