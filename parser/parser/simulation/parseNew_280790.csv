								As of this moment I see the potential to be the evolution of minecraft. I mean this game could be fun and fantastic co op. They had to be greedy and ruin it with a cash shop though. You literally have to wait on extractors and things to mine and build 5 minutes and up. You can of course rush things with their in game mojo points. When you run out though, despite paying 20 bucks for the game. It's either pay to mine or wait forever. Oh well, was fun while the stuff lasted onward to better games.			"

								The game that makes you wait longer then you can take a dump. Pay or wait forever. Pay to have the best items. Purchased recipes can't be earned in game. It's your classic Free to Play get rich now regardless of how badly it messes with the game. It could have been bigger then minecraft. Save your money and time unless waiting 5+ minutes for each ore to be harvested. The best extractor can only be bought. So theres your pay for best items. Currently (going to be removed and reworked) they have a pay now to speed up crafting. I'm probly half way through the games ladder of ores. Crafting is insanely long. It's like 3 hours in-between mining runs spent on crafting. People have over 50 crafting machines because this games design is so flawed trying to get around it. Like I said it's changing but I mention it to demonstrate the character of the these devs. They thought lets make crafting take hours and stick a pay now button next to it.We have a best item only available through purchase.wait time attached to everything from crafting to mining. Pay for quicker noraml paced gameplay. (extractor and the pay now)Online only cloud saves. Game no longer supported its over.			"

								Game looks pretty, plays smooth. Thats about as far as they got with it.Interface is half-built. Can't even see the keybinds in-game, and the keybind menu out of game is utterly irrelivent and makes absolutely no sense.No control for the field of view, which is supidly narrow considering how close the mobs are to you when attacking you.Can't group with friends, or disable friendly fire.The night time mobs are insanely overpowered. Killing the player in 3 hits.Game is not ready to be played or even tested. They actually have to build some mechanics.They don't even have a female body model.I got the impression the devs came up with the idea ""What if we made minecraft with smooth gameplay and graphics?"" So they made the core mechanics and it worked. Then they lost interest.This is just another Minecraft wannabe vaporware project.Move along.			"

								OK before i get into this i just wanna say i have played minecraft since the wee baby years of Alpha. Before i downloaded this i knew without a shadow of a doubt i was gonna hate on it an rage about how this is just another rip off of the game the great lord Notch created. I start the game:1) Graphics are amazing! You will find yourself just walking around starring at the scenery. (willow trees are the best)2) Jump 2 blocks! Um thank you sir.3) Loads of blocks! You can't harvest much at the start but once u get the better equipment everything is yours! EVERYTHING. And it is a lot4) Many mobs. Some will make u run in terror just at the sight. Some just want to be left alone. I killed a baby crab. Felt evil. Was awesome.5) Combat system flows really well.6) Character isn't modable but thats ot a big deal. It could happen in future updates.7) The cave systems and mining capabilities are simply better.8) I do however wish it wasn't all server based. Local play would be a great improvement.9) The grinding element can be annoying but once you locate where certain items are found (aka which biome its in) you can link teleporters and quickly get around the world. The vastness of the universe is incredible.In short Creativerse minecrafts better than Minecraft minecrafts. The creators are the new god. give up the throne Notch. I will shed some tears but i think I am benching Minecraft for a while.Edit: I know Notch hasn't had anything to do with Minecraft in a while. I know he sold Mojang to Microsoft for a pretty penny.

								UPDATE 9/11/2015Well it has finally happened, PlayfulCO has moved up in the world from the ""greedy, lying, misinformation"" company into the ""censorship, theocracy (where they are the Gods), and terrorist” company. What better day for them to transition than on Sept 11th? What better day? Gamers everywhere, if you support this game you are not only supporting a downright evil company, you are the cause of the downfall that is video gaming. You need to pull your heads out of your butts and start opening your eyes. If you support these companies and these business practices you are the cause of the “Early Access” problems, the cause of “PTW/PTP/PTC” problems, and the cause of video game companies having the right to stifle freedom of information with censorship. You ARE the cause of gaming review companies, personalities, and publications going the way of the “sell out”, and why? Because if they don’t “sell out” they are “snuffed out”. Today, on Sept 11th, I have been permanently banned from Sell-a-verse forums. Was I given a warning? Nope. Was I talked to? Nope. And why was I banned? Here, take a look for yourself: http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/517141624282545953/Oh, and don’t worry. If they destroy the evidence and that link doesn’t work check out my blog, I have every screenshot needed for you to take a look at. ( http://www.tihie.com/creativerse.html ) So what happened? Someone (Will have to censor screenshots as to not get myself in trouble with Steam) whose first language is French, had a problem. You see he bought the game because it says “solo play” in the description and bought the game in a bundle and now finds out that the game is “online only”. He asked for help and doesn’t understand why the game can’t be played offline. I post a comment (in English and then I took the time to translate it into French for him) explaining how the game is going the FTP micro transactions *(PTW/PTP/PTC) route and that is why it will always be online. I also tell him that he should have read reviews before buying said game (hoping that he would do so in the future but also because some of us take the time out of our lives to try and help other gamers, the least you could do is read it and inform yourself). He then thanked me, first for taking the time to respond, second because I translated it into French for him to easily understand, and third for answering his question. What happens next? Enter Fan Boi (let’s call him “Bent”) Bent, he wants to turn the thread into how the game isn’t a PTW/PTP/PTC game, basically giving the middle finger to the person with the problem, and then reports me. Within minutes I am permanently banned for helping this French person with the problem. I get a message:“You don't seem interested in having a civil discourse with our community and seem to delight in spreading misinformation about our game and business model. We think you'd be happier spending your time somewhere else. Goodbye.”Please feel free to read my older reviews for this game on my blog, check out all of my postings in the Sell-a-verse forums, please read that thread above (if they haven’t killed it) and you tell me if I have not been civil, if I have not been doing anything but spreading simple truths. I would be happier spending my time somewhere else, and I shall. More importantly, gamers, so should you. This sort of “people in power quelling people’s voices just because they don’t like what they are saying”, THAT is the death of gaming as we know it, THAT is the death of honest game reviewers as we know it, that SHOULD be the death of early access! Who is going to give an honest review when they get censored? Who is going to give an honest review when they will never be given early copies of games and/or have to buy every single one of the games they review? When companies start censoring conversations that scare them and then only give access to those that will say what they want to say what do you have left?In my last review (which you can find on my blog) I pointed out that a lot of the reviews had tags/titles that read “reviewed with key sent by developers”, since that time they have all removed that tag. Every, single, one of those “given free keys” (hundreds of these reviews on Steam) was “positive”. Over the course of this game I have given voice to the thousands (literally) that hate the PTW/PTC/PTP game destroying features in this game, features including but not limited to this: http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/619573787463233789/And I have done so civilly and with facts. (*After posting this review PlayfulCO locked my review and deleted every-single-post I have ever made in their forums in a spectacularly guilty attempt to cover themselves and the truth*)Bottom line is this, you want to buy into early access and support this game YOU are the problem with gaming. And how does Steam respond? By putting reviews that get 50%, 69%, and 70% “found helpful” in the “most helpful” section because they are all “positive” reviews when all of the negative reviews are much, much higher. Tell me this isn’t censorship? Tell me this isn’t “buying away all the negative reviews so no one ever sees them…” If you have a brain, or if you care about gaming in the slightest, do NOT support this game/company or any like it. TL;CR Look, you can’t read because it will fry your brain but honestly want to know what this game is about, then go to Playfulcorp.com/candycraft2 and see for yourself. Honestly don’t know how long that will continue to be up on their website before they take it down, it is a PR nightmare. *Please don't bother commenting on review to let me know that ""you ♥♥♥ need go die in whole yo!"" because I will just delete it... **I suppose people don't even get this far in my review before posting troll comments; as I have said, please don't bother, I honestly delete them without even reading them. You don't like something down vote and move on, if you have a reasonable question I’ll try to answer it otherwise all other comments will be deleted. Ignoring this just proves you can't even read this far before having a fan boi explosion in your pants...***Older reviews of this game in their completeness can be found on my blog; address found on my Steam profile or by googling Ashley and Micah English.

I wish there was a ""blah"" review.Creativerse is one of many Minecraft ""next generation"" games, hoping to cash in on that $2B trend. It's a good game. It's visually more attractive than MC, but then, aren't they all? There are some interesting novel new ideas, in the arena of mineral extraction. The character avatars are currently limited to two congenital twin white people with the same armor/clothing. Here's to hoping they introduce more diversity of races, both real and fantasy.You could spend a lot of time in this game, like Minecraft, just wandering around. They have plugged in more mobs, and the crafting system is more streamlined. One of their selling points in their own copy was ""No more googling for craft recipes!"" Ok, that's cool and everything, but not exactly original.What needs to happen is for the developers to COMPLETELY disavow themselves of the pay for content model. They need to make an original game that works, right now, that people will flock to, or else it's just another bloated dead beta corpse in the water. When they said they wanted to charge for content and upgrades and rushed completion of contruction (they were/are going to use a pay-to-hurry-completion model similar to every exploitative MMORPG ever), that really pushed them into the margins. It was a major PR messup.I know I'm probably not the first to suggest:NPCs that are actually interesting and contribute to the environment in an original way. Vendors are the first thing people make in sandboxes. Okay, what could be more interesting? NPCs that give you missions. Okay, that's great. That would improve the game. What else? NPCs  that form relationships with the characters, that can tell stories.The mobs are more interesting in Creativerse than in Minecraft. They have ""special moves"" which seems to promise a lot of potential. Unfortunately, they're a little stupid, although seemingly more dangerous than in Minecraft. Create features that are interesting to explore and interact with, not just showcases of a new graphical innovation or mob. Minecraft is minecraft. You can't compete with minecraft by being Minecraft. At this current stage, I see no major innovation in this game. No story, no new angle. Fun and playable, but nothing I'd buy again if given the chance. "

TL;DR - You may as well try it.As a minecraft clone, there are a lot of mechanics in this game that will feel familiar to anyone who has played minecraft. Creativerse, however, adds its own spin on the idea. I will be comparing this game to minecraft throughout this review. Lets go through some pros and cons: Pros:  Same feeling of freedom you get from minecraft. Really do whatever you want. Animal taming system is a really cool optional part of the game, that has been refined from the model that existed in minecrft. biomes look beautiful, considering the limitations of block-based graphics Server system is much easier to manage than other games of the genre, with jump-in game worlds with user privilage settings Frequent updates are adding content and squeezing out bugs regularly Free-to-play model works great (Will explain below) Cons:  Game progression is slower than you'd be used to. It takes longer to get to the better tools than minecraft, and deeper layers are un-minable using older tools. Really don't like this feature. Still a bit buggy. Some instances of creatures spawning where they shouldn't and water not acting as it should. Too many block types. I will explain this below. Some block rarities need to be tweaked. Review For some background, I live in a house with 6 of my friends, guys and girls included. Most of us are heavy gamers, and one or two are more casual. I downloaded this game on a whim and within a day the whole house was playing in my world. They had all built their own little houses and we had started organising larger projects and had delegated tasks to everyone. This. Felt. Great. It was a really cool experience that I personally never got out of minecraft, even when playing with friends. We all really love the features and look of the game, and the fact that anyone can drop in, work on the castle a bit or collect ore from the mines and drop out whenever they want. If thats the kind of experience you think you'd enjoy then this game will be a fun casual time sink. Now, the free to play model does have microtransactions. As far as I can tell, you can spend money on blueprints (large outlines of complicated designs that let you know which resources you'll need to build.) and consmetic blocks (recipes that unlock blocks with unique textures). Obviously, all of this content is completely optional and purely cosmetic. This is why I think it is a pro for this game. Block types... There are hundreds of them. Trees drop different kinds of wood, stone is only found in the shallowest layer of digging, each digging layer is made up completely of different sets of blocks representing rock types. What's good about this is the cosmetic implications. You can pretty much find a block with the exact texture you want for the walls of your dungeon or treehouse. What's bad about this is your poor poor storage space. It won't take long for you to fill up containers of bedrock, limestone, dirt etc etc and it is often hard to tell the difference at a glance which is which. The majority of these blocks are used is at least one recipe. This makes the crafting system quite complex. If I want to make an iron mining cell for whatever reason, I still have to keep flipping back to the recipe page to check what I need, even though i've crafted dozens of them. Block rarity. For the most part, rare blocks are very useful for specific recipes. An I tem called rockster rock is very difficult to find away from a beach, so I'd say its quite rare, but it is only really used in weapon crafting. Obsidion, which is found quite shallow under ground, is also rare. I cannot tell you how many times I found a lump of coal and got excited because I thought it was obsidion. Now, contrary to rockster rock, obsidion is used in a huge amount of essential recipes, including the recipe needed to harvest more obsidion. I spend far too much time just looking for obsision, because it is far too rare for the recipes that use it. Obsidion is just one example, it does happen with other block types, but that might ust paint the picture.All in all, creativerse is definitely a fun game, Its free, Its not graphics intensive, It looks great, and its easy to play with your friends. It has its problems, obviously, but they are activley being worked on. Give it a go.			"

								OK I loved Minecraft, It was genius of it's time and really set a standard for Sandbox/Crafting Gaming. That said... Many games have followed trying to pretend it's not Minecraft, but really just a clone. When I first saw Creativerse, I thought Ok it's free for a few days, no harm... Few hours later... ""PURCHASE FOR MYSELF""Creativerse, gave me a renewed interest in Sandbox Gaming, I love that it is in Early Access and the devs are actively working on taking the game to further heights. Love the graphics, Love the design, and the gameplay is very smooth. Your ability to create is nearly endless, and it makes you want to Play, Explore, Build, Survive. I love the way people are banding together, helping each other, building a greater community and relying on each other to grow. In our world: ""The Era RPG Server"" (New Server) we've actually built a thrieving socity based on rules and guidelines, professions, teamwork, trust and communication. We actual have character roles and play out our adventures together.Exploration is very enjoyable, so many different and unique wonders to see, I was exploring and found a spot where 3 biomes met... Beautiful Canyons, Thick Jungle, and Frozen Snow... I was truly amazed at the possiblities of building in places like that.Their are ton of mobs, ugly ones, really cute ones, to down right nasty looking mobs... I am excited to see what new functions for pets they will come up with. A few suggestions: A Pet Whistle to call your pet when they get lost, I like to let mine wander. They should help you in combat, I mean they where kicking your butt while you where taming them what happened to the fight in them,A Pet Trough to feed your pets when your away, so when you come back you can gather from them and then give'em a little shower.Combat is simple Hack and Slash, point and click. For the stage it is, you wont need more than that. However I would like to see implementation of ranged weapons above throwing pinecones, a Bow or Crossbow, maybe the Water Sprayer can deal damage to enemies, implement a flamethower, I KNOW THE ANIMATION IS THERE... Those Firerats will mess you up. Perhaps a Block Button? Just a thought.Health should, however slowly, regenerate over time, and recover completely when you sleep. Character Customization is a MUST, even being able to change the simplest details, Skin color(include green), Eye color, Hair color... Hoodie color.... (optional) Ears, Nose, Mouth, Hair style, Shoe color...A Trade Window, that allows you to trade with anyone in the world. The window pops up, you pick who you are trading to and the item your trading and a request pops up on their screen, they click ok, the trade window opens on their screen.. they add what they are trading, both parties hit confirm... Boom... and they can be anywhere in the world.This game can easily set a completely new and different standard for sandbox crafting gaming.Creative has the Potintial to Surpass Minecraft in everyway with or without mods.DEVs PLEASE don't Give up on us! It would be a crime against Gamers... Keep up the Good work and I will play and promote till Creativerse 2!			"

tldr:  I’d rather be playing Minecraft.Creativerse is a Minecraft clone, and while it’s not a bad game per se, it just really doesn’t do anything new or special to set it apart from what it’s copying.Pros:The block art and monster models are slick and professional looking.  The monster models in Creativerse are very unique and stylized, and not something you could ever see in Minecraft.The biome diversity in Creativerse is pretty good.  Biomes appear to at least match Minecraft in terms of terrain generation and fauna.  However I did not see any new biome types that Minecraft does not have.There is a temperature mechanic in very hot and very cold biomes.  This could create some interesting gameplay mechanics, though I’m not sure how full featured it is or how it effects gameplay in the current build.Random loot chests spawn in the world which is a fantastic reward for exploration.Built in player teleport functionality allows for easier travel and exploration far from your home base.Crafting tier system provides a feeling of progression as you unlock new recipes.Cons:Player movement physics feels bad.  Jumping has moon gravity, and the player takes a moment to accelerate up to speed before moving. Running long distances feels quite quick and smooth, but small precise movements, like while exploring a cave for example, feel sluggish and slippery.Lacks the random terrain and gameplay elements that Minecraft has such as Dungeons, Temples, NPC Towns, Chasms, Lava pools, etc.Crafting tables spawn randomly all over the world, which just look and feel out of place.  Why not just spawn the player with their first table in their inventory?Lacks the charm and coziness of Minecraft.Combat is identical to Minecraft.  Just stand in one spot and click the enemy.  Would love to see something new added to make combat more interesting.No Mod support.Trees are GIGANTIC, making them a major chore to chop down.I know it’s a sandbox, but somehow it just feels entirely purpose less.You play as a cartoony gender neutral 12 year old, and I don't think player skins are currently supported.  It would be nice to at least choose from a few different player models or skins.Creativerse is going free to play soon, which will no doubt add some ridiculous micro-transaction scheme.  No thanks.  I much prefer to just pay for a full package game at full price, and have access to the full amount of content without pay gates or pay to win boosts.In summary, Creativerse is not a bad game, and if you’ve done absolutely everything there is to do in Minecraft then maybe Creativerse could provide you with something new.  But honestly, Creativerse is just kind of bland and there are better options out there.  It just made me want to install Minecraft again.The developer really has a great engine and base to build on here.  I just hope Creativerse will evolve beyond what it's copying, and venture farther into adding new mechanics and new features which make it unique and stand out on its own.			"

								Truth - Great game still needs work, Once you learn the ropes you will be gathering resourses fast, Needs more weapons, Needs a better health management system as there is no real points at the moment to growing food. Most people I see saying Creativerse is a Minecraft rip off well here is the truth below.As in so many other fields, innovation in the world of game development doesn't normally entail creating something entirely new and completely unprecedented from scratch. Every developer, to some extent, is building on foundations laid by other developers. Are all 3D FPS's copying ""Doom"" or ""Wolfenstein?"" Are all text adventure games copying ""Zork?""Notch and his team at Mojang took a block-based, procedurally-generated style of game created by a developer named Zach Barth, and they used it as the basis for something truly awesome, imbuing it with personality, complexity, appeal, and helping to foster a sense of community around their game. There were other influences, too, like Dwarf Fortress. Minecraft has been overwhelmingly successful; after recently selling to Microsoft, Notch famously just bought the most expensive house on the market in Beverly Hills. Good for him, I say.Minecraft is not at all the only game to have incorporated Barth's ideas, and look how many Minecraft-type indie games have emerged since Mojang began to enjoy such success. I personally wouldn't call it ""copying,"" and I don't see what's disappointing about it. It's how the gaming industry has always worked, it's how the arts work, and it's going to stay that way.Complete originality in the arts is mostly a myth. It doesn't happen. We are always the sum of our influences, to which we add some little spark of our own.			"

Yes Another Minecraft Clone... BUT A DAM GOOD ONE!! Yeah its another Minecraft clone that has gone Free 2 Play, but this one is real good !! The games engine is real good and runs real smoothe with no issues and looks pretty darn good.The crafting is just like Minecraft so if you have played that you will be very familiar with this ones crafting system.The crafting works by making stuff and you get plans to make new stuff as you go and i think i read you can also find plans for stuff in the world (kinda like drops off mobs and chest around the land) or you can Buy them later i think. They have good aray of baddies to fight and farm for mats and stuff and makes it more neat to explore.I say being its F2P give it a shot and try it out and see if you like it :) its got my VOTE !!

								This is a fun game. Very similar mechanics to Minecraft but there are more RPG elements which make it enjoyable outside of just mining blocks and building things. The crafting system expands as you create new objects and collect new materials.The fighting system is pretty basic, you have a sword (you start out with a stick, however) of various materials which do more damage for each material type. There are health potions which you can make and are very useful because there is no cooldown to use them and they are pretty easy to make. Bombs are also a huge help with combat and if you've killed enough Keepa for gun powder, you should rarely run out. Death just means you need to run back to where you were to get what was in your inventory when you died. All equipment and quickbar items remain equipped. Now that they've added a map, its a lot easier to find your way around as well.The game looks pretty good, for a block-based world. All npc's have normal looking models, including the player characters. Easy to play with friends and have them join your world too.I am hoping the dev's continue to work on this game by adding in some boss type monsters or some other kind of challenges and building materials.

								Early Access Review6 months, 800+ hours game playYou start out in a wooded forest.  You have this nifty wrist gauntlet that will suck up blocks and put them in your inventory.  Your first order of business is to upgrade that gauntlet with a wood mining cell.  You'll need to check what you need to craft that cell and acquire the ingredients. So the game goes until you're completely outfitted with top tier armor and equipment.  While you do this, you'll explore many different biomes, and levels to get the needed ingredients.  Some people feel this is the end game, but for me the joy of this game has just begun.  Now You can get down to some creative building.  You can do this solo, or find a good server with like minded individuals and build to your hearts content.  There are also different multiplayer servers you can join, or start your own and list it in the Public Worlds forum for others to join.  PVE-player vs. environment is the most common. You'll find your peaceful builders here. PVP-player vs. player.  The people who like to steal, loot, blow up stuff, and hunt you can be found here.RPG- Role playing servers.  These are very interesting and can be lots of fun.Pros:Game updated every 2-3 weeks with bug fixes, and new content.Progressive equipment leveling upEnvironment explorationResource hoardingCraftingBuildingFarmingTaming mobs for pets you can then feed and harvest fromSolo or MultiplayerWonderful GraphicsInteresting MobsInteractive Development TeamFriendly and helpful community forumCons:All the cons I could talk about are being addressed by the dev team, and could very well be fixed by the time you read this review.Note on FTP and in-game store.:The devs have decided that only cosmetic additions to the game will be sold in the store.  There will not be anything that is required in the game to level up, or advance in the store.  This means you can have the full Creativerse experience without having to buy a single thing.  On top of that, the game just went free to play just over a month ago, and the devs have already given out 450 free coins for the Winter holiday update.Conclusion:If you want a difficult, mob killing game this won't satisfy. If you love sandbox games and building games this just may be your next great obsession.  The mobs aren't too difficult to beat, so it's great for kids, and casual game play.			"

								So, is this game another version of Minecraft? yeah, but just wait one minute there.. I HATED minecraft, way too much micromanagement and what not. i would have passed this one by, but it kept showing up on my reccommended lists and it was free, so i figured what the hell.So i enter the game, figure out how to use the blueprint for a very basic house. i figured i would spend 15 or 20 minutes, then delete the game and forget it forever.... alas this was just not meant to be....i gathered the materials, built the house, then started a mine and gathered more materials to expand the house... by the time i looked up...  9 hours had passed.... i was like... WTF?!?!? it was morning and i had no clue where the time had gone. so i get some sleep, my biggest frustration at this point is how the hell to make glass and i go to sleep thinking about it. i get up around noon, and think i've figured out the glass thing, so i get in to the game to test my theory, and i was right. at this point my house is good sized for a beginner, my mine is getting bigger, deeper. i'm progressing pretty good. so i go check out the store and end up using part of the 450 gold they gave me to buy a great big castle blueprint. i go about getting the supplies i need to build the thing, build it with a little help from people coming in and out of my game world, amd finally, the thing is built. i look up, its  6am........ my biggest frustration at this point? that i'm inturrupted when i'm playing by the pain in my bladder... the upside... my bladder is getting stretched out giving me more time between bathroom breaks to play.to say this game is mildly addictive would be a gross understatement. its fun, easy to figure stuff out, and the real challange is, can you get your ideas out of your head and in to the game... i'm working on it.

Review R35/R36/R37... Oct 27, 2016This game like so many has lots of potential.I write this review from the perspective of enjoying to build structures and crafts as I have little interest in PvP, and people should learn to be creative together rather than destructive.Briefly about the gameLike in ""Minecraft"" you just spawn in the middle of an area with a few supplies and are left to your devices.  You are given a note advising you to find shelter before dark or face the unknown.You have a power glove that can harvest resources by pulling them towards you, which when you have enough can be used to craft and create other blocks allowing you to build what ever your imagination can dream up.Block recipes are learned as you acquire contents, craft other items, find them in treasure chests, or take them from the native life.  Many mobs are hostile all the time, at night and are burned away with the rising sun.This world operates very differently from other mining/building games by increasing the difficulty as you dig deeper and build higher.  The deeper you mine the tougher the materials to break and the harder the native mobs.  At higher altitudes its very very cold and you need a heat source to avoid freezing to death.  In addition to vertical temperature changes you also experience changes as you move from region to region ( for example tropical is warmer than forest or snow ).As the sun crosses the sky shadows of the buildings being created will  stretch forth for a nice affect.You must keep exploring and searching or some recipes will never be known.  Once found they are yours for good if and only if you have paid for the Pro version.During the progress of the game you can tame various animals, once tamed if feed and washed they will yield some resources or even recipes.   Don't expect to get them without a fight, even in peaceful mode.  This aspect seems a little childish to me.. and probably more oriented to ten year old's teaching them to look after their pets.WARNING do not use the free 300 coins to buy any claims, as you will loose the benefit in other worlds.  Only the bought recipes will be available in other worlds.Pro's:Texture detail is high resolution and merge almost seamlessly with each other making for better looking walls and floors.You can hold a large volume of items in your inventory, ( lets face it 1 cubic foot of steel weights 490lbs in reality so its never real ), so as far as gaming is concerned a large inventory stack ( 99 ) saves a fair amount of time.You can craft items directly from your inventory as long as you have the stock.You don't need to eat to play the game... only to heal yourself.You can use TNT to blow up useless terrain, and the rare valuable ores are maintained.Ores are more bountiful than some other games.You have teleporters to travel almost anywhere, which adds a nice touch.  Each one can be coded to allow access to specific  other teleporters.Block orientation within Creativerse has a nice addition, you can rotate most blocks into different positions.  For example slabs can be placed on edge allowing the creation of narrower walls etc...  Tapered roofing can be placed on the ends of gable roofs giving a correct feel and look. The wiring and electronics available within the game is superior and does not take up extra space.  You also have number pads to enter values within the game for some nice security features.Cons: Boring, Boring, boring... not sure why the point but I've just spent the last 9.8 hours looking for recipes for the new xmas features to only discover about 60% of them.. basically a waste of 9.8 hours of my life... no building, just mindless pointless jumping around searching for recipes. I've decided to dump this game since the develper obviously does not care about my time.This is a pay to keep playing game, even after you buy the ""Pro"" version, you still can't play locally.Single Player and offline are not available period, due to server authentication.   So if the server is down or runs out of cash you are done.You must claim land by one of two methods, pay real cash to buy coins, to buy land or harvest expensive ores to pay for them.  At first its coal, then obsidian, then diamonds, then lumite (very hard to find in large quantities without wasting a ton of time. To smelt blocks and Items you must click once for EACH piece to enter the furnace. ( a very bad idea that can lead to  potential physical injury ( I speak from experience ).To process blocks and items you must click once for each piece. They have a collect all button but not a process all, and its 21 clicks to fill the machines.To place items you must click once for each piece.Recipes found are not retained from world to world unless you pay for the pro version.More slab shapes could be enabled in various hue's to better match the building materials in play. This con was addressed by R36 now have lots of slabs and new slopesColours in some blocks look like they came from totally different palettes  ( for example 3 iron blocks belong and look in place while the corresponding stairs don't match at all ).Their are very few mechanisms, only doors, pressure switches and fans to interact with players.  Currently I'm not aware of a way to hide a pressure plate. ( No pistons)I've played the game for a long time and even with a ""Pro"" version I'm missing many recipes.Timing errors occur between family members playing over the Lan and obviously sharing a connection to the server.Buggy, but they do make an effort to fix them.Due to the high high repetition of clicking and the lack of single player  and offline, I can not honestly recommend the game, and personally feel its doomed to fail.  If you are a casual builder that comes on once in a blue moon then you may not have any issues, but serious large scale builders will not be happy if their efforts just vanish one day without a trace.  I also personally feel that if you've got the ""Pro Version"" you should be able to retain the game and play offline, including ""Lan"".PS.. Comment to steam... life is not black and white... we need a star rating system in addition to Yes/No 7/10 stars.			"

								I used to run a couple MC servers with nearly 100 mods installed on each, plus I've made some tweaks to existing mods, spendind thousands of hours, so I'll just compare (+/-) Creativerse to Minecraft, because it's basically a MC's descendant+ beautiful consistent built-in graphics+ very convenient harvesting/mining+ resourceful crafting with detailed info+ recipe learning/discovery+ useful pets!!+ better Survival experience+ runs smoother+ blueprints (although in a very basic state atm)+ tons of tweaks which MC annoyingly lacks and force players to install tons of mods(the list would be too long to go through)- MC has got tons of items/recipes- MC is more complex (redstone!, pistons etc etc.)- unlimited MC world- lots of MC mods allowing to construct factories, production lines and even basic computers(!) or just add anything else you'd imagine- huge MC community with thousands of public servers (PVP, parkour, RPG)- dedicated serversIf I were to compare VANILLA Minecraft to Creativerse, then I'd go with Creativerse. However what really makes MC a true breakthrough in the whole gaming genre is it's community (with mods and customizations). Creativerse is still in production, so it might come as an interesting alternative to MC one day, but definitely won't supercede it.But should you play this game? Creativerse is well designed, has really entertaining gameplay, and it's free...so why not?			"

								This is a refreshing start for Survival games. I've been playing Minecraft for over 3 years now and I got fed up a long time ago. Yet, Creativerse has a new and fresh look to it, which makes it super fun to play, for Minecraft players and for those who have never played Minecraft.After playing for 13 hours, here's my list of pros and cons:PROS:- Amazing textures and graphics- Beautiful ambience and sounds- Large variety of mobs and items- Great amount of building blocks and possibilities- Complex, mysterious and very well made spooky cave system- Teleporting system- When you die, you don't lose all your stuff nor progress- Awesome crafting system, with recipes, challenges and more- Spawning of random chests throughout the world- Farms and plenty of cool contraptions to make- Easy to play with friends, for free- Plenty of furniture to decorate your home- Addictive and challenging- Cool GUI/HUD- Temperature system- You can own pets and take care of them, dress them and bathe themCONS:- The server side system makes it buggy, laggy and glitchy- The characters aren't (yet) customizable at all- Upon launch it will be free to play, which makes me afraid of seeing this game turning to the micro-transactions dark side - Still has plenty of bugs (most of the times are fixed by relogging, but still annoying)If you are thinking about wether you should buy it right away or wait for launch, I would recommend you to buy it right away, these devs definitely deserve the support for such a great game.Thank you!

								This game has been a godsend for my wife and her son. We are stationed overseas and couldn't bring Mattie (my 5 year old stepson) with us. He was really big into Minecraft but setting up a personal server and playing without lag was a huge issue. Creativerse makes it so easy for my wife and Mattie to play together on their Skype dates :)I personally play this game almost every day. I've been so impressed at how ""polished"" this game is and it's only in Alpha! The visuals are easy on the eyes and the gameplay is satisfying. The Devs are fairly active in the forums and come out with new releases every 3-4 weeks. This game opens it's doors to many different play styles ie. builder, designer, crafter, organizer, miner, gatherer, hunter, explorer, etc... Some gamers think Creativerse is a Minecraft clone, well... That is far from the truth! Just check out the various forum posts that help explain the difference. I highly recomend this game for anyone who enjoys this genre, but you don't have to take my word for it... ;)			"

								Basic things that should be in the game are not, like the ability to repair items.The game seems to heavily revolve around combat against neutral and hostile monsters in order to get items to make armor so that you have a chance at actually surviving more than one or two monsters that fight back.There is no tactics to this game, you are forced to go toe to toe and trade blow for blow.It doesn't seem that anything is reusable and crafting items takes real world time instead of just the resources.The game seems to really try to push the whole 'pro' package, which to be honest, doesn't interest me in the slightest after seeing what rudimentary things are missing from the base game.It was momentarily enjoyable but I don't care to play anymore. It feels regurgitated.			"

								The game has lots of potential and we've gotten much enjoyment from it up to R16. That being said I'm glad it was a gift from a friend and Playful was kind enough to give me a few keys for my son and some friends to try the game. As the game stands right now myself, my son and the few friends that did play pretty much stopped playing. If you're looking for more of a survival game experience then you probably will enjoy the game. If you're looking for creative freedom to build and explore maybe killing a few of the world's increasing variety of creatures then that's becoming harder to do with the latest updates. Totally put off by the new elemental damage introduced to the game. Forces you to micromanage more now because you need potions to counter the effect where before you could just explore and have fun as long as you stayed a few blocks away from lava or corruption. It takes the fun out of exploring for us. You now also take damage in cold and hot zones even when inside your own home?! No thank you. If you plan on doing little exploring and stick to the level mid surface ground then you'll be fine, bored, but fine. The whole server only play isn't always great either. On more than a few occasions I've noticed clunky lag times when playing side by side on the same world with my son. Also you can't play if the server is down for any reason, but luckily that hasn't been an issue up to this point.Water physics still need work, but are improving. There are some times you need to fight to get out of water or you may get sucked into a pocket of water that's hard to break free from. Update R16 was just such a disappoint after so many hours playing. We went back to Minecraft for its ability to switch between peaceful & survival modes on the fly. Also the ability to have unlimited resources to enable the building of anything as well as all the great mods. Much easier to have creative fun specially for the younger kids playing. We've also started playing lots of Terraria.I'll keep checking on the game every few updates, but I'll not be playing like I was once. Wish them well.I recommend it to survival game fans when it's released as F2P or the early access is on sale next.			"

Early Access Review
								When I tried this game for the first time, I was put off by the ore mining system. After giving it a second shot and actually going further than ""my first mining experience"", I found out it's a great game and mining system isn't that bad at all. However, as any game that there is, Creativerse does have a few drawbacks.  PROS	+  building You have quite many types of blocks available, more can be found throughout the world or unlocked by crafting. It allows you build realistic things and you also have furniture available, so you don't have to pretend some particular stairs and wooden sign make up a chair like you did in Minecraft, but rather craft a real good looking one. It even has many types and color of lighting, with this every room can have different feel and it's literally builder's heaven. I enjoyed my creations much more than in MC and you can actually interact with some of the objects (sitting on chairs). +  graphics Finally a building game with blocks, that doesn't look straight outta 2004. Great textures, lively colors, sunlight rays, motion blur, good stability, you got it all. +  crafting Crafting is based on discovery upon obtaining certain item or crafting. This means if you want to make diamond sword, you cannot just make it without having crafted all other types of swords that are before it. This could be a drawback to some, but I didn't mind it. Also you no longer have to go and search everything on the wiki, all recipes are shown, no crafting tables, yay! It also tells you where to get the item, so I'd say crafting is fun and rewarding. +  miningSomething I didn't like at first, but ended up loving it. If you want to mine, you have to craft an extractor first, yet these are easy to get (you need just wood and stones) and extracting takes some time. It ranges from 1 minute (not exactly sure), but caps at 10 minutes for rarest ore. I didn't mind using it and you can craft better extractors, it adds the futuristic feel to the game and it's not bugging you, as from 1 block you can extract up to 6 ores, so actually you'll end up with more and it's not bad at all. Ores and fairly easy to find, maybe a bit too easy. +  free servers for everyoneIn this game you don't have to pay for a server, you can just open your own for your friends, protect it with password, etc. Also people can buy these protected chunks of land which are really huge and they cost just a few coals. Prevents griefing a lot so in this aspect it's awesome, easy to play with a friend and secure. +  taming and pet system You can tame any pet in this game, then you should (but you don't have to, it's immortal) feed the pet, wash it for it to give you gifts (useful items). Entire process of taming is a bit tedious, as you just ring the bell in front of the pet and there could be some sort of minigame with multiple difficulties, to make it more interesting, Also, monsters sometimes bug out and they don't attack you, so makes taming easier. +  dying system I actually called it dying system, ha. When you die, this game is not as punishing as minecraft. It marks place of your death on your compass and you got plenty of time to get in there and obtain all your items. Also, you got this mini device and wherever you put it, you're able to teleport to it anytime, so moving out of caves isn't digging up and praying to lava gods or getting lost trying to get out then ending up with option #1. +  explosives! In this game you got many options how to f**k s**t up and it's not just TNT. +  mining/collecting animation In this game you say goodbye to axes, shovels and pickaxes, for all of these there's this cool futuristic glove that kind of sucks in the blocks to your inventory, it's extremely satisfying and fast. +  funny and original item descriptions I really like to read stuff and based on certain item descriptions or game telling you stuff, the devs seem like funny people and I'd definitely love to see quests in this style as well.  NEUTRALS =  gardening/cooking This is what you'd see in Minecraft, exactly the same farming formula and same with cooking, except not many meals can be cooked and you'd find feeding them to your pets more than to yourself. Currently there's no reason to eat food, as you don't have hunger bar, only hp bar and meals only extend it, they don't fill it up. To get full health you'll just suicide or get hit by mobs till you die so your hp resets. =  character customization I put it as neutral, because you won't ever be looking at your character, but if you're a person like me, you'll appreciate it. In this game you unfortunately only change your gender and colors of pre-made outfit. It's not a big deal, but it's something. CONS 	-  variety of mobs By the time you'll be a few hours in game and not having spent lots of time with building, chances are, you've already seen all the enemies and  killed them. There are 2-4 (or so) types of enemies per biome and also a few types of night monsters, but if you live in certain biome, it'll get boring rather quick with the variety. But I do believe later on new will be added, as this is still early access game.  -  not enough of things to do  I didn't get to this point yet, but I've got just 17 hours in game (of maybe which 15 is the actually gameplay) and I've already killed all types of mobs and mined the rarest kind of ore and I have loads of it. At this point, only thing I can think of doing is maybe a  diamond toilet  pet collecting or more building, but you do get the point.  -  combat  Not the most impressive thing you will see. You got a bit clumsy sword swinging and that's about it. It's pretty chaotic and you got no skills, I wish they added bows or guns. -  water physics In short, if you want to have more than 1 block deep pool, you'll be pulling your hair trying to fill it up with water.  -  few minor bugs For example after you teleport you can see underground and it won't go away, also when you randomly walk sometimes you can see all the underground caves, but don't take this in account, as it's just early access game.  Conclusion	Creativerse is one of the the better block building survival games and let's not call it Minecraft clone, as everything in gaming industry could be called a clone with this logic. I think if the devs put more work in variety of content, the game will truly shine, but in its current state it's already solid 7.5/10, that I'll definitely put more of my time into. I'd definitely recommend this game. LPT - get a friend to play with, boosts the fun factor by a lot!			"

								This game has quite a few features that simlar games do not like placeable teleporters, you can tame anything and then feed/milk it for its loot table, and very involved friendly devs to name a few.  It does not have any automaion/engineering ATM, NPCs, or Mods but a large chunk of what they dont have they know most of us want and are open to adding it if it wasnt already planned (Early Access still in development and all).It is a pretty well functioning game, runs well and have encountered only one bug when my friend was declaring war on the terrain with explosives.  It is now F2P, with the only in game purchases being cosmetics (Different blocks) and fireworks.Im not really a huge fan of EA and all the downsides it entails but I am actually enjoying this quite a bit especially since you can make a private world with friends (All servers are on their end so that can be good or bad for you depending on preference).  The one absolutely huge thing that will keep me in is the friendly and helpful devs which are quite active in the forums.  Example, in the middle of the night for North America, servers went down and within a few hours they were posting on the forums and had them back up.  I also had my world go down for 50 mins once.  After 45 mins I finally put in a ticket, and even though the problem resolved on its own I had a dev come into my world and check to make sure everything was ok 37 mins after putting in the ticket.  They might not always be this fast but often they are and always working hard to find out what their players want.  Gotta love that =)			"

								Hello everyone! This'll be a medium to long review.Okay, so first of all, I don't play alot of games like this. The only one I've played similair to this is Terraria.That being said, I was drawn to it because it's free and it looked okay.I actually really like Creativerse as a whole, even though I've played for 3 hours total when writing this review.It's open world is quite immersive, and it doesn't take ages to find other biomes and explore. Night-time is dangerous but the creatures look really awesome!Building/crafting isn't that hard and pretty much explains itself. Which is good in my book.. It's a good book. 'cos it's my book.RIGHT!PROS:+ Graphics: Smooth graphics and it runs rather smooth aswell. Even the blocks have detail! The scenery is often breathtaking even though it's made from blocks. It's beautifull!+ Relatively easy crafting:  As said above, the crafting explains itself. That being said, recources aren't that hard to come        by in early stages appart from exploring but I figure it'll get alot harder later on.+ Bestiary: Since I always want to read up on monsters before I actually encounter them, I came across a relatively large bestiary. From pig..things.. to  Things. It's pretty diverse and each spawns within it's own biomes and Lord help me if I find myself in a cave!+ Biomes: As diverse as the bestiary, as diverse are the different biomes to explore. Didn't take long before I found myself in a jungle.. at night time... getting nuked by creatures I was trying to run from. 10/10 would explore again!+ Mining: Okay, so it's not actual mining with a mining pick. Why not? Because that's boring. And who uses a mining pick when you have a cell-powered WABBAJA-  ehm.. MINING GLOVE! That's right! You just rip blocks out of their comfort zones and put them in your dark, dusty inventory only to be processed into more usefull things like rods or slabs.CONS:I can't really think of any major flaws. It's early acces, what would one expect? Goats stay on the ground? Wrong, I saw a couple fly into the air... Which was quite the hilarious sight, I might add. So... so far so good! I hope the developers keep up the good work as I, and many others, would probably want to see more awesomeness!11/10 Would recommend to anyone who likes exploring, gathering, crafting, surviving, building your own secret laboratory and slap pigs with a stick! No pun intended.11/10 Would play again! Which I'm going to do. "

Creativerse: A bunch of Texans thought they could outdo a bunch of Swedes at their own game. Arguably, they succeeded.Creativerse closely adheres to the famous mantra, “Everything is bigger in Texas”. Here are some examples:-Bigger jump height (two blocks)-Bigger trees-Bigger blocks-Bigger swordsThe gameplay has many similarities to the genre-setting Minecraft but still has enough differences to provide a unique experience. For instance,-Pine cones are actually fragmentation grenades.-You can beat up crabs and steal their coral.-You can’t drown in mineral water.-You can enslave creatures with a cowbell. Then you can subject them to a life consisting of bachelor showers, mushroom diets and daily rectal exams.-You can pull things out of your slaves pets’ butts using the Force.-You can beat up creatures and steal their eyeballs. Then use those ill-gotten eyeballs to create swords.-Mineral water can heal everything from flesh wounds to Charlie Sheen-grade HIV.-You can become corrupt without ever running for public office.-You can slow cook yourself with burning moss.Even though Creativerse is still in Early Access, it feels like a fully fleshed out game. It can now only get bigger and better (like Texas?) with future updates.			"

								Pretty fun game  to play with your friends for a few hours, but devs ♥♥♥♥ed it up.It is like minecraft, but much more combat-wise, and it is actaully pretty fun, UNTIL they decided you couldnt make more than 1 world and you couldnt turn off PvP if you didn't pay.That ruined the game.EDIT: Many people are saying that I should just buy the game, but at first, the game was playable for free, now it isnt. And I am not going to pay €20 for something that I would enjoy for only 10 hours.			"

								Update 2 -- The devs have added a lot to the game since launch, but their approach to the payment system in the game and how they are handling it is what is going to kill it, or stop people from playing. They refuse to remove the microtransaction structure etc. You are 100x better off playing ANY other voxel based game that doesn't ask for microtransactions for the whole reason they exist (creativity) The game its self is fine in playability, you can get a lot out of it, but expect paywalls when you want to build a base as cool as your friend has. I had high hopes for this game, nevermind 2/10			"

								It's like Minecraft, but enough of a difference that makes it a game in it's own right. Has features out of the box that Minecraft doesn't, like block rotation and mobs that can be tamed into pets. A lot of nice tweaks over Minecraft, that comes with the game, no mods needed. HD graphics out of the box, no special texture packs needed, in fact it's better than HD texture packs for Minecraft. Processing machines are better than vanilla Minecraft. Can put multiple stacks in at once. Recipes are easier. You just have to have the required materials, then tell the crafting menu to make it, no more arranging items on the crafting table. In fact there is no crafting table, craft at home or on the go!Will allow modding in the future with hopefully a better system than Minecraft offers. So far the game play is fun and just makes sense. However it is pretty similar to vanilla Minecraft, not a whole lot of tech machines and items or trains/tracks/carts, has it's own unique items though. It's still in development and could offer a lot more than that in the future through the game itself or when modding is enabled.Isn't a memory hog like Minecraft, though there isn't 50 mods loaded with it. Runs smooth on max settings, 1080i			"

""A Voxel World full of cute piglets and chameleons""An immersive sandbox & crafting game which is just amazing. Honestly I knew it longer but didn't want to spend 10 EUR for it. Now it's F2P and offers the whole content and even some free blueprints. All MTs can also be made with resources payment (zone claims, blueprint buys). Ofc comparsions to Minecraft can be made. But this game has primarly a focus on HiRes graphics and liquid animations of many different kind of specimen (overly cute comic style!). You'll be sucked in easily into this cycle of crafting & building, farming  crops, taming specimen and gathering minerals. The receipts are not too unfair. So you mustn't grind long for resources (except Iron ore seems pretty rare).Little complaints about the graphics performance: sometimes you see through unrendered blocks down to lavaworld. Also the game seems to run in some Flash webbrowser mode. On my highend gaming laptop it has the same performance than on my old office notebook. And the RAM memory usage is constantly 1.5 gigs.Also the melee fights (only swords as weapons) are pretty unsharp. Enemies hit you from far distance and even through cavewalls. Another thing is travelling the whole map shows you always the same bioms over and over again.But after you crafted yourself up to the highest gear the game has still some more to offer. The building ideas are limitless. The first 100 hours went away very fastly. Still have something to build even after gathering Lumite from the Corruption ...			"

								      Gotta say, upon first looking through the reviews, I WAS NOT going to pay for this sucker right now. There was a decent spread between positive and negative, but most of the positives were pretty non-specific ("" Oh boy! What an AWESOME game, blah blah blah"")  while most of the negatives were QUITE specific and QUITE negative. A lot of talk about it basically being ""pay to ACTUALLY play"", terrible people online, no dev support, no single player (despite it being a listed feature), etcetera etcetera.           Now maybe I shouldn't say TOO much, considering I've only played single player thus far (yes, it DOES exist), but I actually like the game a lot. I haven't encountered any of the negative stuff I read about and it's actually pretty darn good. The crafting feels a lot more intuitive and straight-forward than minecraft, plus you actually get RECIPES to work from (novel concept, right?), the graphics are a touch cartoony, but great looking nonetheless, and the way things like crafting machines and some textures look lend an almost steampunk-y/ torchlight-y feeling, which I really dig. Also, there is ONE thing you need to craft for ALL your mining/digging/chopping needs! Not a shovel...AND a pickaxe... AAAANND an axe AAAAAANND a hoe.... AAAAAAAANNNNDD shears.... aaanndd you get the idea.          I have encountered a few goofy bugs, which, as annoying as they may be at times, are TO BE EXPECTED in an alpha. I haven't come across anything that either stopped gameplay or was a personal deal-breaker yet though. I also can't really give input on dev. involvement since I haven't had reason to try to reach them (yet, I'll remember to update this if I DO).            COMBAT! Now maybe it's only because I've been doing a lot of building and exploring rather than dedicated mining or spelunking, but it does KINDA feel similar to minecraft in that they've added some combat reliant things to a game that isn't really combat based. Let me try to explain that: monsters are scattered throughout the world, right? well some of them drop things you MUST HAVE for certain recipes. Fine. Great. The only hitch is that all you've got is a sword and whatever level armor you've managed to craft. Now, like I said, I haven't been super focused on rare resource gathering so maybe this is just my personal failing, but with 2nd tier armor (obsidian) and a 2nd tier sword (more of a stone club) I still have a good bit of trouble with even NORMAL daytime mobs, nevermind the psycho critters in the caves. Additionally, that sword and armor you burned resources to make is durability based, and each progressive tier seems to require a lot of the same materials as the prior tier, which culminates in a problem trying to move to the next tier because you keep having to use the same stuff you want to use to move up on replacements of the lower tier armor & sword just so you can keep going outdoors!! The only real plus I've come across in that respect is how they've managed deaths and respawns. If/WHEN you die, an urn with ALL your stuff in it appears at your spot 'o' death and, as far as I can tell, stays there indefinitely. This urn is marked on your compass and has a light beacon sort of deal shining up from it, which makes it pretty easy to find once you've respawned at your little spawn setting tile (which is move-able).            Sorry, little ranty, I know. That's just one of those things I've always found a little annoying in minecraft and was disappointed to find it here too, although Creativerse is not AS BAD as minecraft about it.             SO, long story short? Good game. Single player anyway. Multi might just be hell, I don't know, but single player is pretty great. Good crafting, good atmosphere, good graphics, easy to learn, and FUN.			"

								I am not going to lie I loved this game. Note I said loved. The devs decided to take the game down the path from f2p to pay to win. At first I understood you could buy currency in game to use that to buy certain things or to speed it up. I was perfectly okay with that. But the devs decided to make it so you have pay to buy more than 1 world and to do basically anything now. It was a good run Creativerse I had fun playing you with my friends but I guess good things can not last forever.			"

								This might be the WORST optimized game ever, I mean SERIOUSLY!? I have a 2Gb graphic card, and 3.30 GHz Processor and it still lags like sh@t on lowest graphic. I did not buy this game (one of my friends irl gifted it to me), and I really feel sorry for that guy. This game is NOT worth wasting 20 Bucks/Euro on. Also, when I started to play this game there was no tutorial, NOR a guide to show how to start so the only thing I could do, so I was jerking around having absolutely NO idea what to do. I know this is an ""Early Access"" game, but I think the price is too high.			"

								Creativerse is a leap forward from Minecraft.  I would judge it to be twice as far a leap as minecraft is from Infiniminer.The game is fluid and fleshed out.  Game mechanics are very easily learned and mastered.  The sheer number of blocks you can build with is amazing.  Craftable blueprints really make the game special and different from Minecraft, and more like Planet Explorers.Multiplayer servers are handled by the game developer, and are easy to play on.  Some admin tools exist, and more are on the way.This game has much more potential fun than any other block based game, bar none.I highly recommend this game!			"

								Let's talk creativers, we all seen a lot of voxel games popping up after the big success of Minecraft, some are so poorly done you regret ever buying the game. With Creativers it's different, currently in early access it has already surpassed Minecraft in my opinion. With for starters having free multiplayer so no need to pay 60$ just to run a proper server. What got me interested from the start was the feature of having all recipes shown on the crafting grid so there was no need for Wiki to find out ""how to craft a door"". And finally the vanila graphics are much more easier on the eyes, a quote from Minecraft players that gave it a good description [imo] was, ""It like running on a high definition texture pack with shaders""So...? What is a Voxel game? The Voxel genre describes a world where you can alter your environment, every thing can be picked up and placed back again or used in a crafting recipe. In this game exploration is key, by doing this you are often rewarded with unique recipes and various items that you will need in your craft.The crafting system is based on progression, meaning that crafting one item wil unlock new items. The goal of this game is focused on exploring and creativity, having the ability too build anything you want and show it of to your friends or letting them join in and build something together. Griefing is one of the most feared aspects in this genre, you don't want people to destroy you creations. No need to worry there, the developers have this covered.In Creativers you have many options preventing this, by means of passwords, make other players visitor by default, (meaning that when they enter your world they can only look and not interact), turn off/on pvp and disabling explosives.Early access, i must admit it the most over abused features Steam has, 70% of the game never become what the devs are promising the game is gone be and as a player you feel cheated out of your money. With Playful and their game creativers it's different, The developers really are on top of this with good communication and a good ear to what the community has to say, on top of that every player has had there money back true ingame currency up to more then what was invested. The release of new things to do in this game is on a fast track, with only one month in between each new patch.Free to play. We all know this word very well, with most games it's a pay to win scenario or just a paywall all together. in Creativerse the developers only put decoration and blueprints of buildings in to shop and that's it really, of course people that bought the game in its early access state can already buy these object with there free ingame coins they got from supporting the Developers. On release Creativerse will become a free to play game, and with the money they earn from players buying from the shop they hope to further expand the game.Isn't this a copy of Minecraft? This question is in my opinion narrow minded, It's like Doom and Wolfenstein without them you never had Cod or CS. True that Minecraft was the first of its kind but the experience is different, Creativerse adds a lot of new features of its own to the Voxel genre and the Developers have much more in store for this game.*Let's talk downsides then, Because this game is still in early access there are still issues that need to be ironed out, that said, these issues are not game breaking and to be honest i seen non early access games come out with more issues than Creativers. *I think the biggest downside in my opinion will be for people that wait for this game to be released due to that by that time there will be alot of decorations you want out of the shop and it will set you back some money to have them, For people that bought the game this will be far less because at the  moment there enjoying free daily coins. And true that you don't have to buy anything from the shop, for a gamer like me the compulsion is great to want them all.*Last downside for this game is the need for internet access, even in single player your world is still run on a server, there free with no rent but for people that have no internet access this game can not be played.Conclusion, Creativers is becoming a must have Voxel game if your a fan of the genre. With an ever growing feature list surpassing any other Voxel games, its worth the money invested in, and i will go so far then to say, ""If your waiting for the Free To Play version? DON'T!!!"", yes all the shop  items are decorations that you don't really need, in the end you want to have them all anyway. by investing before this game is Free To Play you not only get your money back in ingame currency but also get free coins everyday till the game is ftp.

								Creativerse is similar enough to Minecraft to be its free substitute, but has enough different content to be interesting to people who already own Minecraft. You pull blocks towards you using the Force and can jump 2 blocks high. Torches can actually set your thatched roof on fire. You 'discover' new blocks and recipes in a tiered system that means you don't ever have to remember recipes. You can even track required ingredients as you gather them. I enjoyed going through the levels of the earth, down to the 'corruption' level, which is essentially filled with Dark side energy that slowly kills you. SImilarly, there's mineral water found on the surface that gradually heals you, much like spring water from Biomes O' Plenty. There are fans that work like arcane levitators from Thaumcraft. There are teleporters and you can warp back to your spawn point at any time. Death statues appear holding all your items after you die, much like Openblock's graves.The devs don't support modding as of yet, but I found that even I, as someone who loves mods in Minecraft, was satiated with all the different blocks and items in the game. Some of the blocks are gorgeous, like lumite and diamond glass. Some of the trees are so massive and impressive that you just have to spend 10 minutes climbing them. And no lag! The visuals are good quality even with an integrated graphics card.Overall, if you like the sandbox genre and Star Wars, you'll have a blast with Creativerse.			"

 First off I would like to say that this game has among the best community of players I have ever encountered online. Everyone is super helpful and nice, very collaborative and community oriented. Let's keep this trend going!Now this is a sandbox game!I am absolutely loving this game, it's addicing and rewarding, everything about this game is fun to do.A breif overview of the game.You start off in a random location on the world map, which currently there are only 4 variants off which is unfortunate, but hopefully soon they will be procedurally generated. You have a Twig with which to hit things to kill them and harvest their loot, and a basic Mining Core/Gauntlet. You go kill Piglets, Boars, Leafis, things of that nature to collect Hide, Tusks, Sinew, Bone, etc. As you travel you can collect the trees, dirt, water, honey, etc in order to upgrade your Mining Core. Build up your core, mine around, explore, fight things, collect flowers/mushrooms. Make a Forge and Processor, create armor and weapons, other neat things. Furniture, what have you.Mining Ore in this game is different. Instead of Clicking on it and standing there until you Pop it, you place an Extractor on the Ore Node which will harvest it for you, giving you time to go and look around for more ore while it processes. Come back and poof, there's 12 Coal Ore, or Obsidian or what ever it might be. It's a very interesting take on it and it's a lot of fun. Well anyway I'm rambling on about nothing, but it's a LOT of fun and it's still in early access. Tons of fun, and immense potentil.  Overall Rating  8/10 Oh, also, if you are crying about the game having a price tag now, get over it. Grow up, get a job. It's 20 bucks. That's like, what, less than 2 hours of work? I see so many people complaining about how they ""ruined"" the game and made it ""pay to win"" - it isn't. You can either A) Pay nothing and expierence 100% of the game, or B) Pay the nominal one time fee of 20 bucks, and get a bunch of goodies, and be able to create multiple worlds, and also help fund  the dev team for more updates in the future.Stop being so entitled to free stuff. This real life. Money doesn't grow on trees. Nothings ever free.			"

								First things first, this is my highest recommended game in my library. If you enjoy sandbox crafting type games especially voxel based ones, this game is incredible.I have put in hundreds of hours and have met and played with tons and tons of other players jumping around different community worlds and creating several of my own, built worlds with themes, giant castles, small homes, crazy farms, petting zoos, world trees, villages, temples, the list goes on and on. The multiplayer aspect of this game is amazing and the community is truly great I have met so many awesome people on this game and I honestly couldn't have asked for a much better experience.The game has awesome mechanics like the option to rotate blocks or the use of slabs, stairs, or tables to hide your lights, now with the awesome things people are making with machines and the fact that they are still adding to the game giving you so many possibilities. The real heavy hitter in my recommendation though is the developement team. I have never in my life experienced such a responsive team that quickly implements what people ask for or fixes bugs and will sit there and go back and forth on subjects with you to get the fix you need to enjoy their content. Even better is if you have done something amazing and want to show off you can submit screen shots and they might mention your works or even come build on your world! The player developer interaction I think is important it helps both sides connect with each other and bring more enjoyment to the players game experience and the developers work experience. People ask for more slabs, stairs, and roofs, devs drop multiple new packs, players ask for machines with pressure plates and switches, we get much more than we asked for. Players are still asking for more and we are still getting more! For an early access game, this is the most complete, most enjoyable, and most exciting experience you could ask for. I have supported this game by purchasing extra cool shop texture packs, pro edition, and will probably continue to fund the game by purchasing whatever else they release because I know contributing adds to their susstainability and growth and from a game with this much in early access I can't imagine what it will look like a year from now. If you can handle communicating your issues to developers and talking over forums, and if you like sandbox builders this game offers a unique and enjoyable style to the genre like nothing i've played before.

								I went into this game with a firm expectation of yet another minecraft clone. And it is. But it's also a lot more. The controls are clearly largely based on that of minecrafts (not a bad thing, just an observation) but that and the blocky style is where the overlap ends. All sorts of well designed creatures, as well as an amazing art-style, makes this game an absolute beauty. I was skepticle at first, but after only five minutes I could tell I was going to like this. On another note, the crafting is very complex and fullfilling, with a blockheads-type feel to it in terms of the tiering system for each item crafted. Anybody who has seen this and had second thoughts due to the fact that it came out at the same time as all the other sandbox surivival games (some of which aren't that great), download this game with now, it's free, and you'll get hours upon hours of intriguing gameplay. Only complaints are that online has a few minor bugs, and once you've played one game the next feel slightly repetitive and tedious. Those complaints aside though, great game, very much recommended :)			"

								Downloaded it yesterday  (12/12/16), started playing with a friend who I used to play Minecraft with. Beautiful graphics,  nice crafting options and didnt get boring over 7 hours of exploring and building a bigger house next to my friends cottage. If you liked Minecraft, I can highly recommend this  game, if you dont like voxel-based Sandbox games, why are you even here?And  by the way, it is definitely not pay to  play  resp.  pay to win. If you dont buy the  pro-version you dont have a flashlight,   but you can build torches, and the glider is for the  same people  that   ride those little carts in Wallmart instead of walking. Regarding the fact that you have only 1 world in the free version, well, I am totally fine with that as I am just playing with           a friend, so I dont mind.Best regards,			"

								I believed the game was not free to play, yes? (correct me if im wrong) I put the game on my wishlist, maybe it didnt come out when I was browsing the game. But now, I SHOULD HAVE MET THIS GAME SOONER! This game has lots of features that minecraft vanilla could not cover: claiming area (protection against raider), free and all to use teleportation, no need to eat, no need to farm, just build whatever your dreamland is, suit up, and be creative.If you like Minecraft, but dont wanna buy server, code stuff, put command blocks here, plugin here and there, do lots of reading, then you better try this awesome game. Graphics and game crafting similar to Minecraft, you'll adapt quickly!Also the main feature: FREE SERVER (24/7) FOR ANYONE! You can make your own server, that anyone you want can join (with or without password). The server stays up even the creator left. So players can always come in and go anytime they want. No need to host/buy a freaking server, you can do it FOR FREE. NO COST AT ALL. (unlike minecraft where you have to pay a service in order to do it). I've tried dedicated server myself (only using pc to standby) and it's kinda pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for casual minecraft player like me. I cant keep my pc on 24/7.80/100 i recommend this game.Reccommendation for Devs:Make more of cosmetics for players and make it cheaper. Example: with 1 USD you can buy a wide range of clothes, hats, masks, pet item, etc. Currently the price is around 5 USD for some amount of coins, its not worth it for some of us :)Simpler crafting recipes! I do not like at all that you need to upgrade to Obsidian Cell, Iron, etc just to collect higher tier of resources. I need to start from bottom again if I lose my stronger power cell.Thanks. I love this game. Goodluck!			"

								I have played two other sandbox building games like this before, one of course is MINECRAFT (PE version) and the other is TROVE on steam. I have also been eyeing on ""PORTAL KNIGHTS"" which I can't afford, so obviously I went for this F2P game.In my first 5 hours of solo gaming with this game, I can say that it's a bit of a Minecraft clone but waaaaaay different. I also immediantly liked the gameplay on this better than Trove which I got bored of real quick. Let me give some Pros and Cons of this game.PROS:+ Very large and open world+ Minecraft-ish. If you enjoy games like Minecraft you'd definitely find this a whole lot better.+ The F2P content is very sufficient enough to fully enjoy the game.+ No cheats as far as I know. Makes the game more challenging.+ No creative mode, meaning more sense of achievement each time you build something.+ You can own regions of lands.+ Blueprint system makes it easier to build things.+ Good overall gameplay and crafting system with diverse mobs.+ Lots of potential if updated properly.CONS:- Glitchy.- Unpopular game, which is kinda sad.- Low population. Most Public worlds' population is only about 2-5 people a world.- Gets progressively boring unless they add more stuff to do in the game. You will eventually run of things to do.- Although has a lot of potential, I still feel like the game is lacking.If the developers would be bold enough to copy a bit more gameplay from games like Trove or Portal Knights, this game would rock! I feel like it needs a little it of RPG element :D			"

								Where to start? Honestly? I don't know where to start except to say that within the four (maybe five) days that I've had this game, I've put in 60.2 hours. That's both a pro and a con in my book. A pro because the game has me hooked, and a con because it has me hooked. Not a clean dish in the house, but do I care? No, because I finally found Lumite - dishes can wait. I mean. . . who needs real life stuff when you have Creativerse, yeah?But seriously, this game is Minecraft * 1000. To say the game is good is like saying Oxygen is 'meh'. It's not good, it's fantastic. So what do you do in Creativerse? You create your universe. Hit create world and jump in. Others can join it unless you password protect and/or turn pvp off, etc. We had a troll come into our map (our being my family) and he IMMEDIATELY starts bombing my wife. I had pvp turned off, so it was a fail, but he soon found himself kicked. He comes back and says ""I came here will ill intentions but that was before I knew there was a kick feature. I'm sorry I won't do it again.""My response?/ban - checkHe didn't come back. I couldn't hear anything over his QQ'ing and I didn't care, because my stomach was grumbling, couldn't find anything to eat on because all the dishes were dirty, but guess what? I found friggin LUMITE!!! Everything else pales in comparison. So, should you get this game? Well, I don't know - do you fun? I'll let you answer that question, then click the play button. If you don't click the play button, you don't fun. 10/10 - would ban again.			"

								My downloaded ""game"" changed from a free to play game to a limited feature free trial, also known as a Demo. By restricting my settings adjustment, I can't allow anybody the capacity to visit my one world. By limiting my world creation I cannot show this game to others as we play on a new world.  Nor do I wish to risk my one world to griefers. By creating a means of movement that only the players that paid for the ""pro version"", aka DLC, aka full version players are segregated from exploring together.This game seemed to have changed to a purchased game model, to a F2P model, then to a Demo/DLC paywall model. As such I won't be handing any money to this company because I can't be sure they won't change how they charge for the game. All while this game is in Early access too. Thus the word of mouth advertisment this game would have had gained is instead replaced with scorn.I'm glad I kept to my policy of not paying for a game's premium currency, especially when the game is still in development. I'm glad I didn't run into the game's fundraiser and thus hadn't bought a copy in advance. At least now I won't have to hassle steam for a refund because I disagree with the policy change.I don't begrudge a company the chance to earn money for its employees/investors for a product and/or service. I don't approve of the agreement being altered after the fact without my permission by the company. My bank did it by trying to apply a monthly fee so I changed banks. This game changed my full version game into a limited demo, so I dropped it. But ultimately I had given this game a chance because it didn't look like the buisiness model listed here:  And of course you can see somebody reviewing that software here on youtube :

								Looks good, plays smoothly, puts a few nice twists on MineCraft, so why not recommend it?Because Creativerse basically rushes you to the endgame and then there really is no point to it, other than the sandbox that other games also provide. With games like Factorio, once you complete it, there is the drive to complete it in other ways, or faster. With MineCraft, just getting to the endgame is a lengthy task and there is so much to do on the way, many people don't even realize it has one. And even most of the more linear sandbox games (with a linear technological progression in an otherwise fully open world), like Creativerse is, generally take their time.I'm not saying this game should have more of a grind, or make me walk longer distances. But being able to get from nothing to everything in a few hours, without even watching single YouTube video or reading a wiki on it, means there's just too little to figure out. And being able to teleport easily around the map is a great thing to develop, but it's just handed to you after some repetitive mining. There's no sense of discovery or achievement. It's just ""grind for a bit, here's a teleporter"".There's a couple of cool extras, like the logic gates and some of the technological 'blocks', but nothing that Gary's Mod or MineCraft didn't do better because there was a purpose to doing it.Play Creativerse for free, if you want to see if you agree, but I recommend not buying it until you disagree after playing it for 15 hours. I'll probably play around with it some more, but I doubt I'll get to the 100's of hours those other games got. On the other hand, if you feel $20 is a good price for 15 hours of fun (and I'm not saying it isn't), go right ahead - no major issues with this game.			"

Play this ONLY if you like Vanilla MinecraftI really wish Steam would allow us to give a Neutral, as well as a Positive or Negative rating to games, because neither of my two options feels completely appropriate (and I've only very reluctantly gone with the thumbs down).Just about every aspect of this game exceeds (vanilla) Minecraft. However, with no mod support, and online-only worlds precluding the community modding that took Minecraft from a rather bland voxel sandbox to an incredibly rich and diversely modded one, I just can't quite give this a Thumbs Up.From graphics, to creature and weapon diversity, to mining, to well, just about everything, Creativerse beats out Mojang's base offering. However, if you played a heavily modded Minecraft (for example, with Feed The Beasts Modpacks), you'll find the content offered by the game to be very limited.If on the other hand, all you played and/or all you want is a much better basic Minecraft experiences, sans all the optional extras the Minecraft community has added to Minecraft (Railcraft, OpenComputers, IndustrialCraft etc etc), then you'll find a very enjoyable game here.If you are in that second group, then I'd also suggest the $20 for Pro. You'll support the Developers, who clearly care about and have many plans for this game, as well as extending your own in-game options (particularly with more worlds).A very relucant thumbs down from me though.

								This isn't half bad. I don't really enjoy Minecraft but I enjoy this, for whatever reason; it's similar, but not really the same game. It's a bit more... progression-based is probably the best way to put it, although I hate to imply that it's anything like Dragon Quest Builders either.The free content here is more than sufficient, which was my initial concern, given that there's a paid option for more stuff. You can do pretty much anything you want to do. There's also the option to pay money, if having more fiddly little bits to build with suits you, or if you want some extra convenience features. If I put enough time into this, which I may or may not, it might actually be worthwhile to have the flashlight, etc., that come with the Pro upgrade, and the developers certainly deserve their share.

								Great game, I highly recommend this to anyone who at any point enjoyed minecraft, which is fair to say a wide variety of people have that play video games.This game is extremely fun and is obviously going to be compared to Minecraft due to the fact it is a voxel based game.Top marks to the developers :D Pros Music To whoever made the tracks in-game I offer you a high five my friend!Crafting The crafting system is very well made. For you to be able to create some items (mining cells for example) you need to create its less valuable counter-part. Which I for one really enjoyed on my first world because you don't know what you will unlock in the futureServers/worlds The system in-game for the worlds in amazing in my opinion and have found it to be rather extraordinary, probably because I have not encountered this kind of thing before. Every world you/your friend creates will save and for example if your friend leaves the world he creates whilst you're both connected, you will remain in world and are still able to play-through the game as per usual. I'm not entirely sure how it works but I have found it rather handy for this feature to be in game.Gameplay I personally was expecting this game to be a bit of a bum, probably because I instantly thought of the hundreds of minecraft rip-offs there are but my friend got it so we both decided to take the game ""For a spin"". Instantly we were both 'wowed' by the extensive world and great crafting system and number of new options available to us!Graphics There really isn't much to say about graphics but that they are very good for a voxel based game title, I was rather shocked with the detail of shading in some places and marvelled at the fab-u-lus view from my tree base. looking over the mountains.  -Cons  In my opinion this game is amazing so I'm going to name a few improvements I think could be made.Items I personally believe that this game should have a few more weapon choices (ranged) and extra armour/clothing too, some rare gear/items could be placed around the world with a somewhat 'mini-boss' guarding whatever the gear/items may be. Me and my friend have come up with a number of ideas such as 'Goo-Boots' which reduce fall damage/make you bounce without a block being underneath you. Items like this would be rather nice and would seperate this game from minecraft and other voxel titles even further.Character Customization I positive this has been said before and I'm sure it will be said again. This game would be amazing with customised characters, I'm not asking for the 'skins' from minecraft to be put in the game but I would quite like an RPG style customization in-game, even if it was just complextion, hair, eye and voices even that would be rather nice.Sounds I think it would be rather nice for your character in-game to have some voice emotes like laughing etc, this would again bring the game further away from other voxel based titles.Animations Along with the voice emotes, visual emotes such as waving could be added or even combine the visual and sound emotes together for example with the laughing emote.

								Ok so .. i recently upgraded to Pro and i thought i should atleast write a review about the core game. This game is definately to me far better than minecraft ever was or ever will be .. its like minecraft on steroids.. I love the music though its so soothing that sometimes it makes me sleepy and doze off lol .. The graphics are nicely done and the animations feel very solid. The crafting system doesnt leave you clueless and confused but instead guides you along your way with blueprints and informational tooltips that show you what is needed to either craft or unlock items that are either locked or unlocked respectfully. The game is 100% free to play and not a single dime is needed to be spent to unlock anything in this game. That being said you do have the option to spend real money for in-game premium currency to unlock special blocks and blueprints if you just dont feel like gathering the needed materials. There is also the Creativerse Pro DLC which unlocks a glider, flashlight, faster run speeds, longer sprint time before getting tired, more backpack space, the ability to change the way the sky looks, the ability to customize your world to your hearts content like changing all creatures to be friendly and turning off gravity for some pretty fun space walking (which makes it useful in some situations).I totally recommend getting this game and supporting the devs! These guys have done a tremendous job on this game and they push out updates very often. If your new to the building games or if your a master builder all kinds of play styles will find this game enjoyable and fun to play. "

								When it says, ""Free to Play"", thats their way of saying, ""Yes, you can play the watered down version that is not enjoyable, but at least you can have ONE world at a time, with no way of changing it. But you can spend $20 to have the Premium (AKA the game)""This game went from a glorious sandbox builder to a 'Pay to Play' in one update. The update that added Premium, a DLC which entited the owner to new items, new world options, and a exclusive block set. The catch? Well, lets just say you will wish you had the game sooner. The update removed ALL the world customizing options from non-premium owners. If you had a world that had implemented customizers, you were good. If not, you could only have 1 world at a time, with no way to have peaceful monsters, hard mode, reduced spawns, and more. (With the last update, 9/14 I believe, it removed all of my previous cusomizers) But if you have $20 laying around for no reason, this game is for you!Pros:-LOTS of different furniture pieces and decorative blocks-Varied monsters and creatures-Vast worlds with many biomes-Many types of ores and nature blocks-Free (to an extent)Cons:-Not really free per say-Not much for non-premium owners-Difficult to collect building recipes-Cusomization is a little weakOverall:This is an ok game for an Early Access. Lacking of certain aspects that could very much improve gameplay, this game has it where it counts. There is a lot you can do when it comes to building and exploring. But, Premium 'punishes' players that did not buy the beta, dramatically removing features for non-premium owners. Overall, this is a good game, far superior to games like Minecraft. But if you dont have any spare change, this game is not all it is shown to be.Thank you for taking the time to read this(Listed as a negative review only because of the premium... and the glitch that has me mad at this point)Have a nice day :D			"

								WOW what a great game.I want to start this review by addressing the two primary ""problems"" that are frequently mentioned in the  negative reviews for this game.1: Concerning restrictions on Non-Pro accounts. - I played this game for around 22 hours with a F2P/Non-Pro account and had an enourmous ammount of fun. The restrictions are not very limiting (at least for solo play, not sure for SMP). 2: Games aren't free to make, OF COURSE THEY HAVE A WAY TO MAKE MONEY FROM THIS GAME. - I want to be very clear here. I bought a pro account not to lift the restrictions. I bought a pro account because I wanted to pay the devs for making such a delightful game. Making games takes a lot of time, effort, and in many cases money. They are not being ridiculously greedy with this one (it's $20 people, not $60). Additionally, you absolutely DO NOT have to buy a pro account to fully enjoy this game. The Microtransactions that are available in-game are also not EVEN IN THE SLIGHTEST neccesary to play this game. Now that's out of the way, here's why I love this game:Creativers is a visually stunning, immersive, sandbox crafting experience. Very simlar to other crafting games (such as Minecraft) but with a lot of unique characteristics. The concept of ""blueprints"" is rather unique and enjoyable. Although admittedly the blueprints are not always the best looking structures.The addition of teleporters to the game is fantastic. I was at first concerned it would make the game too ""easy"" or ""boring"" to be able to TP to any of my bases, but holy cow is it useful and great.Long story short, it's a F2P game. Download it and try it out. If you end up enjoying it as much as me, I encourage you to buy the pro version FOR ONLY $20 to show the devs some support for making such a beautiful and fun game.Happy gaming!			"

Personal Rating : ""Could be better""Traditional Rating : 6.8/10Creativerse surely have so many potential to achieve, but still the game feels somewhat not desireable.The game itself works pretty well, with gameplay and mechanic similar to its predecessor, Minecraft. Little things here and there mostly the same; crafting, mining, mob killing, dungeon and underground cave, et cetera.Long story short; It's just an upgraded version of MinecraftUpgraded means there are some things that Creativerse offer more than the old, or is it?Positive :The graphics are beautiful, cloud, trees, and especially the backgrounds are stunning.More diverse crafting possibilities, with creation not just rely on benchwork, but with many other types of tools.More specific items for every needs; roof, wall, stair, floorfor now on this the only thing I can say to be the positive..Negative:Crafting is very hard to do here, for an item (like similarly iron sword), need so many ingredients and hard to find make it barely possible to create without depleting other item's durabilityMobs are just literally & figuratively painful, they look different but behave just the same. Not having different abilities or else.Health regen more like in real life; it get at least 3 days to heal, not even sleep make you full health again.Cave are no enter zone, the mobs too hard to defeat without proper equipment, but you need materials from inside the cave to make proper equipment. (and back to first point, where items durability are very short) :(Possible microtransaction in the future, there's a store page inside the game.No LAN or direct connection available, everything tied to the server in NAInability to play in offline is the worst, even when you have the world saved to your pc, you just can't. (already try steam offline mode, click on the .exe)My suggestion, this one is a promising game, but not that worth it for this time around, I hereby recommend for you to try—for people who wants to be involved in the progress of the game—.

								I picked up this game a few days ago and forgot about it. And then sunk my evening yesterday into it. For Minecraft players, they'll find this game familiar yet fresh and different. There are a few really minor thinga that make the play experience much nicer than Minecraft, for me. One major thing is jumping. You can jump 2 blocks straight up and you can jump across a pretty wide gap. The other thing is mining. Rather than stand there and swing your pickaxe like a fool, you simply place the gatherer, and walk away. Then when you come back when it's finished, and your ores are sitting there all nice waiting for you. Eating also isn't a necessity. Which I know will be a point of contention for some, but rather it's there to boost your play experience rather than hinder it. There are some other things, like falling damage, that are equally convenient but you won't notice so much.There are also features you may notice from many popular Minecraft full mods. The death beacon is a major one where you can collect your items you dropped on death (but your quick bar handily remains on your person!). Equally convenient and awesome are personal and craftable teleporters. You can set teleporters to travel to eachother, and players in your world can travel directly to your person teleporter. This is especially handy when playing with a friend and you're able to explore without a concern in the world about getting lost. There's also many different overworld mobs with different varieties for biomes. And dozens of items to pick up off the ground you'll think you're chasing butterflies in Skyrim.That said, there are a handful of things I find cumbersome coming from the super flexibile Minecraft background. First and foremost is recipe progression. Personally, I don't like having to 'find' recpies only after creating the items that are lower than it. Even though I can't create it, I like to see where I'm headded for eventually (a la Don't Starve). Also having to refine every item at the processor is a bit of a drag. It makes it so that your cave dives eventually have to turn back home or hole up and take a long pause while you refine the stone you need for more gatherers. I also found combat and taming to be quite clunky. I may not be getting the full grasp on how it plays properly but from what I gathered, you're pretty much guaranteed to take damage. The combat system heavily focuses on your gear rather than your ability to kite and hit. Taming falls on the same spectrum: while you're ringing your bell it seems like you just stand there and take damage. There are a few non-obvious ways to avoid taking damage, but I'd personally like to see it play a bit more 'obviously'.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's a slightly different, yet familiar, take on the sandbox construction/survival genre and I think plays really well. It's a smooth experience that does a pretty great job of guiding newbies into it through individual tasks, though a wiki will still always be your best friend. It's a great early access game with a few minor hiccups (most of the stuff I noticed is graphical glitches) but doesn't interfere with your play experience.			"

								This is the first review I've written on steam and felt I had to leave one for this game after installing it today. Despite only installing it today I've played it for six hours solid and I only stopped playing because it's nearly 5am and I have to get to bed! I could play have longer if not. This is very similar to minecraft in terms of feel but with one major difference - it's a lot better than minecraft! The controls are similar, the gameplay is similar but very much improved, the graphics are a perfect balance of pixel and shaded. It all makes for a very enjoyable experience. The extra depth in this game is what was missing from minecraft. Having spent ages playing that I was looking for something new. I never found anything that filled the gap till now. This game being free makes it even better. Although I paid for pro membership and I'm glad I did. The flashlight and glider although not major things make a massive difference to gameplay. The single player option works well. It's good to get to grips with the game. But the multiplayer mode is fantastic. The community is really welcoming and within ten minutes of joining an online session I had people helping me out and getting me going in to proper gameplay. It's a really fun world to explore. The crafting is really well thought out and I love the rewarding feeling of unlocking items. It really motivates you to keep going. I'll be playing this a lot. It's highly recommended.			"

								The devs have renounced their anti-Pay-to-Win philosophies with the most recent update. New players can no longer customize their world, nor create more than one world. You must now pay $20 in order to ""go pro"" and gain access to the full game and enjoy additional content in the future. It was a great F2P game prior to this update, with all the paid content being cosmetic and overall inconsequential, but now its no longer a true F2P. I would still recommend it if you don't mind paying the $20 upgrade fee in order to fully enjoy the game, and I suppose it's still an ok free game, but if you came here looking for a F2P sandbox game where everyone has a level playing field, I suggest you look somewhere else.

								It's a fun Minecraft clone, what was supposed to be a quick hour or two look turned into 12 hrs. It's a very forgiving game also, death most of your items goes into a tomestone pot. Also has a built in compase with markers. Very addicting to play with others. Taming the wild life gets a bit boring when after it's tamed. All the creature does is follow/wander/stay. Feeding it, the pet will give you an item to harvest from it. Would be interesting if some could be tankers or support fighters.			"

								What can I say? Even in early access, this game delivers. While the game is F2P, if offers premium content in the form building blocks and a feature called PRO. With PRO, you can futher customize your world. You also gain access to a glider, flashlight, increased stamina and increased carrying capacity. The cost of PRO is $20.00 USD but they have sales and discounts often.While this game has been called a Minecraft knock off, the same can said about Minecraft being a knock off of infinicraft. There will always be a first for a game type. That doesn't mean all games that follow are simple clones. The same can be said about Creativerse. The public world option will allow you to jump right in to an established world freshly formed world. The official forums are full of useful information and people reasdy to help you get started.If you like building, exploring, fighting other players or anything inbetween, give Creativerse a try. For free, you have nothing to lose but some time.			"

								This is probably one of the best free games on steam. If you read the bad reviews, saying that you have to pay to get things faster, they completely removed that feature. There still is an in game shop, where you can get more blocks and builds, but you start off with 2,000 coins. That seems to be enough to get the things that you want. I haven't added a penny to this game, and it is one pf my most played games. I would definatley reccomend this game to anyone, regardless of wheter you like the genre, or not.			"

								[Update: Last time I played Creativerse was on March 2016, so I didn't know anything about the new Pro update when I was writing this review.]I played this game for an hour and I was hooked immediately. Awesome game and even better developers.Pros:- Free to play- Easy to learn- No need to rent servers- Beautiful and peaceful environment- Decent graphics, even though it is a voxel game- Efficient building system- Easy crafting (No need to memorize a user manual or spend half your lifetime on Wiki)and most importantly:- Great support staff (I explained the reason at the end of the review)Cons:- You get to end game fairly easy (Although I'm sure more content will be added in the future)- Minor bugsWhy I support this game: I was playing with my friend on a private server, and after spending 10 hours on the game, we encountered a rare bug and all of our chests became empty. I was going to rage quit this game but my friend decided to email the support staff. And they actually replied withing few hours and solved our problem. I have huge respect for the developers because even though this is a free to play game, they actually care for the community. As of now, I've only played about 30 hours, but I will definitely come back to Creativerse when it has more content and I plan to financially support the devs since they were so nice!Thank you			"

								Ever wondered what Minecraft 2 might be like? Play this game. It builds on the core concept and makes it more fun to get around, build, and share your world with others. One particular concept that was very welcome? Plug and Play Teleporters. Makes getting around the world and to your various bases a snap. Also - beacons. Mark points of interest with a pillar of light that can be seen from quite a ways away. Also, the cartoonish look has it's charm. I spent way more time screwing around here than I expected. Can't stress enough how much FUN it is to actually explore.			"

Early Access Review
								My review for this game would be basically this, up until the latest update I would say it was a worthwhile game to play, even if I didn't play all THAT much because I typically wait for games to go out of Early Access before I bother playing them, to have as much a polished experience, rather than play when its bugged and unfinished. Now, with this latest update they effectively removed any desire to ever play this game again with their 'Pro' system, effectively they have added limitations I don't like to this game and made any attraction disappear, didn't they realize games like this are a dime a dozen lately and all they did was flush away a ton of player interest? I guess they don't care and at this point money is all that matters, so yea, I find myself choosing the uninstall this game and moving on. I'll go play one of the other Open World Sandbox games that are around, sure maybe most of them asked to pay to buy them from the start, but at least they didn't shove it in your face out of nowhere, taking away things you could do to create a 'Paid' version of the game. I am pretty sure their intention at this point was to twist the arm of players that had come to love this game and push them to pay to keep on doing as they did before, so yea, I am not buying into that sort of backstabing company.

Early Access Review
								This game wasn't that great before- To be honest, it actually seemed like a rip off of Minecraft. Yes, a good one, with great visuals, easy multiplayer, and a few mechanics not found in Minecraft. But recently it's somewhat blended Terraria and Minecraft together, with the luxury of Minecraft's 3D, easy multiplayer, and stuff, with Terraria style character customization and greater amount of content over Minecraft. Yes, it doesn't have as much content as Terraria, and never will, to be honest. But now it's blended the 2 most popular sandboxes, along with content not found in either, such as a tutorial. Well done. If it's to be called a rip off byb ANYONE, it's a very, very good one.Basically, it combines Minecraft's style of gameplay with Terraria's progression in equipment, and where you go. You might not be going far without decent equipment......And now is when it hits the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Creativerse Pro- A Builders club style subscription service allowing for Flashlights, Gliders, and various exclusive blocks. Y'see, with F2P games there is ALWAYS a catch, whether it be excessve ads, or what you're probably used to, Micro-transactions. I quite literally knew that the game would come to this someday, as a F2p game. I literally knew it. Yes, you can argue that those features aren't necessary, but there's something about a free indie game going into the We-Do-Want-Money category, just like Roblox. Atleast this isn't as bad as the removal of tix, but it just rubs me the wrong way. Despite that, i can't not give this game a reccomendation. It's still a great game to play with friends, so go do that.			"

								This game is a minecraft clone yes. It so far is pretty amazing though and worth trying at least even if you don't want to buy it.(I'm writing this during free week)I'm not good at pros/cons so I'll just say my thoughts.      First and foremost yes as i said it is a minecraft clone however alot of the extra stuff to make minecraft this you would need mods, which imo is great, but my friend gave some solid drawbacks of everyone must have the mod and some mods the admin has to place it all down, etc.1. Crafting so far is great, you have to find the materials  explore eerie places and you can't just take your friend's already made item to unlock the obejct's recipe however picking up items unlocks the next tier/new recipes to craft.2. Exploration is huge and immense extremely enjoyable3. So far building I wish took notes from trove where it predicted where you wanted to build and hold+drag to place multiple of the same block at once. Most definitely needs an improvement since I want to be able to build while surviving unlock minecraft where i have to go admin mode4. Weirdly moving you do not just move over 1 block automatically, I wish that was changed for more QoL movement5. Very artistic designs a plus for you graphic junkies6. I love that you can buy some stuff from the store and everyone on the server can help build it, to my understanding7. Combat so far since im still inexperinced: the enemies so far are pretty diverse and do many entertaining actions however I wish that as the player i had more than just a ""homerun/swing and a miss"" sword....8. Very friendly UI which can sometimes be overlooked in game making9. Character customization needs work, that's a must...and I kinda want more than a 12 year old even if they are great for a default design10.  Water logic is pretty boring you dont just sink which is true irl but I prefer minecraft/trove/starbound water to this.... water in minecraft/trove makes fun trap potential and starbound great for helping with exploring11. Taming monsters is really cool12. The fact that the game stays up, your world, friend's worlds, all stay open even while you're offline is a huge plus esp if some friends are in different time zones13. When you start out with a few recipes, every time you craft an item it unlocks the next tier however with every item crafted it's easier to build another item(so far most of the time it isn't the next tier but a different item type) this can feel a tad linear but to me it helps prolong your exploration since you have to take your time and discover all the secrets in the world instead of just digging through everything and reaching the core of a planet(i'm looking at you starbound) or just falling into the void(hai minecraft), or hitting a undestroyable boundry(you're lucky you have rpg  trove <3)14.I would love to see where they go with this because so far it does have huge potential15. They should also do like trove and say in the tooltip where an item mat can be foundI might add more to the review later but I just realized I might be late for class wish me luck and carry on adventurers!

Early Access Review
IntroductionCreativerse is a crafting game made by Playful Corporation. This game is an Early Access game which means there will be lot of updates to the game i assume and you can play alone, with your friends and the people you do not know. I expect developers of this game to keep updating the game and adding more stuff.I tried to play alone but it was boring. Then, i told my friends to download it and we started to play. The game is good and enjoyable. I recommend you to play with your friends. Otherwise, it will be boring. This is my opinion so if you think playing alone is not boring then give it a try.You discover blocks and other stuff and then you craft them and when you craft them, you discover new stuff and when you craft them you discover new stuff. But you need resources to craft it. That's how it works.BlueprintsThere are blueprints in this game but they are not free ofc. You need to pay to get coins so you can buy the blueprint then start to build it. Building takes lot of time and resource so i'd recommend you to buy both blueprint and kit thing which gives all resources you need.PerformanceLet's talk about performence. I have got Intel I7 2640M Cpu, 8GB Ram, Intel HD Graphics 3000 Integrated GPU. When i was playing this game, i had fps drops and i was playing on low graphic settings. I think i will try to play this game again after i buy a good computer.Buying PremiumI think buying premium is not a good idea because it does not give you too much things. Let me tell you what you will get if you buy the premium. You can run more, you get more options when you want to change some settings of your world. You get a flashlight which you can use and you get ability to fly which will make building easier.Pros1- You can create your own world and invite people easy without dealing with ports etc.2- You can make teleporter in this game which will make traveling between your places easy.3- When you die, you do not loose items on your slot but you loose items on your inventory.Cons1- Boring to play alone. Seriously, play with your friend.2- Repetitive game. Which means you will most likely enjoy the game when you are playing it for the first time but after playing it like 5 hours or more then you will get bored.3- Premium is not worth buying. It does not give you anything except ability to fly which makes building easier, running more, ability to change more options of your own world and flaslight which you can use at dark places like caves.4- The game does not have lot of things to discover.5- It is really hard to find diamonds, iron etc.6- Lack of things to discover and craft.Score: 5/10 "

								i am not a minecraft person...i can't build...so if i play mc at all i just sit there and break blocks and try to find precious stones.  my daughter is very much a mc person...she has it on every platform possible and she plays it fairly regularly.  i got this, because it was free and something we could check out together....we opened it and next thing we knew 5 hours had passed.  we both love it.  it has a good sense of humor.  i like that it is easy to recover from getting lost, there is a map to your death so you can recover your stuff.  the crafting system is fun....there are just shy of 400 things to craft and you have to unlock most of them but it gives you clear instructions as to how...which include forging in your forge...mining...gathering...processing materials.  so each thing has a unique route to the next thing.  there are treasures scattered through the map that include recipes...today we found halloween decorations as well as christmas ones...also clothes for pets we will some day tame.i am very interested to see what the game will turn in to as it is pretty polished as is.

								      This game runs on a timeless concept: ripping off minecraft in every way possible. The only difference between this and MC is the graphics are better and the game lacks the depth and multiplayer options of MC. I played it cause it was billed as MMORPG, this is flat out a false tag. The multiplayer is much smaller than MC and only exists if you have the friends to get together and play on a single server. There are no public servers and no servers that are popular (I never found a single server with more than one person playing.) "

								When I first loaded this game I thought to myself... Welp, this looks like Minecraft lol.. I've played a few Minecraft knockoffs, and this... This is not Minecraft. This is something else entirely. Yes, it's a sandbox game where you can pick blocks up and put them back down but the differences are huge.I started playing with buttons and quickly picked up which were the crafting menu and inventory, saw that I needed some initial resources to start crafting with. Instead of being able to craft anything in the game if you simply have the materials, you unlock newer, better recipes via crafting the first ones.. Alright, I can do this lol. It took me a good 30 hours of gameplay (mind you, I had started my own private world so I had no help) to dig down to the bottom of the world and craft the best armor and weapons. I had to traverse the globe in search of specific creatures in order to use their items to craft stuff in order to dig deeper. It is super fun figuring it out for yourself, as opposed to minecraft's 'start the game, dig some stone, build castle' it feels a lot more like an adventure and learning experience.The game is unfinished, and is already stomping out Minecraft. The only thing I kinda miss is Redstone.. And not very much lol.			"

(<- love it)The learning curve in this game is pretty good; And combat is fun works like ""Hit 'N Dodge"";Sadly, there is no blocking mechanic (yet), so, no Shields 'n stuff, which makes me sad, cuz im missing a shield to feel like a real Knight. Add Shields please~! <3It feels like the Crafting is somewhat different from other Games, collecting the Materials to Craft something feels like a quest, everytime, i really like it.Probably one of the best Early Access Game i've playd in the last 2 years.

								Video: 7/10Audio: 8/1Gameplay:3/10At first play, it was amazing. I had finally found a game that was F2P. You could literally get the FULL experience, simply by spending the 10 minutes for the download. Yeah, sure, there was stuff you could buy. Blocks. Thats all. Alright. Amazing. I enjoyed many hours like this with my mother, and my close friends. There were permissions for your servers, and you could set up admins, moderators, and even just have visitors. It was amazing. Everything I wanted in a Free to Play game. Similar to TF2, you could simply spend cash for ""Cosmetics"" (In this case, Blocks).I saw they had an update to the game, and I got a bit excited. I was hoping they added new content, and tweaked out some of the bugs. NOPE. They decided to add some ""Pro"" version of the game. New players now can not make more than one world, and they can no longer edit the features of that world. I had a world with 9 players. My friends can no longer use explosives, access my extractors, my chests, my blueprints, or my pets. They added some glider, and a flashlight, in order to give ""Pro"" players an edge. They essentially switched from their (very firm) Free to Play, to a P2W. What a joke. I HIGHLY encourage you not to waste your time with this. Two days ago, I would have said go for it. I even convinced a few sceptical players to try it, and they loved it. Now, every single one of those 9 players are uninstalling the game. Summary: F2P tag is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Go play Minecraft instead.

								This game may seem like a clone of minecraft, but the reality is- it's not. Sure the world is based in a blocky enviroment, you can mine and build with individual blocks, that is similar to minecraft, but it's also similar to every voxel-based game out there. I love the crafting system. Think of it like ARK: Survival Evolved, in which you need engrams to make the tools. You unlock upgrades by making the former item. Also, searching for materials does not get boring! It isn't hard to get the basic materials, but the ones later in the game? Yeah, those can be difficult to get to. Also, once you have a base of operations, it doesn't get repetetive, you still have to quest to get those items, whether it be 6 stone to make 48 stone rods for that stack of stairs your making, or the Feral Pigsy Fur for the Iron Sword- it doesn't get boring. (Well, the stone mining does- but that's besides the point!) Instead of making all your tools in one machine, placing all your items in one type of chest- you have different types of them. You want to make a door? Get a processor to process that wood. What was that? You wanted a bar of obsidian? Get that forge. Wait, what was that? You wanted to COOK an APPLE PIE? Get the Cooking machine for that. You need a better chest because the normal, 20 slot one isn't working for you? Get an ARC stone chest. Gameplay: Now the gameplay and combat systems are alot like minecraft. It is a point N' click kind of game, no blocking (Yet), but it still retains a certain air about it that makes it original. You can't chose your game mode- it's already at the default setting- Life. Movement and all, it has a very nice flow. The animations are nice, You can run, jump- move about freely and as you wish, and best of all, you can seem badass by hopping from treetop to treetop. Graphics: The graphics are not like Minecraft. I mean sure- It's pixelated- but all games are pixelated. There's really not much to say about it, other than it has better graphics than Minecraft.Over all, I throuroghly enjoyed this game. I would recomend it to all those looking to take a break from minecraft and to refresh your senses, as I did. Oh and one more thing, just to let you guys know- I have played more than my fair share of minecraft as well... Probably over 400 hours of it. That will be all I will say on this subject, until (or if) I decide to revise this. [Unedited]			"

								While it may be similar to MInecraft, Creatifverse diverges greatly from MC. More are available to the player to use, craft with, craft, and decorate. Way more mobs and the mobs are significantly harder to take down; they also deal more damages. So getting better weapons, armour, and a steady supply of health potions is crucial. However, getting resources is also a dificult challenge. THe further you go down the more enemies and the stronger they are, but also the more valuable resources. SO stack up !!You can also get a pet which in turn gives you free items, as long as you take care of it. My first pet was a rockster! But i lost him. It's been days(in game) since i've seen him. All I've had is my pigsy, Pig-o-tron, to comfort me, Moreover, this game is best played with more people. You'll need to them to coordinate attacks, gather sources and build. The world is huge and unforgiving. Great game, I will continue to play !!! 100/10			"

								This game was nice, something different from Minecraft also F2P with cute graphic style.Then Devs shows their true side of Greed **** and put ""pro"" acc for what you need to pay $20 what itself is veeeeery pushing away. Also this make players split on""elite"" with this status and those ""worst without"" (this is my personal feeling about that).Such things should be forbidden and I hope this game will lost over 90% of players and go dead so next greedies will think twice before decide milking players.Uninstalled...Don't recommend to even think of dowloading this milking machine.

								Decent game, but if you're going to be a Minecraft clone, I think you should add more content than Minecraft has, and features it doesn't.I like the default textures better than Minecraft's, the gameplay is smooth, it never crashes on me, and the sound effects and animation are well done.Development and adding new features seems to take forever though.  I started playing again after many months, and it hardly changed.  I'd like the game world to be *much* more dangerous too.  It's so easy to get away from enemies if you want, which makes the game less than challenging to me.  For example, no enemies I've seen shoot anything at you, it's all melee, and so are your weapons.  No bows, guns, lasers, etc.I hope they add more content too, as it gets borning very quickly when you've crafted everything.			"

								I went into this game just thinking I would spend a few hours trying it out now I've been playing this game for four or five days with a couple of friends of mine and have already gotten 36 hours playtime into it, not sure where all of that time went but we seem to be enjoying ourselves. From a first glance it looks a lot like minecraft but I really feel it doesn't play anything like that at all it has enough differences and unique features that Minecraft could actually get a few ideas from Creativerse. I've seen a lot of negative reviews on the game stating things like Pay 2 Win but how can you have P2W in a non competitive game? Additionally most of the complaints I see in the negative reviews seem to have been addressed and removed from the game or fixed since the game has gone free to play. Yes the game has an ingame real money shop but you start out with currency for it so if you really want a specific cosmetic block you can get it for free anyways, Play with a group of friends and you can all claim different things and you've gotten almost everything for free. Pros:-Free to Play-Replay ability-All recipes are obtainable in game now without spending real money which was a common complaint I saw in other reviews.-Graphics look amazing-Multiplayer is set up amazing, Anyone can set up a world without fussing around with downloading server files because it's all hosted online for free. *Note* While I would like to continue listing things here I feel like it would just become a really long list of the games features such as Monster taming, The farming system, the Blueprints system and most of the other features in the game.Cons:-No brightness slider, This may be a personal thing since none of my friends seemed to have any difficulties but when the game is dark it's very dark I couldn't see more than a few blocks infront of me if at all. -Very little character customization, you get to chose between male and female that's all for character customization. -There are premium items that aren't attainable to everyone, like a limited sword for people who attended Pax, As a completionist this type of thing tends to bug me but again it isn't really a con just my personal opinion. Overall I would give this game a full score 10/10 while the game isn't for everyone it is a great game to jump into with friends if you like other games of this type or have never played one but don't feel like investing this is a great way to try the style of play out, Don't think it's like the others though this game has a decently difficult armor and tools progression and a the art style is pretty nice to look at.  I would definitely recommend this game to others even if they are just looking for something to kill a weekend with.			"

								For a free-to-play (and early-access) game this has shown how a better ""copy"" of Minecraft should be.If you ask me though, this has  a lot of differences compared to minecraft. And very positive ones aswell.This game is open-world sandbox and unless you like these RPG-like games you shouldn't be playing.Creativerse is an extremly addicting game if you give it the time and effort, when you reached ""end-game"" there are tons of blueprints which I enjoy building at the moment.Pros & Cons (Mainly talking about stuff that are different from minecraft)Pros:Being able to rotate blocks the way you wantBlueprintsCrafting MenuTaming many different creaturesHigher jumpingAuto-runCons:Slow when things are being ""Processed""Slow furnace/forgePets are not used in the combat aspectSlow when taking ores/nodesNo ""story"", no why you're where you areSo far I've been enjoying myself in this game, and I would definitely recommend it to people who like these type of sandbox games. It has a very cartoonish feel and style which to me is okay. I personally do not like that cartoony feel but still, the gameplay and the feeling makes up for it. They should try and make it more abstract if they want to open up the player-base to older audiences.Other than that, it's free. Try it.			"

								As someone whose all-time favorite game starts with 'mine' and ends with 'craft', most games in the craftlike genre just fail to scratch the itch the genre-setting title had left me with. I've tried dozens, and while a lot of them do build upon their own experiances and go their own ways in gameplay exploration, none have tackled what made minecraft so much fun to begin with.So I've kept my eye on this title ambiently, and only recently realized it was finally open for free players. I was excited, but having known my past experiances, I wasn't overwhelmingly hopeful. Sure it looked cute, but could it scratch the itch?Well, it did. Within the first 10min of gameplay I was thoroughly impressed. The block setup is quite familiar but as far as crafting and mining goes, it actually improves upon previous title's attempts in very intiutive and creative ways. I adore the mining nodes. I adore the crafting stations and how you can build a mixed queue. I love how the combat feels a bit MMO-y but not in a terrible way. The animal and character models do seem ""out of place"" depending on your opinions on graphics, but they are none the less well designed, beautifully textured and wonderfully modeled and animated.It's just a gorgerous game. And as someone who likes open world games for aesthetics, I was quite pleased with this. The trees are robust and you genuinely feel like you're in a dense forset. The other biomes, though I have yet do explore too deeply into them due to tougher mobs, are just as gorgeous.The pacing feels a bit odd, but It's tier-based as I feel a craftlike should be. In this case, there's many different layers of underground rocks and you can only progress past certain layers if you have the correct mining tier. There are some things that feel a bit odd, but because they seem more unfinished than anything. The pet system is really awesome and I look forward to tamed animals being coded to act as combat buddies and mounts (they are only livestock atm.) and the fact you can tame almost anything save for a handful of named special mobs, is fantastic.I'm genuinely looking forward to this title. I kind of wish it was a pay-for game, but I can understand their reasoning for micro transactions. And their micro transactions appear to be completely humane at this point in time as well, you are buying recipies for purely aesthetic building blocks, like tiles and carved stonework, as well as 3d blueprints to help you build a house if you're not the creative type.All in all this is pretty dang solid. Eagerly looking forward to updates!ps - I forgot to mention, this game is obviously heavily geared towards kids, but isn't dumbed down /at all/. Which makes me thrilled as an adult, and also thrilled that game companies catering to children are begining to understand kids aren't dumb as rocks and love challenges. Thank you, Playful!			"

								Welp, lets start buy saying that I've personally never played Minecraft. I've watched other ppl play, my son plays it and I've gotten idea about these types of games from him.I've waited 'minecraft style' sandbox game to play, I've looked up many games yet not play one. I saw this game on steam suggestions and instantly was pulled in. Downloaded game, btw 1~gb? that's so small, awww, anyways... Downloaded game, logged in and after 5 hours I was like ""wth what time is it?"". Safe to say Im hooked, so many armors crafted, so many swords broken... so many blocks gathered... Yeah, try the game, this IS NOT MINECRAFT (My opinion is based on watching someone else play MC)I most likely wouldnt had bought this game EA 20$ or something? But after playing it now, Im most likely going to buy gold to get blocks :D			"

								Spiral Knights meets Minecraft. Mysticism mixes with technology as you use arcane artifacts to bend the world around you to your will.That's just the aesthetic, though. The atmosphere is spot-on, from the music (that is, I'll admit, eerily similar to Minecraft's) to the guttural growl of the Miru outside your house as you hide in the light of your moss-burning torch. An eager chase after a nearby Keepa, holder of the arcstones that make such pretty little lights. The awe and shame as you accidentally light a tarpit on fire with your torch. It's all delightful, and it reminds me why I loved playing Minecraft years ago!I'll admit I'm not very far into the game at all at this point of writing. I've only just gotten my Iron Mining Cell, but I had a heap of fun getting there with my friend. And this game is very much worth playing with friends. Perhaps while you're in voice chat, if possible?Other reviews say it as well, but this game is immensely easy to set up servers on. Just hop in game, create a world, and start inviting friends! You can even set a password.			"

The graphics are stunning, the enemies are entrancing, and the controls are fairly intuitive. All of this in early alpha makes this game beyond exceptional. To add to this wonderful world is the community and the Dev support that can be found on the Steam forums. This quickly became my favorite game!			"

								This game was fun for 3 days, I had a large group of my friends and we all had our own dedicated server. It had good connections and the ability for all of us to work together. We built had a lot of fun but after those 2-3 days we had unlocked just about everything in the game. We had all of the high level armour and the weapon to go along with it, we had all the potions, all of the building materials (we built the skyfort thing.) The game has so much potental but it was to easy to progress. With a super extractor you are able to get six lumite (the rarest material.) This is overpowered because you can get a full set of lumite armour only extracting 2 which is not hard to do because the dark area below  is not hard to get to or  kill the enemies. I mean this is fun but after this 3 day point the main thing i realized is that iron is harder to get than lumite. Diamond is so easily accessable you get to the level and you can get hundreds in 10 min. We also hated the fact that if you wanted a iron table you have to progress from the bottom of the list by making a wood, stone, and obsidion table just to unlock an iron table. This is bad because you are litterally wasting resources because you will throw away all of the other tables you do not need. Everything in this game requires you to progress from the bottom of a catagory even if you are well progressed overall above it. After geting armour you basically have nothing else to do with it. For example in minecraft they have enchanting and if you get a bad enchantment you have to grind out more diamonds and levels to enchant. In all, this game could be better if it was harder to progress by showing a difference in color between certain ores like obsidion and coal look practically the same, or limestone looks like every other stone in the game. Or if you nerfed the extractors so that you only get 1 lumite, take out teleporters because if you have teleporters people will again progress to quickly and be off of your game faster, make lumite generate less (like 1/100th of the spawn rate same with diamond) CREATE A PURPOSE FOR LEAVING SPAWN you can get everything to progress in spawn and the surrounding biomes, why make a map so big with no reason to explore it. Also create an endgame other than getting the armour.			"

								In short, this game's got a lot of potential, but many features are still currently under-developedThis game is a mix of Minecraft, Portal Knights, Trove and many other sandbox block building adventure games. It has good graphics and can run smoothly on machines not equipped with a graphics card (Surface Pro 4 for example). I was attracted to this game mainly questing to unlock all the crafting recipes while mining every type of ores, taming every type of animals etc.However as this is an Early Access Game, features are still rather limited. After 9-10 or so hours I have already ""finished"" the game (i.e Unlocked all the recipes, self sufficient with resources etc). There are literally no automation available in this game, you are required to search and dig out every single block all by yourself, and just because you have equipped a diamond glove/lumina glove doesn't mean your digging speed becomes faster either. The Pro feature of this game although doesn't make this game pay2win, its price tag makes the feature rather unattractive for myself to purchase.Do I recommend this game? Well, for now yes, as I can see there are a lot of potentials to make this game a lot better (e.g Modding, Automation, More adventures, Less Grinding etc). Finally, this game is an early access game, things are still subject to change so will this review.			"

								TL;DR : I LOVE CREATIVERSE!This game has honestly surprised me quite a bit. Within the past few years, ever since that one day in my tech class in middle school, I have been playing Minecraft (It was 6 years ago, I was in 7th/8th grade at the time). More and more that game has been releasing updates, so many that I can't keep up with, and so many that it sort of just takes away the good old nostalgic times of spending hours upon hours a day on building, mining, and surviving. I loved that game, with all that I had of me. It's been the foundation for my most precious friendship to this day. Anyways, I have had lots and lots of experience of playing Minecraft, both with friends, alone, casually, competitively, you name it. I had loved that game. Then, one day, I am scrolling through the latest and greatest f2p games here on Steam (let's be honest, alot of em are either lazy works of disappointment, or just projects that just died out.) Well, I stumbled across this game, and I've only played about 24 hours of this msaterpiece, and yet I am more impressed and captivated than I am for Minecraft anymore. Something about this game gives me a tingling in my stomach, and with all the aspects and content this game offers, it's hard to put it down. Whether it be the looting aspect as many MMO's seem to have whenever you defeated a passive or aggressive mob, or maybe it would be the amazing feeling you get when you spend hours building something that looks amazing in your head from nothing into something, with amazing ancient technology and gear to help you along the way, or even just the simple, yet beautiful, artwork. Whatever it may be, I can honestly say that this game has brought me more satisfaction and fun than Minecraft has in quite a long time. Don't get me wrong, I love Minecraft, but the way it is now will never be the same, just nostalgic dreams drifting throughoust my mind from time to time. If you are looking for a great game to both enjoy by yourself and your friends, then I would HIGHLY recommend this great game. Even if you are new to this gamestyle, it's definitely worth checking out for even just and hour or two, or maybe more ;)			"

								I've played about ~20 hours or so across 2 accounts and I personally found it pretty fun and entertaining. I'm more into the exploration, mining and combat side of things rather than building although if I was I'd have gotten many many more hours out of this.It does feel very similar to Minecraft but also feels very different. The voxel (cubes) design will obviously look extremely familiar and so will some of the gameplay elements such as farming. Although in Creativerse you can do other things such as tame animals, and not only that but mining can be a little more complicated requiring different devices in order to get deeper into the earth (mining cells, basically your laser mining pick ...who doesn't like lasers?!) and then on special blocks of ore you need to use an extractor or an advanced extractor to get a higher yield, and this can take between 20 seconds and 6 minutes per block, so get ready to defend yourself or atleast don't forget where the block is!Then you have to keep an eye on things like becoming too hot, too cold, and corruption. Once these are full you will begin to take damage! There are things in place and things you can build or do to yourself to defend against this. You can use potions, a healing beacon, mineral water or just ordinary water to cool yourself off, heal yourself, warm yourself up and to cleanse corruption. I would definitely reccommend this game, for a free to play title I got a good amount of play time out of it, although it's still pretty early in development they are adding much more (hopefully more layers to the world as endgame seems a little too easy).

The updates come regularly and the best thing is that they really listen to what the players suggest.In the game you can play in many ways. You can be creative and build whatever you can imagine, you can go explore and fight creatures and if you like you can even play pvp.The graphics are absolutely beautiful and it is always fun to explore the wonderful worlds.I love the crafting system and that you can find out recipes by just crafting stuff. It's also good that there are recipes you can only find in treasure chests.I can't stop playing and I'm always happy to see a new update because I know it's gonna be something awesome.			"

								Actually quite fun. Smooth controls and character movement, hud is great , Music is well done & graphics are well polished . This game is a very fun , free to play ""minecraft"" genre game.Downsides I have found, the pay model doesn't fit for PC games. This pay for coins aspect feels like a mobile games income raking trash. That I found to be even worse than usual and this is why , when you purchase things like ""Blue Prints"" for different craftables you can only activate them(Use them) on one server.. So say you choose to play on a public server and spend your time on it then purchase a bp and activate it then say the server shuts down and well you have lost your Money/Coins and will need to fork up some more to get another one. That is only one example corrupt data saves etc can wreck your purchases. After doing a bit of reading seems that this has been an issue for quite awhile and after the community has pointed the dislike on the issue the dev team has discussed the issue amongst themselves and we still have single use pay model.Other than that if you want to play for free it is fun for a vanilla style minecraft experience. Also worth mentioning this game lack's the ability for  community modding.			"

								First off, I overall LOVE this games.  The artstyle is very unique when it comes to the surroundings, plant, animal, and other parts of the game.  There is vast amounts of creativity used to develop this strategical, adventurious, simulated, and first player game is incredible.  To me the best part about the graphics of the games is when the night sky appears and you can gaze into space with enumerous amounts of stars creating light within the dark.  When it comes to game play I love it!! Its simplistic, but you have to put some thought into it when it comes to creating gear, weapons, and armor to fight against tougher night creatures.  When it comes  to creatures night/day I find it awesome that the player is capable of training a creature as your pet.  I would like to see there be some consideration of the creatures you aquire as pets to fight with you when you get into a fight.For now I believe that is the main issue about the game that I think would be ideal for when traveling and getting into a fight with annother creature while your pet is with you.  I will give more feedback later--Sincerely Evernight			"

								For a free-to-play game, I must say, I am VERY impressed. Certainly NOT a Minecraft clone in the least bit. This game is amazing in many aspects, including the fact that unlike other ""free-to-play"" games, it's not pay-to-win. Sure, you can make ingame purchases for coins to get blueprints, but you can still build your own custom homes. 10/10			"

								I really like this. has the same feel as minecraft but its different in some key ways. no need for tools, you wear a glove to harvest particular items. You get so many cools items to help make it easier. FREE!! plans for homes, buildings, etc. No more trying to figure out what to build and how, the plans are there and are soo easy to modify to suit the types of blocks you want to use. My ONLY complaint is that it gets really hard harvesting trees, I really want to fly lol			"

								Creativerse is an Early-Access game, points made in this review might be redundant at a later date.During my first time playing, I was, somewhat, immersed with the music and nature of the game and it was truly a sight to take in, despite the blocky feel however. The controls are very simple so it's easy to get a grasp of how to navigate terrain especially with the useful compass and structure symbols that are located at the top.  Crafting can be a pain sometimes, trying to find the right resources is tricky and risky if you don't have a sword to defend yourself with against the repetitive creatures. Oh, a tip, if you just circle around them while attacking, it seems to stop them from hitting you ;) Playing with friends is a lot more fun than playing by your self and, although never really tried it myself, multiplayer seems to be a lot of fun.Now onto some negative points.Once you've crafted everything there's not a lot you can do, sure you can play with people online but there's nothing to feel any satisfaction from anything. I shouldn't have to pay just to earn the ability to make my own worlds, that's rediculous and should be a mechanic in the game already. The ability to fly? At least let people craft wings or make an item that allows the user to fly for a limited amount of time. I don't know really, it just seems a bit silly. The creatures in this game are no challenge at all after you craft a sword, they often get stuck in the terrain and sometimes are even frozen on the spot making them stupid-easy targets. (Again I understand it's an Early Access) Your tamed creatures are useless, they don't seem to attack any hostiles in the area and I just don't understand why this is in here. Sure it's cute to name your first pigsy but there's nothing to achieve from it, you either make them follow you or let them wander off. What would be cool, is if there was an option for your 'pet' to search for valuables in the area, like collecting flowers or seeds from the ground and bringing them back to you, pretty cool idea. I don't know though. I am, however, excited to see where the development leads on this. Maybe in the future, we'll see the ability to adjust the wold options without spending £/$15.00 on a upgrade just to do so. Let me know what y'all are thinking if you sat and actually read this. Have a nice day, :)			"

								Great open world game with tons of neat functions. Many Ideas have been taken from minecraft, but many more have been added that are unique to the game. Definitely one of the recommendable Free-to-play games. Pro-Mode is affordable and preferable to any other ingame purchases. There could be some improvements on Controls, but since it's still early access, I assume lots of changes to come still. I probably wouldn't pay $20 for it, at its current state, but it's a solid f2p game with tons of community content and hours of fun ahead. And if you really like it, wait for a discount to get a lot of game for just a few bucks.			"

								The best sandbox  game that I have come across since I started  playing Terraria  nearly two years ago. It has everything from building to crafting, fighting creatures, and PVP. Love the game !  I am totally addicted.  My daughter, grandson, and I play it as  a family. We have fun playing together! My grandson is 7 yrs old, and this game is perfect for him!  My daughter is 28, and I am 54 years old. This game appeals to all ages!    I will be sending feedback  on a few Ideas my daughter and I had to make the game  a little easier to navigate.  A world map that shows where you have been, and where your base is located would be awesome. There isn't much that I can say negatively about the game, it is fantastic!  This is a game for all generations!			"

								Creativerse! The better version of Minecraft!Creativerse is a free survival or building simulator (if thats what you can call it) and sky-rockets above Minecraft in a lot of ways.Now, before readers rush to hasty judgement, I am NOT saying Minecraft is bad. Minecraft was the spotlight of survival. But answer this: Is Minecraft really worth $20?Creativerse is free, I'm not going to put graphics into this review because who cares about graphcs? But in creativerse, it has better animation than Minecraft.-Decent animations! Enemies attack you, animals sleep, you actually look like you're putting some weight in swigning your sword-Same building style as Minecraft.-The world ADAPTS to your decisions! Thats right, the world will adapt to you! I won't spoil too much of it.-TECHNOLOGY! You don't have the same technoligical freedom Minecraft has (redstone) but Creativerse has teleporters, ark technology, and other machines. You alsohave bombs and TNT.-Multitude of enemies, the world adapts to you, which means it will introduce new enemies, as well as new enemies in different biomes.-Tamable animals. Taming animals may be a challenge, but you can tame animals as either companions or livestock, you don't KILL tamed animals, you feed them and collect their items.-There is no hunger or thirst meter, there is food though.-You cannot naturally regenerate health, you need potions or standing in w**** to restore health, this is NOT a problem, it offers a challenge.I have read several negative reviews, and yes, there is a coin shop... but I don't honestly see how this is a problem. The game needs to have support and it's not a competetive game, yes, extrating ores such as iron, coal, diamond, and obsidian does take a while. But thats why you UPGRADE YOUR TECHNOLOGY to reduce the time and obtain more ores. And also: It only takes about 2 minutes to get coal from a normal extractor. I believe the negative reviews may have overexaggerated when they said it takes ""forever"" for 2 minutes.And even then, the coin shop doesn't offer weapon or armour upgrades, it only offers blueprints for buildings such as castles... At least, thats all I saw.So, that was my review on Creativerse, this game has a lot to explore and many choices of build....also, there are teleporters :) "

								Where do i start? The beginning I think. . .Have to say, this is one of the most addictive and creative games I have ever played. There is so much to do and see, and that's just in your own world. Then there's other player worlds where you can explore and converse with fellow fans of the game and check out their creations. Some of which just blew me away. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.Thought I'd add to my review as I now have the Pro add on. Which unfortunately for the price is a bit unimpressive. I mean you can fly and you get a nifty light to help see through the darkest caves. I think one thing I do like about the pro pack is the fact you can edit your world and so make it peaceful, or spawn more loot, or even change the gravity. Apart from that, I'd hope they would of added some coins or blocks as a reward for the fee instead of making a limited time offer for free coins (which I managed to miss out on by a few days).That being said, I am still wrapped with the game and the new additions they keep bringing out on a regular basis. Which brings me to a point some of the negative reviews may have not addressed. ""It's an Early Access game"". Hence why it may appear somewhat vanilla as some have put it, but given a chance I believe this game will become one of the best games, if not the best game in this genre. As before, I look forward to what new surprises they drop on us.			"

								I'm loving this game quite a lot, I have almost 100 hours into it at the time of writing this review. To be honest when I first seen this game (and I know i'm not the only one) I thought this was gonna be another Minecraft clone but after looking more into it and playing the game it really is a different experience overall (other than it being blocky of course), like the glove with the mining cells that's used for block placing/breaking rather than individual tools, the different types of mobs with their own unique type of attacks (wait until you meet The Thing :3), unlockable and hidden recipes for you to find, a touchstone that you can use to set your spawnpoint which i'm very glad exists considering I can get lost way too easy, not to mention you can also craft teleporters for easy travel around the world once you set them up, and I also love how easy it is to setup a server as well, literally all you have to do is just start up a world and there's your server (Passwords for worlds are optional). Those are just a few out of the many things that I love about this game.Now yes as one would expect with it being in Early Access there are some annoying bugs, like crouching not always working when moving and you end up falling off, getting stuck in stairs or roof blocks, and one rather funny bug is launching yourself forward or backward with doors if you time it just right while running into it while trying to open then quickly close it, but I can live with that as it seems like the bugs are very few in numbers that I can remember off the top of my head.Overall I highly recommend this game and this is just in Early Access too (currently on R14), who knows what will come of the game once the full release is out whenever that may be which i'm looking forward to. :)			"

								I loved this game, honestly. I spent a bit of time on it. I built a couple worlds up, and I enjoyed it. I spent quite a bit of time on each one, making them all a little different, and I played with my friends in the privated worlds. Then the next update comes a bit after the Golden Age, and I see ""Patch R33 Now Live!"" I was pretty excited about this patch, as I already knew it would bring in new things like automation and machines. So I read through it and I saw ""We've been trying to figure out a way to make this game Pay 2 Play er- I mean... Trying to figure out how to fairly charge our players, and we came up with Creativerse Pro!""Now what I SAW in the actual patch notes was, ""Creativerse Pro players now will get a Glider, a Flashlight, and a bigger inventory."" I didn't really care about anything except the inventory, that did tick me off a bit when I saw it. However, I could deal with it. What I COULD NOT DEAL WITH is the fact that when I booted up my game, I was restricted from touching any advanced world settings, ESPECIALLY after I was really looking forward to messing around with them because I knew that new settings were introduced in the same R33 patch. However, I still had hope for the game, because I still enjoyed it.What made me simply stop playing this game was when I tried to click ""Create New World"" and a pop-up advertisement shouted in my face, ""BUY CREATIVERSE PRO FOR THIS FEATURE TO UNLOCK!"" At that moment, I lost all hope on the game. It had now turned from a fun, enjoyable F2P game to a P2P.Point and Case, I would love to recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed crafting survival games, like Minecraft but much better, but I simply can't do that anymore.This was a great game, but DO NOT EVEN DOWNLOAD THIS GAME.It simply isn't worth downloading at this point.Save your own time, and go look for something else, because the label ""Free To Play"" on this game has faded away already, while still in early access, and beneath it is now ""Pay To Play"".[[[ EDIT: I edited it, thanks to people correcting me. I didn't realize it myself at first but P2W doesn't make much sense, it's Pay 2 Play, changes have been made accordingly.]]]			"

								the game is nice. If you are artistic and want to build simular to minecraft, but prettier, it's a nice alternative. mind that the game lacks a lot of other features you find in minecraft clones (for example, redstone mechanisms), meanwhile it has a few features of it's own that are unique (like build templates).some things you should know:   you need to kill or tame monsters as you progress, you are going to have to get used to it. the best way to do this is with explosives. explosives are love, explosives are life... the sword is best for farming explosive mats from pigsies (using explosives to get mats is not efficient). or tame pigsies, and learn how to feed, and take care of them.  green goo is important for a large amount of block crafting. save these for your projects as much as you can, there is no easy way to farm these, save killing monsters. you may end up with a lot while farming for explosive mats, but you'll realize when you start building that you will never have enough goo.   when starting the game, get up into a tree and build a base there. night mobs rarely spawn on leaves. trees are also a great source of mats for building.    first objective is to collect up crafting recipes. also, openly explore, most mobs won't attack unless you attack, most. two best ways I have found for taming is stun bombs or standing on ladders, depends on what you are taming. taming is not easy otherwise. most monsters are easiest and fastest to just kill, but that uses up a large amount of explosives, taming is good for saving resources, but inversely, you will have to farm and cook for them.going to stop there, that's most of the game. building is the main objective and you have a great variety of designs to build with, I suggest sticking with lower end building materials like stone or wood though if you want to go big.

								My first day/night in Creativerse: I spawned, looked around at all the huge environment that I could see from where I was standing. The first thing I notice is the colors and well lit environment this is different than some of those other ""block"" games so I thought that's pretty cool. then first encounter with an animal, it was a Pigsy, then I saw a Leafi and they are just going about their business doing their thing, So I went and did mine which was mainly running, jumping, digging, making stuff (armor,weapons,food etc..) everything was great and fun, then night came. those same animals were still around but the changed colors and now their ""thing"" includes killing you,...SO...NOW...EVERYTHING...MUST...DIE. The game is a blast to play for ten minutes or two hours and it's not just another clone of some other game. like some people may be thinking. similar concept,...yes. but a game all it's own.and for the new pro version...it's an option. but hey who doesn't like to get paid for their work. I know I do. and if I ever think about going back to game dev, I'll probably hit them up. get the game it's free and fun even in single player like I played all 90 of my hours.			"

								My first few minutes were immediately thinking... Minecraft. However i believe this had something Minecraft lacked and that was, you don't have everything at the start, you need to earn blueprints of new instructions and items. You can make a crafting table from one block of wood on Minecraft, this game is much more in depth and gives you a big reason to explore. Mobs are quite lacking, but unusual loot from all kills that's for sure. i recommend this cute game, for the fact that this is a free game and if you can't get your mother to pay their credit card for Minecraft, just play this.

								One of the most Innovative Minecraft-Inspired games you'll ever play.While this game may still be in Early Access, the potential for Creativerse's future is absolutely astonishing.There is never a dull time while playing this game. There is always something to do, something to build, and crafting recipes to discover. The monsters are remarkably charming, derpy looking, and just fun to watch walk around (or kill). Not only that, but every monster in the game is Tamable! The art style is also one of the many fine features of Creativerse, as it's vivid bright colors and textures grasp your eyes and attention to detail. One of the most successful and brilliant features this game has to offer, is Hassle-Free server hosting; that friends and family can enter with or without you (as long as they know your password). Servers also have Claiming and Grief Prevention you can set up in your world. Lastly, player server's are 100% Company-Side Hosted and there is absolutely no lag whatsoever (unless your pc is garbage, what do you expect?). Only time your server will be offline, is during Maintenance; which usually never happens unless something needs a change or content being added to the game. Did I mention Creativerse has like, no bugs at all? It's so squeaky clean and well polished!Go play Creativerse for yourself, and see what I am talking about.

								I'm torn when it comes to reviewing this game.  I loved the first 15 hours of gameplay.  The problem is that in that 15 hours you can pretty much complete EVERYTHING the game offers.  You can go from wielding a wooden stick, to the best weapon/gear in the game with relative easy.  That wouldn't normally be an issue, if there was some reason to get those great items.  But there isn't.  There are no world bosses to prepare for... no dungeons to get stronger for... no Elite monsters to defend for.The enemy variety is terrible.  Each biome may have 1 or 2 unique enemies... but most of the enemies are just recolored skins of enemies from other biomes.  You WANT to explore the absolutely huge world, but feel like it would be a waste because, with the exception of some cool randomly generated terrains, there is nothing new or exciting around the corner.  You can travel to the other side of the world, and the caves and mining nodes are the exact same as the ones in the biomes near your base.  There is simply no reason to venture off.Now, for the building aspect of this game... it's great.  If you want to come in, and just build huge structures and houses or whatever... you have all the tools to do so.  It's fun, and there is a decent variety of materials.  The UI is reasonable, and you don't feel like it holds you back.  The one area of absolute insanity on the part of the developers is the teleporters.  You can place ""beacons"" around the world that you can teleport to.  Now, a normal person would think that in order to teleport to a location, you click an item, select the location you want to teleport to, then POOF!  But nope, not this game.  Here, you have to place the teleporter, and then give it a code name which you create out of building materials.  Any time you want to teleport to that location, you have to input the building materials which you code named the teleporter.  Sound confusing?  It is.Why is that a problem?  Because the game doesn't keep track of ANY of this for you.  You can have 20 teleporters across the world, and you are expected to remember the unique code combinations for all of them.  You know what that means?  I have about 17 teleporters out in the world that I will never visit again because I can't remember the code combination.  In order to make any of this function, you would need to keep a real life pen and paper list of all of your teleporters and codes.  That is such an overly complicated system.This game has been in ""Early Access"" for two years now.  It boggles my mind that the game was playable two years ago... and yet still only has the current level of depth to it.  You would think there would be more to do in the game if it has been in production for 3+ years.TL;DR  - Fun for the first 15 hours or so.  Then it's just a build-a-block game offering no progression for your character.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a very pretty game!  But I cannot in good faith recommend it.There are a lot of crafting options, things flow more or less understandably with the recipes being unlocked as you build things - not a huge fan of that, but it helps you understand the game so I'm alright with it.  Visually it's very nice!  But the problem is the combat system.Monsters have a much larger range than you and there are no effective ranged weapons, so I was forced to dash through enemies (there is no collision damage, the one small mercy here) while swinging and /hoping/ I hit - didn't always, because sometimes I would inexplicably fail to swing my sword for several seconds and then swipe at empty air.  And with limited stamina, every battle against an enemy that actually fights back - and all but three or four of them do - is a dice roll whether you'll be able to win before your dash meter bottoms out and you're murderized by a tiny evil piglet.There's no other tactic that seems to work, even circle strafing, as mobs seem to be able to hit you from any angle - and any elevation.  They're easily able to follow wherever you go, unless you outpace them or have a door to shut in their face, and some are small enough to slip through 1x1 gaps and terrorize you.  There's a severe disparity between monster health and damage output for the early game.  I'm not sure how it is in late game because I gave up after progressing to the obsidian tier, and that was enough of a problem as it was, requiring the consultation of a wiki to find the best places and ways to kill things and not die repeatedly.It's a shame the combat is so awful, because the rest of the game is really quite well-done - there are ladders with auto-snap, teleporters, really nice-looking decorations; you keep everything in your action bar when you die, just not your inventory; the crafting system isn't grid-based, so it doesn't feel like a direct rip of Minecraft; all these are nice things.  But ultimately, in order to progress beyond the very basic levels of interaction with the world, you have to kill things.  And that's where the game fails, and fails terribly.I wanted to like this, I really did.  But I'm not going to suffer through this horrible combat system any longer.			"

								Early access review, close to 300hours in game.I'm don't usually do a review. However, given the latest update, I feel obligated to do a review.I played this game when it is free and since that, I got hooked up. Played this with my kids and have a lot of fun. I never played voxel games before. So, this is my first one. I have great time playing it and met a lot of cool builders. Learned a lot of design and architecture while playing the game. This couple days, there has been a lot of bad review regarding the introduction of Pro account and when we look at it closely, most of it is from player with low in game hours. This low hoours might affect their judgement.Let me tell you why, to play this game, you will grind a lot. grind to harvest blocks, to kill mobs for their drop items, to craft new blocks, items, etc. You will have to go deep down in the underground to get resources. You will need lamp / light sources for that. This new Pro feature will give you ability to have flashlight and glider. With flashlight, you will have the ability to light your way. But, it's not that bright and will only brighten few blocks away. In big cave system, you will still need to have a lot of lamp to be able to travel and mine easily. So, flashlight is nice to have. But, it doesn't change the underlying mechanism. New players who rage quit failed to see this as they don't have enough experience in the game.Glider give huge bonus for exploring new area. But, that's it. It doesn't help you build faster, since you can't build while gliding. Once you have found an area, glider will be meaningless.Another Pro bonus is an additional backpack slot. This also doesn't really affect gameplay wise. Why? 200++ in the game and we never complained. So, why rage quit when new paid feature is out with no huge difference in gameplay? It does helped mine items bigger. But, that's the benefit of Pro. You shell out money to grind less. It is also pretty common in F2P to introduce features that allow player to grind less. By having Pro, Creativerse doesn't turn into P2W. Because, you still have to grind to mine resources, to kill mobs, to craft items, to cook foods, etc.FYI, when Pro feature was announced, I already said in my head that I will get this as a way to support the developer. The same way I purchase coins, since I got the game free. Why I did this? because the game is really good. If you don't believe me, go look for youtube video. Also, if they don't release Pro account, how will they pay server bills? How will they pay their developers?Now, for anyone still undecided, go install it and have a run for a couple of hours / days. Look for free peace worlds in the world forums. Experience the game and then decide for yourself, is this game worth your time? "

								Lets get this out the way Creativerse is as much a Minecraft clone with updated graphics as your going to get and it is free. Although they have recently introduced a pro model you still get alot within the free version of the game. Pro's main benefits is a flashlight to see in the dark, glider to get around and you are allowed to create multiple worlds with special customisation options. The worlds are massive so as a free player being restricted to one world should not be a problem as there is more than enough space to keep you occupied for a long time. The game for me does micro stutter and I have seen others talk about this issue but it does not detract from a fantastic game. As I said before the game is literally like minecraft, you have the different tier of mining gloves just like mining picks in minecraft. You have a good discovery method of when you create an item or pick something up you slowly expand your recipes. There are special night monsters that come out during the night and in dark places and other creatures splashed around during the day which range from friendly to aggro. You can build swords of different levels and armor just like minecraft. You can also tame the critters of the world which you feed and wash to get items from them. This allows you to create a farm full of creatures that can set to follow, stay or just wander around. You can even add hats onto them lolYou also have blueprints which are various buildable structures ranging from treehouse to forts where it basically gives you a list of ingredients and tells you where to place each block to create the final structure. You can also swap out ingredients for others if you wish to change out what it is built with and recently they introduced mechanisms that allow you to link certain items to perform set actions. For a game I expected to be rubbish I am having a ton of fun and it is a minecraft game where you do not have to worry about hosting a server as that is all hosted by the developers.			"

You have to unlock blocks based on what you have mined / created.  Lots of cool mobs.  I'll be playing this for several hours today.			"

								I was suprised to find such a competent game under the layers of eye candy and MC stigma. The systems, while some are fundamentally the same as the usual suspects, have flair to them that tell you ""we're not a clone but a member of the genre.""First, let's get it out of the way... the way you 'mine' blocks is awesome! Who doesn't want a gravity gauntlet? Me and my son started with the 'janky house'... building from the blueprint, slowly gathering supplies and learning the basic recipes. We didn't do a whole lot of digging, just enjoyed the scenery and got use to the mechanics. This self-imposed tutorial helped us shake off the MC mindset and get primed for whatever else CV had in store for us.From there I decided I'd start my own little slice of heaven. I made it public and unlocked... a brave move for a beginner. After about 8 hours of carving my house/mine shaft out of a riverside canyon, my first random visitor popped in. He looked around, made me really nervous (especially because I had to go to work... It felt like leaving a stranger in your house...). He must not have been too impressed, as he left without doing anything and only stole some leather before placing his touchstone and going about his business. I've since edited the world to force visitors to keep their hands to themselves.. and removed his foothold, but the concept really enticed me. This is the good stuff. Having people over to help you build, help you fight, help you shape the huge worlds you've spawned. A truly exciting multiplayer experience.I'm now well on my way to unlocking the secrets that are buried deep in Creativerse. I have my diamond mining cell and some decent armor, I'm using teleporters and freezing tar. I don't exactly know what I'm working towards, but the journey is fresh and I'm racing to get there.For a F2P game, it's amazing. Anyone that likes to build or discover will love the work the devs have put in here. If you've been looking for a new way to waste a couple hundred, or thousand or hours, you've found it. Check out the discussions section for things I think should be added.. For as awesome as the game is, it has sooo much more potential!			"

								You know what, it's alright.Mind you, I do play Minecraft, and I see similarities, but this takes a slightly different approach, which isn't a bad one.  Most of what you do revolves around waiting.  Extractors take time, processing takes time, etc.Again, it's not a bad approach.The only complaint I've had yet is the lack of skin variety, as well as some bugs.  I understand that this is early access, but I do hope that these are remedied at some point.6Overall, it...works.  I can't quite speak in an experienced view, simply because I haven't messed around with multiplayer as of yet, which this game seems to be heavily based around.  Though, for the low, low price of free, you can't go wrong.If I were to give this game a star rating, I'd say...perhaps a 6-7 / 10.			"

Early Access Review
								NOTE: I have many hours outside of Steam, as well.Although it looks like a Minecraft rip-off on the surface, once you start playing, you'll realize that it is its own game. Not all sandbox games with squares are trying to be Minecraft.. especially this one.The Graphics: 7.5/10Yes, the graphics are really nice to look at, along with the animations. The world comes alive much more than many other games, including Minecraft. However, with all that's going on - nearly everything is animated - it can get a bit laggy. Just because your PC can run games like Grand Theft Auto V at 60 fps on high graphics, does NOT mean you can run this game on high graphics - I know this firsthand. I have all my settings set to minimal. I can barely tell the difference between max and minimum graphics visually, but it does effect my FPS. Overall, really nice graphics and animations, but it needs to be optimized for minimal lag. The UI & Controls: 9/10The user interface is fantastic all around. It isn't the same bare-bones UI you'd expect in early access game (I see you over there, ARK), but is instead detailed and elegant. It could use some improvements, sure, but for early access, the UI is really nice and self-explanatory. The controls are somewhat familiar - if you've played Minecraft, there won't be a huge learning curve. WASD and mouse buttons are the same as in Minecraft. It has more controls, actually - and it still doesn't seem overwhelming even on your first time playing. The Gameplay: 8.5/10Like most sandbox games, when you load up a world, it doesn't tell you what exactly you need to do. You start off exploring, playing with the controls, and seeing what there is to offer. Eventually, as you explore, you'll find a crafting table. Once you find that, it becomes self explanatory - find this, craft this, build this, do this.. it isn't confusing. However, don't mistake this for the game being linear. It is not linear at all - you can take your survival in many directions. Unlike many sandbox survival games, you have a single do-it-all tool that comes attatched to your character, and you simply have to upgrade it to break new types of blocks. This makes the game less confusing, but may even make it too simplistic. However, overall, the game is quite self-explanatory, but in a fun way. You won't run out of things any time soon. And if you do...The Multiplayer: Your worlds are servers. When you create a world, it becomes public on the list of worlds - people can search for the name of your world, and (try to) join it. You can password protect the world, or make it so those who join can't edit the world, but anyone can view your world by searching the name of the world. This makes multiplayer with friends extremely easy. You simply tell them the name of the world (and password, if you set one), they search it, and they can easily join. It's fantastic. There's also a wide range of administrative tools for your world, and settings to make your experience easier or more difficult.The Community: 10/10Fantastic community. The devs replied to my problems within hours, and the community was equally ready and happy to help. This is not an immature community.The problems:There is no chat in the game, even if multiple people are online in the same world. It requires a fairly updated graphics card - there's a good chance you'll need to do some updating of your drivers.It can lag, even on great PCs... needs some optimizing.I'm a little worried about it becoming free-to-play at launch. I fear the microtransactions...Overall: 8.5/1010/10 would kill leaf creatures with a twig again.			"

								Zomg I usually never write reviews.This game is Notch's worst nightmare. This game will put Minecraft at a not-so-close second.First off, let me start by pointing out the developers are very active. The game seems to be moving quickly through the development cycle and there is already a LOT to do. I can see they're just getting started, and I cannot wait until even more things are added.The art style in this game is phenomenal. There were a lot of great details thought out throughout the character art and the aesthetic of the environment. Not only is the entirety of the game breakable (i.e. Minecraft) but it's just beautiful to look at.The one thing I love most: it's difficult. Expect to go through a few worlds of just utterly failing before you get the hang of it. Don't give up; it's worth it. The fact you have to work harder for results is so much more gratifying than the instant reward of playing Minecraft. You HAVE to find shelter if you want to survive; these critters involve a fair amount of skill to kill.I've played quite a few voxel games, and other than Ace of Spades (the original), they all kinda suck. Oort was a great idea but it has since been abandoned. This is the answer to the calling for a better voxel game. Crafting is pretty unique for its genre, but it makes sense and proposes a challenge that doesn't seem over the top. You don't have to travel too far to find what you need, but obtaining it may very well be a challenge. One downside to Creativerse is that it isn't very Steam-coupled. Perhaps they intend to release this through other channels but to be honest they shouldn't. Games through steam that also house their own login/authentication system usually♥♥♥♥♥♥gamers off and cause fragmentation of stats. Please, keep it coupled, at least for users playing through steam. Keep an open mind with this one if you're skeptical. It's worth the money and honestly they'd probably do well to keep it pay-to-play. $20 might be a bit steep but there is an obvious amount of love that has been poured into this game. 5/5, will continue playing for a long time. It has definitely replaced Minecraft in my eyes.			"

								This game doesn't feel like Minecraft at all in my opinion. I'd say it's more like Starbound, whether it's in the greater variety of enemies, the crafting system, or the unbelievably awesome atmosphere it creates with the well placed music and sound cues. The difficulty curve is just sublime, in particular - it'll never force you into an area you're not ready for, and new enemies are just the right level of toughness for each layer.The only thing I find ""wrong"" with it is the movement, but only the momentum issues with stopping and starting, and the fact that you just tumble down a cliff even when you're not holding a movement key, but honestly, these actually just add to the realistic quality of the game.All in all, it's just brilliant, and I find myself always turning to it when I get bored of TF2 or PAYDAY 2 for a while.

								First off, I think the positive reviews are either made by people who dont mind being misled, or sheep. As soon as i started the game, the only thing i could see was the bottom half of the game window on the upper half of my screen. Did a search for the problem and came up with this...http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/1/523890681413854742/....grant it, its a bit old, and to be honest i didnt pay attention to the date of the post. So anyway i created a ""dummy"" world to fix the screen problem. Lo and behold on a free account you can only make one world. Also you cant delete that world, nor the character you made, nor can you do much of anything. To be able to do all I just mentioned, you have to buy the $20 version.Now I have no gripe with that. These guys obviously should be paid for their work. My problem is when you advertise a free game and instead of offering a free game you offer a free demo. Thats what you have here, a demo. You cant edit any of the rules for your world. Best you can do is reset it. Which by the way does nothing for you if you created a ""dummy"" world.Just know what your getting into. I admit i did not research the aspects of this game enough. I also admit these guys dont make that info available on the store page.			"

								I can only recommend this game, even while it is in early access.While the graphics are really well, there is also quite a range of enemies and mechanics - for example you are allowed to tame creatures and keep them as pets - as well as a lot of tools at your disposal to experiment with. Want to play with a friend? Place down a touchstone and let your friend simply teleport to you! Like to have an expansive base? Built some teleporters for easy access! If you create a world, your friends can join it - you can also set different settings to prevent griefing as you may decide to make the world public.If you want to test out your creative side, grab a few friends and get building!

								Let me get this out of the way. You know those 12972978219847 ""BLOCK THINGY"" games? This is not one of them.This game is a masterpiece, and absolute gold, for playing with friends. HIGHLY reccomend, for TERRARIA lovers. It has extremely familiar exploration, Spelunking, and building elements.It's $0.  For Real. ZERO. The entire game costs you NOTHING. PRO, is WELL WORTH IT, but not needed, to enjoy the game.The only use for $$, is for optional items. Please support the developer, and this game. Get some. 150+ hours, and I'm just scratching the surface.This game has inproved by leaps and bounds, since my 1st 125hours, and I am thrilled to continue!This is not some cheap, slapped together, knock-off BLOCKTHING game. This is a legit, quality product, and you have a very solid chance of enjoying it. Looks great, runs nice, plays great. This game is a winner.Blueprints are amazing..... Even those of us, who couldn't build a BOX, like me, can build a CASTLE, thanks to Blue Prints.By Day 3, I had an ENOURMOUS Castle, nearly complete, that my girls and I, worked on together, using a Blueprint. Each of us, played on our own machine, and it worked perfectly. It took a labor of love, but, we got it done, and always knew what we needed to do, and how.YOUR WORLD IS IN THE CLOUD, so anyone you allow to access it, can access it, even when your not on. This fact, is vert important. Your world becomes a place that feels real. Where you can drop in, and discover things that your friends worked on, while you were away, or, JOIN THEM at any time. It's very very cool, and required NO SETUP.			"

								I love this game! The gameplay is amazing and the music I am a great fan of, I love the taming system sorry I'm a rancher and I just think the creatures are adorable. The mining system is actually quite easy once you get used to it and I just love how open it is, you can go anywhere and do anything. The only bug I hate is sometimes your pets disappear, but I just tame others haha :D all in all great game I give it a 10/10			"

								I have played this for a good few hours before I upgraded to pro and the game was amazing. If you want a game thats like minecraft but with a cool twist, I recommend this! Only one problem though is you HAVE to unlock a lot of recipes which becomes tedious and dull over time. All in all for the R34 update I rate this a solid 9.5/10. =)			"

								It's what Minecraft should have been. Quests + procedural + sandbox + choice of PvE/PvP + build stuff = OMGITSAWSOME!	Seriously, it's one of the best games I've found that fuels the creative muse. I love that I can enjoy a touch of MMO, a touch of Minecraft, a touch of First Person Shooter, and a whole lot of fun!It's creativity on steroids!It's free, so giving it a try is a complete no brainer.

								Awesome game 9/10, but its lacking in the ""customization"" area. I would love if you added character customization to the game. It would make your character seem more special/unique and make the game a bit more fun. It would also make it easier to distinguish players from eachother.			"

								I have to admit, I've never played Minecraft, but I am familiar with the minecraft-esque genre. With that in mind and this game being F2P, it definitely exceeded my expectations. Besides it freezing on me a couple of times and all your characters being the same if you do multiplayer, creepily staring at each other and glitching in strange ways if you compare them, the game is great (no, seriously). Plus, it looks like a game that will have character customization in the future. Right? Right?The number of items and vast expanses you can find and explore are overwhelming... in a good way! There's always many things you can do--grind or don't grind. The witty comments and good art for every item make it worth it, anyway. As of now, I've only found maybe three biomes other than the starting biome and I'm still scuttling around trying to bohog all the resources that pop up in each place. And now I'm going on the hunt for the special holiday items...It's a sandbox game, so of course it comes with a lot of freedom and I like that. Freedom. I do suggest that it needs a map that expands as you explore, but the lack of a map makes it more thrilling (unless you're a nomad, because then you won't care). It also makes the teleporters (and the beacons for that matter) have a use beyond reducing travel time.Creativerse is a great way to pass the time. Even if that means throwing water on top of a mountain until the amount of ice is so much that it slides you down the mountain. Ding! Dinner's ready. Then your friend shows up in the world the next day to realize the nearby mountain has an immense icecap. Forever a memorial of your hunger.I also took a peek at some negative reviews. (Someone noted that negative reviews were being ""censored"" because of the helpful rating, but negative reviews are very helpful when well written and their helpful ratings aren't much different from the positive reviews... Plus, it's not censorship by steam if we're the ones voting.) One thing I noticed is the top ones are from over a year ago. But another thing I noticed is people comparing it to Minecraft and mostly complaining about waiting-times. To that, I leave you with this, because it has always confused me: When building a table, can you throw the raw materials on the ground and have the parts magically shape and form together? Does this process take a simple five minutes? Can you toss a seed onto the ground and be instantly blown away by its growth? Does it harvest itself? Do you have nothing else to do in your life but watch the table build itself or the plant grow? Like I said, this game lets you do more. So do more!			"

								I have to be brutally honest with all of you that are going to play this game to have fun, but it has become a complete waste of time since the new update, with 10+ modifiers to your world just for peaceful creatures and more treasure, but they made it $20, which is utterly ridiculous. Also when you are playing you can only have one world, with default settings. To be honest with you guys, when Creativerse first came out, I thought that there was going to be a lot of good potential for it, but they messed up this ""Pro"" Update. So that is my opinion about this game. I also have to give it a 10/10 for the uninstall button for working			"

								Developer don't seem to make up their mind whether the game should be free or not:- Game started as ""Early Access"" buy-able.- They then decided to make it free for everyone but keep some sort of micro-transaction mechanism where you could get decorative special blocks and ""blueprints"" by buying ""coins"" with real money. - They then decided to make blueprints available to everyone for free.- Finally, they announced ""Creativerse Pro"": More options for world generation, special unique items and character capabilities AND multiple world slot providing you pay the ~25$ to upgrade! ""Basic"" accounts can only have one world now.Not a fan of these ""Free to Play"" games that are not really free. De-installing... to ""free"" space on drive!			"

								To start with, I've been playing this game for a bit of time. At first, I have compared it to minecraft. A LOT. But, after I have saw the gloves, new monsters that brought in the chills I used to feel whenever exploring any other sandbox game, I started to really get into it. And I must say, it's no mere ripoff of minecraft. It let me feel the same thrill as in every single other game. Getting to know the wacky, buggy and interesting physics engine, seeing new, goofy in most cases models of players and monsters, feeling the fun of not knowing how to craft anything, killing first monsters, and getting killed by them instead, in most cases, gathering my first rescources, going mining, getting my first bits of coal, beforehand realizing i had to make extractors for that, getting my first bits of obsidian and farming then for a stone cell only to gather bedrock to make a forge. Most of the flaws of the game are not really even that bothersome. In fact, they give the game some fun tricks to pull off. Let's say the buggy physics engine, for example. Turn a chair upside down, sit on it, get off, and you're in for another Apollo space program to the skybox, after which you may or may not die. And that's what makes this game so lovable. Many goofy things in it: comedic item descriptions, silly monster design, gloves that suck up blocks for ordinary pickaxes, teleporters, ingame jokes, pretty decent terrain generation. Then, there's housebuilding. And dear lord, the amount of blocks and furniture is simply MASSIVE. I simply LOVE how much variety there is in terms of housing. Most of players may build simple wooden houses in the middle of their beloved forest. And they will look just as good as another player's treehouse. But then, it can be also beaten by some ambitious player's greek styled cave base with many fountains in it and many chamers of all kinds. That's what this game is about. The variety.But lately, suddenly something started to change. Developers seemed to have a shortage on money, and offering the pro mode, which offers some neat features such as flashlight, more backpack space or a glider, was a pretty good move, including the paid block packs and blueprints. It's all fine and is a good way to make the game more entertaining while keeping the free experience as good, except a little worse, than premium experience. Until they have started limiting some of the crucial world options, such as setting a world count cap, disabling a few options and disallowing free players to disable PVP. That is what made the players hate the developers, and is an unhealthy move. But I am not to complain about devs, but about the game.Tl;dr Game's a really cool minecraft looking sandbox, but devs turned out to be greedy and made the pro mode take away some of fun away from it. Hate the player not the game.			"

								9.5/10 I believe there should be more ores, armor, weapons and a new biome/layer.Amor idea 1: Ruby armor, a little stronger than diamond and glows at night.Armor idea 2: Emerald armor, stronger than Lumite. Glows in the dark just like Ruby and during the daytime you get a 5+ damage increase against corrupt monsters and has a 5% armor increase towards mobs of it's own layer known as the ED layer which contains poisonous neon green monsters who glow. (Miru, Pigsy, Chizzard and Rockster) they also spit this weird green gew that does posion damage for 5 seconds. The water in this layer is neon green and glows and when you step in it, it does 8 seconds of posion damage. The blocks down there consist of Dirt, Stone, Woods, Leaves. (ED Leaves, ED Dirt, ED Stone, and ED wood. Also ED trees) Weapon idea 1: Emerald sword, does a bit more than Lumite sword and glows during the dark.Weapon idea 2: Bows. (Lumite, Wood, Diamond, Obsidian, Stone, Iron.) Ore idea 1: RubyOre idea 2: Emerald I am open to opinions on this good or bad.Emerald Sword does 10% more damage this monsters that are not ED.Emerald mining cell: Better than lumite and will lose no durability mining T1 blocks.Emerald armor is 5% stronger against non ED monsters.*Also open to edits*Emerald sword does 200 Overall emerald armor defense: 1,300Chest plate: 600Arms: 225Legs: 225Pauldron: 250(If someone feels like it they can comment how strong Ruby armor should be)			"

								This game is fantastic! it's like Minecraft only in that it's a block style crafting game. everything else about it is better in every way. from the wide variety of wildlife to murder for resources (or fun), to the teleportation system, everything-EVERYTHING in this game is better than Minecraft in every way. it's like Minecraft's sexy, interesting cousin. except it's still better than that. currently, the 2 biggest downsides i see to this game are the fact that you're always logged into and playing on a server in this game-even if you're in a world by yourself. and the fact that you can't currently adjust the audio settings on the game's start screen. the 2nd one's not a big deal at all, but i have noticed some framerate drops when running around an area that i've build up a lot of stuff in. but even that doesn't happen every time.

								So far not too impressed. Bought the game and can't connect to server at all. Aparently some North American client has this bug. I did everything sugested on their known bugs page and no joy. I paid for it and can't use it. Now, I can't give it a good recommendation, can't I? Too bad...looked neat on the screenshots.Update: Although the support section was kind enough to spend a couple of hours with me, the game still won't connect to the server. At the end they blamed my Internet set up. (an ordinary router hooked up to a pc box) but could not tell me why. So I had to uninstall a game I've never played.....waste of time and money.Update: After more than a year I changed my PC and my router it connected to the game. It's a nice open cube building world but I'm reaaallly not crazy about having to be connected all the time even though I single play and having only a limited ""territory"" to build stuff.			"

								This game is one of my personal favorites; it's a lot of fun whether you are playing with friends or by your self as i often do when i need to relax. The building is quite nice compared to some, though it does become tedious at times when you haven't gotten to the best mining gear or if you're looking for a recipe you want but it just won't drop, but all in all not bad. Not to mention that the graphics are being upgraded all the time and recently they added new music which I enjoyed quite a lot.Many of the negative reviews will tell you that they don't like the combat or that the game isn't worth 20 dollars. True enough 20 dallors may seem a bit much however I can't really complain since I was one of the people given a free upgrade of the pro version, but honestly it doesn't add that much to the overall gameplay or experience. If want a peaceful world you can find a friendly public one if you can't change your own and the extra tools? A light which all be it helpful is unnecessary since you can just make torches and the glider... well it can get you a few extra meters but in general it's quite hard to control but it can be helpful after you have practiced with it for a far bit. Now on to the combat, yes it's a little bit slow and could be improved some here and there, but really for what it is it's pretty decent and if you move around and don't just sit there taking all the hits to your face it's relatively effective. Seriously it's first person sword swinging it's not exciting it's not ment to be all that exciting it's ment to kill whatever's attacking you. If this game was one of those rpg mmos in thrid person I could understand wanting better flasher attacks but here it's pretty much just slash till it dies and of course as i mentioned above moving around while you fight can help quite a bit. If there's low grav on the server hoping above your target and hitting it from behind will lessen your chances of getting hit.The only things i truely dislike about this game is the tendency to get extemely laggy at times and that we haven't gotten new creatures or at the very least new uses for the creatures, but i digress those sorts of things take time to add or fix and this game is still early access.

								This game is amazing.  At first, I thought it was just a generic mix of Minecraft and Terarria, or possibley a rip-off of Trove or Cube World, but it was something new.  The game starts you off holding your hand, but then drops you off, letting you do whatever you want-  that is untill you realize that the game's combat system sucks.  Combat from the begining to the end  consists of you and the enemy wailing on eachother untill somebody falls over.  You are expected to be physicly stronger than your enemy, not smarter.  You can't even avoid and attack once you initiate combat; the enemy's attacks just go on a timer.  It woulden't be such a big problem if combat was not such a big part of the game, but it is.  That is the number one issue with this game that games like Cube World and Terarria or even Minecraft do much better.  Also, the first few days, all enemys reck house and you have NO chance of killing them.  Apart from that, the building, exploring, and FANTASTIC multiplayer system works very well, with random treasure chests and a large ammount of areas to explore.  They nailed the underground caves and different mining system, as well as crafting, which is on a timer. The game also looks great for an early access and free game being on steam for only a few days.  I give this game a 8/10 for the faulty combat, and I hope they fix this issue in the future.Amendment: Okay, they fixed the combat mechanic, but... after releasing, they added a 20 DLC that gives you a big unfair adventage, so I give the game two points for fixing combat, but take away two for the $20 DLC.

								It's free & fun, try it.I'm havin fun alone but im sure its even more fun with friends, if you have friends - sadly, i'm living in the friendzone, so i will probably never get a chance to experience this part of the game. Feelsbadman.This game isn't askin you ""Yo, Dude, Easy, Normal or Hardmode?""Its Survival of the fittest! So you basicly playing on Difficulty; ""Real Life"" and you have to deal with it. (<- love it)The learning curve in this game is pretty good; And combat is fun works like ""Hit 'N Dodge"";Sadly, there is no blocking mechanic (yet), so, no Shields 'n stuff, which makes me sad, cuz im missing a shield to feel like a real Knight. Add Shields please~! <3It feels like the Crafting is somewhat different from other Games, collecting the Materials to Craft something feels like a quest, everytime, i really like it.Probably one of the best Early Access Game i've playd in the last 2 years. (Little bugs, but no game breakin stuff)Keep it up.			"

								I am pleasantly surprised by this one. At first all I kept thinking was that this was a straight Minecraft ripoff, but the more hours I put into this game, the more I realized it's own game.It seems like it is in really good condition for an Early Access game. I ran into no real issues in the 50 hours I've played so far.I pesonally love the cooking system. At first it seems like there are only a few recipes for food, but once it clicks, you realize there's actually a bunch. It's a lot of fun figuring this game out.There's definitely some things this game is missing (Redstone-like mechanics! and boats!), but damn, this game has the potential to being something big. Here's to hoping the Devs stick with it.			"

								Well set out game for the most part. Lots of options for visitors and restrictions on them if you allow them to visit your world. Building and mining is a breeze. The crafting side is well thought out and cool. The concept of when you die, the inventory you carry gets dropped and you respawn at your teleport spot is novel. The fact that a beacon can be seen where your loot was left, makes it so much easier to find your stuff and retreive it.Overall, a great game with great ideas.So far the ONLY problem i personally have had, is when i logged into my world a few days later, my house was not built as i had left it and there was a lot of resources missing that i had collected in my previous session. I had died about 7 times and had stacked the ""tombstones"" (they mark the spot where your loot is when you die and you can collect them) but the entire stack was gone. Presumably bugs will be addressed as they are discovered.If you like minecraft.... you will LOVE Creativerse!!!			"

								I really like this game, and still have fun with it presently. I've never played Minecraft before, which I suppose is the obvious comparison, so I cannot comment on how alike they are. I will say that this game visually appears similar. You gather resources, craft items, farm, fight/tame creatures, and obviously build stuff. Your basic sandbox goals. The degradation of mining utensils/weapons/armor is rather frustrating, but realistic I suppose. As with all free-to-play games (they are going f2p soon), there is a transaction store. However, that said, it only consists of pay-only building blocks and things called Blueprints (basically in-game building tutorials for certain structures). I quite fancy the blueprints actually, putting one together feels like a paint-by-number or something. Pretty much, even without paying, you can get where you want to be. The only exception would be if you really really wanted some block in the store for your build. I highly recommend this game if you like sandbox construction fun. Just make sure you protect your world from trolls (which is easy to do by checking the forums). 9/10			"

								I was slightly concened this would be Minecraft Lite.  But even at this early stage its so much more fun.  There are way too many things to list but I'll cover a few of the basics.Crafting is very intuitive, their unlockable recipes are a creat idea.  No more searching Wiki's for ideas, once they are unlocked, you can see what you need to craft them.The Graphics are beautiful, especially the creatures.  A little piece of me dies, everytime I kill a Leafi.  :( MIning is no longer such a chore.  Find some ore, set up an extractor, come back later and collect your goodies.Exploration is easy.  Set up a teleportation stone in your home base and never get lost again.  Build more teleporters as you traverse the globe.  Set up new bases in different Bio's and hop to them quickly and safely.If you liked Minecraft, then buy this game.  It takes a little bit of getting used to some of the slight differences, but I believe they are all for the better.			"

								Have to recommend this game. if you like voxel sandbox games, this one has some really great mechanics.Do I want to do a Pros /cons, not really, I'll tell you what I like instead.- I love the artstyle, it's blocky enough that building is easy, but unique enough that items and creatures don't feel like they've been created just to fit the game world.- In fact creatures are all very unique, with their own loot and fighting abilities and visually very different.- I like how mining is limited by the tech level of your equipment, no way to bum rush the highest tier.- Tame any creature you see and treat it well, it will give you better drops than just killing it.- Everything takes time, so you can leave extractors mining, farms growing, processors processing, etc. and then you can come back to collect everything later or when you next pass through an area.- Teleporters really open up the options for exploring, no need to worry about trying to get back to the edge of the world, just place a teleporter and return whenever you want.- A really interesting crafting system, with recipe tiers unlocking as you craft, as well as rare recipes from drops.- Drops, one of my favourite features is that even if you have scoured the whole area around you and picked it clean, you can still get random loot chests appear and some items grow/respawn so you can always find something new.- Death is not permanent, all your items get placed in a death chest which has a beacon of light so you can find it all again when you're ready. Just finished gathering all those blocks and then you fall off a cliff, no problem, you just have to find your way back and you've not lost all those items.- there's loads of other things, but I don't want to spoil too much.It's difficult to talk about what I don't like as things may change and bugs will be probably be fixed, so I'll just say that as long as there are more of the same in future updates, then I'll continue to be happy.

								I played this game while it was free to play a while ago. And let me tell you, it was insanely...FUN!I like the way where you have to work towards getting a certain thing crafted. Such as the bungalow walls. It makes it to where you can't just search it up and then be done with it. It adds a certain level of challenge to the game where you can't just make whatever you want in one hour, like in Minecraft, or Terraria. No, no, in this game, it'll take you DAYS to complete a blueprint you get from the shop. Would I reccomend it? Definitely. You can just wait for it to be free to play for good, like I probably will due to not having much money (most of my games are gifts), or you can buy it now to support the devs. Either way, you'll be able to play a really cool game with TONS of potential.

While a few issue do arise with this game such as the night monsters being able to just phase through walls to get into my home and with the night monsters being extremely OP for beginners. However the good strongly out weighs the bad if you just make a pillar at night you can easily hide from the monsters or if you sleep....i think i haven't had a chance to place down a bed yet so i have yet to figure it out. Also when i made the extracter i couldn't place it in to my make shift home so i'm not sure what to do with it.

								I must admit... I was extremely critical about this game at first, but after playing a few minutes I found myself completely gobsmacked! Many have compared it to Minecraft(Myself included), in some ways, yes and no.The Touchstone feature gives me more freedom to explore without the fear of getting lost or battle to grind back to base with a full inventory and risk getting killed just to lose every cool item I found on my adventures.Building with friends is much easier with The Cornerstone, no need to worry about your friends placing wrong blocks at wrong places. Although I prefer complete freedom to build what I want to build, the Cornerstone still remains a handy tool.The game engine requires minimal computer hardware, and it can be played on a Cheap♥♥♥♥♥Gangster PC.I have come to love this game and definitely recommend YOU to download it TODAY and PLAY it NOW!

								Creativerse is an open world voxel sandbox in EARLY ACCESS. I have to keep checking to make sure it IS early access. I think a lot of players coming into this game forget that fact. You will find something very different here that is rarely seen in any genre of Early Access game.The devs at Playful polish off their newest toys well before adding them into established content. Yes there are hickups or things are found that need to be fixed, but every single time SOMEONE from Playful is on it within a few hours at most. Even on weekends. I have personally had company Reps come directly to me for a number of things. And I'm nobody. Just an avid gamer that has discovered a game that I can really let my imagination run wild in. Quite often I have SO many ideas I wander from one to the next. Too many times you are excited over an early access game and you try to get invovled but the community and company making the game do not seem invested in the concept of gaming ... FUN. You will find with Creativerse not only a community willing to share ideas, show others how something works and help each other improve your builds, but you will find that Playful is just as involved in your experience as you are. I have been with the game long enough to watch the chatter between company personnel and the player base and have seen Playful juxtapose their game concept with player suggestions and even complaints. For an early access game ... Creativerse and her makers are that long searched for jewel that once polished to the sheen you know it will be, will give you great joy for a long time to come. Thank you Playful for hours *cough* of true enjoyment. I for one can not wait to see what you have in store for us down the road. Adora Lupinatu <3			"

								I recommend this game it is fun, easy and it is for people who like games like minecraft. Yes it is alike minecraft but has it's own things, and probably i like this one even more. There are no picaxes needed, and ir's pretty cool to play :) For now I am happy with it. Maybe there could be more items in the game or blocks/weapons/creatures. But this game has a hook even that most of people say it is minecraft clone. But in the same it has another features that minecraft doesn't have.			"

								This game is 10x better then vanilla minecraft. But in all honostly there is really no ""end game"" to this. Once you get to the corrupted world and spent a few hours there, there is really nothing left to do except farm and build (which dont get me wrong its fun but it can get a little boring at times). What would make this game a lot better is adding more things to do in it rather then a ""vanilla"" minecraft feeling.			"

								If you're a fan of Minecraft or other similar games chances are you'll enjoy this one.  I really enjoy the game's distinctive features such as its crafting system and corruption biomes.  And of course the graphics are another big plus. Overall I like the direction in which this game is going and I would highly recommend it.			"

								They screwed the game up with one update. On the last update the devs added a feature that basically took all basic neccesities that allowed free players to enjoy the game, and gave those basic things to ""pro"" members, who spent an extra $20. Even something as simple as creating a world is reserved for these ""pro"" members.Before this update, the only things they charged money for was cosmetic blocks and blueprints. I was actually going to buy one so i could support what was once a very great game. Now They've just ruined it.Unless you and your friends (this game only becomes really fun once you have a few friends on your world with you) all buy the rediculous $20 Pro status, I recomend staying away from this game. It's just hard for me to say that considering that just a week ago I would have said ""definitely give it a try"".			"

								Even though I've only played 3 hours, it's awesome. You create your own house like Minecraft, but the building system is better. This game is 1000% better than Minecraft. You start with a stick and a unlimited grass/dirt/wood mining tool. You progress through the game by collecting stuff either by killing monsters or opening treasure chests that appear from time to time. There are mobs, but if you die you just go back to your teleport pad that you place (or should place) and that you start with.  You can go back and get the stuff from your inventory (Quick bar stays) and a Death Stone (permanent reminder of your embarrassment, which I proudly have 3 in my house). You also unlock more recipes when you craft♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game is also small in size, definitely worth a try. Overall, a very good game so far, can't wait to see what they add nex.t			"

								Really great game. Like it more than Minecraft. I love the possibility of jumping 2 blocks instead of 1, blueprints are fantastic idea and are nicely done, minions/enemies are cute but also scary when encountering them for the first time (especially The Thing) . Travelling using teleports is fantastic. No need to run for hours if you dont want to. You can play with friends right away on your own server that the games creates for you. Many small little things that makes the game different and better than other ones in this genre. And the dev team is releasing new content often, thats huge plus. Overall, there is big future for this game.			"

I love how we can create multiple worlds, your own adventures to share with the public, and how customized your ""claims"" (pieces of the map you can claim) are. It's great that you have control over this. Love the fact that you have to look for the materials you need to be able to craft your items, and one thing that got me hooked is how positive the fans are in this community, and especially how fun, creative, and interactive the devs are! This always makes the game even more enjoyable :) Follow them on Social Media, you won't be dissapointed!			"

								It's a fun game, I once spent 12 hours playing it but there's a bit problem, the problem is that it crashes often in Mac client and that's a bit annoying, it happens when I try to travel using teleport to touchstones or to teleports itself going to somewhere. So the only two downs of this game is that either it crashes or you'd get disconnected. however, the game is really good, it has a great potential, It just need a little bit more of ads to hook up players. 4/5 :)			"

								I absolutely love this game. If you were ever a fan of Minecraft and always modded the game, well this is the game for you. All those useful mods are added in this game so you can actually travel, get your corpse, save your stuff, craft with ease. The learning curve is very low compared to Minecraft. It is really well designed and is easy to learn. With only a few minor glitches that will surely get fixed. With a new patch coming, this game will definitely rival lots of survival games.On top of all that: It's F2P. You should definitely get it and support the company behind it by getting some esthetic elements or getting coins.			"

								Creativerse, going into the game I assumed it was going to be a terrible Minecraft clone, like so many others. I was wrong. Creativerse might take place in a world made of cubes, but the graphics, gameplay, and overall feel of the game is very different. From a graphical standpoint Creativerse uses higher res textures than the pixel look of Minecraft, and even includes monsters, characters, and items that are entirely a different style from the cube based world, including the playable characters. All of the worlds in Creativerse are multiplayer. You can join and be joined by friends and strangers depending on the world and settings.Creativerse feels like a sandbox game that builds of of concepts other sandbox games has, but still manages to feel all its own. I recommend it to anyone looking for a free to play sandbox game to try. Creativerse is free on Steam now so feel free to jump in and explore, play and do whatever in Createverse.			"

								If your true to any Gaming Scene then i dont need to remind you about negative reviews.Do not be blinded by the reviews that tell you the game is going pay-to-win/play.  --Sure you can buy new blocks to play with but thats just Cosmetic.--Sure you can upgrade to a Pro Account Which by the way is one time,  what do you get? Flashlight, Glider, 2 free Claims, extra server. 20 inv slots... Any real gamer can bypass this with time and experience.From a developers standpoint this was a smart move.  By allowing players to freely experience the games basic functions you offer freedom to choose whether or not its worth pitching in a few bucks for more.Pay to Win/Play?  just not seeing it. About the Game,With every early access your gonna find bugs, optimization, and freeloading♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags posting negative reviews about a game that hasnt even finished its development.Whats important is understanding what your getting.  That is the games basic functions, meaning everything other than premium content.  (optional)Building: There are multitudes of blocks to build with.   Farm the resources upgrade your gear build new blocks.Crafting:  The crafting system is tier based.  Build one item to unlock another.  And if you cant unlock the next tier you may not have one of the resources to build it.  Find the resource and the item will unlock.   Crafting Blocks: Processor, Forge, Cooking Station. (assuming more will come)Worlds:  Every world is a persistent and globally accessed world, (or private) once you create it you have the option of setting a few modifications such as difficulty, mob awareness, gravity......  You can always delete the world if you dont want it.  Or, you can simply rename it change its description and then reset it.Land Claim: Many Many negative reviews harp on ""Oh its pay to win or pay to claim""  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T  you get 1 claim to start then you can harvest resources to claim another.  You even have the option to support the developer by purchasing Coins  which is a cash currency.  Be warned tho, the resource cost of each claim changes the more claims you have.World/Land Permissions:  You have to option to protect your world from♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags by defaulting new players to Visitor Status.  These players can then request (/Request) to have their status promoted (Visitor, Interact Only, Builder, Mod, Admin)  The same concept applies to Claimed Land.  The Land owner can change the player settings of every player on the server to have designated access to his or her land.Premium Content:  (if you call it that)  In any Free to Play game there will always be a way for the developer to give its players a way to support them.  In this case you can: Upgrade to a Pro Account (one time buy)  or you can purchase Coins, coins allow you the option of getting more blocks and if you wanted to, you could waste them on buy land claims.  No real reason too, since you can harvest 20 coal and purchase the next land claim that way.Overall Thoughts:   This game has come a long way from when i first played it.....(on my sons account)  Creativerse is making steady progress and i trust the developers to follow their own plans for the game.  Creativerse has a well developed Rock Solid foundation for the game to expand upon.  I dont say this often but this game is easy to come back to when you get burnt out on other games.  With more content coming and the games rapid development  I highly recommend you give it a try.			"

I'd say i recommend this game because of how good of a game it is. You have many blocks! Blueprints and also a 20$ permanent offer that gives you wings and a flashlight and more options to play around with! So if you have 20$ to spare, might as well spend it on that PRO.			"

								I see a lot of people complaining about now having to spend 20$ on ""Pro"" Even without it you can still do a lot of things. Perhaps they are upset that they cant fly or use a flashlight? (Both which come with the pro account) I played a while without it but decided to upgrade to help support the game.As people have said, Creativerse is a lot like minecraft. It's also a lot more though. Instead of crafting normal tools such as a pickaxe or an axe you make cells. Each one helps you dig further and further into the ground until you come to the final ""layer"".You unlock recepie's by crafting other items. (Make a wooden fence and you unlock wooden gate and stone fence for example.)Instead of cows, pigs and sheep you have weird monster like creatures that you can tame. Once you feed them they will produce items which you harvest with your cell. Then you must bathe them. Rinse and repeat.Of course, like many newer games there are a few bugs. You need to keep your tamed monsters in the stay position. If you let them wander they may dissappear for good.I would give this game an 8.5 out of ten. I look foreward to more updates in the future.			"

								This is a first for me doing a review, well this is going to be more of a first impressions during the first 24 hrs of game play.First the visuals are very pleasing graphics are nice and well done and so far i haven't seen any re-colouring to create different areas.Game play is nice and fluid some of the creature movement can be a little buggy but nothing game breaking but its early days.The crafting system is very well done i like the progression craft to learn new upgraded items and also the chance that recipes can drop from chests and mob loot.Building is very much like other games of the same genre.The mobs are well done with a great art style some cute some goofy looking and then there are the menacing ones.So far i have found the world to be rather large and haven't found an end to it as yet, having vines hanging from trees that you can climb is a nice touch and being able to tree hop is different, digging down  is a fun task and I`ve found can take some time as you need to upgrade your mining glove to be able to dig deeper and i got to the cursed layer late last night.Environment effects i had mixed feelings about this but they add another element and sometimes a sense of urgency to get the hell out quickly, as i said being on the cursed layer i had a  cursed and a heat debuff ticking away( and yes there are potions you can craft to to keep these at bay).Over all the game is very pleasing and a lot of fun to play i am looking forward to what will be next and I`m very impressed with what they have done so far.Devs listen and are also very active in the forums from what i have seen, there has been talk about Creativerse going F2P many don't like the idea but there a many that also welcome it, i purchased this on sale i paid i think $13 but would happily pay $20 .I hope to add more to this as time goes on and I would suggest to grab it while its on sale  as there is a whole lot of fun to be had .

								Don't knock this off as some clone. Oh, no, Creativerse is something grand in the making.It feels as though the creators of Minecraft listened to every whispered complaint and then, BAM, Creativerse was born. It's (almost) everything you loved about Minecraft with better grapghics, and a more laidback, sci-fi atmosphere.Creativerse gives you:-Bigger pet selection (every monster is tameable)-Pets pay out (you get items for caring for these buggers)-Better water graphics (Physics? Not so much...)-Adorable pre-teen characters (though I wish you could change their appearance. Oh well, maybe in an update.)-No Creepers! (huge plus for me. No random, hard-work-destroying explosions)-Sci-fi atmosphere (Suck-arms instead of pickaxes and glowy machinery for crafting)-Teleportation (makes life easy. You can recall to wherever you place your pad using the 'T' shortcut OR create a numbetr of teleporters you can step through and link together via a nifty little menu where you place items inside it to attune them to one another)-Easy to navigate U.I. (Very intuitive. Bonus: almost all of the items you can interact with can be renamed) -Dungeoning (Plenty of monsters and dark pits to wander through with a torch, though the equipment selection feels a little sparce thus far)-It's now FREE TO PLAY. -Did I mention it's free?So, yes, it draws a lot of inspiration from Minecraft, but it's definitely not a carbon copy. Definitely worth a play. Creativerse is far from perfect, but I'm looking forward to what future updates hold. "

I'm glad to say I helped even a small amount in getting this game developed. With it being early access, sure there is some bugs and other issues. But I expected them before I even started playing. None of them have ever been game breaking. But what's great is the amount of things this game does right from a very early stage in its development. There is a high level of promise here and I hope the devs stick behind this game and turn it into something fantastic.			"

								For some reason I find Minecraft boring despite my kids loving it.  Somehow this game has spoken to me and it's turned out to be great family fun at our house.  We purchased 2 copies for the kids and one for myself and the wife.  It may not be the most amazing game ever but it's a lot of fun being able to build things and explore in a simple but yet complex dynamic environment.  The graphics are good in the sense that it's a step up from Minecraft, though performance seems to be a bit laggy at times for unknown reasons (not bad enough to completely impact gameplay).Overall, if you're tired of the same old Minecraft, give Creativerse a try.

								I don't like Minecraft, but I love this game.  305 hours and it is still as fun as it was back when I bought it.  Now it is free, MT for block kits and coins which you can use to buy custom blocks.  You can still make anything you want without buying anything.  However you can assemble blueprints quickly by buying the block kits that include all the blocks you need to complete the blueprint.You used to have to spend coins on the blueprints but they are all craftable now.  You basically gather some blocks and create the blueprint, set that down and then build the structure.  Some of the blueprints contains over 10,000 blocks!  Will keep you going for some time :)  You can also customize the blueprints.  For instance if you decide to build the wood fort but want to make it out of rock you can customize the blueprint and replace the wood blocks with the stone of your choice.  It will update the blueprint and tell you where those blocks go.  Pretty cool.Overall I'd recommend this game.  I mean hey it's free, what have you got to lose?			"

Early Access Review
								Honestly, it didn't start well. I tried it during the free week, and from what I've read about it, it was a Minecraft clone with paying Early Access that would be released later as a free-to-play game with cash shop.Starting with the cons :After some hours I found out about the waiting game : want to convert some blocks into crafting materials ? You have to wait for a ""processor"" to do it. Want to extract coal, obsidian and iron ? You have to wait. And the more precious the material is, the longer you wait.Also, you need to craft specific mining cells to gather blocks, one for each ""level"" ( stone, fossil, lava, etc. ), and each cell only permits you to gather a few hundreds blocks maybe, so you need to craft a new one every 2 minutes; And gathering the materials to craft those cells can be really boring, especially the flowers that grow on trees ( but there is an exploit you can use to get tons of them, even the devs suggest that you use it )...All of this just screams ""we're gonna make you pay to wait less, like any stupid facebook game"", doesn't it ?Something baffling too is that there is no portable light, so you have to waste a lot of ressources crafting torches or lanterns, or waste your time picking them up to place them elsewhere. And as their radius is REALLY small, you'll need hundreds of them...There is also this stupid ""super jump bug"" people have been complaining since 2014. basically, sometimes when you jump your character will jump 50m high or more, and of course when you hit the ground again, you die, losing all your inventory...Last thing, it's about the monsters. They are EVERYWHERE ! You just can't dig anywhere without stumbling into a cave full of mobs. It's not really a problem in itself, the real problem is the sound : you will hear those monsters through the walls all the time, because no matter where you try to build your house, there will be a cave nearby. I've spend hours filling a entire cave with blocks to keep monsters from spawning under my castle, so I wouldn't have to hear them.Now the pros, and why I finally bought the game and recommend it :Well first, the devs put it for free for a week, so they are pretty confident with their product and know it's good.After the bad first impression with the waiting game, I kept playing, more and more. And the game itself is good. I never played Minecraft so I can't compare, but I played Terraria and Starbound, and I really prefer Creativerse.Sure you have to wait to craft materials, but you just need to craft several crafting stations to speed up the process. Sure you need to wait to gather ore, but you can just put an extractor on the node and keep digging around, then come back later to gather the ore. In the end it's no big deal, if it stays that way.It's still EA but the game feels finished, except for some bugs and poor performances most of the time ( don't know if it's a GPU, CPU or server lag issue, but I don't think it's because of my PC, I have a gtx970 and an i7 ).There are really nice features, one of my favorite being ""TNT digging"", and you can also craft a device that just removes a big square chunck of blocks, it's really quick. You can also craft teleporters and configure them with ""codes"" by putting 3 objects to create the code; So let's say a TP has 3 stone blocks as code, and you build another TP, you put three stone blocks as destination and BAM, you're teleported to the first one. So you can really create a whole network of TP to fast travel anywhere, like, one TP on a beach to gather seashells, another one in the snow if you need snow or ice, etc.Exploration is really nice, the world is big and full of different biomes. Caves can be really huge and take hours to explore, the atmosphere is really well done. Too bad we need so much torches to light up the path, because it's mostly pitch black, with ony some colored fog to highlight the cave at a distance.Objects and monsters design are nice too, and most textures are pretty good. However I find the building materials textures a bit ugly most of the time and it's hard to build something that looks good. I thought building an obsidian temple would look good, but in the end it's just a big, blocky, blue house...Also the character can rust fast and jump high, controls are good too, and for once the UI and inventory are pretty effective ( compared to Terraria which was a nightmare to play ).All this makes a rather enjoyable experience, so if you're looking for an almost finsihed game, just buy it. Or wait for it to be free to play and possibly destroyed by a sh*tty buisness model ( hope it won't be though ).			"

								Right, I've tried to like this game. I've got a significant playtime on a server with friends. I'm being as unbiased as I can. If Minecraft didn't exist, perhaps Creativerse would look better. As it is, by basing so much of its core gameplay off of Minecraft, it really has no excuse to be this mediocre. This game is Minecraft Lite. It's Minecraft made simple, with a lot of pretty blocks and cute ""pets"", but basically nothing more. It's Minecraft for the unambitious, the unimaginative. It's what you'd let your child play, if you thought she couldn't handle challenge or failure. In the process of lowering the learning curve, Creativerse takes away the cool toys and leaves you with limits. No complicated redstone, instead have a wiring system that gets confused when you send two inputs into an object. No world-manipulation capabilities like pistons or dispensers; instead have logic gates made for you as individual blocks, and only the ability to turn off lights and open doors with wiring. No large-scale crop and animal farming, instead mine every individual crop. Instead, feed/wash/harvest every individual animal, which you must also tame individually as it tries to escape or kill you. No risky death where your inventory falls into lava, instead respawn on this Touchstone, which you can reclaim from anywhere in the world, place anywhere, and teleport to anytime.Redstone and world-manipulation was the lifeblood of Minecraft; the ability to change every block of the world was one thing, but the ability to make the world change at the push of a button, to imagine contraptions and make them so, that is why Minecraft is timeless and so full of potential. There is no potential in Creativerse. The game-makers think for you, and the player is limited by the makers' imagination as a result. Hell, there isn't even rails or minecarts. ""Early Access"" is no excuse. In the time that this game has been in development, Minecraft went from Alpha to retail, complete with all of the core gameplay that gave the player so many possibilities. Creativerse can't add more fundamental gameplay aspects without overhauling the game, so the future will likely bring only more pretty blocks and cute pets and nothing else.In other words, if you've experienced half of what Minecraft allows you to do, then this game will make you very sad.

								THIS GAME IS FREAKING FANTASTIC, ESPECIALLY WITH FRIENDS!!! Sorry for the caps, but that's my enthusiasm towards this game. It's great fun to play. My brother bought two copies- one for himself and one for me (as a birthday present)- and we both booted up our games. He created a world and started playing. As soon as my title screen appeared, his world was there! It is so easy to play with friends it's insane! I joined his world and the rest is history. I don't want to stop playing.			"

								This game has made me leave MInecraft, probably for good. It's what I found myself wishing for after months of playing Minecraft. It's similar enough to make it easy to pick up and play, but different enough to realize that MC wasn't realizing it's potential. Best voxel game out there, and easily the most beautiful. For me, when you see how beautifully the art direction on this game has been done, it can be hard to accept 'less than' from other games. It's GORGEOUS.			"

								It's a nice game to play. Better looking and less anoying then minecraft. You have a good amount of things you can build without doing crafting table non-sence as in minecraft. For some stuff you do need to convert things from raw to refined However, you tend not to have to have dozens of forges and such to do it.  A couple or few is more then enough to handle the job.You make a wood roof and instantly you can make a stone one. You don't need lists of crap to leaf through to figure out how to craft something. The standard items you can build look decent enough. You can also go to the store and purchase more items such as fansy blocks and blue prints to create better looking stuff. Over time more items are to be added in. Right now it's a small selection. They also give you a small stipend so you can get a few things off the bat.			"

But when you want have four friends over I would much prefer for gamepads on a couch over finding space for four computers, mice, and keyboards.

								Creativerse is a game that has a lot of potential. Whilst games like Minecraft have a lot more features, and you can add mods, Creativerse is still in Early Access, and I have no doubt that those features will come in time. I was impressed by the variety of blocks that were available in this game, that it includes blocks to build proper houses, and that so many of the different blocks of the game have their own style of stairs/rooves/doors. It's an area where Minecraft fails, because you still have to make your rooves out of stair blocks and have only released more than 2 doors in the last few updates.At the moment Creativerse is a little empty. You can unlock 90% of all the blocks, weapons, and tools within a few hours of playing, and there's only a handful of biomes to explore and monsters to kill. It's a game with a lot of room for expansion. However, based on the more dangerous areas of the game to go in, I wouldn't say greater and grander expansions are too far down the line.Considering this game is free as well, I'd say it's definitely worth getting. If you're unsure, keep an eye on it. I suspect it'll get a lot better in the coming months.			"

								Creativerse shows so much potential, though it's basically an FTP version of minecraft, it's a lot more detailed and more fun than most minecraft copies that I've seen. The only problem that I can see is the fact that it's online only, which I don't have a problem with personally, but it does create a problem for those who travel a lot or those who don't have a very stable connection. A few suggestions for Playful is basically add in workshop support, so that users can share their worlds and creations, or at least add in support for servers so that we don't always have to play with friends. Another thing you guys could add would be something like Minecrafts Creative mode, for those who don't prefer survival, and maybe a mode that adds in hunger, deletion of all items upon death, and the need to sleep for those who enjoy a more hardcore play through. All and all, Creativerse is a great game, I definately recommend it to those who enjoy sandbox style games.			"

								This game is a good alternative to Minecraft, i really like it that you don't need to setup your own server and that it is free to play for everybody, this makes it very easy to play with friends that want to try the game.The only thing i really miss are community built addons and mods. "

								is the best iv seen thats like mine craft but has a complete different feel but overall 6/10 accept for the latest update. i likethew fact they aded in new gates ect butthe carct u gotta pay to create a new world and to add world modifiers. i understand that the creator wants to make money but lets be real, not every one can affford to go pro but haas the in store coin optionand if the new content added in to crafting is for only for buying pro then its a wast of money.so to sum it all up it is a good game and has so much to do in it but has so much improvement to go. for instance random generating ruins or structures or even a custom player customisation option to make every player unique thean the next. more mobs or even if it dosnt defeat the purpose of the game villages.

								I am just totally addicted to this game. It's got a good balance of creation and danger to lift it out of the plain boring cube grabbing and building.A few more shapes would really set it out in front, such as a corner slope for roofs and a slope for grass cubes but I am not greedy because it's good to think outside the box and use your imagination when building.Farming can get to be a chore but you don't have to farm, instead you can just hunt instead and only grow crops to make food for your health, or make health potions instead. The choice is yours.			"

								When my boyfriend suggested this game, I took a look at the screenshots and was a little bit surprised that he would suggest something so \""cute\"" and sceptical of how much fun this would be. Upon first delving into my own world I thought \""Okay, it\'s minecraft\"" but I soon found out that it\'s so much deeper, and much more fun than minecraft. I can not recommend this game highly enough (if you\'re into the genre).This early access game is definitely on its way to being one of my favourites! Great job, devs!It\'s also free, so if you try it and don\'t love it, you\'re not losing anything! What are you waiting for? just try it already!			"

								Creativerse shows so much potential, though it's basically an FTP version of minecraft, it's a lot more detailed and more fun than most minecraft copies that I've seen. The only problem that I can see is the fact that it's online only, which I don't have a problem with personally, but it does create a problem for those who travel a lot or those who don't have a very stable connection. A few suggestions for Playful is basically add in workshop support, so that users can share their worlds and creations, or at least add in support for servers so that we don't always have to play with friends. Another thing you guys could add would be something like Minecrafts Creative mode, for those who don't prefer survival, and maybe a mode that adds in hunger, deletion of all items upon death, and the need to sleep for those who enjoy a more hardcore play through. All and all, Creativerse is a great game, I definately recommend it to those who enjoy sandbox style games.			"

								Although this game may seem very similar to the popular game ""Minecraft"" there are very many differences that need to be taken into account. I just started playing Creativerse and have been almost instantaniously gripped to it. It's an awesome game to play with friends. Seeing as Creativerse is still in ""Early Access"" I am looking forward to what the creators have in stock for the players. There is always something that draws you and makes you want to keep playing. The feeling of killing a monster you haven't encountered before and seeing what it drops is one that I don't really see in other games. This game is unique and is highly commendable. It deserves to start off with a bang. I honestly am very excited and have great anticipation for the future of Creativerse. I strongly recommend getting it. Props to the creators. I will leave the rest for you as the reader to figure out yourself whether this is the game for you or not. Personally, as stated many times, it is the game for me.			"

								7.5/10There’s really not much to say about this game. If you really want to play Minecraft but don’t want to pay for it, get this.It’s a good solid free-to-play game.Its crafting system is detailed. It has a more realistic, cartoony style than Minecraft and for being a free game, it’s really well done. There are creatures to fight, things to build, mines to mine. It’s pretty much a simplified version of the game everyone already knows about. It's also boring and repetitive if you're playing by yourself. But the same can be true for the original game. The best way to play this is with your friends. So gather them up and see how much chaos you can cause each other.  "

								TL\DR : I love this game, just download it and try it already.  No PTW. Great community. Small download.  Why have you not downloaded it?Another update is here today. New models for some of the items and the characters, lots of improvements and some new bugs.  Thankfully, with all releases there is a pinned thread for new bugs.  The devs where quick to respond, wich make me feel like they were all actively waiting for feedback. I have faith they will work hard to quash those bugs to keep the game getting better and better.With this release they also adressed three of the major concerns from players feedback, keep up the great work guys :)(I have not receive any incentive other then the free game... actually, I paid for some blocks that are on sale right now)NB : An archive of my reviews can be found in this guide. Some of you may get the joke on the title.

								For starters, yes, this game is obviously inspired by Minecraft as are many others. However, everything the developers pulled off, they pulled off just right. I stopped playing MC a couple years ago, but thought I'd give this a try. It's a suprisingly fresh take on the voxel-sandbox styled world games that keep coming out. They took all the best things people liked about MC, improved and expanded on them, whilst removing the features I don't think most people were ever really fond of in MC. Overall, it's a great game, I'd easily recommend it, and am excited to see what the developers do with this great game.			"

								TL\DR : I love this game, just download it and try it already.  No PTW. Great community. Small download.  Why have you not downloaded it?Another update is here today. New models for some of the items and the characters, lots of improvements and some new bugs.  Thankfully, with all releases there is a pinned thread for new bugs.  The devs where quick to respond, wich make me feel like they were all actively waiting for feedback. I have faith they will work hard to quash those bugs to keep the game getting better and better.With this release they also adressed three of the major concerns from players feedback, keep up the great work guys :)(I have not receive any incentive other then the free game... actually, I paid for some blocks that are on sale right now)NB : An archive of my reviews can be found in this guide. Some of you may get the joke on the title.

I can see myself playing this for a period of time every day. I also like the more modern texture appearance of the blocks.Only thing I've noticed is that occasionally there is very high server latency of over 1000ms... aside from that, I give this game 5 stars thus far.

								Very good game! Enjoyed it a lot, despite it being kind of a Minecraft clone. It takes a lot of Minecraft's aspects and upgrades them to the next level. Awesome graphics, textures, models and much more will await anyone who tries this game out. Only thing I recommend to the devs is to be able to change world stats after creation, like being able to make it peaceful instead of normal after creation. Also, if the devs want to add a kind of inventory save system, so we could have one inventory on a character in every world we go into that'll probably help a lot of people with those pesky obsidian nodes...Either way, thank you so much for the game Playful, I'm going to play for many months, maybe even years! I give it a 9/10.			"

								Excellent game... and is truly free!  There are a few microtransactions but they are just simple cosmetic blocks and some blueprints for people that are not really interested in creating builds themselves(which does not make a lot of sense considering that at least half the game is about building).As an avid sandbox fan, including years spent playing that other big block building game and many other sandbox/simulation games, I have waded through the trash pile of clones and wannabes for a long time, hoping to find viable alternatives... I found that with Creativerse!This game is different enough to make it stand out.  The graphics are superb, gameplay is smooth, mechanics are intuitive, crafting is simple and progression based.  You can make progression easy on yourself by making use of many mechanics for easier mob killing, or skip all of that and dive in with nothing but the clothes on your back and a wooden stick for protection.The pet taming system is great and the animations are cute and smooth... well done!Playing with your friends is super easy and quick to set up.The only negatives are the little early access bugs that sometimes annoy but nothing is game breaking or outside of acceptable EA norms... I have experienced many more frustrating bugs with finished games than are present in this already very polished game.I would love to see more mobs, machines and blocks of course, but no matter how many they implement, I am sure everyone will always welcome more of those things.

								My computer is a potato, and somehow the game doesn't torture my FPS. Most of the time. This allows people with old computers to play the game fairly well.I feel like crafting is a bit hard, however. It took me 4 in-game days to get a furnace for some melted beeswax to get a wooden floor so I could make a stone floor, but I ended up finding a chest with the wax instead. Speaking of which, the chests are a nice addition. Maybe put some underground and add maps to find them? Thats a good idea for me.The attempt to find nodes was either a journey that would take you through 10+ areas or you spawn fairly close to one. It was SO difficult for me to find coal nodes. COAL nodes. And I only get 6 and the machine used to get the coal dissapeared. I'm not saying nodes should appear more, but nodes should appear a BIT more. That would be nice.I still reccomend the game. The creatures are nice, building is nice. This is pretty much just Minecraft mixed with Terraria, with a bit of TerraTech. All 3 cool and awesome games, and the devs decided to be geniuses and make THIS game.10/10, would commit mass Leafi genocide again.			"

								Allow me to sum up this game and what i think of it in a paragraph (or 2)As most people would notice, this is another game based off of minecraft. And while this is true, that does not mean you should not try it. The way I see it, Creativerse achieved the thing another game known as Block Story failed to accomplish: minecraft with RPG elements. The textures in this game are incredible along with the creatures and how crafting works. All in all, I would say its at least worth a quick look to see if you like the game's style.			"

								7.5/10There’s really not much to say about this game. If you really want to play Minecraft but don’t want to pay for it, get this.It’s a good solid free-to-play game.Its crafting system is detailed. It has a more realistic, cartoony style than Minecraft and for being a free game, it’s really well done. There are creatures to fight, things to build, mines to mine. It’s pretty much a simplified version of the game everyone already knows about. It's also boring and repetitive if you're playing by yourself. But the same can be true for the original game. The best way to play this is with your friends. So gather them up and see how much chaos you can cause each other.  "

								I have not played this game much but I love everything that I have done. I first saw this game and thought it was just another Minecraft wanna-be however that is not the case. This game is fantastic with how it is played and with how the game looks. This game is so much fun to go and just explore as well as build. The only down side is that in order to get more building blueprints is through microtransactions. I love the building mechanic I just wish there was a way for a player to get more than just the starter building for free and I would be so happy to see that users can input creations into the steam workshop and players be able to load those into the game. (mainly cause i suck at creating buildings that look good)All in all I love the game and am consistantly recommending this game to friends.			"

								This is a game that my entire family has enjoyed a lot, age 7 to 40. One is a player that prefers to start at scratch on new worlds all the time, fighting mobs and getting resources while building shelters and other things. Another is an explorer, wandering all over the map, a magpie (ooooh, look, shinies!), farmer and a tamer of wild animals, and the third is a crafter and the builder of entire towns, and so on. And we love playing it together, building things together, cooperating, saving each other, finding materials for each other. I recommend this game so much, and I was rather flabbergasted by finding out how good a game this was after finding it for free on early access. You can make  a world yourself, visit other worlds, invite others into your worlds or keep everything you do entirely private - and you can decide the settings on your world; if the animals are hostile or friendly, if you can carry recipes you've learned earlier over to the new world, if explosions and bombs are usable, etc, it caters to a lot of different kind of players. Also, one of our family was a bit hesitant, not wanting to play ""cube worlds that looks bad"" but the tune changed when seeing how it all looks in game. It has the cube materials, but the animals, players, furniture, etc are not, and everything looks good, new and modern - and like a game of today. It is still in development, and we get nice new features and materials at pretty steady intervals, and even if you sometimes have to create a new world (the old ones are kept however many new you make) to make a new feature work, they haven't wiped the game since very early development, and many ""old"" worlds are still active. It takes a few minutes of figuring out what the processor and forge can do for you and how to get new things to craft in your menu, and then you're off on an adventure. The game has added a tutorial when you start the game so you get hints of what you should start doing, but the game is very intuitive. Just remember that a shelter doesn't need to be more than a few blocks of dirt and grass if you start out in hostile world the first time you play. The community is helpful, and the developers are hanging around. And there's plenty of open worlds that will help you out in figuring out things if you prefer to get your help ""live"" instead of posting. And it won't take long before you're running after Keepa's to tame them so you can harvest goodies regularly, shout happily when you find a node of something you've been needing for the next level cell or find a new fancy recipe in a night treasure chest. This is a nice open game that you never really finish with, there is no end game other than finding all the recipes and materials in the different layers. But don't be surprised if you find yourself building yet ANOTHER great thing some months from now, as you learn the tips and tricks in how to make the best, funniest, cleverest and most astonishing buildings!

								For starters, yes, this game is obviously inspired by Minecraft as are many others. However, everything the developers pulled off, they pulled off just right. I stopped playing MC a couple years ago, but thought I'd give this a try. It's a suprisingly fresh take on the voxel-sandbox styled world games that keep coming out. They took all the best things people liked about MC, improved and expanded on them, whilst removing the features I don't think most people were ever really fond of in MC. Overall, it's a great game, I'd easily recommend it, and am excited to see what the developers do with this great game.			"

								This game has the most potential out of any early access game I have played. It is basically Ultra Modded Minecraft. Myself being a Minecraft Veteran (not exactly something to be proud of) I can say this game is the ultimate Modded Minecraft. With high resolution textures and most mobs being HD models this game is, in my opinion, better than Modded Minecraft. It has in depth crafting and makes you adventure to get the materials to craft things to progress which gives the game a really nice open world to adventure in and explore. But if you want to enjoy this game to the fullest I suggest playing with friends. It overall makes the game more enjoyable and practicle since each player gets a free teleporter that anyone can use. A negative is that some really cool things in the game such as wings that allow you to fly are only accessable by buying in in app purchase for 19.99 but the game can still be enjoyed without payingOverall I give this game a 9/10			"

								Date of Review: 02/11/2017Score Total: 9.7/10Graphics: 7.5/10Mechanics/Gameplay: 9/10I'm legitmentaly surprised with this game. I refused to play it for the longest time because I figured it was just another minecraft ripoff. Well here's the big deal:No there's no mods.No there's no hackers. (I've looked thoroughly for hacks)Here's what's amazing about both of these. In minecraft you need all these mods and so on just to make the game look cool or decent to your tastes and those tastes hit home on your PC and/or laptop hard. This game runs smoothly, really smoothly there's some moment of minor lag (a lot to be honest) but it's incredibly small and not an issue (at least for me.) In minecraft if you want to travel faster you're screwed from the start to grind into things less you go the cheap way with a mod or two. Here, I haven't even gotten passed Iron ore and I can actually make teleporters. The ability to traverse land is amazing because of this, and if you buy the pro pack like I did, and I HIGHLY recommend it. If not for the glider, for the transportation ease, for the extra stamina, even bag space.. Just go for travel luxury. The map isn't procedurial generated. It's not as massive as Planetside 2 or Minecraft. But it IS HUGE. It'll take you the better part of an hour to get from edge to edge.Biomes, diversity in mobs and difficulty curves to match, the feeling that you don't have to walk from edge to edge but can fast travel in teleporters. The game real has a lot of potential and is hitting home runs on everything. The game has a fair community, not a big one by any means. But they're there, 24/7 too and playing this game really stimulates you. It's minecraft on hard and easy mode. The mobs keep you on your toes, the progression system is absolutely brilliant and scales you into horror. Got a pickaxe that's stone, congratz you can mine up into the next level no further. That simple stopping point is epic. It stops people from going in over their heads, being smart and gearing up for every mine shaft and cave they venture into. This game knows how to keep you on edge.Extremely recommended!			"

								Played the game a bit here and there. Pretty good for a F2P game. Its mostly about building worlds and exploring them, so its not too competitive. Has multiplayer, can play completly without spending money, ect. Cons are the bad AI, lack of dungeons and monster types, currently no MOD support. Minecraft is older but still better due to MOD support. IE player created anything you want. If this game had MOD support, this would own minecraft hands down.			"

								So, while I could not get the full enjoyment out of the game for my multiplayer experience, I will start off by saying this is a wonderfully designed game by appearance. The interface to create and learn recipes is great for single player experiences. Looting and interacting with the world is quite nice. Even the idea of server hosted worlds right out of the box is awesome! But that lead to my major gripe, and what ultimately lead to me ceasing to play the game with my friends. Random world resets, usually via one player crashing, are the biggest annoyance I had. After playing for about a half an hour, we would have established a nice place, storage and what not. Then at least one of us crashed. Those that did, came back to the world to see everything we built and removed from the world restored to how it was when we first found it. They could 'fly' through walls and the floor as if there was no clipping on them, only because in their game, the entire structure didn't exist anymore. If they were to extract the blocks in their way, which were part of the structure in our 'version', they would receive the material as they saw it, but we would see that crafted item be picked up, and effectively deleted due to them getting 'dirt' instead.To alleviate this, those that could see packed up the base and moved to a new location, till the issue repeated. You can only be willing to rebuild/redesign a structure so many times before you just give up. Ultimately, I assume this issue comes from world data being saved on the users pc, and not coinciding/refreshing based on the severs data. At least a debug tool which forces a refresh of currently loaded cells/chunks to be downloaded from the server would be useful until this issue is fixed. But until that time, I will await for updates and play other games. Once again, the game is amazing at what it has so far, but that issue is killer for anyone hoping for a solid multiplayer experience.			"

								Me and my girlfriend have been playing Creativerse for 3 days and I have to say I love the idea behind it. The blueprints and monsters are great. With that said ore nodes are few and far between. Its rather difficult to find even coal nodes. Also another issue that has been happening lately is I constantly get timed out. I have no idea why so I guess it is the game client. The game is fun and has a great vision behind it. I do hope to see these things fixed and a creative mode added.			"

								Honestly, creativerse is flat out awesome. Most people say it just looks like minecraft, so theyd rather go play minecraft. WRONG. Sure it has taken a bit of inspiration from games like minecraft, but the game itself is nowhere near, the game has much to offer such as taming monsters, animals, throwing goo at your friends, mining, building, and so much more! It has a full on create-a-server with friend able to join you, descriptions and just flat out awesomeness! I have already created 4 different worlds just because its that fun!A few things though....There is no main purpose to the game, nothing to lead up to. Its just a upgrade and have fun game. (Not saying that it is bad but it could be better)Maybe as a suggestion add a Main Boss or atleast a few Mini bosses to have a goal of defeating, The ""Thing""(Hardest mob i have found) Is not much of a challenge when you can get it suck, tame it and just dismiss it. Fun game overall 9/10P.S. Watch out for Hot Foots, they suck ):			"

								This game has the most potential out of any early access game I have played. It is basically Ultra Modded Minecraft. Myself being a Minecraft Veteran (not exactly something to be proud of) I can say this game is the ultimate Modded Minecraft. With high resolution textures and most mobs being HD models this game is, in my opinion, better than Modded Minecraft. It has in depth crafting and makes you adventure to get the materials to craft things to progress which gives the game a really nice open world to adventure in and explore. But if you want to enjoy this game to the fullest I suggest playing with friends. It overall makes the game more enjoyable and practicle since each player gets a free teleporter that anyone can use. A negative is that some really cool things in the game such as wings that allow you to fly are only accessable by buying in in app purchase for 19.99 but the game can still be enjoyed without payingOverall I give this game a 9/10			"

								Creativerse...I thought I should atleast write a review about the core of this game. This game is definately drifferent but like features of Minecraft. Another form of explaining this is Minecraft is for younger generations who don't want a challange where here is a challange! The music oh my god it's not annoying like minecraft! It's soothingThe graphics are nicely done and the animations feel very solid. The crafting system doesnt leave you clueless and confused however you can't craft say the last item? You have to work your way to the TOP!! Instead they crafting system guides you along your way with blueprints and informational tooltips that show you what is needed to either craft or unlock items that are either locked or unlocked respectfully. I do reccomended this game to anyone interested. I have just brought the Pro Version and I hope there will be more features or even some build packs or codes for friends?			"

								This game is absolutely amazing! Do not think of it as a Minecraft clone, I would say it's better than minecraft in the survival department, there is no creative mode though, You can turn on special settings for your world to make it really easy to gather resources and build though. Every time that you create a world a server is created, this makes it really easy to let your friends play with you, just give them the password and name of your world and they can play with you. the combat in this game is also really great, you can't just click a few times in front of an enemy and kill them, you have to jump and dodge the enemy's attacks as well as striking blows at their back, this game also has a lot of value in its free to play package with many blocks, crafting machines, weapons, tools, enemies, areas, and resources to keep with you or in storage. Creativerse also runs very well, I have 4 GB of RAM and the game only has a few moments when it lags, those moments are during world generation, if you have a beast PC you could run this game smooth as butter on high settings. Overall, this is the most fun survival sandbox game I have ever played. PS, the game has a great community as well			"

								Played the game a bit here and there. Pretty good for a F2P game. Its mostly about building worlds and exploring them, so its not too competitive. Has multiplayer, can play completly without spending money, ect. Cons are the bad AI, lack of dungeons and monster types, currently no MOD support. Minecraft is older but still better due to MOD support. IE player created anything you want. If this game had MOD support, this would own minecraft hands down.			"

								As a long time Minecrafter I kinda think of this as it's slightly fancier more challenging cousin lol The basic concept of grab blocks,place blocks applies, day-night cycle of yay and sheer terror applies,though some of the monsters in this gae far surpass Minecraft in fear factor. The crafting though is a hyper improved system of ""Craft this and oh look you can now make this""  kinda pushing you to upgrade and find new types of blocks. The biomes also feel simply...more appropriate in Creativerse,often seeing similar creatures but ones fitting for that zone in color or style.  I enjoy both but I will say this is free,the pro version may be an option someday for the cosmetics but if your looking for a fun,thinkers,building game that's free look no further! Also side note i'll be starting a Creativerse series on my youtube channel soon,so there's that XD			"

								So where to begin, this game is good and has some good concepts and designs. The graphics are very visually pleasing and the game runs smooth, minus some rendering issues now and then. There is a good baseline of items that can be used, however apart from the blocks, all the items can be aquired fairly quickly. I have played this game for about 15 hours in total and pretty much have every item, minus all block colours and combinations. which really isnt long time get to end game items.As this game will be closely compared to minecraft, for obvious reasons. Although the content is lacking in creativerse in time they would be able to compete with them, such as a redstone equivalent.The biggest problem with this game is the fact that blocks can take forever to create, using forging rather than crafting. As this game has some very visually pleasuring content for structures, this should be addressed so people can come into the game and just 'CREATE', something like a creative-mode, would suit this game very well.Overall the way the game stands i would give this game a 6.5/10 and would recommend it to someone who would like a change from minecraft.

								In my books, this is the best voxel sandbox-game up until today:- Good Graphics, vibrant colors, cartoonish- Cool game mechanics (rotate blocks, gliders, gravity settings, blueprints, machines, etc.)- Best community i've ever seen so far (great support  from the devs, competitions organised by players, guides, ideas and suggestions posted by players and turned into reality by the devs)- So far every update improved the game even more (unlike other f2p games that usualy take a turn for the worse really quick), with bug fixes, added content and cool events.I highly recommend this game.Keep up with the good work!

								If Minecraft had been made 6 years later, this is what you would get. Except better in every way. Nothing can undermine Mojang's pride and joy, but Creativerse comes pretty close. For Minecraft veterans, this is a breath of fresh air and gives you the same feeling you had when you loaded your first biome. The music and sound effects in general are to die for, too. Absolutely love it.			"

								So I found this game and...It's like minecraft and trove together, in a good way. So after a few hours of gameplay I can state the followings:    1. The game is under development, and it needs patches here and there.    2. The controlls in the game are simple, the movements and actions are smooth, the PvE combat is acceptable.    3. I love the idea behind the game: every map is a multiplayer server too (as long as it works its awesome!)    4. Truly free gameplay money is only for supporting (at least now)    5. Is an enjoyable game so farSo if you've read this far, and you like Minecraft and/or any similar game you should give this a try too! But don't take is as the full experience and please look back when the game is finished!			"

								I played the demo version for 6 straight hours before purchasing the game.  I own just about every sandbox game.  So far this is my favorite.  I much prefer the crafting and the harvesting.  The graphics are impressive.  I hope someday it will have the ability for you to put your own textures in the game like in minecraft... to make it more personal.  I found myself immersed into the gameplay very quickly.  Having the demo is a very good idea, I myself have a few games that became ""bricks"" when the designers gave up on the game.  It makes me much more cautious when buying another early access game, but it becomes less important when you really love the game.  Of course, please continue with the game :) I will be happy with every update... I love the game.  Did I mention? I love the game			"

I also like the free servers and that you can set your world to just people you want to have in it--via password. I hope the free servers stick around and that when it goes to F2P the microtransactions don't hinder actual gameplay. This is a great game now and can only keep going I think.

								Played it at first on a friend's account, and immediately labelled it a Minecraft 2.0 game. After playing it on his account,  figured it wasn't, after all, just a copy.I downloaded it to see for myself, and I have to admit I'm hooked. I especially appreciate the Blueprint system.Things that could be improved, and that I can think of right now:-Loading time between teleportations is VERY long.-Monster types could be made more diverse.An Overall 8/10.

								I've enjoyed Creativerse quite a bit. From earning my way to newer and better recipes to actually having to go above ground for some materials, it's kept me hooked. I also like the free servers and that you can set your world to just people you want to have in it--via password. I hope the free servers stick around and that when it goes to F2P the microtransactions don't hinder actual gameplay. This is a great game now and can only keep going I think.  Keep up the good work Playful Corporation!			"

								Hmm ive never witten a review but this game is so great i played it during its free week (more like the last 4 hours).I felt attached its like finding that game that you know you will never get tired of playing. thte monsters are so different I actually get scared to take them on sometimes you dont know how strong a Monster will be untill you fight it, and at night they are so much worse. The game looks alot like Minecraft but it has its own nature its own adventure theres plenty more dangers the part of building a base is more important here than in mc. I liked this game so much that i had to pay for it they deserve the money.IS AWESOME!!			"

								I was pleasantly surprised when I started playing. I was genuinely not expecting a good experience due to past bad lucks with free-to-play-minecraftish-sandbox of the style, but Creativerse stunned me by being IT'S OWN GAME, and not just a mincecraft clone. Despite the lack of blocking during combat, and the need of more variation in biomes and monsters (simply have two or three models for each monsters with texture variants would help.), the principle behind it all is amazingly well executed.Up to now, one of the most robust early access indie games I've got to play in a long time.EDIT:While I still give this a thumbs up, the lack of frequent and robust updates drove me off. Once you hit the end-game content, there isn't much left to do other than to build whatever you'd like.			"

More intuitive tool system - pickaxe & shovel are now incorporated into the same tool WAY better graphics Wider variety of creatures to tame or battle, including some with biome-specific subspecies Tamed creatures can be harvested without killing them Super-intuitive crafting interface - no need for a crafting table or checking the Wiki Wide variety of crafting plans to discover and build And more!...and the game is still under development!Very belated edit - if you bought the base game when it was first released, you do not need to buy pro.  Just open the game and the client should recognize you as pro.			"

There it is! This game has alot of wacky and complex structures within the game and its super fun to get better at and just explore. Although the world isnt that big and there are some minor bugs here and there, its still a very fun game which i reccomend for people who are into exploration upgrade games.			"

								All is well, It may be a bit like minecraft but less pixelated which I mostly prefer. But it doesn't mean I don't like minecraft.What would be better is that there would be creative mode attack. :-)But there are bugs that I've found but I understand it's still in development.The bug of when creatures attack even I am away from them, still near but not far away.But everything else is such joyful and pure fun with the pro DLC.One problem though and it WAS THOSE BLOODY DUST DEVILS, THEY MAY DEFEAT ME BUT I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE, I HOPE THEY ARE EXTINCT AND NEVER COME BACK TO MY LAND FOREVER!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE NOW QUENCHED MY HATRED TO THEIR SPECIES. I WILL GO ON A CRUSADE TO THE CANYONS AND BREAK THE F OUT OF THEIR BONES AND SLICE THEIR EMPTY BODIES TO VICTORIOUS AGAINST THEIR ENTIRE SPECIES! But again, everything is fun, creative and joyful to play and this game is incredible even in development.                           From now on I will raise a crusade against the dust devils species and start a new hashtag for their demonic spawn.#CrusadeAgainstDustDevils "

								I recommend it but I have a huge problem with it.This game is a cooler younger brother to minecraft. Didn't play much but from what I saw they gotten rid of the crafting complexity and right to the action with much better graphics plus I'm playing it for free which is always a plus.Can't see more of the game because I can't really play it though. I wish there was an option to adjust the field of view somehow because I get motion sickness when playing. The content seems fine and I'll give the best review ever if you just give me an option to play for more than 5 minutes at a time. Had a similar problem with minecraft too but only after at least an hour of gameplay. Here it's way worse and there are probably at least a few more people around with the same problem so please devs don't shut us nauseated weaklings off.			"

								I played this game because it was free and held my interest, but now the addition of what is basically a necessity for most sandbox games in my opinion, is locked behind a paywall. This isn't like you, devs. You encourage players to be creative, it's in the name of the game, but since you got greedy, you're pretty much forcing free players to pay a hefty amount, and if they don't, they can't be creative and have fun like they used to be able to.The devs say that they're setting the Pro expansion up for ""success"" by removing features that we as F2P's love and enjoy. What they're really doing, is removing the Creativity from Creativerse.Game updates are supposed to introduce new things into the game, be it helpful bug fixes or new items that are supposed to keep the game fun, fresh, and interesting. Game updates are NOT supposed to turn users off of the game. Take Team Fortress 2 for an example; Valve recieved so much backlash on the 'Meet Your Match' update, so they listened to the community and fixed most of the problems with it.I do not reccomend this game in its current state, but if something were to change for the better in any coming updates, then I will have my keyboard ready to re-type this review all over again.MY FINAL SCORE FOR CREATIVERSE IS... 51%			"

								Logged thousands of hours in Minecraft, and I'm having just as much fun in Creativerse.The graphics and the overall feel of the game makes it a strong contender to the throne on which MineCraft sitting atm. I guess MC will sit there for a while longer with all the mods around backing it up as it is.But still..watch it, Creativerse is lurking in the shadows, given time and modding it will assassinate King MC swift and silent. Nothing can stand up to hungry and hard working Developers caring for their game.Looking forward to the finished product.Only wish offline mode and/or create own servers was on the table, since even tho I choose EU at gamestart and play on a 250mbit connection I still get delays on extracting blocks sometimes. Pretty much the only bad thing about the game as it is, but I guess this will be fixed somehow in the future.Buy the game..Support the devs.Keep up the good work.Oh to all ppl out there that played the game 1h during freeplay and gave the game a ""bad review""This is not MineCraft, it doesn't work the same way, don't give a game a bad review just because you don't have the brains to learn new ways to do things,,also,, thank you for making me laugh :D			"

								It was obvious they wouldn't make enough money making the game free to play and just selling pretty blocks. It was bound to fail and their response to this by making a hugely upgraded version 20 bucks and extremely downgrading the free to play version is evidence of ineptitude and lack of forsight. It's no wonder the free to play version hasn't gotten any real features in MONTHS, they've been working on the $20 version and all of its features. Steer clear until they figure this♥♥♥♥♥♥out.PS. This is coming from someone who purchased the game back in the day and gets all the free ""Pro"" upgrades.			"

								I've never played Minecraft before, but when my wife picked up this game during it's free week, I decided I would check it out as well. It is absolutely FANTASTIC. I played it for about a day and a half before I decided to pay for it, and I don't even slightly regret the choice. It's still early access, and it occasionally shows, but this game shows an extremely high level of polish that i've not seen on some games that are even fully released. The bugs that i've come across are usually small, but pretty regularly re-creatable. However the depth and breadth of the game make them easy to overlook. My biggest problem is with the combat, honestly. It's almost always a battle of attrition, and if you survive, you tend to end up with low health. At that point it's almost better to just kill yourself somehow and run and get your things. Dying is basically a part of the game, so it's good that there's no REAL repercussions for doing so (other than having to go pick up the things in your bag). Some creatures are absurdly difficult, and dodging is almost a complete non-factor. You can, occasionally, find a good spot to dance a circle around a creature and not get hit, but it's inconsisitent.My 2nd largest issue is the durability of some items in the game compared to the amount of materials required to craft them. The mining cells in particular come to mind. There's one of two ways to solve this as far as I can see: Either make items with durability (like mining cells) last a lot longer, or make the odd materials to make them more readily available. I'm not saying I want my stone mining cell to last me through 18 hours of playtime, but I would like to be able to find 5 red flowers without running around for 20 minutes looking at every other tree I find.In spite of this, the game is immensely fun, and you can easily find yourself sucked into it. Digging into your mine deeper, crafting your house to look absurdly awesome, or just exploring the surprisingly vast environments, you'll find yourself readily wondering where the hours have gone. I'd definitely give this game a 9/10, because it's technically not even finished yet. You should definitely check it out.			"

								This game is fantastic, much more entertaining than Minecraft. On top of being a lot prettier and running a lot smoother, its game mechanics are just overall much better. I personally enjoy that it encourages you to accomplish the next thing, unlocking new recipes and taking risks to get better loot. I'm not the greatest with words but I really would recommend it to anyone who might like this type of game. So you should really give it a try, you've got nothing to lose. :)			"

								If you like MineCraft, you'll like Creativerse as well. It is more intuitive than MC, which is a huge bonus for new and/or younger players. There is plenty to do, and I have yet to feel that I was ever at a ""dead end"" trying to figure out what to do next. It's a good game, that gets upgraded to great game, due to the price. (Free!)You can purchase the ""Pro"" version for $20, but other than a flashlight and glider, there is nothing that Pro gives you that you can't get yourself in the Free version in game. The only other difference is on the Free version you are limited to one world at a time (Or you can play online on other people's servers). If you have Pro, you can have multiple worlds and more control over the settings for them.Personally. I feel that the $20 is a bit overpriced for what you get. (I get that the developers need, and deserve, to get paid.) If the Pro was $10, I would say jump on it in a heartbeat. Who knows, maybe it will go on sale someday!Graphics: Really nice. (Way better than minecraft. The world has a fun, and kinda ""cartoony"" feel to it.) Also, it runs great on my laptop, which means it should run great on tons of systems. 7/10Sound: Sounds a lot like MC. Which isn't a bad thing. 7/10Gameplay: Controls are good and responsive. Your character moves pretty predictably. Lots to see and do. Many different ways to play, depending on how you prefer. 8/10Re-Playability: Just like other open-world sandbox games. You might get bored after awhile, but wait a few weeks/months and you will get hooked again. (Repeat as needed.) 9/10Overall: 7.5 / 10 (Great)			"

								What is Creativerse?Creativerse is an open world voxel/building game. The game is very similar to Minecraft, to the point that calling it a 'clone' would be fairly justified.After playing for a few hours recently I thourght I should share my my experiences and opinions.Pro's-Its 'FREE' to play.-Multiplayer works well and is easy to set up (Disregarding the many strange bugs currently present in multiplayer).-You can build giant phallic objects out of a number of different building materials.-Cute art styleCon's-VERY limited content, after playing through the game once start to finish you will know how to reach endgame in under an hour.-Once you have got to the 'end game' there is nothing to do beyond building something pretty.-Game is easy and unchangingly.-Combat and enemy AI is simplistic and boring.-Game is very much 'online only', there is no way to play offline without an internet connection.-MT's (Microtransactions) in an unfinished game that is lacking in content. It is possible to buy new block recipes from the ingame store for real money, however some of these are available in game as rare drops from monsters.R33 UpdateThe recent R33 update has added something akin to minecraft's redstone to the game, however from my experiences so far there is very little to do with it, sure, you can make a door/pressure plate system and some light switches, then what?Whereas in minecraft you can use redstone to create wonderfully complex contraptions with actual function, the 'machines' in this game are more of an after thourght.PRO accountsI don't even... What?Another part of the R33 update is the addition of pro accounts, this is in my opinon the worst thing they could have possibily done to this game and is the reason I will not be playing this game any further.So what diffrenace does a PRO account make?-PRO players get a flashlight and a glider (thats right, you can fly in this game! but only if you pay £19.99)-Free players are now limited to creating only one world with VERY limited options compared to those with PRO.Review SummaryI cannot in good faith bring myself to recommend this game to anyone over the age of 5, there is simply not enough content or enough to do to keep a person entertained. What content is present is very short lived and easy to complete.The recent update to add machines is a step in the right direction however still needs 'more'. I am painfully aware that games dont develop themselves and servers cost money, however I cannot support the developers in thier choice. This has created a clear division between players, how can a company that claims they dont want to add 'pay to play or pay to win' elements justifiy paid players being able to fly and non-paid not?

								Honestly this was a really good game, it's kind of like a free Minecraft with buggy monsters. But unfortunately the game devs decided to rip 90% of the game out and post it so you have to pay money to get the game's contents, if they're going to make a FREE game full of horrible glitches that make monsters teleport into your well lit with doors house, by walking through the door while it's closed and force you to pay them 20$ for only the stuff they removed from the game to force you to play it, that's stupid. It sucks, because I worked a long time to build my castle, only to not be able to use it.Just get Minecraft.			"

I would very much like to see several more layers added to the world each with its own unique bioms and materials you need to harvest to get to the next level below. Other than that i would very much encourage you to pick this game up soley for the multiplayer aspects like the free servers saved to steam so you can play on a friends server without them being online.10/10 would grief my friends again			"

								For the 6 hours I played, non-stop mind you, I have to give this game a lot of credit. A friend bought this for me after telling me about it and I was a bit iffy on the idea of another sandbox game similar to Minecraft. But, there is a lot of differnces between the two games.The structure of the game itself gives a whole new feel if you are use to playing Minecraft. It's not as easy as chop some wood, mine some stone, then you're good to go. There is a lot of depth to just the crafting alone. While it is still fairly easy to find all the resources you need, you need a lot of them. Even after you collect them, you might need to use some tools to break it down into a different matterial. (For example, breaking vines down into twine.) Yes, you have wait times on crafting stuff. While it isn't too terribly bad, the times do get a bit longer as you start using more advanced materials such as Obsidian, Iron, and Diamonds. But in my opinion, it adds more to the game because now you have to wait 5 minutes to advance and in that time, you could go out and collect more resources or even go spelunking.The creatures in the game is definitely unique. While some do remind me of creatures from Jak and Daxter (the night Pigsy's and night Leafi's), they still have a unique vibe to them. And they of course vary in difficulty. While a few of them have unique skills such as blinding you for a short time or spinning to do a lot of damage, there isn't a lot to worry about as long as you keep some distance.Also, there is furniture. And to be honest, it actually looks pretty nice. There is also a lot of ways to customize and build your own house and make it stand out from your friends. You have different types of carpet, walls, and even slanted roof planks you can craft. You even have different colored lamps. You could use them like my friend does and make each room different colors. Though the blue sometimes confuses me because I never know if it is dark out or not. But it still looks really nice. Much like a room with a bunch of black lights.To add on to the crafting idea to the game, you do not start off with being able to craft everything in the game. You have to work your way up and find the recipes. While some of them are scattered in chests around the world, you usually unlock new ones after you craft something else. Like weapons for instance. After you craft a wood sword, you unlock the crafting recipe for a stone sword. Which means you have to work to find better things, meaning you actually have a goal to work towards.While there is still some bugs in the game with it being early access, it still runs fairly smooth and it's easy to play with friends. No port forwarding or setting up custom servers. Simply create a world and set a password so your friends can join up. Even when you are offline, they can still join the world and continue which to me, is pretty awesome. I would gladly recommend this game to anyone who likes Minecraft or sandbox games in general. And I think if you actually take some time with this game, you'll find there is a lot of possibilites with it.			"

But it not as bad as one thinks. The server work fine, the game can still be played on your own or with others (just use a password). The comunity is great and helpful as well Devs that are active on the forums and have even asked us the comunity what kinds of things we wanted.

But anyways this game is somewhat like Minecraft but even better! It is so fun and is a complete different experience than Minecraft so donot think that it is a cheap copy of Minecraft as it is not.

								     I went into this not sure if I was going to like the game, but willing to give it a little bit of time to see for myself.  After the first few hours of playtime, I realised that I was hooked.  My family and I have always loved playing minecraft together and this is everything we loved about that game and then some.  We can create, we can fight, we can BLOW THINGS UP!  It allows each of us to play in our own style.  The amazing part is that this is still being tweaked and improved upon to add even more incredible things.  There are only two things that I can see on the negative side so far and those are:         1. There is no offline gameplay         2.  Characters are not modable (but you do get  a choice between being a boy or a girl)     The fact that these are the only things that I and my family can find that are negative, says a lot.  In the future, these things could also change.  We will be playing this game for a long time to come so hopefully we will see it come about.  I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone!			"

If the uppdates keep coming and they keep to thier word and make something epic of the game, then is it should 100% be tryed and played.			"

								Creativerse effectively takes everything I didn't like about Minecraft and fixes it. The inventory is better, the crafting is better, containers are handled better, there's a greater variety of enemies. Even things like the look of the characters and environment. Multiplayer is very easy to do, and you can make your world public or put on a password so only your friends can join.Don't let the ""pro"" status or microtransactions turn you off. The benefits are primarily cosmetic or simply a shortcut to things you could readily gain in-game, and you still get for free more than you would get for paying for Minecraft.			"

But it not as bad as one thinks. The server work fine, the game can still be played on your own or with others (just use a password). The comunity is great and helpful as well Devs that are active on the forums and have even asked us the comunity what kinds of things we wanted. (we asked for more grass block types and we got it XD who would have thought grass was high on that list XD)but in a jokeing manner: WE HAVE DIRT SLABS :? where as minecraft never kept them :?*note: i dont favor minecraft or creativerse over the other as i like both.

The whole world, mechanics, music, crafting... it's all done so much better than minecraft. I feel peaceful when I play. The instructions are clear as to what you need to do in order to build xyz. The physics is nice as well. It has that sort of.. floaty unreal/quake feel. I even tried strafe jumping and it almost worked haha.If someone is looking for a cute game (that is also safe for kids) to pass the time and relieve stress, I would recommend this!			"

								Creativerse is like Minecraft.This is true to any game, which consists of blocks, and revels around building with them. However, Creativerse has a wholly different mining and crafting system, building schematics, and everything below the ground level is very, very different from Minecraft's experience.I'd like to rephrase: Creativerse is like Minecraft, only better.

								Well this is gonna be a first impression view on the game. And I'm gonna make 3 categories beginning, mid-game and present.Beginning - I started playing this game with a friend a long time ago (around April) but we lost interest after we found out about the system of mining (The extractors) they took way too much time to extract essential stuff so we lost interest. Later on (couple months ahead) we decided to give it another go because we were bored we had nothing to play yada yada. My friend started to enjoy the game meanwhile I kinda found it still boring and just not suitable for me so I quitted for like 1 day. Mid-game - My friend finally convinced me to get back in the game, she built a house, showed me this and that and actually how fun this game is so I caught some interest in the game so we played together. Helped her creating the house (btw building thing for houses and such is amazing) I got hypnotized by this game and its mechanics even though I hated it at first. We played finally finished the house yada yada. Later on we found something weird ? I mean we built a pool and when she played and I was away the pool got bugged out and got all destroyed over night while she was asleep ? Also random holes in the ground appeared, might have been some bug because she restarted the game and it worked afterwards. Present - We found out about more crafting materials, gear, blocks to build with and we got really into it. To be honest I kinda feel that the game is way too easy ? In terms of finding resources and such. I don't really have anything else to say.. moving on.PROS & CONS:PROS: -Amazing game if you have a good friend to play it with            -Crafting and imagination of building stuff, realistic outlook of the houses you build is amazing as well           -Gearing up in the game seems quite fast in the later gear (at the beginning the game is quite slow)           -I found it fun and kept me intrigued even to this very momentCONS: -Feels like its quite a glidy game and it still needs some updates in terms of movement and smoothnes            -Even though I have a quite decent PC it still drops frames for me and has couple lag spikes for some reason (might be some optimization problems)            -Don't play it alone you'll get really bored (that applies for me)            -Combat is not as accurate.. mobs can still hit you from 10m away and sometimes you can't even hit them (sword      literally goes trough them)            -AI.. Ok the AI is legitimately stupid. Mobs tend not to attack if you're one block higher than them (doesn't happen all the time)            -This game ♥♥♥♥s the physics.			"

								This game is great, don't be fooled by inadequate reviewers, this game has a lot to offer, if you've played minecraft and have been craving a new open world sandbox experience then this game is fantastic, and is worth the small $20 price tag.From what I've seen in past reviews, most people tend to complain that this game is ""too much like Minecraft"" and that it's ridiculous to make you have to pay to use certain features, which in some aspects is completely fair, but let's not forget that Minecraft itself has a $25 price tag, sure that comes with more content, but that game has been around several years longer than this game, it really personally triggers me when I hear people say that ""the developers ****ed up by making you have to pay to use certain features"" ('cause it would totally be fair to make this game 100% free and allow the developers to earn literally nothing for the years of work they put in... genius) let us not forget that Minecraft's ""free"" version you couldn't even create 1 world, you'd have a creative sandbox and that was it, nothing was saved, the player got nothing but a taste, at least these developers allow people to play their game and decide whether or not to purchase it..Now let's get down to gameplay itself;Gameplay felt great in terms of player feedback as far as menu's and some aspects of combat, some issues I'd noticed when playing was not having a far enough reach with your attacks (most of the time you'd end up getting hit at around the same time that you can actually reach the creature) this was a bit of disappointing but I'm not going to say that it ruined the game. Content wise this game has around 20 - 30 hours worth of content to explore, items to collect and creatures to meet, the blueprint system was quite nice in some regards too! Something that disappointed me though was the method of collecting certain minerals was just a pain, having to craft an extractor everytime that you wanted to harvest an ore was an absolute pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Mainly just because the extractors themselves are quite costly to craft early game which makes an unnecessarily long start.The crafting system was easy to understand and I liked how you had to learn to craft a previous version of an item before you craft the next tier, for example; diamond sword required you to have crafted an iron sword previously to be able to unlock the recipe for the diamond sword. I also loved the waypoint system where you could teleport to saved waypoints at any time by pressing 't'.Overall this game is a lot of fun with friends or by yourself, the $20 pricetag is justified with the amount of content, but if you're looking to play this game once, download the free version and get almost the exact same experience! Crafting was nice and easy to understand  but mining and some combat was a little lackluster.In conclusion, give this game a go, you may be surprised! And since this game is in early access, you can watch this game and community grow with only more exciting content to come!			"

								What drew me into this game is it's basically a more intricate minecraft.In Creativerse the weaker creations have to be crafted before you can create stronger creations (like stone stairs have to be crafted before you have the option to craft diamond stairs). Creativerse is more of a game I would play if I just wanted to burn time. It does glitch here and there. At times I can't see any of the world around me but I can see through it and then it loads in. I do love that when I die all my stuff is saved in a vase that only I can get to it when I spawn back in. The blueprints for structers are a wonderful touch and I do wish they had those in minecraft too but sadly that's not the case.			"

The whole world, mechanics, music, crafting... it's all done so much better than minecraft. I feel peaceful when I play. The instructions are clear as to what you need to do in order to build xyz. The physics is nice as well. It has that sort of.. floaty unreal/quake feel. I even tried strafe jumping and it almost worked haha.If someone is looking for a cute game (that is also safe for kids) to pass the time and relieve stress, I would recommend this!			"

								I only have a few hours into the game thus far, but already it has impressed me. There will be a lot of people compare this to Minecraft, and thats fine, cause when it comes down to it, its the exact same principle, only done much better with already far more building materials. And its still being added to, hence that its still in Early Access. My only problem so far is the games tends to have severe FPS drops and my machine is no slouch. Though I've read that many are seeing this as well. But hey, its still in development, so I can forgive for that. If you played Minecraft, or games like it, and you enjoyed them, then give this a go. Heck, even if you never played a game like this before, give it a go. I mean, what do have to lose, its free!I will update this after I've played the game a bit more and after a couple more updates to the game.			"

								I only have a few hours into the game thus far, but already it has impressed me. There will be a lot of people compare this to Minecraft, and thats fine, cause when it comes down to it, its the exact same principle, only done much better with already far more building materials. And its still being added to, hence that its still in Early Access. My only problem so far is the games tends to have severe FPS drops and my machine is no slouch. Though I've read that many are seeing this as well. But hey, its still in development, so I can forgive for that. If you played Minecraft, or games like it, and you enjoyed them, then give this a go. Heck, even if you never played a game like this before, give it a go. I mean, what do have to lose, its free!I will update this after I've played the game a bit more and after a couple more updates to the game.			"

Why have only one Minecraft, when you can have a hundred varieties and choose the you like best? It's like cheese. You might not like blue cheese, but love Gouda. You're still eating cheese and both are 100% viable.Pros: Textures are greatModels are cuteCrafting system easy but funThe sky looks awesomeCons:I had some laggy movementIf you're skeptic about this game, give it a go!

I really like the gameplay. It's like minecraft, but more visually stimulating. I love the exploration, and large biomes. I can't really judge the game with only 20 hours of gametime. So I'll updating a better pros/cons list after i play for 100 hours or more. Played during the free weekend event, ended up buying it before the trial ended. Worth the $9.99 it was.

								Keep in mind that I only have a few hours into the game as I'm writing this, and that the game is in Early Access.+ Fluent Combat(compared to many other voxel games)+ Graphics are gorgeous(compared to many other voxel games)+ Good Soundtrack+ Nice Tiering system, gives the feeling you are actually progressing+ Lots and LOTS of stuff to play around with(and it seems there is much more to come)+ Seems there is a lot to do and discover- Crafting items is smashed all over the place(First you need to craft something in your Q menu, then you have to use machine A to craft piece B, and then you have to combine it with Piece C that has been created in machine X... you get my point. It's rather overwhelming, and quite time consuming)- Interface needs improvement(As for now, you have to browse huge lists just to find that one thing you want to make. And the further you go, the bigger the lists become. Seriously needs a few QoL improvements there)- Monster AI is quite derpy, sometimes ignoring people completely- Once you got your basic set, the game isn't very challenging anymore(unlike items, it doesn't feel there are different many tiers of monsters out there(... yet?))- Standard occasional bugs(no major crashing yet, just a few silly bugs like being stuck in the ceiling after jumping on the bed x.x)(+ you can jump on the bed)- FPS drops a little when venturing underground(Nothing major, but slower comps might notice it)As it is now, It's the typical Early Access game. It's playable, it's enjoyable, and it has great potential. There has been a lot of thought put into the game, and I appreciate it. The game isn't there yet, hence the EA status. It's up to the devs whether this game will become a master piece, or another could-have-been-awesome.I will update my review if it turns out to be the latter, but until then, download and give it a try!

								Much better than Minecraft, for creative discovery, for the following reasons.  Crafting guides you towards what you need (no more having to look it up elsewhere online), and requires more appropriate resources (you cut a wood block into multiple slabs or rods instead of building a stick out of multiple wood blocks, and two sticks for a handle).  The scenery is generated with impressive variety, trees of various kinds with branches, vines, flowers, etc.  There are different terrains to find various items that change the scenery quite a bit.  Mining is more logical with depth being important for what you're looking for.  Creative play is easier to setup without bouncing between ""survival"" and ""god-mode creative"" modes, it's a good balance where you have to work, but not struggle.  Maps are shared online, so I don't have to be online to share a world with my son.  Not paying $27 times two is a big bonus as well, and blueprints are fairly enjoyable to work together on similar to a co-op resource gathering 3D puzzle board.I recommend this for anybody who wants to get into Minecraft creative exploration style play with their friends or family, but doesn't want to put up with all the difficulty of setup, wants to save some money, or just wants more options and a more enjoyable time.  It is plenty fun with the Free version, I'll likely upgrade to the Pro once my son masters the game a bit more.			"

								First off, let's not beat around the bush here. Creativerse can easily be mistaken for just another Minecraft clone. Just taking a single glance at this game can give it that impression. And I can understand that first-glance impression to a certain degree. If you are expecting a game that is radically different from Minecraft, you are quite frankly looking in the wrong place.That said though, I enjoy Creativerse quite a bit more than I enjoy Minecraft. The thing with Creativerse is that it aims to be a bigger and better Minecraft, and I personally think that they are doing pretty good at that for now. There are enough differences and improvements between the two games that I can say Creativerse is well worth a try if you have either played Minecraft already or if you just couldn't bring yourself to play Minecraft but wanted a similar(/better) game. First off, I honestly believe Creativerse is clearer and easier to get into than Minecraft is. If only just for the reason that in Creativerse you can see what you can craft and that there are blueprints available that let you know what you need to craft it in the first place. Minecraft just throws you in the deep end and just says 'I dunno, you go figure it out' without any notion of a hint or general direction. And while Creativerse does something similair, it at least does so with a better UI and a little bit of help.Secondly are the much better graphics. Minecraft is notorious for just being a bunch of badly textured blocks. Creativerse is still designed around blocks as well, but at least in Creativerse they look much nicer and better designed. The biggest con I can think of, and one I think needs to be mentioned, is that this game is entirely focused on being online. If the servers (or your internet connection) decide to go AWOL, then that's it, no more Creativerse for you until the connection is restored.			"

								Some may say this is a Minecraft clone... I say this is not and its own thing.Yes it is a block based game and has crafting and such...But this has free easy to use multiplayer hosted not by the player but the devs own server.Both i think have great devs but they are great in diffrent ways.This game is still in early access so it has things its still yet to do that could be come anything.In my eyes there is only one flaw with this game... no offline mode... But it not as bad as one thinks. The server work fine, the game can still be played on your own or with others (just use a password). The comunity is great and helpful as well Devs that are active on the forums and have even asked us the comunity what kinds of things we wanted. (we asked for more grass block types and we got it XD who would have thought grass was high on that list XD)but in a jokeing manner: WE HAVE DIRT SLABS :? where as minecraft never kept them :?*note: i dont favor minecraft or creativerse over the other as i like both.

								Well this is gonna be a first impression view on the game. And I'm gonna make 3 categories beginning, mid-game and present.Beginning - I started playing this game with a friend a long time ago (around April) but we lost interest after we found out about the system of mining (The extractors) they took way too much time to extract essential stuff so we lost interest. Later on (couple months ahead) we decided to give it another go because we were bored we had nothing to play yada yada. My friend started to enjoy the game meanwhile I kinda found it still boring and just not suitable for me so I quitted for like 1 day. Mid-game - My friend finally convinced me to get back in the game, she built a house, showed me this and that and actually how fun this game is so I caught some interest in the game so we played together. Helped her creating the house (btw building thing for houses and such is amazing) I got hypnotized by this game and its mechanics even though I hated it at first. We played finally finished the house yada yada. Later on we found something weird ? I mean we built a pool and when she played and I was away the pool got bugged out and got all destroyed over night while she was asleep ? Also random holes in the ground appeared, might have been some bug because she restarted the game and it worked afterwards. Present - We found out about more crafting materials, gear, blocks to build with and we got really into it. To be honest I kinda feel that the game is way too easy ? In terms of finding resources and such. I don't really have anything else to say.. moving on.PROS & CONS:PROS: -Amazing game if you have a good friend to play it with            -Crafting and imagination of building stuff, realistic outlook of the houses you build is amazing as well           -Gearing up in the game seems quite fast in the later gear (at the beginning the game is quite slow)           -I found it fun and kept me intrigued even to this very momentCONS: -Feels like its quite a glidy game and it still needs some updates in terms of movement and smoothnes            -Even though I have a quite decent PC it still drops frames for me and has couple lag spikes for some reason (might be some optimization problems)            -Don't play it alone you'll get really bored (that applies for me)            -Combat is not as accurate.. mobs can still hit you from 10m away and sometimes you can't even hit them (sword      literally goes trough them)            -AI.. Ok the AI is legitimately stupid. Mobs tend not to attack if you're one block higher than them (doesn't happen all the time)            -This game ♥♥♥♥s the physics.			"

								Ok first off id like to say that this is coming from someone who has been playing Minecraft almost since it first came out and as of now i am sooooo bored of it due to doing every possible thing on it and even getting bored of mods lol. But anyways this game is somewhat like Minecraft but even better! It is so fun and is a complete different experience than Minecraft so donot think that it is a cheap copy of Minecraft as it is not. I love this game and tried the free Demo and will defiently be buying this soon!			"

								Obviously a minecraft clone. Has some minor glitches here and there, nothing severe. Haven't played minecraft in a while, but Creativerse seems to make some smart adjustments that make the game more approachable and fun: ingame recipes and easy teleporting to your home or that of other players. It's also for free, you can purchase some cosmetic blocks or blue-prints for bigger structures (which you really don't need if you prefer to design your home by yourself).			"

								First off, let's not beat around the bush here. Creativerse can easily be mistaken for just another Minecraft clone. Just taking a single glance at this game can give it that impression. And I can understand that first-glance impression to a certain degree. If you are expecting a game that is radically different from Minecraft, you are quite frankly looking in the wrong place.That said though, I enjoy Creativerse quite a bit more than I enjoy Minecraft. The thing with Creativerse is that it aims to be a bigger and better Minecraft, and I personally think that they are doing pretty good at that for now. There are enough differences and improvements between the two games that I can say Creativerse is well worth a try if you have either played Minecraft already or if you just couldn't bring yourself to play Minecraft but wanted a similar(/better) game. First off, I honestly believe Creativerse is clearer and easier to get into than Minecraft is. If only just for the reason that in Creativerse you can see what you can craft and that there are blueprints available that let you know what you need to craft it in the first place. Minecraft just throws you in the deep end and just says 'I dunno, you go figure it out' without any notion of a hint or general direction. And while Creativerse does something similair, it at least does so with a better UI and a little bit of help.Secondly are the much better graphics. Minecraft is notorious for just being a bunch of badly textured blocks. Creativerse is still designed around blocks as well, but at least in Creativerse they look much nicer and better designed. The biggest con I can think of, and one I think needs to be mentioned, is that this game is entirely focused on being online. If the servers (or your internet connection) decide to go AWOL, then that's it, no more Creativerse for you until the connection is restored.			"

								Much better than Minecraft, for creative discovery, for the following reasons.  Crafting guides you towards what you need (no more having to look it up elsewhere online), and requires more appropriate resources (you cut a wood block into multiple slabs or rods instead of building a stick out of multiple wood blocks, and two sticks for a handle).  The scenery is generated with impressive variety, trees of various kinds with branches, vines, flowers, etc.  There are different terrains to find various items that change the scenery quite a bit.  Mining is more logical with depth being important for what you're looking for.  Creative play is easier to setup without bouncing between ""survival"" and ""god-mode creative"" modes, it's a good balance where you have to work, but not struggle.  Maps are shared online, so I don't have to be online to share a world with my son.  Not paying $27 times two is a big bonus as well, and blueprints are fairly enjoyable to work together on similar to a co-op resource gathering 3D puzzle board.I recommend this for anybody who wants to get into Minecraft creative exploration style play with their friends or family, but doesn't want to put up with all the difficulty of setup, wants to save some money, or just wants more options and a more enjoyable time.  It is plenty fun with the Free version, I'll likely upgrade to the Pro once my son masters the game a bit more.			"

								I've been looking for an open-world, exploration, crafting, 3D, creative sandbox game for a while, and this is the one that finally grabbed me instantly. Graphics are cute and funny and polished (without being too cute), biomes are varied and beautiful, and the world is big enough for a long time of playing. I like spending hours just running around gathering stuff, or exploring an area (usually a cave) where I haven't been before; you can do that here. If you're rather the more active sort and want to build and build and build, you can do that too: lots of blocks available. You can play alone, with friends, with strangers, and it's all easy to do, no offline mode though. The game is still in early access and the developers have been active and busy, there are frequent updates and they do listen to feedback -- so it can only get better! Personally I would have preferred the game not to go F2P, but it was planned from the beginning and I think it can work (it's not pay-to-win in any way, items for purchase are purely cosmetic).My favourite thing? All the little descriptions for every item in the game.I bought the game before it went F2P and haven't regretted it; it's free now, so you have no excuse: try it out and see if it grabs you the way it grabbed me!

								You know, if you feel like this game is missing guns, oranges, or even people who want to murder you in your sleep with a bazoka that are walking and talking skeletons wearing Leafies that blow up, if the suggestion gets popular, it gets into the game. The devs is what makes the game shine, as well as the familiar building with awsome mechanics that even the beginner can love. There are only two tools, mining/power cells and the famous sword. and they have their own slots, so they don't have to take up your inventory. Also, the fire is flipping bright!10/10 would burn up my makeshift shelter with a moss torch and then get killed by a Night Leifi again.			"

								Let me just say that creativerse is a great game. The best minecraft-like sandbox game ive ever played by far! There are alot of bad reviews coming out recently and i would just like to say dont listen to them. Mostly ppl are mad that the new creativerse pro makes you pay $20 for enhanced features and i say whats wrong with that? The developers need some kind of income to make the game better and better. Plus if you bought any coins on the game at all before the update you were updated to pro even if you spent only 5 bucks. I say if you love a game, support it by buying the extras. This game is still very far from being PTW. Thank you creativerse!			"

								LOVE the game...Reminds me a little of Minecraft (also a fav game of mine) but a twist to it. I recently went pro and love that I don't have to make so many trips back home cause of the 20 extra inventory slots and how the glider works...my only issue (not with the game but with my laptop) is lag...once I get a desk top tho I'm hoping all (or at least most) of it will go away and I'll have even more fun ♥ At the moment I'm trying to build all the blueprints and make EVERY recipe I can get my hands on o-o Me and my bf just finished making the Floating Island...took us about a week lol And me and him just recently got one of our friends into the game (:			"

								An amazing game to play with friends! Runs smoothly on my little laptop, very fun and, dare I say.. creative.Not really a fun single-player game, but multiplayer is loads of fun and there's so many recipe's you can make and creatures to tame, the blueprints help out a lot and I really enjoy the different terrains along with the elements of spelunking and exploring, both are fun with or without friends (but mainly without, unless you want them to get in the way XD) I find this to be a very addictive, yet relaxing game. :3			"

								     I enjoyed this game a lot, and still do, but you have to understand that when you play this game for free, you wont have all the options you used to. People now a days are getting really used to things just being handed to them, but as a game developer, you need money to keep the lights on. Now, this game is easily comaprable to Minecraft (which costs $26.95 for PC) but to have pretty much all the bells and whistles for this game its just $20. So now you can oly have 1 world if you just do this for free, and you are missing many options. I find you can still progress to end game items at a relatively good speed, and you can still build/claim plots as you did before (with a few very minor options lost). You can also only play on normal difficulty.. Considering the options, its still pretty fun to play it for free, and you can put a little extra for extra plots. A good loop around is to have a second steam account to make a multiplayer world as well.     All that said, lets compaire it to Minecraft a little in free to play sense. Minecraft on PC only lets you play for 10 in game days before you are cut off from your world... granted you have full access. Minecraft for consoles only offers you the ability to play in the tutorial... which is okay, but is lacking in sooo many ways.. long story short, the devs could just call the free to play version, a demo perhaps, then maybe people will stop crying about the features... because compared to minecrafts Demo, this is definately way better than the minecraft Demo.     Now on to pro, the features arent a ton, but they feel pretty worth it. Im definately not going into this with any salt towards the game at all, as it is a pretty great game with, or without pro. Now, pro is only $20 and offers nearly the full game, with the exception to have a few purchaseable added graphic block.. without them, the game still offers a pretty large number of options for creation. I see all these things as a way for people to support the devs. $20 gets you the game for the cost of 4 packs of cigarettes, or not much else you toss extra money into for minor temporary indulgence you buy... What this means is, if you play with friends a lot, you can make many worlds that they may join and play on. You also support their continued work on the game. It deos not feel pay to win, and definately not over priced. Back in the day, many games werent free to play, and many times you could buy them, only to find they dont work on your machine, or they are buggy and not worth the cost, or just plain garbage. Some games were returnable, but many with cd keys for pc were not... Keep that in mind.     This game is not for everyone, but it is worth trying. If you enjoy blocky survival sandbox games, this game is worth trying out. It looks really nice for its genre, and gameplay is pretty interesting as well. I have put thousands of hours into Minecraft, but play Minecraft and many games like it a lot less now, but can say i still enjoy them. This game is definately a nice alternative to minecraft, but not a replacement. What i would like to see in this, so it may be more equal to minecraft, is maybe a modable pro version; one that is easily modable, with offline, and online mode... Perhaps for online keep the modding to personal servers, run on their own server computer, or pc, which is obviously kept easily modable. Should they make it easy to have a large modding comunity, I could definately see this wrecking minecraft, especially with Minecrafts loss of Bukkit.			"

								It's insane how good this game is, considering you can play it for free. Game is fun, good-looking and run smoothly - try it for yourself ;)At 2017-01-03 (written by complete newbie): Right off the bat you start within your own world with 40 inventory spaces and basic mining tool. LMB gather stuff, RMB place/use selected (item under highlighted 1-2-3... hotspot). Q to craft, E for inventory, TAB to quick swap weapon/mining. At night hostile mobs spawns at surface, underground you can find them all day. It's good to know that to gather some resources you have to place one-time-use items on them and wait. Placing torches reduces/prevents enemies from spawning. Crafting buildings and containers can be picked up and placed (if there are no items being stored/processed within them). Graphics are good. Jumping is kind of annoying but expected in this kind of game. There is insane amount of things you can craft and place ^_^			"

								This game is great, don't be fooled by inadequate reviewers, this game has a lot to offer, if you've played minecraft and have been craving a new open world sandbox experience then this game is fantastic, and is worth the small $20 price tag.From what I've seen in past reviews, most people tend to complain that this game is ""too much like Minecraft"" and that it's ridiculous to make you have to pay to use certain features, which in some aspects is completely fair, but let's not forget that Minecraft itself has a $25 price tag, sure that comes with more content, but that game has been around several years longer than this game, it really personally triggers me when I hear people say that ""the developers ****ed up by making you have to pay to use certain features"" ('cause it would totally be fair to make this game 100% free and allow the developers to earn literally nothing for the years of work they put in... genius) let us not forget that Minecraft's ""free"" version you couldn't even create 1 world, you'd have a creative sandbox and that was it, nothing was saved, the player got nothing but a taste, at least these developers allow people to play their game and decide whether or not to purchase it..Now let's get down to gameplay itself;Gameplay felt great in terms of player feedback as far as menu's and some aspects of combat, some issues I'd noticed when playing was not having a far enough reach with your attacks (most of the time you'd end up getting hit at around the same time that you can actually reach the creature) this was a bit of disappointing but I'm not going to say that it ruined the game. Content wise this game has around 20 - 30 hours worth of content to explore, items to collect and creatures to meet, the blueprint system was quite nice in some regards too! Something that disappointed me though was the method of collecting certain minerals was just a pain, having to craft an extractor everytime that you wanted to harvest an ore was an absolute pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Mainly just because the extractors themselves are quite costly to craft early game which makes an unnecessarily long start.The crafting system was easy to understand and I liked how you had to learn to craft a previous version of an item before you craft the next tier, for example; diamond sword required you to have crafted an iron sword previously to be able to unlock the recipe for the diamond sword. I also loved the waypoint system where you could teleport to saved waypoints at any time by pressing 't'.Overall this game is a lot of fun with friends or by yourself, the $20 pricetag is justified with the amount of content, but if you're looking to play this game once, download the free version and get almost the exact same experience! Crafting was nice and easy to understand  but mining and some combat was a little lackluster.In conclusion, give this game a go, you may be surprised! And since this game is in early access, you can watch this game and community grow with only more exciting content to come!			"

Well done developers.The game is overall fantastic.Pros:Good gamplayNo lag(even though im a UK on an American server)Plenty of items, Biomes and monsters.Huge multiplayer benefit and so much creativity.Cons:Not enough people play this game, so its hard to find a full server.Thats prettey much it. The best part is it is F2P. You don't need to put ANY money in unless your a tryhard that needs that special item. Me? I'm fine with what I get. The community is friendly and it's anything but horrible.Summary:Like minecraft. Just not microsoft owned and 200 times better. Get. This. Game.			"

								If you like Minecraft you'll love this game.  It's better than Minecraft in my opinion, it's more polished.  Minecraft has plenty of things going for it that this game doesn't though such as mod support and you can do a lot more with redstone.  I'd love to see this game take wiring to a new level.  If you're a redstone junkie then this isn't as good as Minecraft, yet.  As a survival based creative block building game yeah I'd play this over vanilla minecraft any day.			"

								I've played this game for 21.5 out of the past 48 hours. Firstly, this game features an amazingly smooth and rewarding crafting system. It's simple and to the point! No complex blueprints and all that mess. Even with blueprints, it shows you what you need, and where you need it. Too easy! The combat in Creativerse is actually quite solid for a sandbox builder. You can craft different tiers of swords; as well as explosives and stun bombs. The soundtrack for this game is simply awesome. It makes some of the most tedious and difficult tasks less frustrating. It's calming and exciting at the perfect times. I LOVE mining in this game. When you get down there and start finding chests, Obsidian Ore, Coal, etc, it's just such an awesome feeling. You can set up your own area down there and get a TON of resources. Lastly, I have to mention the pets. You can tame (if you're slick about it) just about any enemy in Creativerse. You can also find things such as party hats and other accessories in chests and equip them to your pet. Overall, this game is so much fun. It's free and not another pay-to-win. Get in there and create!			"

								This game is great, don't be fooled by inadequate reviewers, this game has a lot to offer, if you've played minecraft and have been craving a new open world sandbox experience then this game is fantastic, and is worth the small $20 price tag.From what I've seen in past reviews, most people tend to complain that this game is ""too much like Minecraft"" and that it's ridiculous to make you have to pay to use certain features, which in some aspects is completely fair, but let's not forget that Minecraft itself has a $25 price tag, sure that comes with more content, but that game has been around several years longer than this game, it really personally triggers me when I hear people say that ""the developers ****ed up by making you have to pay to use certain features"" ('cause it would totally be fair to make this game 100% free and allow the developers to earn literally nothing for the years of work they put in... genius) let us not forget that Minecraft's ""free"" version you couldn't even create 1 world, you'd have a creative sandbox and that was it, nothing was saved, the player got nothing but a taste, at least these developers allow people to play their game and decide whether or not to purchase it..Now let's get down to gameplay itself;Gameplay felt great in terms of player feedback as far as menu's and some aspects of combat, some issues I'd noticed when playing was not having a far enough reach with your attacks (most of the time you'd end up getting hit at around the same time that you can actually reach the creature) this was a bit of disappointing but I'm not going to say that it ruined the game. Content wise this game has around 20 - 30 hours worth of content to explore, items to collect and creatures to meet, the blueprint system was quite nice in some regards too! Something that disappointed me though was the method of collecting certain minerals was just a pain, having to craft an extractor everytime that you wanted to harvest an ore was an absolute pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Mainly just because the extractors themselves are quite costly to craft early game which makes an unnecessarily long start.The crafting system was easy to understand and I liked how you had to learn to craft a previous version of an item before you craft the next tier, for example; diamond sword required you to have crafted an iron sword previously to be able to unlock the recipe for the diamond sword. I also loved the waypoint system where you could teleport to saved waypoints at any time by pressing 't'.Overall this game is a lot of fun with friends or by yourself, the $20 pricetag is justified with the amount of content, but if you're looking to play this game once, download the free version and get almost the exact same experience! Crafting was nice and easy to understand  but mining and some combat was a little lackluster.In conclusion, give this game a go, you may be surprised! And since this game is in early access, you can watch this game and community grow with only more exciting content to come!			"

								What drew me into this game is it's basically a more intricate minecraft.In Creativerse the weaker creations have to be crafted before you can create stronger creations (like stone stairs have to be crafted before you have the option to craft diamond stairs). Creativerse is more of a game I would play if I just wanted to burn time. It does glitch here and there. At times I can't see any of the world around me but I can see through it and then it loads in. I do love that when I die all my stuff is saved in a vase that only I can get to it when I spawn back in. The blueprints for structers are a wonderful touch and I do wish they had those in minecraft too but sadly that's not the case.			"

								Great game! Reason i didn't play minecraft was because the purposely pixelized graphics, this game gave my eyes something easier to look at. Played ~250 hours then bought pro. Don't listen to the folks who say that pro makes the game bad for free players. 1 world is enough to build and explore a lot! Of course, if you want to gain access to the special controls then buy pro. The devs have to make money to continue making the game amazing, it's not like minecraft is just free. Check out my main world ""Vernasia"" to have a lot of fun!			"

								Good game, recommended if you are looking for a nice ran. gen. world sandbox game to play. Great with friends because you can abuse the free teleporters a lot. You'll enjoy this game a lot more if you don't compare it to Minecraft while playing it. Pros: refreshing and new enemies, unique items, excellent horizontal progression (instead of dumpster diving down to the strongest tier right off the bat). Cons: crappy combat, few weapons, movement feels really bubbly (could be a pro for some?), mining could be faster, healing requires a bit of a grind (bloodborne tier)Basically what Minecraft should have been, what Cube World will hopefully be, and what Terraria does in but in 3D.

I have enjoyed it immensly for various reasons, the world, the fun little random notes, being able to keep pets, recipes, etc. I LOVED the Halloween and Christmas Events! Haunted houses and Gingerbread homes were amazing! My only real complaint is minor really. In the early days you used to be able to choose a mode for free. As in whether or not you wanted a safe world. Now you have to pay for the membership to be able to have that particular choice. I have noticed that has made me not want to play as much, but I don't know if I will stop alltogether. Overall great design, great custom building options, great game.			"

								Minecraft was first. You fell in love and were addicted with the scenery and adventure. The game made you want to come back for more. Creativerse has the minecraft mindset with advanced tech. Instead of pickaxes and woodaxes, you use a mining glove. It's a great new perspective to an already great concept.			"

 Buy this game, support the Creativerse devs! This game is 100% worth the 124 hours that I have on record so far, and the $20 I've spent on Creativerse Pro. If you're a new player and feel put off by the complaints of Pro, please ignore the negative responses. You're helping out devs who genuinly care about their game and fanbase. The more you support, the better this game will be!			"

								A slightly different take on the Minecraft concept. The creatures are less dangerous on the surface, and the day/night creatures are interesting. I wish it had Minecraft's plot advancement though. I like it's crafting system: unlocking recipes instead of needing to flail around or look up an online guide for figuring it out.			"

								This game is actually far better than it looks. My friend and I were looking for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ free games and stumbled upon this gem. We had a good laugh and decided to download it. When we got into the game, we initially were shocked by how much of a Minecraft clone it was (and how hunky it looked). But as we started playing more, it grew on us. After a while I looked at the clock and realised we'd been playing for about 3 hours.This game looks gross at a glance, but it's actually quite charming. It has plenty of things that I've lwys wanted out of Minecraft, and it's completely free. That being said, it has a few bugs, and the movement is quite floaty. But those can all be overlooked if you have a friend to play with.So if you're looking for a bit of good fun for free with a friend, I absolutly reccomend Creativerse.69/420 heh heh heh			"

								I absolutely adore this game, it's a little harder to play than Minecraft (okay a lot harder) but since Pro has come about I can set the Mobs to ""peaceful"" and don't have to worry about being attacked every five seconds. People say it's like Minecraft but only a little bit, the graphics are way better and it's more challenging and fun :) I like taming the bad Mobs and making them food so they give me things in return!I think my only gripe is that the mining cells eventually break and you have to craft a whole new one, it's very tedious but other than that (and nasty people coming to blow up your whole world - which is fixed by Pro because you can set it to No Explosives allowed but that means harder to mine things without TNT) All in all - I give this game two thumbs up!!

It feels more alive, it's beautiful, and the multiplayer is great! The multiplayer is the biggest thing that makes me recommend this game. I can have my own server to play with friends without having to port forward or add mods and what not. It's just that easy! And it's early access, which means there's even more to come.

								Good game, recommended if you are looking for a nice ran. gen. world sandbox game to play. Great with friends because you can abuse the free teleporters a lot. You'll enjoy this game a lot more if you don't compare it to Minecraft while playing it. Pros: refreshing and new enemies, unique items, excellent horizontal progression (instead of dumpster diving down to the strongest tier right off the bat). Cons: crappy combat, few weapons, movement feels really bubbly (could be a pro for some?), mining could be faster, healing requires a bit of a grind (bloodborne tier)Basically what Minecraft should have been, what Cube World will hopefully be, and what Terraria does in but in 3D.

								What drew me into this game is it's basically a more intricate minecraft.In Creativerse the weaker creations have to be crafted before you can create stronger creations (like stone stairs have to be crafted before you have the option to craft diamond stairs). Creativerse is more of a game I would play if I just wanted to burn time. It does glitch here and there. At times I can't see any of the world around me but I can see through it and then it loads in. I do love that when I die all my stuff is saved in a vase that only I can get to it when I spawn back in. The blueprints for structers are a wonderful touch and I do wish they had those in minecraft too but sadly that's not the case.			"

								Great game! Reason i didn't play minecraft was because the purposely pixelized graphics, this game gave my eyes something easier to look at. Played ~250 hours then bought pro. Don't listen to the folks who say that pro makes the game bad for free players. 1 world is enough to build and explore a lot! Of course, if you want to gain access to the special controls then buy pro. The devs have to make money to continue making the game amazing, it's not like minecraft is just free. Check out my main world ""Vernasia"" to have a lot of fun!			"

I definitely recommend this game it's a lot of fun just to play around in and just do whatever you want. :)			"

								Hey there, possible player!Well, now that the game is free, you shouldn't need too much convincing to at least try it. I bought this when it first came out at the 20 dollars and I don't regret it in the least. A lotta folks will compare this to minecraft, and of course you could, but this game truly stands on its own.For one, it's way effing prettier than Minecraft, and while still a bit lacking, the character customization is much more in-depth. Two, the building and crafting system is quite immersive and fun. You can build more depending on what you've already discovered and created so you have to work your way up to the good stuff, which I find pretty darn neat. Gives the game a longer play-life. The exploration and fighting system are also pretty damn good. No mods needed for a comprehensive compass and map system, and most blocks are VERY distiguishable. If you're looking for a huge challenge as far as monsters go, there isn't much of that, but I find that to be a good thing that way more casual players can get the good stuff too, with hard work. Instead of a nether, there is something called the corruption layer, and there's all sorts of fun and spooky stuff down there! So that is probably the biggest challenge of the game so far that I'm aware of.They also have a system called Taming, where you can make pretty much any mob in the game a pet! You can even dress them up in little hats and bows. They produce mob-specific mats for you. All in all, if you want a nice relaxing game with a great building, exploration, fighting, inventory, and crafting system, play this.			"

								[4/5] The terrain graphics are quiet decent if set to max setting.[2/5] Player character graphics & their animation really need to be improved / re-created.[5/5] Building can be very creative with many variants of blocks/items & the mighty [R]otate tool.[4/5] Combat is definetly a good spot in the game, comparing to games likes Minecraft. However it                     could use more variety of weapons; axes, spears,  & expensive laser guns.[5/5] Tinkering & Farming, its definetly well made.[5/5] Developers earn money by having players purchase the pro version of the game, however the pro version isn't neceserally pay to win. Which is great, of course and i hope it stays that way.SuggestionsPlease finish the /Quests update... xDGuilds! Add guilds that are bound to worlds. It disables combat against guild mates (If set, otherwise by default world setting)Trading: Vending Machines / Custom npcs (Where players can create their custom npc/robots & set them a 'job'. Examples; Guard,  Merchant, Questmaster, Guildmaster (Guild quests, etc), & a banker which would be costly to unlock but could allow upgading vaults. Finally, auction house employee. If a player decides to sell an item, they can talk to the auctioneer and set an item for sale. All items for sale at the auction house would be display in a list, & players could bid with a set currency. Example; Obsidian/Coal/Diamonds/Lumite (Or if the devs plan to add a currency item) Side noteBought pro after a 100 hours of normal gameplay, can't wait to see the future updates. Keep them coming! Also, who's developing Creativerse? An indie studio?			"

								Well, I guess I've played long enough to comment on it now.Creativerse helped my family find an activity we could do together. It began as just my wife playing, then my 7 year-old began playing too. And then I had to look into this thing they were both enjoying so much. And yeah, suddenly I have 1000 hours in this *cough* casual little game.Us three, we play for different reasons. My wife loves to build. My daughter loves to explore. And I love the feeling of survival, of combat in the first 50 hours of any world. They prefer to stick to one world, but I admit I like to bounce around, see who I meet and what sort of fun they've created for themselves in other worlds. Creativerse really offers many ways to play, and even more now with the launch of user-created Adventures. You are not stuck in any one routine.The art style just works. It is simple and pleasing, without feeling like you've fallen through a wormhole to 1990. The staff and developers will actually communicate with you (and even answer emails!). A plethora of great Youtubers have made videos to give you clarity over features, or inspiration for things to try. A Pro ""upgrade"" is currently available if you wanna toss a few bucks at the developers, and the perks are worth it in my opinion.So, yeah. Definitely recommended.			"

								Not the usual minecraft ripoff..The game is really fun when playing with other people, the mulitplayer system is easy to work with.The only real problem with playing with friends is that you need to buy a ""Rank"" in order to unlock sertain options with your world/server.			"

								I started playing this game no 2016 of august with one of my friends.At first i was searching for minecraft but looking at the price my friends would probably not want to invest the money on minecraft which left me  buying the game and play alone is not fun at all.Then i keep searching and discover creativese which is what? ""FREE"" and i suggested it to my friends and we started playing.We enjoy a lot of this game, especially during exploration of ore for crafting purpose and fighting monster.The feel of around my friend is really good in this game caused we can interact together.The graphics though was great either.What i really feel bad about this game is only when i reach the bottom level of the game it self and got nothing to explore anymore, it will make the game not really enjoyable since basically we had seen everything in this game. when we go to other caves it will still be the same item again which is getting boring after we had found the deepest thing in this game.Will keep playing this game again with my friends if there are any update regarding more exploration (not another block update since i don't craft that much, i prefer exploration. seeing things that are new which can lead me and my friends keep playing).Overall the game is so good before you reach the deepest part of the layer.I recommended playing this. :)			"

								It had been nearly 24 months since I wrote my initial review of this game. I need to update this especially with the kerfluffle that occured in the R33 update. There are other reviews that can talk about the depth of this game and how it compares to say a Minecraft game. But I want to address the reviews. If you're seeing some negative reviews trending to the top due to R33, then keep reading because I feel those bad reviews are dishonest and I'd like to give a more even handed review.So basically, alot of the man children and 14 year olds are mad because the devs introduced several new outstanding features. This includes the ability to use a glider to fly around the world. Weeeeee! You can customize your own world server. And other smaller enhancements such as a flashlight and increased inventory storage. However, in order to have this, you must pay for Creativerse Pro for $20. But they are being generous and giving Pro to early access backers or anyone who bought anything through the store. However, there is one downside. They are also limiting free players from only owning 1 world rather than owning multiple worlds, as had existed prior to R33.  I can see why some are mad at Playful for limiting ownership of worlds to 1 per free player whereas before you could own unlimited worlds. All of these worlds take up alot of server space which the devs must pay for. And there are few reasons anyone needs to own this many worlds to begin with. Each world is huge unto itself and can accomdate a couple thousand players easily. So outside of that, the game is in no way affected and the quality continues to get better. And I'll bet you anything those people complaining will still keep playing.Claims such as this being pay to win and other silly giberish are just that; gibberish. Apparently all the freeloaders think a 15 man company should starve to death and not be able to pay their rent by simply giving everything away for free. Gasp. The nerve of this company!In fact, with the introduction of basic machinery and wiring in R33, I expect to see the devs introduce more advanced machinery and functionality. Perhaps think Scrap Mechanics but for voxel based building? Just guessing and hoping.I had nearly 100 hours into this game before stopping to play for 9 months. But these new features along with everything else they added in between has pushed me to start playing again with new excitement.TLDR: Some of the playerbase are too cheap to pay $20 and using the tired P2W meme as their way to spite Playful.

								Creativerse is very similar to Minecraft. There are plenty of mobs, caves, biomes and blocks to find. Build mighty structures or play it as a survival game. In my opinion, Creativerse is actually better than Minecraft. It lets you set up your own server for free. The graphics are much better, the biomes are more attractive and just visually stunning, helping you to feel more immersed.

								I wouldn't recommend it just yet, because I haven't been able to ""Connect to a Server,"" with a block eternally spinning in front of my face as the ""Connecting to Server"" window shows no signs of any servers being connected too, which is very frustrating considering I did pay $20 for it. The in-game store to cut out waiting for items to be crafted is kind of a bad idea considering it's basically paying out of impatience and so many ""pay-to-win"" games exist now. In general, I recommend removing the crafting time idea considering it takes time to gather resources to make most things in the first place. However, I have seen some game play and can see the potential. It does look beautiful with the block design, as well as the tiered crafting and recipe discovery system adding a twist to your typical crafting systems. The mobs having their own unique shapes and even having a night time counterpart is very pleasing to see despite probable adjustments needed. Once I can actually get some hands-on time, I might edit this review or post a better one, but for now, until the connection issues get settled or an offline mode is added for those who struggle with connection, I give it a thumbs down.

								I applaud anyone trying to do what Minecraft does only differently -- Minecraft is far from perfect, and at this point Mojang/Microsoft has made so much money off the status quo that it is unlikely we are going to see great strides in the genre from them.  We need developers willing to retread the same ground and try different paths if we are going to see better games in the genre.But that being said, Minecraft is very, very good.  The bar can be vaulted, but it is set high.  And Creativerse makes some very basic errors in its early game that are going to relegate it to the dustbin of time if they are not fixed.  I don't usually write ""first-person experience"" reviews, but I think this will speak to fans of the genre.First thing I noticed is that even the starter recipes require many types of raw materials.  Forget about processed materials -- even turning wood into planks requires a device I would call ""second tier.""  I was fortunate, I had spawned into a region that was resource rich.  I can't imagine trying to play this game after spawning into an unfriendly biome (assuming they exist -- maybe you always spawn into dense forest?).  After some gathering I crafted up a wooden sword (three raw materials) and a wood power cell (four raw materials; used for mining stone) and struck out to find a cliff to dig a shelter into.What I discovered next was that the stone layer is extremely thin.  Maybe ten blocks from dirt to ""bedrock"" which required a stone power cell (five raw materials) to mine.  A stone power cell requires coal.  I wasn't lucky enough to find coal in the vicinity of my shelter so I made some more moss torches and went looking for a nearby cave.  Upon finding one I discovered that while a moss torch is sufficient to light a 3x3x3 room, it really only has a functional radius of 2 blocks out in the open.  That's not a lot of light.  I should have known, considering they only required two separate raw materials to manufacture.  Still, I figured there had to be a lot of coal not far beneath the surface and descended.  I could hear a monster, but I cowboyed up and kept going anyway.  I was still in the dirt layer, and was confident I wasn't deep enough to encounter anything truly dangerous.Boy was I wrong.Something green and  vaguely bipedal with about a dozen eyes surged up out of the darkness right in front of my face.  I defended myself with my wooden sword, and managed to get in about 20 good hits before it did me in with its blinding flashbulb and slam attacks.  That was it for me.  I quit to menu and exited the game.I don't want to be unfair -- I realize this game is free, and in early access besides -- but the incredibly high production quality throughout suggests that the developer is not an amateur, and yet the game balance leaves a lot to be desired.  The crafting system in this game is very complicated and interdependent, and therefore early game success feels like it is dependent more on luck than it should be.  To get A I need B, but if B isn't readily available I need C to go looking for it and C requires A.  That's a tough pill to swallow.  It is nice that the game abandons Minecraft's crafting grid -- while a clever way to get more mileage out of fewer materials, the grid can be very tedious and is ultimately unnecessary, as both the XBox Live and Pocket editions of the game have shown.  All things considered, though, I'm not sure the dozen kinds of raw materials required for first tier crafting in Creativerse is really a viable alternative.Combat is my least favorite part of any survival game -- I feel like most of them are better without it.  But even considering my bias, an enemy I can encounter during the day in the dirt layer should not require more than 20 hits with a crafted weapon to defeat!So, ultimately, no, I can't recommend this game, despite its price and despite its early access status.  I hope to see it improve, but right now the early game does not inspire confidence enough to warrant toughing it out to see the late game. "

								At the current time, I feel that the developers have really started to simply let go and lose commitment to this game. When I first played it, I did a let's try miniseries on my youtube channel of it. At the time the devs were clearly very commited and knew exactly where they were going to take this game. I loved it and in the end told my viewers that I highly recommended it. But after around 4 months hiatus, I returned ti the game for yet another video, this time to ""Revisit"" the game and re-review it. And to my dismay, dissapointment, and slight annoyance, it made me realize just how far things have fallen for this game. A game that had immense potential, especially with such once-commited devs, that actually truly listened to the community have let go. And it seems those that are still at least half-commited are lost and split on the direction they want to take it. The game also still lacks a creative mode which is easily my biggest peeve with this game. It actually does make me a bit maddened. So all in all, my love for this game and excitement are all gone. Washed straight out of me. However I know there is still great potential for this game if the devs get back to where they were priorly in the beginning, back to be energized, excited, commited, and community oriented. Knowing the exact direction they wish to take it. So for the time being, it's honestly a ""I'll leave it up to you to decide"" notion rather than a don't/do recommend sequence from me. And that's my actual true stance on the game currently. But since I had to choose yes or no on recommending it in order to post this, it's easily a no.			"

								(Updated March 18th 2017)Creativerse is a 3D-block based sandbox game like Minecraft, which is a successor of Infiniminer by Zachtronics. However Creativerse is not a simplified MC-clone.* first of all; Creativerse is an online-game and does not provide an offline-version, it's designed for easy multiplayer access and shared experiences * still each player receives at least one gameworld for themselves where they can set world options to their likings and can protect their world/s with a password to play solo or only with close friends there* official public servers, player-moderated public servers and adventure instances are available for everyone additionally to that, and players can also claim areas on many gameworlds where specific protective claim options can be set* the game is easy to understand for beginners so they won't have to rely on Wikis. A tutorial and tooltips provide sufficient help, plus all common crafting recipes can be viewed in the crafting menu greyed out right from the start together with their unlocking requirements* gameworlds are not procedurally generated, but based on 4 preset template worlds of 10,240 x 10,240 x 256 blocks in size each, divided into 26x26 (676) areas with up to 43,264 possible player claims each* all currently created gameworlds feature 10+ surface biomes plus 4 different looking underground layers, each with their own biome-specific denizens* on all worlds 16 types of imaginative mobs can be found in up to 42 variants with different behaviour and specific attacks/defensive moves* all creatures can be either killed or tamed and can then become lifestock to be harvested from, after being fed and cleaned, and they can be dressed with a few accessories too* ""Boss mobs"" exist too, however only 2 for now, one has to be summoned by building* nearly all natural blocks (ca. 70 types) that the worlds are made of can be harvested and then placed again for building porposes, plus ca. 130 different looking types of crafted cubic building-blocks, ca. 30 roofs/slopes, ca. 16 slabs  and 20 stairs * nearly all blocks and placable items can be rotated into all 6 directions* 7 existent liquids with specific attributes can be collected, used for crafting and/or cooking and can also be placed into the world * crafting is a core-feature of the game, the gaming progress relies on unlocking the most important crafting recipes by collecting materials and crafting requirements as listed in the crafting menu. Up to 5 crafting recipes with their unlocking requirements or with their required ingredients can be tracked onscreen (like a shopping list)* players can hunt for randomly spawning treasure chests that sometimes contain rare collectible crafting recipes. Some crafting recipes for unique looking blocks can only be bought in the store* some more additional seasonal recipes and findings usually appear around halloween and christmas for up to 1 month each * players can create artificial biomes to make biome-specific creatures and treasure chests spawn. Even artificial biomes can feature the same gameplay-relevant environmental effects that natural biomes would have, like freezing cold, burning heat or poisoning corruption * currently 6 swords and 5 armor sets (helmets are WIP) help players to win and survive fights, plus 9 types of explosives can be thrown at adversaries (4 of which will affect the environment too in different ways), as well as rimecones and snowballs * 4 types of TNT can destroy the environment (however player claims and world settings can protect player property from being harmed), 3 types of excavators help with clearing larger areas (7x7x7) and will save half of the blocks they remove* only one harvesting/mining tool is required in Creativerse, and many items can be crafted on the fly without requiring any crafting stations * player characters can now be customized to a certain degree* after defeat/character death all the stuff that drops can be retrieved again by following the compass* teleporters can be crafted and placed in large amounts, also a ""home-teleporter""* Creativerse has an area-based RPG-like mapping function too (no crafting required)* 4 types of crops and 3 types of trees can be grown, 36 types of food can be cooked, additional to edible mushrooms and a bunch of potions that provide different effects * adventures are a new feature that can be used by everyone to create instances of their worlds and let other players experience intresting builds, parcours, puzzles and/or stories there* players can use devices like switches, pressure plates, sensors and number pads to wire doors, trap doors, lights, beacons, fans (can be used together with ladders or ice slopes to create railways or ""roller coasters""), campfires/pit fires, loot spawners and mob spawners from anywhere in the world - for protection, to build traps and to create adventures * players can craft up to 12 different types of storage containers, 4 beds, 10 tables, 9 chairs, 17 doors/gates + 3 trap doors, 9 windows, 4 types of fences (that can hold back creatures even if only 1 block in height), 5 inscribable signs and 2 types of climbable ladders too* several customizable blueprints of preset buildings are available for free to help with building large structures together with friends. Block kits containing all the suggested standard blocks necessary for specific blueprints can be bought in the store * there is a day-night-cycle that can be influenced by using beds* as for weather, there is either clear or foggy for now* the game usually uses first person view. Third person view is enabled while flying the glider, sitting on chairs or can optionally be switched to only while standing still * sleeping/resting or eating is not necessary for player-characters' survival, however cooked food (no decay) offers boosts, can negate falling damage, can make toons immune to cold, poison or corruption, or can even turn damage into healing* trading between players can be done by dropping player bags or by setting specific permission levels for storage containers for certain player types to use* healing of other player characters is not possible, but characters can heal themselves by consuming mushrooms, health potions or healing food, or else by standing in/close to mineral water or a healing beacon (that can also purify corruption btw.)* the background story consists only of hints on notes and data chips found in treasure chests* tons of features are still in the pipeline, like modding, a creative/creation mode, NPCs, villages, liquid transportation, railways and much much more, as the developers have hinted at on the forums where they actively participate The ""Pro"" update has been a bone of contention and really might not be the best possible solution, however it was a necessary attempt to finance the further game development after Playful had decided to make the basic Creativerse game free to play so it will be easily accessible for all kinds of players, including younger audience and people who have to economize.* while free players have one world of their own, the ""Pro"" upgrade allows players to create many more worlds of their own where they can define more world options than free players can, plus they get a glider and a flashlight, 2 free claims on each gameworld, 20 additional inventory slots and double stamina* early backers and everyone who has ever spent money in the store of Creativerse before August 2nd 2016 have automatically been promoted to the ""Pro""-status with release/update R33 and have kept all their old worlds.* even players who have played for free up to August 2nd 2016 and have not ever spent any money for Creativerse have kept their old worlds - and are additionally to that provided with one new world where they will find themselves after returning to the game for the first time.

								Before you say or think anything, NO THIS IS NOT A MINECRAFT CLONE. It is a voxel (or box) style game.  Minecraft is not the only voxel game in the world.  This game however, was worth paying the $20 to get to play it early.What I like about it:- There's a back story, in which you find through items scattered in the world- The crafting system- Building creativity / freedom- Active community (dev.s listen and reply very quickly to suggestions!)- Friendly community- No pressure to buy anything- The creatures are downright adorable- and more.I highly recommend that anyone who loves adventure to play this game.  Even if you don't have the imagination for sandbox games, this one has you exploring the world in your own way.  Craft all the items.  Find recipes that aren't just handed to you.  Create your base.  Blow everything up! (Even friends)			"

								Don't buy this unfinished mess.There is almost no content and the content there is is behind hours upon hours of grinding and days of waiting.yes that's right. Most of your gameplay will be waiting for those slow as can be machines to finish up  something like splitting a block of wood into slabs.which takes.....10 seconds!good luck making a few hundred of those.This game seemed quite promising at the beginning. i was there. It would be the next minecraft! With modding support, upgradable stations etc.No. It's nothing more than a cheap and loveless mobile game.			"

								As of right now, this gets a thumb down from me.Now, before I go into why, bear in mind the game is FREE TO PLAY. Try the game yourself, becuase the flaws I list may not be flaws that you have an issue with.So, first of all, the game is Increadibly smooth. The mechanics are very smooth and well thought out.Sadly though,  you Burn through gear, especially compared to minecraft, because instead of using just one or two blocks to ""mine"" you end up having to use your mining tool to mine EVERY BLOCK in that entire section (not counting extractors mind). So as an example, I was having to craft a new mining tool every time I went down, and it got to the point I carried two or three on me, simply because it stopped being cost effective to do so. Plus you have to hunt down multiple resources to craft set things. Enemies do respawn, but it was a frustrating and annoying experience for me, not an enjoyable one. I almost feel the game devs created this to be played with multiple people, so the drain on gear isn't as bad as it is with one player. However, since I WAS playing one player.......the grind was real.And honestly, that ONE fact destroyed the game for me. For me, I love exploring, just running around, and checking stuff out, but....sadly there's not a ton of content here. On top of that, this game as been around since August of 2014. Now, I have not been a part of the DEV team, nor have I really played through or been a part of the updates, but the fact that there's not a whole lot of different areas/content (like, expansive worlds I mean), a LOT of grinding, and the cash shop selling blocks, I sorta get the feeling that the Dev team put most of its work into the game fluidity and mechanics, which are fantasitc. But it suffers in other areas.So for me, personally, while it does have good points, the areas it suffers are reasons why I play games. Exploration, crafting, combat, but mostly exploring. So when grinding is the focus, the game suffers for me.As I said though, the game is completely free to play, and the ""pro"" version costs 20 bucks. If you like the game yourself, buy it to support the developers.Edit: Good to see people are still marking reviews down they disagree with, regardless if it was actually helpful or not			"

								Used to be one of the best free to play sandbox game on Steam, and then R35 came along and suddenly everything was pay-to-win.Buy the dlc if you are interested,otherwise don't bother wasting your time on the ""basic"" account. Many of the features before the recent updates were free and easily accessible to all players. If you really like the game, go for the ""pro"" account. Currently, its the only way to truly enjoy your experience in the game.However, be sure to do a test run on the basic account to get a feel of the game first before buying the dlc to make sure it is worth your money.

								Meh. This game is not bad, but most certainly NOT the worst Minecraft clone ever at least. Still though, I don't recommend this game under my point of view with some valid reasons explained.Pros:+Tone down version of Minecraft with relaxing music.+Functions like Minecraft (digging for stuff, crafting, fighting monsters, etc.).+An atypical Minecraft clone.+Customizable characters.+Graphics are average, plays smoothly  at least on a potato or a toaster.Cons:-An in-game cash shop for P2W aspects.-Extractors for things to be built takes up to 5 minutes or more. -Movement system is not good, jumping feels like there's low gravity in space.-Combat system is also bad, monsters have a longer range, and there are no effective ranged weapons.-Building and exploring are probably the main aspects of this game mostly. Come on, a lot of crafting involved? In the end, I would rather play Minecraft than this game. Minecraft already has its own aspects that are probably better than Creativerse.Now listen. I can see this game going to become better at least in the future, but we will have to wait and see if that will happen, since this game is in Early Access. I might come back and try this game again, so be aware of this. My review might be deleted or edited for a different opinion.			"

								I haven't delved too deep (YET) into Creativerse, but what time I've spent in it (a few months ago as of this review, I'm sure there's all sorts of new stuff!) has been quite fun. Sure, it's another Minecraft type game, but so what? That's a good thing. The way things function however, make the game play quite different than minecraft even early on, and from what I could tell it was only going to get more divergent on its own path. One thing I can tell up front is this is more of an exploration based/combat game in terms of your delving down below ground. Sure, there are critters in minecraft, but no one really worries about any of the minecraft creatures. This game has things that will EAT YOU AND SPIT OUT YOUR EYES TO MAKE SOUP FOR LEFTOVERS ON THURSDAY. Anyways, I strongly recommend this game if you like building/open world/exploration minecraft type games, enough that I suggest you pay for it despite it eventually going free to play upon release. Support the devs for their quality, hard work, and have fun building and exploring!			"

								This *was* a good game until they not only went Pay to Play, but are also heading towards Pay to Win. I normally like to give pros and cons for the games I review, however this game no longer deserves it. Instead, let's see just what caused me to hate it so much so suddenly. It was free to play with stuff you could buy from the store for coins and real money. That's fine. It's an Early Access game. That's fine. It's vaguely a Minecraft clone. That's fine. What's NOT fine is springing this ""DLC"" on us. Extra inventory space? Extra items? Are you sh!^^ing me?! Aside from that, the ""DLC"" basically says, ""Gee, you're really enjoying our game, huh? Here, let me take about 90% of its pieces out of your toy box and demand your lunch money to get them back."" Doesn't seem very fair does it? It's borderline Bully Tactics really. So because this ""company"" decided to pull this stunt, this game has immediately fallen out of the good light I saw it in before, and likely will never return unless this P2P/P2W BS is corrected. 0/10. Correct your sins, or forever burn in Gaming Hell, Playful Corporation.			"

Early Access Review
								Good game.  4/5 Would recommend buying the finished product when released, but even for early access the game has a lot of content.  I put quite a bit of time into it, could have spent more building, but I'm not really a building guy, I prefer exploration, fighting etc.  If you enjoyed Minecraft, thisr is an improvement.  What I liked:-Graphics are nice, good lighting effects. I found myself stopping and looking around quite a bit.   -Lots of the biomes are really neat, the swamp especially I enjoyed when I first discovered it.  Canyons are also very cool.  -Recipie discoveries - I liked that it was tiered so that was really good.  I didn't like that I had to build some stuff to open the other stuff though, was kind of a waste of resources, but whatever. -Difficulty - Tier by tier the monsters where pretty tough, so whenever I went into combat I was really careful because ya never know what was going to happen.  As I got better weapons the stuff above ground was pretty much cake, but down underground there was never a time when I felt comfortable or secure.  What I didn't like:-You don't know what you don't know.  I'm still not sure how to get some of the items required to make some stuff.  I never saw an Egg the entire game.  I'm guessing you have to Tame something?  - Some of the items required to make stuff was tedious to gather, especially potions at times.  The resistance potions where kind of annoying to make.  Not a huge deal, but maybe get a bit more for less resources?  - Farming with the Hoe - This was way to slow.. I don't know if there was any other kind of item that made it faster, but tilling the grass/ground was 4 or 5 seconds per plot... it was time consuming. -Corruption mob density was a little high.  Because they had so many HP it was really tedious to fight because you got swarmed.  I was building terrain traps to farm stuff, I'm cool with that but it gets tedius when you want to explore but can't.  Suggestions:-Combat - I liked combat, it was challenging.  I felt maybe a medium power range weapon would be a good choice, something to soften mobs up before engaging?  I know there's bombs, but they are somewhat expensive to make. -Crafting Tabs - Let me tab off stuff if I like, as per ARK.-Gathering Water/Liquid was kind of annoying.  I felt that if I sat there, it should maybe speed way up as I collect the resource?  -Terraria, rare monster drops to summon bosses, etc.Anyhow, good game.  Free week was awesome, I'll buy the game for sure when it's out.			"

								you dont need pro in this  game at all ...buy a cheap item package and save money in the shop and get the pro instead of paying for pro  like some did. nice game but need much mengling sound fixes spawn fixes and such game is farming sorting inventory replacing used items that requires alotta crafting resources its like use 70% of a sword to get materials for a new one think of it as minecraft in a cartoonway with out any automaing at all then you can tame an animal and make crops for feeding it, after waiting on animal to sink food you return to get something good for the food it was given you get dirt or **** not worth it. if you cut a tree you need to remove all it dosent go away by it self dosent look like anything is regrowing.too me the game feels like alpa minecraft cartoonish not that it is bad.but worth the propackage nopenot saying you shouldent buy it but use your time before paying for pro.example i have 4 lanes with 99 crops in each if i plant and go to the lovest layer i still get massive sound spam from crops growing up on the top and theres alotta moments with lagspikes where you wanna pick up 1 dirt but end up taking 3-4 not fun the intention with the game i like just needs more life in the lenght and small fixes here and there			"

								Note: For all you complainers out there who are upset that it copied Minecraft, why did you play the damn game? The reason I downvoted the game was because although it is fun, and I do suggest it for those who like voxel like survival, it does not have creative mode. I know it probably isn't that hard to build and do stuff in survival, but I was expecting CREATIVE mode. Since the name of the game was CREATIVErse. I wanted to build, not fight a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of monsters and then maybe get the chance to do something.Edit: Also the reason I want creative is because I remember hating survival both in minecraft and in this. I really suck when it comes to those things, so I simply can't suggest the game because it sucks the fun out of my gameplay by limiting me.			"

								Many fans of Minecraft may come to enjoy this, and I strongly recommended this game to them. Personally, however I had played so much Minecraft from the first year of it's release til Microsoft bought it, and it did feel too much like Minecraft. This is the type of game you just can't play without friends however, and all of my friends and myself are a little tired of the game after all the years. This is just me personally, but I still strongly recommend it to any fans out there.Sorry this isn't a thorough review, I didn't put as many hours into it as I should have, and if you've played Minecraft on your own, then you pretty much know about 75% of what exists in this game already.

								friends recommended this to me even when i'm already busy with some other builder games, ended up x6 times more hours played than all of them totalled.Review effect around 5/3/2016:+simple and fun+Environment develops slowly around you+cool different biomes with more new blocks to discover+underground-content filled+low spec requirement and small file size download+your best place to show your creativity in building+co-op-the more ""crafted blocks"" accumulates in the world, the laggier it gets for low-spec users-Early Access glitches you may expect-very simple combat mechanism-crafting lists are still increasing, currently not a lot. (3/4/2015)-no adventurous story gaming-strict & tight community vs toxic community exists (i think dota 2 is 'lightly' better.... no i'm not joking lol...)it has its own art, gr9 music, items and potentially immersive, would definitely recommend this as a co-op building exploration game to many friends. Its still in early access so don't expect much to spend your time long on.8/10 would definitely lose other friends for this game again.			"

								Hmmm...do I like the game? Just look at my hours played! The only other game to challenge for hours consumed would be Minecraft but I got sick of that game ages ago. Main reason why? Every update I would have to wait for, then download, then install all the mods I required to make the game bearable. Creativerse has those things as standard. Better graphics, better hud, more mobs, more ores, more blocks, decorations, etc, etc.In early access it is already vastly superior to Minecraft Vanilla and each update makes it better than most mods!

								About a year ago I would have recommended this game, but after R30 and the pro update the game just seemed to go downhill. It has became very lackluster for multiplayer and not very fun by yourself. Personally adding dlc or in game purchases to a creative sandbox games just ruins the game. Overall as os making this review... 3/10			"

								Aside from being a Sandbox Voxel game like minecraft, it has it's own charms and seperates itself pretty well. I like the direction it is going and hope it continues to stay different than minecraft. What I notably like is:The crafting system - really interesting, makes me want to unlock all the recipesDifferent biomes - refreshing and interesting types of biomes even based off of seasons makes me want to explore around and see what I can find.Fear of caves - don't dig straight down...Creatures - not the generic cow and chicken combos i mean there are chickens but they are more cocktrice like and more interesting than just a normal mooing cow, plus the night creatures look scary :D at least you can see them most of the time ^^---------------------------------What I find so - so-The fighting is lacking, kinda makes me feel like it's turn based like when I am not even close enough or behind it I still get hit by attacks while i try to maneuver and evade it. -Food is rare, so is health regen-Could add some more filler content or more visible goals. I know it's there but, as someone who started out some of the things are a bit hard to find and some items aren't readily accessable which drags the crafting system back when you don't have the proper item or tools. But I do recommend it for people who enjoy Voxels and want something new and refreshing, maybe more for people who want to relax a bit. Not recommended for those who are hardcore or looking to 'conquer' land because it is actually a fairly relaxing game from what I can tell on the surface of the game itself and it's gameplay. I do look forward to see how it develops more! "

								With all the reviews being about how it costs $20 to play, I'm making a positive review to counter those. It's a pretty neat game, could use some improvements but it's much better than minecraft if you're into that, I'm sick of it by now. People are grabbing pitchforks and torches over a mere $20 for a pro version. Actually angry that they were given the game for free for a few months first, lol wtf? Had they not let players try the game out for free, the reviews would be 99% positive I think. If you really can't afford a $20 game, maybe you should be spending your free time getting a job...			"

								At first from looking at the screenshots, I thought this was another buggy, minecraft-esque voxel sandbox.I was wrong.I played it for a while, however it had one big flaw; it was almost featureless. I don't play Minecraft anymore, and honestly I never could really call it my favorite, however it still had a moderate amount of features. As a game developer and somewhat game player, through seeing things in past experience, this game is uncomparable in terms of features to many other games I've seen, as in it has VERY, VERY FEW. As in:Chops TreeGets CragwoodMakes big house in treeCan't figure out what to do in houseStarts miningMines for 2 hoursFind corruptionCan't figure out what to do in the corruptionGets diamondsAnd then there's pretty much nothing left!Another large issue that I see, is the CHILDLISHLY, COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC entities. While I in no way am in favor of the realism in Minecraft, at least it has COWS, and CHICKENS, and THINGS THAT DO NOT LOOK LIKE THEY CAME FROM A SHOW FOR LITTLE GIRLS, while in Creativerse, the same ""wth is this"" message is constantly flitting through my head.Plus, it barely has any form of entity that is HOSTILE!A leafy? What's a leafy?I'm sorry, but a game that has been in development for 1 1/2 years should not have simple issues with even being able to get to the main menu, have entities that look like they were drawn by 4-year-olds, or be in a situation where the only blocks are completely useless and random and the only thing you can do is make a pretty house.

								Okay... Although i've only played for like 60+ hours, but i guess it's enough for me to finally make a review, since i've reached the deepest floor on  creativerse, and i kinda get the hang of the whole game. And this is my score for this game ( Please keep in mind that i have never played minecraft so i can't compare the 2 game) :Gameplay : 8.5Music : 8Crafting : 8.5Combat : 8 ( The combat is simple but the monsters and their unique spawn rate is unique )Unique : 8.5Longevity : 9! ( If you play this with friends!)IMPORTANT MESSAGE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW! SO PLEASE DO READ THE REVIEW THOROUGHLY :)))A bit of my story about the game : For someone who has never played minecraft and stuff... For me this game is amazing,This game has endless possibilities, I can do almost anything that i want in this game... The graphics is awesome, the gameplay is good on its on way, There are tons of unique monsters.The first time i played this game... I was confused, because i have never played minecraft before, and there is barely any Tutorial for this game, but after playing a few hours, I'm starting to get the hang of the game and i really enjoyed it.I was playing with my buddy and at first we were building a small treehouse and stuff, and we thought that it was amazing... But then after a few days, we explored that this game has ( What we called it ):1. Spring Zone2. Summer Zone3. Autumn Zone4. Winter ZoneAnd after we look around, we decided to move our house to the Winterrrr Zoneeeeee....!!!And then we build our own castle, WE DESTROYED THE WHOLE MOUNTAINNNN WITH A ♥♥♥♥IN BOMB LOLOL.... It was amazing xD... And we made our own monster breeding place, using the soil and the ecosystem based on where they spawn. so we basically dont have to walk to actually farm for the monsters.OKAY BACK TO THE REVIEW! ~~~~~GAMEPLAY :The gameplay for me is unique, simple , and fun ... It doesn't require you that much of skill to actually enjoy the whole game... And as someone who has never played a single sandbox, voxel based open world game.... this game is amazing, because i can actually do almost anything that i want. And the features in this game varies, and it never bores me.- You can suck the ground and mine the ore based on what layer of soil you are in... There are :------- 1. Normal Soil------- 2. Layers with Obsidian and a few useful ores------- 3. Layers with iron and a few useful ores------- 4. Layers with Mythril and a few useful ores------- 5. Layers with Diamond and a few useful ores------- 6. LAVA LAYERZZZZ------- 7. End of the world (?) Where you can gather Lumite...ANDDD... each layers has its own unique monsters with unique drop for crafting! Best way to open the space for mining is using BOMBS!!! easy space lol.Watch this guide :

			Views: 37,794		

			MOAR Creativerse Peeps! Creativerse is a sandbox adventure game set in a beautiful yet treacherous world shrouded in mystery.		

 MUSICCC : The music is quite soothing and it's really enjoyable while playing the game ...Crafting : The crafting is quite basic, as usual... you gather stuffs and when you have enough ingredient , fuala~ you can craft those items...BUT... If you want to open the next recipe , you basically have to AT LEAST craft the recipe before it... OnceSo basically if you want to open the whole recipe, just craft em all... although not all recipe has the next recipe if you craft 'emAND WHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE :There are different processing machine for each kinds of crafting, and it's what makes the game quite unique, and you can multitask different craft in a different machine! and you can also make unlimited amount of that machine too! amazing right...?!COMBATTT :The combat itself is quite simple, just mash-click your button lol... But what makes it unique is the kinds of monsters and items that they droppedAAAANNDD Where they spawn! you can actually make an ecosystem just like where they used to live, and the monster itself will spawn! That way, you dont have to actually run from side to side just to gather those monsters item, since this game has limited amount of teleport machine, which is limited to one teleport machine for each players.UNIQUEEE : This is game TO me is unique, because you can do almost anything, and it really differs from other sandbox game that i've witnessed from youtube and stuff... The gameplay and etc is much more polished than the ancestor... Minecraft, although there are some parts that still lacks of something...But overall this game is fun, enjoyable, unique, and if you play this with your friends, this game is just amazingly fun in its own way lol trust me!LONGEVITY :The game is very fun, it doesnt get boring fast, and even after 200+hours i would even still play this game and smile like a dork everytime i finished building something with my buddies.One key to make this game longlasting ... Play this game with your friends... seriously... it gets really fun especially if you play this game with teamspeak or any voicechat program...SOOO This is the end of my review! I hope you enjoy reading my first...detailed review i have ever made. I hope it makes it easier for you to decide to play this game or not... AND IF YOU WANT TO JOIN MY WORLD ON CREATIVERSE... SIMPLY JUST ADD ME, AND CHAT ME WHEN IM ONLINE :)MY WORLD IS STILL RATHER SMALL BUT I BASICALLY HAVE COVERED MOST OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE GAME SUCH AS ORE MINING, MONSTER BREEDING, AND A MOUNTAIN SIZED CASTLE :)			"

								Well, I really liked the game at first but here are some reasons why the ""magic"" gone after some minutes of gaming.At first it seems like a more polished version of minecraft but it lacks some basic things that makes it impossible to surpass the title of ""bad clone"".:::Enemies:::They are too few and with barely no variety, the game seems like a lego game that has some strong agressive enemies (caves and canyons) with bad AI and their melee attacks hit you from far distances.The only way I found to not being hit by monsters is non-stop walking away backwards and hitting them like 3 blocks away while you hit the air and damages them ._.They all look really cute (which makes me wonder if this game is supposed to kids 12 and below).:::Biomes:::All the biomes looks the same, but with recolor, I couldn't find any weather effects.The game has only night and day, in the snow biome you get a freeze meter that didn't seem to have any effect on actual gameplay.:::Blocks:::The solid blocks all have the same atributes. Example: Sand blocks doesn't fall when the block below it is removed.If you remove the logs on the bottom of the trunk the tree doesn't fall or ""drop"", you have to remove every single block, one by one.I really loved the game in the first minutes, it felt very polished and well optimized, and the asthetics....some people might not like it, but i like the toy-ish texture overall however sometimes you feel like you are playing a game for kids, mostly because of the lack of clutter on the biomes and the enemies being toy-ish too.I know it is a free game, but I guess they could make it better and there are some reviews that point out really good points to improve, unfortunately my english is very bad since I don't use it in a daily basis, so I will end my review here.The game feels kinda empty, but it is worth a try (it's free!), your younger bros/cousins/kids would enjoy it a lot as a minecraft alternative (I guess.)This review is subject to change if the game sees some improvement.

What's a leafy?I'm sorry, but a game that has been in development for 1 1/2 years should not have simple issues with even being able to get to the main menu, have entities that look like they were drawn by 4-year-olds, or be in a situation where the only blocks are completely useless and random and the only thing you can do is make a pretty house.

								I really enjoyed this game before this new pro update stuff. This pro member upgrade effectivly removes many ofthe features which were faily attracting to me, such as the world customization and making as many worlds as possible. It really has killed Creativerse for me the fact that those options are gone, it no longer is fun for me, and other people as well.*Initialzing uninstallation process-1337.abc.Creativerse*PS: Playful, please take away the pro stuff, no one wants it.

								Aside from being a Sandbox Voxel game like minecraft, it has it's own charms and seperates itself pretty well. I like the direction it is going and hope it continues to stay different than minecraft. What I notably like is:The crafting system - really interesting, makes me want to unlock all the recipesDifferent biomes - refreshing and interesting types of biomes even based off of seasons makes me want to explore around and see what I can find.Fear of caves - don't dig straight down...Creatures - not the generic cow and chicken combos i mean there are chickens but they are more cocktrice like and more interesting than just a normal mooing cow, plus the night creatures look scary :D at least you can see them most of the time ^^---------------------------------What I find so - so-The fighting is lacking, kinda makes me feel like it's turn based like when I am not even close enough or behind it I still get hit by attacks while i try to maneuver and evade it. -Food is rare, so is health regen-Could add some more filler content or more visible goals. I know it's there but, as someone who started out some of the things are a bit hard to find and some items aren't readily accessable which drags the crafting system back when you don't have the proper item or tools. But I do recommend it for people who enjoy Voxels and want something new and refreshing, maybe more for people who want to relax a bit. Not recommended for those who are hardcore or looking to 'conquer' land because it is actually a fairly relaxing game from what I can tell on the surface of the game itself and it's gameplay. I do look forward to see how it develops more! "

								Well, I really liked the game at first but here are some reasons why the ""magic"" gone after some minutes of gaming.At first it seems like a more polished version of minecraft but it lacks some basic things that makes it impossible to surpass the title of ""bad clone"".:::Enemies:::They are too few and with barely no variety, the game seems like a lego game that has some strong agressive enemies (caves and canyons) with bad AI and their melee attacks hit you from far distances.The only way I found to not being hit by monsters is non-stop walking away backwards and hitting them like 3 blocks away while you hit the air and damages them ._.They all look really cute (which makes me wonder if this game is supposed to kids 12 and below).:::Biomes:::All the biomes looks the same, but with recolor, I couldn't find any weather effects.The game has only night and day, in the snow biome you get a freeze meter that didn't seem to have any effect on actual gameplay.:::Blocks:::The solid blocks all have the same atributes. Example: Sand blocks doesn't fall when the block below it is removed.If you remove the logs on the bottom of the trunk the tree doesn't fall or ""drop"", you have to remove every single block, one by one.I really loved the game in the first minutes, it felt very polished and well optimized, and the asthetics....some people might not like it, but i like the toy-ish texture overall however sometimes you feel like you are playing a game for kids, mostly because of the lack of clutter on the biomes and the enemies being toy-ish too.I know it is a free game, but I guess they could make it better and there are some reviews that point out really good points to improve, unfortunately my english is very bad since I don't use it in a daily basis, so I will end my review here.The game feels kinda empty, but it is worth a try (it's free!), your younger bros/cousins/kids would enjoy it a lot as a minecraft alternative (I guess.)This review is subject to change if the game sees some improvement.

								It's like minecraft if Minecraft simultaneously looked better but was more boring to play and could only be played online (read: lag) and contained a bunch of F2P in-app purchase nags and pay walls.It looks pretty for this type of game, I'll give it that, but I don't see any reason to play this over dozens of similar games that are already available. The Premium version is $20. For an extra ten you could be playing Minecraft, and in the several hours I spent with this game, I didn't really feel like it has anything to offer that makes it very competitive against minecraft other than looking better.Well, except that you don't need to keep a wiki page open to remember how to craft things. But that's about it. But the thumbs down mostly comes from everything in first paragraph.			"

								Initially things to start with, this is my most noteworthy prescribed diversion in my library. On the off chance that you appreciate sandbox making sort recreations particularly voxel based ones, this amusement is mind blowing. I have put in many hours and have met and played with tons and huge amounts of different players hopping around various group universes and making my very own few, assembled universes with topics, mammoth châteaux, little homes, insane homesteads, petting zoos, world trees, towns, sanctuaries, the rundown continues forever. The multiplayer part of this diversion is stunning and the group is really extraordinary I have met such a variety of magnificent individuals on this amusement and I sincerely couldn't have requested a vastly improved affair. The diversion has great mechanics like the alternative to pivot pieces or the utilization of sections, stairs, or tables to conceal your lights, now with the marvelous things individuals are making with machines and the way that they are as yet adding to the amusement giving you such a variety of conceivable outcomes. The genuine substantial hitter in my suggestion however is the developement group. I have never in my life experienced such a responsive group, to the point that rapidly actualizes what individuals request or fixes bugs and will stay there and do a reversal and forward on subjects with you to get the settle you have to make the most of their substance. Stunningly better is whether you have accomplished something astounding and need to flaunt you can submit screen shots and they may specify your works or even come expand on your reality! The player designer cooperation I believe is vital it helps both sides interface with each other and convey more delight to the players amusement encounter and the engineers work encounter. Individuals request more sections, stairs, and rooftops, devs drop different new packs, players request machines with weight plates and switches, we get considerably more than we requested. Players are as yet requesting progressively and we are as yet getting more! For an early get to amusement, this is the most entire, most charming, and most energizing background you could request. I have upheld this diversion by acquiring additional cool shop surface packs, expert version, and will presumably keep on funding the amusement by obtaining whatever else they discharge since I know contributing adds to their susstainability and development and from a diversion with this much in early get to I can't envision what it will resemble in about a year. On the off chance that you can deal with imparting your issues to designers and talking over gatherings, and in the event that you like sandbox manufacturers this amusement offers an exceptional and pleasant style to the class like nothing i've played some time recently.

								My feelings on this game are mixed and for that reason I will neither recommend it nor will I not recommend it. I'll leave that decision for those who decide to try the game.The following is my Creativerse experience:  At first I was intrigued by it and wanted to see how it compared to other games similar to this that have come out since the creation of Minecraft. After playing for a bit I started to get a little more interested and thought it might be something I could have fun playing. I loved the idea of the blueprints system and was hoping to work towards building the fort some day. However I dont think I will be playing anymore after my short frustrating experience with the game. After gathering and crafting many materials I ended up losing everything after dying to a glowing crab that somehow managed to get into my ""safe room"". I had finally found some obsidian and the extractors take 5 minutes to gather the ore. This of course being 5 real life minutes and the in-game clock ticks by much faster. Being a new player I hadn't had much chance to make the nicer gear which is what I was working towards. When I noticed it was getting close to night time I decided to build a little wall around myself so I could mine my ore in peace. Just as the exctractors where almost finished thats when that pesky crab came in and killed me. I don't know if it glitched through the wall I made or dug its way in but if it glitched its way in that bs needs to be fixed. As a side note although at the beginning of my review I said I would neither recommend or not recommend the game becuase steam forces me to pick one inorder to post this review I am picking not recommend.

								this was a fun game when it first came outits mechanics were fun its playermodels were a bit dull but not badand all and all it was simple,easy and enjoyablenow that the update has come alot of things have changedthey removed helmets and replaced them with arm guards i thinkthe mining chips that werent a problem are now replaced with giant gauntletsyou can't attack mid air anymore (you have to stand still)the enemies often times become repetetive and gang up on you when you try to work (im looking at you mirus)i can go on and on and on about its problemsand if the developers see this review they need to realise that they need to take a step backLITTERALY and go back to the previus updates were they didnt add new things yet "

Early Access Review
								This game, Creativerse is fun. Sure from the looks of it, a person might say that ""oh its just a minecraft clone"" which is true to an extent. The graphics are voxel and boxy, but they are WAY better than the♥♥♥♥♥♥ minecraft displays on your screen. GRAPHICS= 8/10It very pretty, the textures look great and the sky at night is a sight that you should experience. I'm sure as this game further develops it will look even more stunning. However, the reason why I gave it a 8/10 is because some of the textures need work like the monster textures and blocks often come off as looking the same as the one next to it.GAMEPLAY 8/10To put in a few words. Creativerse is jam-packed with many things to do, caves to explore resources to mine. Yes at it's core gameplay mechanics, it might be borrowing from Minecraft in terms of mining in caves and gathering resources to smelt and repeat. But where Creativerse is different is its execution of the way you mine for blocks. Instead of a pickaxe you suck blocks up into your glove, and the more you upgrade the less time it takes to mine. The movement in Creativerse is fluid like silk cheese, jumping really feels like you are actually jumping. Combat is more or less the same as any other game, point and click to hit. You can tame the monsters that you can encounter and feed/shower them for various resources. Also monsters change in the night time so when they do you better build shelter. CONCLUSION= 8/10REALLY AS OF NOW I can say this EARLY ACCESS game is solid so far, its graphics and shaders make the world of creativerse feel less blocky than it actually is + slopes which is good. But besides that what creativerse needs now is a sense of direction to guide players into what this game can offer. I had to wiki most of the game's many blocks and mechanics such as taming monsters to feed and shower them. Hopefully in the future there is an option for character design like gender perhaps? What i do like about the game is that it attempts to have the player uncover a story through ripped pages found randomly on the map, but lets be honest who would read that I wouldn't.  "

								Highly recommended! If you love voxel games this is one that should be in your library. I hate to compare it to another game, but if you have ever played Minecraft(who hasn't)this game takes it to the next level in every way while still being a game of its own.Don't believe the negative reviews of people complaining about the $20 pro option. If the game is for you, you won't mind paying $20 bucks for it. That is a small price to pay for a very enjoyable game.The devs seem to really care about the game. There are frequent updates and a ""playful"" youtube channel.This is an early access worth getting in on!			"

								This is a great game with huge potential the devs constantly update it and its not restricted under a big paywall or anything. DO NOT listen to those negative reviews whining about pro feature ruining the game and restricting them because they gave free pro to anyone who spend even a CENT in the game before it launched and pro does not restrict the free players from their gameplay whatsoever the only differences between basic and pro worlds are a few settings like low gravity and lowering mob spawns and making them passive which does NOT ruin the game for free players pro players also get a free glider and flashlight and for all u people who are stingy not to pay 20$ to sustain the game IT DOESN'T MATTER if you played the game before without a glider and flashlight then you can do so now as well			"

I find it amazingly more interesting than minecraft ever was, considering all the monsters, layers and their updating building blueprints that you have to make stuff to unlock more things.

								This is a fun game.  I'm not sure what the crying is about Pro level. I played it as a free user for a while and liked it enough to buy the Pro version, and while the flashlight in particular is pretty handy, nothing you get with Pro is OP or P2W.  Really it's worth it to me just for the ability to set some fun modifiers, and have multiple worlds going.That being said, the worlds are pretty huge and even a single world will keep you exploring for many hours.  This is basically minecraft but with better visuals, and I like the mechanics better.  More variety of enemies and block types, too.  I like the recipe system (certain blocks require you to find/loot recipes), and the blueprints are fun.The free version is great for a F2P game, the paid Pro level is worth it IMHO.Keep in mind though, this is an Early Access game.  There are still some bugs in there, some of them requiring restart, and once it completely locked my machine up to the point of having to restart with the physical power switch. Hopefully these will be worked out over time.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a new review on the game, now that I've really played it. The base concepts are very similar to Minecraft: Build, mine, explore, KILL. The way that Creativerse executes it, on the other hand, is different from its predecessor.Tl;wr: Creativerse adds onto the already-great concept of Minecraft. It has more of everything, and the fact that it's free makes it better in basically every way. Overall, would definitely recommend for literally months of entertainment. Now, for the actual details.MiningThe first thing I want to note is the mining system. it still has tiers like Minecraft, with maybe two more tiers than it, but the way that you dig is different. You still attempt to find caves, since that provides easy ores, but in Creativerse you can do mass excavating quickly and the way the mining tools work is different. You only get slightly faster mining when you get a better tool, but you need better tools to get through the different tiers of the world. On the note of ores, Minecraft just treats them like another thing to be mined. Creativerse on the other hand requires a disposable item to be placed on the ore to give you up to 16 of that ore (if you use the best item on the weakest ore).CombatIt's not much different, but there are some added complexities. Minecraft has only enemies that melee, do ranged, or just explode. It's lackluster, but it works. With Creativerse, there are specialized enemies like Warmworms, some enemies that are peaceful until attacked, and some enemies that do knockback or special effects. there are also special bombs and potions that can be consumed while battling, unlike Minecraft. It's only a little better, frankly. (also, more variety in Creativerse. ALOT.)BuildingThe building is actually a whole helluvalot better than Minecraft. With Creativerse, there are Blueprints for the non-creative, free rotation for the clever, and special lights and decor for the creative. There are also more furniture options, such as tables, processing stations, and mechanisms. Wiring is also better, since it's based on linking instead of using a material.ExplorationThe exploration is actually pretty fun, since it has more varied biomes and the map is easier to use and give people directions on. The layers of the world are also great, since you can go (from highest to lowest) to the surface, cave, fossil, stalactite, igneous, and corruption layer. The ores get better as you go down, and you don't find bad ores in the deepest places (like how minecraft does).MultiplayerThe multiplayer is also done better than Minecraft. The game is technically ONLY multiplayer, but you loners out there can put a password on your epic singleplayer world. For worlds that allow it, you can claim plots of land to be yours and maybe someone else's very easily. Just gather some resources, open the map, select some land, and enjoy! Creativerse also has a huge list of all of the ""Public"" worlds that you can join no matter what. Friends can join easier, you can join randoms easier, and overall it's a good experience.InterfaceThe interface is well made, with the recipe system different from anything I know. Recipes are gained in a sort of ""Unlock Tree"", kind of like skills in a skill tree. You always have a map of the whole world, and you can fill out the map by visiting diferent ""sectors"". There's a blueprints tab for the blueprints mentioned in Building, which allows you to convert small amounts of materials into reusable and relatively easy to follow plans. Overall, would definitely recommend. It's a minecraft clone, sure, but one that's on content steroids.			"

								So my opinion on this game is buy it! It's $20, and lots of fun. If you like Minecraft, you will love creativerse. This game is a huge upgrade to Minecraft. The graphics are 10 times better (I don't play minecraft without a resource pack), what you can create with the blocks available is amazing, and right now I would say there is no need for a modded version. The recent update did a lot for this game imo. Before the update I hadn't put a ton of time into the game. Since the update I have been floored on all the changes they have made. Now I say all this with love and admiration but it is not without flaws. I have had some issues where teleporting from one place to another wont load into the new place I teleported to and had to leave world and restart. I have also left world in one of these situations and and went to reload and got nothing but a black screen. On occasion there is some lag but it is nothing major. As for a lot of these recent bad reviews... Quit your crybaby crap! Whaaaaa they want money for something they created and I used to love but now ♥♥♥♥ them because they want $20. The fact that you can't be bothered to pay $20 to purchase a great game when your computer most likely cost you anywhere from $300 to $3000 is complete rubbish. These Devs basically worked for free up to that point creating something for you to enjoy. Now they would like to see some return on their investment... SHOCKER! Do you like getting a pay check at work? I mean by your standards you should just work for free and let others enjoy having you around! Think about it this way, what other games do you own? I'd be willing to bet the majority of you own quite a few games. Some in the price range of $50 to $60 and you never got to try that game before you purchased it. This game let you play for free for quite a while and all they are asking for in return for the Pro version with all the bells and whistles is $20. You can still play for free though, with no money out of pocket. $20 is not a lot for a good game. For a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game sure I could understand not wanting to pay for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game but this is a really good game!			"

								""oh, come on, not another *mincrafty* game.   Whatever, I guess I'll try it.""  Creativerse isn't TERRIBLE.  But it isn't amazing either.  As usual, you'd want to find shelter, in any survival game, and find some coal.  Doesn't sound too difficult..... Having no clue what coal looked like in this game, I just started TEARING apart the ground inside of the hole I dug.  Took me 4 hours to find one coal ""node"", as is what they're called here, abd when I did I said "" Finally, that took waaaaaaayyyyy to long, *click click click*, why can't I mine this?!? *Tip thingy pops up in the top right of the screen*  ""You'll need an extractor to get some coal.""  What the f- fine, fine, fine then.  I'll make one of these, ""extractors"", and I'll finally get my coal.  But on the bright side, the recipe for an extractor is EXTREMELY cheap, as it is the weakest.  Made one and ran back to the coal, and left clicked, wrong button, right click.  ""There we go!  Why did that take so long?!?!!  Back in Minecraft,"" Yes I will be making a lot of comparisons to Minecraft in this review. ""This would've taken me just 5 minutes after getting situated.""  Come to find out that takes more time to get the coal, not that much time, but I was pretty irritated about this whole thing, since I was at this for 4 and a half hours at this point.  So, just a minute and half later I got 5 coal from one node.  ""Not bad, I guess. still, I wish that wasn't so hard.""  Yes, after playing this, and liking it thus far, I realize that it shouldn't have been that difficult.  Now I know that.  But after using the extractor, I noticed that I didn't get it back.  Which upsetted me just as an inconvienence, since I knew then that I would be carrying atleast 10 at a time, plopping them here and there.  Then it hit me, I can just place one down and do something else, then come back to it, and grab the coal.  That is a HUGE plus.  This game is ALL about progress.  The start of the game is a little to slow for my liking.  However, it is largely Pay to Play, as you can only have ONE WORLD at a time.  You HAVE to buy the ""Premium Upgrade"" to do anything.  Like the world settings.  You want peacful enemies?  Buy premium!  You want extra inventory space?  Buy premium!  Want more than one world?  Buy premium!  This is the kind of marketing that I WISH NEVER CAME TO LIGHT!  I like having the ability to make more worlds as I please.  I don't want to buy a piece of memory space for that sh*t.  I have an intense Love Hate relationship with this game.  So far, in the eight hours that I have put into this game, it has crashed once, but probably it was because I was messing a little with the settings, trying to fix a few things here and there.  I recommend this if you are getting tired of Minecraft, as this is a more, ""special"" type of ""minecraft-esque"" game.  One last thing though.  Fix the craftable light sources, in the mean time, I'll just say, make a LOT of torches and find coal as soon as possible, you can't make the better torches without it.			"

								This game is vary fun and creative.   You can biuld what ever is in you oun head or make it on grid square paper and biuld it here.  I make Zelada's castel from a Link game.  They even give you blueprints to biuld stuff and you can modifie them to your likeing.  I never got into Mindcraft becaues it was too blockie.  This one has better graghics and is smoother I think.  The creaters are cartoony but I think that is cute.  I highly recomend this game from Creative pepel that like to make stuff.  It's multie player sand box is Asome.  You make something and show it off to like 20 or more of you friends   They can see and exploere it.  You can have Public or privet worlds.  Many block to choes from to biuld things.  They added mechines.  They update it. They lison to the players. They add holliday goodies.  This is a fun game to spend hours biuld a town or houes on.			"

								This game is a minecraft clone. It is cancer, yet, it is decently made, and only kinda begs you to upgrade to pro, which is more than can be said for most games of this variety. I would write it off and call it pure cancer if it weren't for the legendary flavor text describing all the items in the game. If you wanna have a quick laugh, play this game.			"

								1st and before everything else this game has Always-Online-DRM yes I know it's a free game and it's kinda like Minecraft, but and this is a big but if the dev's decide some day for some reason shutdown the servers well say good bye to all your worlds and invested hours on your buildings and creations and for that alone I can't recommend this, and BTW the dev team for the time being doesn't have that option in perspective at all, as you can read here... this is the excerpt ""Are there plans to add an offline mode or the ability to host my own worlds?At this time we’re not planning to support offline play. Our focus is on providing effortless multiplayer for everyone with no server setup required."".Other than this big but it's a fine game for a ""clone-like"" of Minecraft, but it's nowhere near as refined and complete IMO, but with time it can be better and better until it's killed that is! :-D			"

								A lovely game to fill in that Minecraft-shaped void in your heart! Creativerse has no greater objective and no major bosses to find. You simply exist to create and mine things as you please! It is in general very soothing to play (unless you're digging in the deepest layer, which is kinda dark) and, best of all, free! (Game is funded by optional microtransactions for special blocks and blueprints to make structures.) PROS: - Tons of blocks to decorate and build.- Different layers and biomes to explore.- Great graphics! sunshafts and high res textures. - Teleporting, so you don't have to walk back to places if you've built the teleporter. - Hotkeys can be changed! - Graphics can be lowered! - You can tame animals; farm them or just have them follow you around. - Great soundtrack! - Easy multiplayer! You can even keep it private by adding a password. - Friendly for people of all ages to play; very forgiving upon death. - the ability to claim chunks of land, lock chests/furnaces/extractors, and so on.- Rotate blocks with the 'R' key! -------EHH- Sometimes light sources glitch out and do not provide light; digging up blocks nearby fixes it, but it can get rather annoying, especially in the dark. - Pets set to follow do so very closely; they do NOT help in combat. - requires Wifi to play.- Lots of block variety can cause inventory to become very messy.-------Overall, very nice! Worth a shot to anyone looking for a block-y game or just wanting to kill time.  "

								Creativerse is an Excellent Game!  Nevermind that it still says ""Early Access.""This game is fully functional and I have found no bugs after 35+ hours.This is a bigger and much better Terraria.  Terraria was great and I can't wait for Terraria 2, but they will have to work hard for T2 to be as good as Creativerse.I've played many open world sandbox games and I'm often disappointed, but not with this game.This is easily my favorite open world sandbox game, and there's more to come.Also, I sent a message to the developers about a question/issue.  (I had ""lost"" some items and didn't understand why.)  They wrote back the very next day and explained why the items ""disappeared.""  Then, they replaced the missing items via an in-game drop in my inventory!Talk about GREAT customer service!  Not only are the Devs working continuously on this game, but they respond to questions ASAP!I highly recommend this game!  Have fun!			"

								I really want to like this game but... The crafting system is somewhat weird. I takes strange combinations to craft things and it's often more frustrating than fun to create simple things like stairs and so on.A few hours in I have yet to find any creatures or dungeons. Mostly because of the crafting system i guess, crasfting gear and armor requires hours of mining, full inventory and so on... Heck, to craft a simple chest for storage requires you to find and mine bee hives...Like I said, I realy want to like this game but I'd rather play vanilla Minecraft for 24 hours than one more hour of this.

								Going to start this off like so many others. I dont usually write reviews but this time I decided to for a few reasons but mainly for the fact that they took a F2P game and made it into a Free demo with an option to buy the real game. Some people talk about the ""Pro"" feature as no big deal and how it doesnt impact the underlying game play. Well.. True.. Going pro doesnt magically make it so that you dont have to harvest blocks, build houses, etc. They then talk about a few of the perks included in there and give them as examples of how just because it is pay now doesnt make it better. Well the issue I take with this is these ""bonus"" items could have easily been placed in their store for you to purchase a la carte. These reviews are missing the point of the other negative reviews. The point is just what has been stated. A F2P game has been turned into a demo version with limited features.Is this game fun?YesDid this game have some interesting ideas on world building?YesDo I think the devs deserve to get paid?YesDo I think they should have gone about getting paid in a different manner?Also YesBut would I recommend this game?Not any moreLike other reviewers said, games like this are a dine a dozen. Even ""big ticket"" MMO games are moving away from subscription based services and focusing on the micro-transactions (in app purchases) because they know that is where the true money is.While I dont think I will uninstall the game since it really doesnt take up that much space I dont believe I will be playing it any more unless something changes where it becomes F2P again with micro-transactions as the way to make their money.

								EDIT:  you now must pay to create new worlds which makes turns this game from a 10/10 to 0/10, you should not have to upgrade to their crappy little pro service just to create new worlds, thats just bullsh*t, if your looking for a good game thats ACTUALLY FREE TO PLAY, i urge you not to even THINK of installing this game, the gameplay is ok, but its not worth paying for your experience.And to the devs of this game, you have dissapointed me, and i hearby will never use, purchase, or play anygame you have made/will make, you have lost me as a customer, and will never have me again as a customer, you claim this game is free to play, but if somebody has to upgrade to ""pro"" just to create a new world, the game is indeed pay to play, you've made liars out of your selves, and i sincerly hope people with the same views boycott your products as well. your game went from the one of the best building games i've played, to the absolute worse, sorry guys, but, i'll stick with minecraft or garry's mod.and to the people thinking about playing this game or the people who have the same views as me, i urge you to uninstall this game if you've installed it already, and stay away from anything these devs make, because they've made themselves liars by making you pay for a ""free to play"" game.0/10 creativerse has done the immpossible, and that immpossible, is being worse than minecraft.

								First off, I will say that this is a fantastic game. I've been playing since before it went free-to-play, and I can say the gameplay is solid, the terrain generation is stunning, and there lots of fun toys and decorative blocks to play around with. They've continued to consistently add content to this game making it better and better. However, I cannot currently recommend this game. There are several issues that severely impact the quality of the game. -First and foremost are the lighting bugs that have gone unaddressed for over a year. When too many lighting objects are in an area, they start behaving strangely. Some kind of algorithm causes them to cease producing light even though they are lit. This makes creating large interiors or nightscapes massively difficult and also makes creature spawns incredibly problematic.-Liquids do not behave properly. Erasing a source block is nearly impossible the way that liquid generates, movement within water is unnecessarily difficult, and liquids often flow in nonsensical patterns.-There are various issues with targeting occlusion, with various interactive objects being prioritized in an inappropriate matter, such as signs being selected when you're looking at a chest, or not being able to remove doors or fans or pressure plates. Additionally, the targeting glitches can cause you to inadvertently place static blocks over interactive objects, effectively deleting the interactive object. When the static block is removed, an ""Empty Block"" remains in place, irrevocably occupying that space.-The scarcity of certain materials is absolutely nonsensical. Once you have the proper equipment, finding diamonds and lumite (the highest tier materials) is absolutely trivial, while finding even meager amounts of iron requires hours of mining.A lot of these issues would be forgivable if not for the fact that they've existed for quite some time, and while the consistent delivery of new content is appreciated, the continuance of these issues is exasperating.

								Creativerse is an Excellent Game!  Nevermind that it still says ""Early Access.""This game is fully functional and I have found no bugs after 35+ hours.This is a bigger and much better Terraria.  Terraria was great and I can't wait for Terraria 2, but they will have to work hard for T2 to be as good as Creativerse.I've played many open world sandbox games and I'm often disappointed, but not with this game.This is easily my favorite open world sandbox game, and there's more to come.Also, I sent a message to the developers about a question/issue.  (I had ""lost"" some items and didn't understand why.)  They wrote back the very next day and explained why the items ""disappeared.""  Then, they replaced the missing items via an in-game drop in my inventory!Talk about GREAT customer service!  Not only are the Devs working continuously on this game, but they respond to questions ASAP!I highly recommend this game!  Have fun!			"

								I logged in and what immediately grabbed my attention was the very detailed hand of my character with his glowing wrist contraption, which allow you as the player character to manipulate the world ala minecraft, left click for pulling blocks, removing them and placing them in your inventory, right click for placing. The game highlights block you are focusing on so it you won't make mistakes. The games main menu and interface are very sleek, and from the looks of it all you need is the name of a world to hop in and play with your friends, all hosted with Creativerse, no extra time and money and frustration out of your pocket trying to make your own server or be forced to live with the rules of another. Top notch. There is an ingame story that sells builds, that you furnish with your own blocks, sort of a graphical blueprint if you will, and very detailed block recipes. The game is cheap, and just like Trove I don't find the items for sale to be game breaking. Similarly wondrous looking blocks are available to build ingame, use the shop as you see fit.You spawn with a platform that sets your spawn, and allows you to teleport to it by simply pressing T. It appears you can teleport to  other players ""Touchstones"", there were slots in the menu that comes up but I have yet to test this feature. Upon death all of your inventory items are placed in an urn, and giant white beam of light shoots high in the sky from its location and on the minimap a skull is placed so that you can find your body easily, if not get back to it easily. This feature alone will save me from rage-quitting like I did with Minecraft for weeks at a time after dying to laval in Hardcore with diamonds or some nonsense.The graphics are very well done, think HD block pack, very smooth, water needs some work, but it overall fits the theme and looks very fluid unlike default Minecraft liquids. The crafting is varied and unique, needing multiple stations to craft at like Minecraft. Instead of mining all ore by hand with a pick you use your hand device and upgrade it with chips, without the need to carry an axe, pick and shovel. For the progression ores you use extractors which essentially is a device you place on the ore, it then breaks the block down into ore, the amount dependent on the level of extractor used. Currently as I am working with obsidian, its 5 minutes per block. This is a nice change of pace from just clicking and clicking, it gives you a chance to step back and explore a bit while the ore is being extracted.TL:DR - If you like Minecraft, STOP AND BUY THIS NOW!

								Dig Dig Dig. It almost seems as if this entire game is based off digging. Sure, after hours of digging through dirt, rock, and siltstone you'll find some mysterious caverns and some monsters to kill. Play this on a late night while wearing headphones and it'll scare ye' more than a few times. Dig a lil' further and you'll find diamond and lava. Hooray. As some point you'll realize that there is just not enough content, let alone a goal to reach for. Of course, building a house, office building, tower, or whatever comes to mind, is pretty amusing...until you realize that no one but you will actually see it. With everyone creating their own world there is no chance of interaction between other players. Oh how I wish there was just one gigantic world....As for item creation, the list is somewhat bleak. It starts off with an alchemy-type process in which you need to find resources to unlocks a few items to create. Exciting. Later (but not much later) it ends with creating swords to create other swords and doors to unlock other doors....same with grenades... In otherwords, the list is unorthodox and has no definite clear order while ignoring the gigantic gaps between items. The game could accomplish much more with many more useful resources, which then could easily extend the item construction list. What it needs for me to come back: More extractable resources, one world for all, extended item list, bigger monsters to slay.			"

								As soon as I saw the amazing graphics for a blocky game, I said to myself, ""Ok they are a serious group people I guess"". Then, many things started to hook me like the deep and inspiring sountrack, great concept of creating worlds and making public (of course there is an option for a password), and the amount of things you can accomplish along with the surplus of variety of items in the world. But, the con is that it's a bit too much like Minecraft. However, I said that there was a suplus of items and by that I mean tenfold than MInecraft's items. So, overall I guess I'll give it a 9/10. Good job developer(s)!			"

								A lot of you will compare this game to Minecraft, so let me tell you a few things:1. It's not Minecraft.2. It's FREE.3. It's still in early alpha, so it will get even better.If those three reasons aren't enough for you to try this game, then you can stop reading and ignore this review.The graphics (texture detail) are really good. When I've tried Minecraft a couple of times before I always got a headache after a few hours, because of all the pixelated stuff going on there. It was hard to see and it was hard on the eyes. Even with mods that used 2x more detailed textures. This game is still a block/voxel based sandbox, but it's the first one that actually looks good. There are a lot of materials and resources, way more than your usual sandbox game. The crafting system is really cool and unique.The game is awesome. If you like sandbox games you should definitely buy this one... Oh wait, it's FREE!			"

								When I first saw this game, I expected a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Minecraft clone with endless microtransactions.  But it was free, and I saw no reason not to try it.After fourty hours in the span of about half a month, here I am. It does have microtransactions, but nothing you need  to survive (I spent the gold they gave me on a treehouse, lmao). And it's far from a minecraft clone.It operates on the same premise- Mine blocks and gather resources to expand your territory and better fight the creatures that come in the night. After that, though, it's got it's own really interesting spin- one that takes it to a new level. Gameplay:Like I said, the premise is like Minecraft's. Mine blocks, defend yourself from hostile creatures, and expand your world. However, it's got its own system. You have a mining cell, fit onto your wrist to gather and hold pieces of the world around you. And you can craft anything, anywhere, with no crafting bench. So long as you have one somewhere and you've gotten the refined materials for it. To make food, you get a cooking station as well. And you forge ores at a, well at a forge.Your ores are much the same way. you upgrade said mining cells to dig deeper into the earth and gather more precious materials from nodes. However, to do this, you need extractors (and time). You attach it to a node, then it will break it down for you. At this point, it's gone, and you're left with everything you need to keep grinding your way down.But the deeper you go, the more dangerous things get. The enemies get tougher and more vicious, and there are more dangers, lava, and after a while, even just being that deep starts to take a toll. You'll have a meter filling up, and when it's full, you'll take damage. Cute and fuzzy the creatures of the world may look, they can be bloodthirsty as all hell.But that's what makes it really fun, the challenge. 10/10 would get mauled by adorable lizards again.Story:There's not much of one, really. Someone left you out in the middle of nowhere to survive (or not) on your own. And through various journal scraps, you find out more about someone (or maybe multiple someones) who've been there before you through journal pages. Now, I love a good story. But I also love the freedom to make one up myself through bits and pieces. So for me, this one gets 7/10, would read way too much into random journal scraps again.Overall:The game's simple to get into, the learning curve is tough, but not brutal, and it's addictive. Between expanding your base(s) and exploring what the world has to offer, you could lose a whole night playing this without even realizing. Having to wait a long time for some of the materials is a slight pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it's nothing that would ruin the game.Easily a 9/10. I'd recommend this to anyone, at least to try out. After all, it's free, so there's nothing to lose (but time), and a really great new game to gain!			"

Early Access Review
								This is an easy to learn building/exploration type game. And any similarities to other titels such as minecraft, rust, terr-.. THEY are all mearly happenstances:) The games greatest virtue is the strait forward and easy multiplayer setup. You just click multiplayer, write name and password, and then all your friends can join easily. You become the admin, but the searver is hosted by the game creaters, so any pc can host. Especially joining through steam is perfected. Additionaly the game has recipies for everything, and these recepies are displayed clearly and smoothly. While also not cluttering the screen. Recipies are learned many different ways, by killing, looting, exploring or in case of the most esecial recipies; by creating the item one matirial tier further down, or in case of multiplayer, by having it in your inventory.(inc. someone else made it) The game is artisticly beutiful, especially the mobs are highly uniqe, original and interesting. The only lacking part of this game is an option menue inside the main menue. Having to host a personal world if order to create a EU character before joining a friends EU server. And finally: The lack of content. 4 friends all working together and rushing finishing the game, not bothering to gather extra rescourses or building more than a big shack. Can finish the game in 8 hours. 8 well spent hours.My advice, pick it for a LAN, host a server, get everyone on, and then GET the best extracter in the game.			"

ALSO stuff is really qquite logical in what materials are used to build what things and as for fuel for your forge and cooking, there is a ton more that makes a hell of a lot more sense such as burning leaves to refine stuff instead of just coal or wood.

I wan tto build awesome stuff, but i dig and dig and dig and i can't find enough resources! i dont' know how people have gotten THOUSANDS of resources to build these awesome buildings, so i lack the fun feeling of most sandbox's, and at the moment, with no boss's and nothing beyond flat out survival and exploration, there's no real reasont o play without creative mode. that all said, i do love teh game. the feeling of building is still quite fun, i enjoy the feeling of accomplishment you get from finding those hard to find items.

								I played during the free week and decided not to buy the game simply because it will eventually be F2P with an in-game store.  Right now, it costs money to play as a way to help fund the developers during Early Access.  It's already in a playable state with a lot of content, but it will get a lot better from the looks of things.  I recommend this game as a future endeavor and hope you will check it out when it's done.Creativerse is a Minecraft-inspired building block game with very similar gameplay mechanics but also vastly superior graphics and input support.  It is already a very stable game build with a lot of content to keep you busy.  The in-game store also looks promising with some unique recipes, redeemable codes, daily free coins, and building blueprints.  I also enjoyed the game's crafting system and unique monster designs.  It also helps that the world is not entirely voxel-based and has beautiful art.  I look forward to future content but will wait for the game to go free-to-play so I can play the full experience.			"

Mini Bosses that will show up on your radar with a Little White skull with crossbones Have pets be able to fight, quests given to the player by npcs, A story line on how you got here, add the abilty to change what you look like.

								Looks like a cute modern minecraft with better animations and much more interactive UI.It's actually a horror game. I can't stop shatting my pants. Some enemy is dangerous at day. Most is dangerous at night, but it's okay you are pro. But the mines! The mines are filled with deathtrapes and lurking AI waiting in the dark to rush you down! I remember the first time. I thought they can't climb through the 1x1 hole! Than I saw a blue light and fallen down. Soon I was surrended by eyes and horroristic morbid faces! I was running trying to fight, but they are much much stronger, faster and better.After that, each moment is a passing nightmare. Every ambient sound, every bit of growl! Is that my steps? OR IS IT THEIRS.I live on the top of the trees, with security, with traps and bombs attached to everything. But it's just not enough. You are NEVER SAFE.Good game though.			"

								As soon as I saw the amazing graphics for a blocky game, I said to myself, ""Ok they are a serious group people I guess"". Then, many things started to hook me like the deep and inspiring sountrack, great concept of creating worlds and making public (of course there is an option for a password), and the amount of things you can accomplish along with the surplus of variety of items in the world. But, the con is that it's a bit too much like Minecraft. However, I said that there was a suplus of items and by that I mean tenfold than MInecraft's items. So, overall I guess I'll give it a 9/10. Good job developer(s)!			"

								A lot of you will compare this game to Minecraft, so let me tell you a few things:1. It's not Minecraft.2. It's FREE.3. It's still in early alpha, so it will get even better.If those three reasons aren't enough for you to try this game, then you can stop reading and ignore this review.The graphics (texture detail) are really good. When I've tried Minecraft a couple of times before I always got a headache after a few hours, because of all the pixelated stuff going on there. It was hard to see and it was hard on the eyes. Even with mods that used 2x more detailed textures. This game is still a block/voxel based sandbox, but it's the first one that actually looks good. There are a lot of materials and resources, way more than your usual sandbox game. The crafting system is really cool and unique.The game is awesome. If you like sandbox games you should definitely buy this one... Oh wait, it's FREE!			"

								Likes:-Run's great at it's current state, even on a terrible computer like mine.-The crafting system requires you to make more components out of the materials you gather and takes time to make them to give a more realistic feel.Dislikes:-It's a MineCraft clone and doesn't even try to hide it. Clones don't usually have a lasting future.-It is pay to win and pay to play despite what the developer said in the Early Access information as you can pay for an advantage over other players and have to pay to unlock certain features.-You cannot play offline, you must have an internet connection to play this game.-According to the community the worlds are templates, not randomly generated.-The recipe system is nonsensical.-It becomes incredibly easy and waters down the experience after you make a huge coal/diamond farm (This is a feature the developer fully supports) and realize that you can obtain an infinite amount of water/tar,etc. (Unknown if the developer supports this but it's apparently existed for a very long time.)-To beat/tame any monster in the game, simply move around them.-You can tame creatures but they serve such little purpose which is gathering materials you could've just killed them for. You'd think that they would fight along side you at first.-You do not even need the strongest Mining Cell which is Lumite, the only purpose it serves is to gather corrupted water or Lava.-The tree's are massive and you have to manually destroy the leaves yourself or waste a fire potion, liquid lava, or start a bonfire to set it on fire. (Seriously, it's ridiculous how hard it is to start a fire in this game.)-Some items/blocks are completely worthless.The plot seems to be that you're just a child dumped onto a random planet for whatever reason with no interest in questioning why, getting revenge or even leaving the planet but you seem to be happy about the whole ordeal 100% of the time. You also seem to have access to some futuristic looking equipment but you gotta ask yourself why in the world you're running around with swords instead of space pistols and chunks of metallic armor instead of some kind of barrier.

								Creativerse is an interesting and well-made Minecraft-Clone.Similar enough, it takes place in a world full of cube-shaped objects. Including the trees, mountains and so on. You can explore the big land freely, change it to your liking and create everything you can imagine, turning the scenery into something completely different.It's a world without much gravity. Blocks and other stuff will stay in mid air when you remove everything around or below them. You will find a variety of creatures living in many different biomes. Some are friendly, others are hostile and will attack on sight. They are strangely persistant and will explore the area until they find their way towards you and can attack you.From the materials they drop upon defeat and the ones you gather on your journeys you can craft different qualities of armor and swords. No bows or such, but you can find some items to throw from safe distance. Snow balls, pinecones, bombs...Once you are done buildung your base and exploring the surface, you can go below. Very far below. The underworld has its own biomes, but they are below each other. Stalactite layer, lava layer, corruption layer. That's as far as I got. The overall difficulty is usually fair, but down there it can get very hard to survive and you will find yourself quite challenged. It's also a beautiful sight to explore all the new areas.Oh, you can also do all that with others. I guess it would be funny. I played it solo on a world I created for myself to freely explore everything and it kept me well entertained for over 40 hours. So if you feel like Minecraft could be interesting to you, but you don't want to spend money on it, give this free gem here a chance.One last thing: On the current state the game still has a few bugs. Don't expect anything perfect. Monsters will attack you from behind obstacles like doors and walls if you get to near. Jumping will rarely lift you off into the highs instead of just letting you jump. Prepare for a painful landing when that happens. It will also happen to enemies from time to time.			"

								A lovely game to fill in that Minecraft-shaped void in your heart! Creativerse has no greater objective and no major bosses to find. You simply exist to create and mine things as you please! It is in general very soothing to play (unless you're digging in the deepest layer, which is kinda dark) and, best of all, free! (Game is funded by optional microtransactions for special blocks and blueprints to make structures.) PROS: - Tons of blocks to decorate and build.- Different layers and biomes to explore.- Great graphics! sunshafts and high res textures. - Teleporting, so you don't have to walk back to places if you've built the teleporter. - Hotkeys can be changed! - Graphics can be lowered! - You can tame animals; farm them or just have them follow you around. - Great soundtrack! - Easy multiplayer! You can even keep it private by adding a password. - Friendly for people of all ages to play; very forgiving upon death. - the ability to claim chunks of land, lock chests/furnaces/extractors, and so on.- Rotate blocks with the 'R' key! -------EHH- Sometimes light sources glitch out and do not provide light; digging up blocks nearby fixes it, but it can get rather annoying, especially in the dark. - Pets set to follow do so very closely; they do NOT help in combat. - requires Wifi to play.- Lots of block variety can cause inventory to become very messy.-------Overall, very nice! Worth a shot to anyone looking for a block-y game or just wanting to kill time.  "

								Already loving this game! I'm not even a Minecraft fan, but this is just different. The worlds look great, and the game is super fun with friends. Take out the mining aspect of MC and replace it with more futuristic building. Using left click to use your glove and teleport materials to you, and right click to materialize the materials. The controls are perfect, even better than Minecraft. I honestly went into this expecting a ripoff, but found a game I enjoy way more than MC. There seems to be a lot of items to craft, and lots of enemies and animals to fight. The servers are also flawless. Took my brother not even a minute to search for my world, find it, and join in. You also start with 300 coins, so you can buy a nice building set to begin with, I got the Aztec temple looking set. Made an awesome base with tables, goblets, a throne, chests, torches, etc. I hope they add more to the character customization, though. Right now you can only change your hair and skin colour. I wish I could wear accessories and change my haircut. Anyway, I definitely recommend this game to anyone that wants a casual but fun game to pass time with pals. :)			"

								When you release Pro, you said that ""those who supported us"" will not end up losing what we have. Does that just include people who donated- or do you count people who have put money into purchases as well? It would seem a little unfair to those FTP's who have already bought things from you to lose any of the features we have. While Pro sounds cool (and would be worth the $20) if you plan to take away things from those of us who have bought bundles and things in the past before they purchase the Pro pack you will lose the ""cool update"" factor and likely a lot of players/fans to FTP's and Games like yours who were up front about a price tag before the players started.It's kind of like WOW where they claimed FTP but really cost money to play beyond a certain level and or certain areas without paying.What's the real story?

Early Access Review | May Be A TL;DR Review, You ChooseAs a fanatic of the hit title Minecr**t, I enjoy sandbox, voxel, RPG-esque, games. I figured I would try out Creativerse just for the giggles. Little did I know, or expect, that the game itself is being constantly updated w/ features that even novices can get in to. I fell deeply in love w/ the game's easy to use UI, it's easy to use crafting system, it's ""brief"" like tutorial system, it's hover to get a description"" deail pattern and it's addictability. Though I may not have a lot of hours, I haven't felt this feeling with crafting. building and powning my enemies, since an unformentioned ""Huge Update"" in Minecra**t. I enjoy building, crafting and defeating enemies again, over and over. This is what Minecra**t should strive to be, or beat, in terms of user friendly play and repeat value. I strongly suggest hopping on this bandwagon as soon as possible, so you can witness it's evolution and growth too!My Personal Opinions of the Title/Game | Pros vs ConsPROS: Extremely easy to use and friendly game, crafting, building, battle, interface. Well drawn art and details. Lower-End PC compatibility (Ggraphics card wise; make sure you meet the CPU minimum first). High replay value. User appealing items and gear. Interesting crafting sstem w/ recipes at the ready w/ upgrades. A plethora of materials, eneamies, worlds to share, social activities and more! Peaceful soundtrack and ambient background sounds. PvP ready. Custom worlds ready and editable. Amazing graphics.CONS: Takes forever to get what you need through advanced crafting (time based crafting system; nothing happens easily). Early Access is unpredictably long process and the updates are massive (takes a long time, at times, for the updates to download). Some Beginning Game enemies are too OP and need to be nerfed. Too easy to cheese enemies for , and gain materials. Not too much of a challenge, once you get a hang of the absolutes and controls. Things aren't things, until you're face to face w/ them (i.e. ""Insta-Death"") Limited Item Space on character's person.The RundownAll in all, the pros, IMO, outweigh the cons. So I believe this title/game is a must have for anyone who is looking for a visually stunnig, slightily challenging (when it comes to enemies), playful, fully socialy interactive, self sustaining, Minecr**t-esque, sanbox, voxel game. I believe this game will be going places, lots of places, in fact :3			"

								This game can be compared to Minecraft due to similar gameplay, but there are obvious differences. There are a vast amount of blocks and building materials, and blueprints are great for building large structures. Exploration is definitely something to do in this game. The caves are insane, there are tons of breathtaking biomes, and multiple underground layers allow for deep underground exploration as well. Also, the night sky is so beautiful in this game! There are so many unique, rare, and resource-loaded mobs that have varying levels of difficulty if you enjoy combat. One thing this game has that Minecraft doesn't is a pet system in which you can tame any animal you want and take care of it to obtain valuable resources. My favorite aspect though is the steady pace of gameplay. This means that starting out is not a complete grindfest but it also prevents the player from skipping really far ahead quickly, making it constantly engaging. Would definitely recommend playing this game with friends!			"

								A lovely game to fill in that Minecraft-shaped void in your heart! Creativerse has no greater objective and no major bosses to find. You simply exist to create and mine things as you please! It is in general very soothing to play (unless you're digging in the deepest layer, which is kinda dark) and, best of all, free! (Game is funded by optional microtransactions for special blocks and blueprints to make structures.) PROS: - Tons of blocks to decorate and build.- Different layers and biomes to explore.- Great graphics! sunshafts and high res textures. - Teleporting, so you don't have to walk back to places if you've built the teleporter. - Hotkeys can be changed! - Graphics can be lowered! - You can tame animals; farm them or just have them follow you around. - Great soundtrack! - Easy multiplayer! You can even keep it private by adding a password. - Friendly for people of all ages to play; very forgiving upon death. - the ability to claim chunks of land, lock chests/furnaces/extractors, and so on.- Rotate blocks with the 'R' key! -------EHH- Sometimes light sources glitch out and do not provide light; digging up blocks nearby fixes it, but it can get rather annoying, especially in the dark. - Pets set to follow do so very closely; they do NOT help in combat. - requires Wifi to play.- Lots of block variety can cause inventory to become very messy.-------Overall, very nice! Worth a shot to anyone looking for a block-y game or just wanting to kill time.  "

								Creativerse shares the sandbox genre with Minecraft.Most people will say it's a clone. I say let them. To each their own,right?Pros:- My potato pc can run the game just fine.- The graphics are really nice.- Updates about every 3 weeks.- Talkative devs who listen to the community.- Nice variety of blocks.Cons:- Servers are online only,which some people will probably dislike. I don't.Some players need to understand the difference between some things like F2P,P2P,P2W - and the recently added Creativerse Pro (which is a one-time price of 19€ or something,that allows for extra features that are,by most players,described as Pay to Win.)It contains the ability to make more than 1 world,a glider,a flashlight,additional world options,2x stamina and probably more stuff I can't remember.Do you like the genre? Try the game for yourself then. Enjoy!			"

I recommend this game to anyobody that would like a really fun and random world to explore. The game isn't complete yet but it's still awesome. That just shows how much this game is going to be when it comes out full. Play it or something cuz its cool.			"

								Great game if your looking for a sandbox game that isn't minecraft! easy to set up servers for yourself and friends also none of that coding marlarky! So easy and simple to do and to get to grips with it's also much easier to protect and less likely to have your account stolen...I find that creativerse is much more secure and safer as you can choose a password for your world and whether or not it's public. It's perfect for me highly recommended but buy the full version :D definetly worth it as it's a heck of a lot cheaper than minecraft which is £20. so happy days for a cheap yet effective game so far as I can see can't fault it :D It's worth getting a pro account as it's just so much simpler to add worlds for yourself or friends! There were other sandbox games before minecraft before everyone freaks out about it. Most sandbox building games will have a similar layout as it's the easiest one to create. And if your gunna complain still make one yourself! :D It is by far the easiest game where sandbox games are concerned and it is easier to protect your builds and worlds from grief.			"

								I honestly don't get the people who keep saying this is not a F2P anymore (you know, since the Pro Account update).IMHO, this IS still a F2P. And it's one of the best ""build 'n' scout"" survival F2Ps I've ever played.Pro upgrade only means ""add something useful yet not indispensable"".100% worth, especially with friends.			"

								I've had this game for over a week and didn't get the pro version like everyone else who bought the game before you guys came out with this huge update today. Me and my friend downloaded this game at the same time but he gets the pro version like everyone else but me. I'm not going to buy the pro version when I had the game before had and I would recommend this game to other people in which I have had two more of my friends  download the game before the update and they got the pro version as well. I'm upset about this and would like to get the pro version because I had the game before hand just like the others who downloaded the game before this update.			"

								This is an amazing game.  I can see everyone's dislike of the changes to the free play version.  There are some I don't like either, but $19.99 is not a bad price for the full version of the game. I've bought other games that were supposed to be complete for far more, and wished I hadn't. At least they don't charge a monthly charge like some other online games which I won't mention.  I would recommend this game to anyone wanting a free online game, with the opportunity to upgrage later. Obviously they are not finihed with the game. This is my opinion of the game and its changes. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. If people really don't like the changes, then they should contact the dev's and let them know, instead of dissing them on social media.			"

								Great sandbox game with easy to learn controls and mechanics. easy enough to farm resources and doesn't take too long to get what you need - although starting off is obviously slow to start as is every game. learn the blocks and craft your armour and weapons, build a fort and farm the creatures, start a farm of animals and veg then create your wonders of the world. start a community or explore servers to join one, the world is your oyster.

								Picking up this game, I thought that the mining animation could use a little love, but about 30 mins into it, I had managed to make a crafting station, a roof made of leaves, and then subsequently lit the roof on fire with the moss torches I placed inside my house for ambience. Thankfully, the walls, made of wood mind you, stayed strong. It was an exciting turn of events, I I enjoyed playing it.

								Why would you play this game?Creativerse is a multiplayer sandbox game, which in itself is nothing new.However, as you progress in the game, you unlock certain items of a higher tier and - in turn - will help you to gather better quality material and new tools.The players in this game are all in all very friendly and helpful. While I knew nothing about Creativerse in the beginning, a few friendly fellows explained to me the basicsand what I can do (thanks again! ;)).A few functions I dearly miss in other good sandbox games are included in this one: Taming monsters Blueprints Crafting Teleports (without installing plugins and such)And more...Sadly, while playing the game, a few minor bugs appeared:- when teleporting back to base, the surrounding doesn't load sometimes (invisible blocks)- (only with the bought Pro version) the glider glitches while flying slightly upwards with boost- while building a blueprint, the place where the firepits need to be have a graphic bug with the smokeBut all in all with Creativerse being an early access game: TOP! :)			"

But what puts it apart from Minecraft, you can have an infinite number of animals and you can name for free without a name tag that you have to make, all you need is a bell and some patience and survival skills and you can have infinite pets. That's the selling point, pets. I recommend this game 10/10 only do the animal parts though.			"

								Listen, many people are putting the thumbs down♥♥♥♥♥♥with this game due to it being "" a minecraft ripoff "" however just becuase it looks like minecraft or consists of blocks doesnt mean♥♥♥♥♥♥ i saw a dumbass say ""Its a rip off of minecraft down to the CODES"" what are you some ♥♥♥♥ing genius? you can see the codes of both games, well in fact it isnt dumbass and if it were thn the crafting, monsters, gameplay, and shapes would be the same however, you ♥♥♥♥ing minecraft degenerate, isnt. there are ♥♥♥♥ing curves 9isnt in minecraft) and the crafting is much more complicated. monsters arent the same and there arent the same items in this game tham minecraft. in fact i peronally think this is a better game than minecraft since it doesnt crash every ♥♥♥♥ing time i load it. also stop being a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and thinking you know everythin you eleven year old prick. this game is a very good, well managed game Although some glitches it is still a very nice game. i would however like to see differnt ame modes like minecraft and the ability to add plugins.and maybe make it easier to obtain better gear. but other than that a very good game.

								This game is fun and really allows me to not only expand my creativity, but it also helps me relax after a rough day. Only complaint I have is that most of the recipes you need to construct certain blueprints have to be found by defeating certain enemies or finding chests, and that takes almost too long. You could literally spend hours hunting down Keepas or opening chests and not find and of these recipes, you'll find them yes, but they are rare.			"

								I find this game just as addicting as Minecraft, from first glance you might think it's just another rip-off and as far as I can tell only on a basic level, mine stuf, kill stuff, mine stuff again BUT I feel it is a much better looknig game (Granted my PC is rubbish and I had to turn off a few features). I've only played an hour so far but I'm already hooked! One thing I will say though is the crafting.... after playing Minecraft for so long some of the items you need seem a little uneeded to make the item you want, but hey, that could just be meI would recommend you giving it a shot, even if it is just to say ""Nah, it's just another rip-off"" but either way I think I'm going to keep playing this game!

								I'm saddened by negative reviews. At first I was hesitant to try it out because of them, but I still played the free version and loved it so much I decided to support the devs and buy pro.I found out that the game used to allow free players to create more than 1 world and modify certain settings (which now can only be done with pro version). Now that it has been taken away, I can see why it angers so many. However, do notice that this game wasn't always free. After a while, they decided to make it free to play so more people could try it out. Those who bought it early on or spent even 5 dollars in the in-game store received pro for free with the R33 update. So I don't believe the devs are being unfair, they're simply finding out ways to make a profit for the hard work they put into this game. That being said, I would recommend trying the free version first, keeping in mind that it is still early access and that bugs are constantly being fixed. For some it works perfectly, for others it keeps crashing, so be sure to check the system requirements and adjust your game settings accordingly. I really believe it is worth a try. If you still don't want to buy the pro version, the game is completely playable without it. There are many things to explore and discover, and there are always ways to make the most of this game without having to buy it. For instance, if you want to build in many different worlds, ask your friends to play and each of you will have a world. You can join their worlds and they can join yours. You can also join public worlds and contribute to their community builds. In my opinion, part of this game's charm is playing with others.			"

								This game has a lot of potential, but it needs a lot of polish. Personally, the sensitivity for the mouse is a bit too high, so could you either add an option to lower it or just lower it in general? That's the only problem I have with this game, everything else is pretty cool.			"

								Looks like a cute modern minecraft with better animations and much more interactive UI.It's actually a horror game. I can't stop shatting my pants. Some enemy is dangerous at day. Most is dangerous at night, but it's okay you are pro. But the mines! The mines are filled with deathtrapes and lurking AI waiting in the dark to rush you down! I remember the first time. I thought they can't climb through the 1x1 hole! Than I saw a blue light and fallen down. Soon I was surrended by eyes and horroristic morbid faces! I was running trying to fight, but they are much much stronger, faster and better.After that, each moment is a passing nightmare. Every ambient sound, every bit of growl! Is that my steps? OR IS IT THEIRS.I live on the top of the trees, with security, with traps and bombs attached to everything. But it's just not enough. You are NEVER SAFE.Good game though.			"

								Pros:1.  Its Minecraft with good graphics.  The one reason I couldn't get into minecraft was the bleeding from my eyes it caused.  I also couldn't stand the faggy arm thing.2.  Good set of tools and craftables so far.  Took me forever to find out how to make twine however (hint...it comes from vines)3.  Lots of monsters so you don't feel alone even when you play alone.  Not a 'living' universe like No Man's Land will be, but much better than Barrens chat4.  Free.  Thank God for a free early access game (as they all should be instead of us paying to be their alpha testerrs!)Cons:1. The Melee Combat is faggy right now.  Not much too it...you just zerg what you want to kill and spam attack and hope you don't die but you will die alot.  No skill to it at all.  Don't try to dodge because you can't unless you get a mile away or stick the mob in a corner.2.  Has a store with 'p2lookcool' currency that I will never spend money on.  Sorry, cosmetics for a game like this just aren't cool enough.  Might as well go buy some flash cards for elementary kids so I can gawk at those graphics!3.  Character creation is limited  (generic really) between some typical male white kid I really don't want to be and some jailbait chick.  I picked the jailbait.  Give me a dark skinned person with an afro or asian or scandanavian or something.  Or just give me an afro at least.  *@$&.  Why does everything have to cater to Anglos/Caucassians?  That aside, there's nothing to improve the style of gameplay such as stats, perks, a level system, or ability boosts (which would be really cool for this type of game).4.   Fun for a while but it begins to feel like you're working a job after that.Final Verdict:  I reccommend since it is free!  Its fun and can be nice playing with others or by yourself.  Hopping from trees to collect beeswax is pretty cool and risky (since you die from falls).  Hopefully the game will improve its battle and character creation systems.			"

								If this game cost money i probably not recommend it because it is currently feel like a missed opportunity. What is done is well done and working, bugs are rare. Graphic and game mechanic is good. Yet it should offer more for people who like to explore and love confrontation in PvE. Crafting and finding a way to poses better armor and swords is absolutely a fun, but beyond that the rest is volunteer work, no need no pressure. You can grow things for fun and build things for fun, and buy blocks in the store for fun and be creative. If you decide to not, you will be just fine. If this game ever have survival stile gameplay I gladly play for it. Because not much alternative is around for those who seeking block based games with good graphic + RPG elements and loads of useful recipes + enemies + challenging combat and exploration etc. Yes, good mods are there for Minecraft yet the graphic and combat mechanic is SUX. The competition if there any really (other than 7 Day To Die) is not worth to mention yet, because most of them is under development and may never get finished, or pushed out incomplete. So i suggest to try out this beauty and experience it, and hope one day it turn out as a lovely game with good mod support.			"

								Great game, even without getting Pro, because you can still do everything. It has a good system for minig and crafting which is what you'll spend your time doing; the mining is a bit different due to the higher quality ores having to be mined with a device that is timed. It kind of wraps around a single block and works on that one ore while you go explore other things or craft. Crafting is similar to most of the systems already in use by other games of this type; gather, refine, and craft. You also use a type of gauntlet that you upgrade to gather ores that are deeper within the crust of the game world.You can buy plots of land with resources and you control what happens on the land. This is nice so that others don't come along and destroy what you have made. You can make it possible for others to warp to your specified location and you decide who can modify your area if you want a friends help.The monsters are basic at this point and so are the weapons you use; by basic I mean a small variety, limited actions, and predicable. The weapons you get are just the same melee weapon upgraded over and over. I really just want a ranged weapon.. upgrading the same weapon over and over is... meh I do like the game other than that though.			"

For an example, /give (name of item) (how many) (name of player), that would be great. If you could make a flashlight that us players could make to explore Caves and such, that would be amazing! I really like creativerse and I do recommend this game alot! I like that we can tame animals and such but if you could make the pets help you With fighting or mining like have some sepcial pets that do different things.

								When I first played this game, I expected a Minecraft clone but that is not the case. Creativerse is enjoyable and it allows you to create impressive builds or simply waste a few minutes (or hours in my case) of the day. Multiplayer is considerably better than single player imo: luckily, if you do have a single player world, friends can join easily as worlds are hosted externally. I look forward to the future of Creativerse.			"

								Let's not beat around the bush...Creativerse (C) is obviously inspired by Minecraft (M).  This review will compare the two games assuming that you are already familiar with M.  Although I haven't played C nearly as much as I've played M, I wanted to get my initial impressions written down.  I will update this review as I continue to play C.To be clear, I RECOMMEND the Free-to-Play version.  I DO NOT recommend the $20 Pro version at this time.PROS+ Improved art style makes the world much more attractive and vibrant+ Brilliant crafting system makes M's feel ancient, frustrating and obsolete+ Excellent quest, hint, mapping, and item-tracking system is very modern and fun+ Incredible Blueprint system makes building advanced structures a breeze+ Free-to-Play allows you to see almost everything without paying a dimeCONS- Mining is way too convoluted; must repeatedly craft harvesters for basics like coal and iron- Harvesting blocks takes way too long and can only be done ONE block at a time- Mobs, while unique, are bizarre and unintuitive (WHAT drops X item again?)- Can get confusing when transferring items between inventory, quickbar, and workshop/forge UI- Free-to-Play model (with non-refundable DLC ""unlock"" and microtransactions) seems greedy- Still feels shallow when compared to M (still in Early Access, however)			"

								Pros:1.  Its Minecraft with good graphics.  The one reason I couldn't get into minecraft was the bleeding from my eyes it caused.  I also couldn't stand the faggy arm thing.2.  Good set of tools and craftables so far.  Took me forever to find out how to make twine however (hint...it comes from vines)3.  Lots of monsters so you don't feel alone even when you play alone.  Not a 'living' universe like No Man's Land will be, but much better than Barrens chat4.  Free.  Thank God for a free early access game (as they all should be instead of us paying to be their alpha testerrs!)Cons:1. The Melee Combat is faggy right now.  Not much too it...you just zerg what you want to kill and spam attack and hope you don't die but you will die alot.  No skill to it at all.  Don't try to dodge because you can't unless you get a mile away or stick the mob in a corner.2.  Has a store with 'p2lookcool' currency that I will never spend money on.  Sorry, cosmetics for a game like this just aren't cool enough.  Might as well go buy some flash cards for elementary kids so I can gawk at those graphics!3.  Character creation is limited  (generic really) between some typical male white kid I really don't want to be and some jailbait chick.  I picked the jailbait.  Give me a dark skinned person with an afro or asian or scandanavian or something.  Or just give me an afro at least.  *@$&.  Why does everything have to cater to Anglos/Caucassians?  That aside, there's nothing to improve the style of gameplay such as stats, perks, a level system, or ability boosts (which would be really cool for this type of game).4.   Fun for a while but it begins to feel like you're working a job after that.Final Verdict:  I reccommend since it is free!  Its fun and can be nice playing with others or by yourself.  Hopping from trees to collect beeswax is pretty cool and risky (since you die from falls).  Hopefully the game will improve its battle and character creation systems.			"

								Great game, even without getting Pro, because you can still do everything. It has a good system for minig and crafting which is what you'll spend your time doing; the mining is a bit different due to the higher quality ores having to be mined with a device that is timed. It kind of wraps around a single block and works on that one ore while you go explore other things or craft. Crafting is similar to most of the systems already in use by other games of this type; gather, refine, and craft. You also use a type of gauntlet that you upgrade to gather ores that are deeper within the crust of the game world.You can buy plots of land with resources and you control what happens on the land. This is nice so that others don't come along and destroy what you have made. You can make it possible for others to warp to your specified location and you decide who can modify your area if you want a friends help.The monsters are basic at this point and so are the weapons you use; by basic I mean a small variety, limited actions, and predicable. The weapons you get are just the same melee weapon upgraded over and over. I really just want a ranged weapon.. upgrading the same weapon over and over is... meh I do like the game other than that though.			"

								Dear creators of creativerse! I think this game is great, but it might need something more. It could be cool if you would add some commands that you can write in the chat! For an example, /give (name of item) (how many) (name of player), that would be great. If you could make a flashlight that us players could make to explore Caves and such, that would be amazing! I really like creativerse and I do recommend this game alot! I like that we can tame animals and such but if you could make the pets help you With fighting or mining like have some sepcial pets that do different things. Thank you for making creativerse and keep doing the great work you have done.			"

Also I read a while back that magic, and maybe bows, should be a thing, but carrying around a bow while also holding magic and a sword, seems kinda OP, so maybe 1 or 2. I kinda wanna see you toy  with shields and Moving buildable, large boats or air bases, just think that'd be cool. And if You made skills, or even like a umm ""proficiency"" type thing, that'd be great. Well thats all I've got to say.GAME OVER "

Early Access Review
								I'll open with a bold statement: This game will probably be the Minecraft killer, but only if the developers allow the community to create content akin to the Minecraft community's. That's what separates the men from the boys in this genre, nowadays. The developers have done a great job taking what's good about the big sandbox games and mashing them into one. There's very obvious and heavy inspiration coming in from Terraria, but I feel like it's done better simply on merit of the fact that this type of game should be 3D. The character models are laughably bad, and it would be really nice if they'd add in an option to have the magic mining hand from the videos instead of the unsightly and cartoonish Hulk hand that we get in game. Monsters spawn way too frequently - I've had instances of six or seven of the same monster spawning all around me. It really makes me glad there isn't a creeper knockoff in this game, or else everything you try to accomplish would be blown apart as soon as night falls. Combat is atrocious and completely dominated by tossing bombs. I don't necessarily mind this, but the complexity and costliness of the sword recipes implied I'd be getting at least some use out of them. Armor is equally useless, partially because it does a poor job of preserving your health, but also partially because as I just mentioned, becoming a mad bomber is infinitely more effective. What you need to craft bombs comes from the easiest of enemies, so honestly, it almost feels like the devs just wanted to give you a sword just strong enough to one-shot passive mobs so that you can craft bombs to deal with their stronger, aggressive counterparts. Mining and building are fine, but somehow they feel... clunky is the only word I can think to describe it. Maybe it's because of how fast your base walking speed is, but it feels like you're constantly outpacing yourself both while mining and building, and it doesn't have the smooth, meticulous satisfaction factor that Minecraft has. Useful ores are extremely scarce, and the strange system of having to build an extractor to mine ore vs just taking it like any other block, while more realistic, really interrupts the flow. We've already accepted ""you have a magic gauntlet that teleports dirt, rocks, and virtually everything else to hammerspace"", there's no need to put the strange emphasis on realistic handling of raw materials. Possibly the best thing ever put into a game of this genre, however, are the excavators, which act like primed charges ready to literally take a chunk out of whatever you're near. Combined with the nifty rotation feature, you can landscape and mine at unmatched efficiency. Materials in general is another thing that really throws me off about Creativerse. The amount of stuff you can pick up is nearing infinite shelf tier. There's nothing wrong with variety, but past a certain point, it becomes too much. Not only can you mine a boatload of stuff, but everything seems to have a use. In theory, this is great - the player never feels like they're wasting time shoveling dirt or stone while trying to get to something important, but in practice, it makes crafting things a chore. Some recipes, like the Lumite mining gauntlet, ask for ridiculous ingredients (cactus flower, in this case), as if the developers just shoehorned some of this stuff into usefulness instead of just letting it be. Not only that, but there's so much in-between. Mined some diamond, now I have to go smelt this diamond into a diamond bar (let's not get into how silly that is), and for most recipes that use damond, I have to go process it even further. This holds true for almost every material in the game, and it really drags the experience through the mud. I'd feel more compelled to mine and craft and build if my inventory weren't constantly filled with situationally useful items and my house didn't have to be made of chests to accomdate everything. The current system turns you into a packrat, as until you've put 400 hours into the game and memorized every possible recipe, you feel like everything you pick up must have a use, and to reiterate a previous point, it probably does. The weirdest part of it all is how massive your inventory actually is and yet, it still ends up getting filled with garbage. Within minutes of a routine excursion, you'll find that three to five slots of your inventory is taken up with one or two blocks of unique materials that are functionally identical to one another. As it stands, there's just no real solution for this. There's just too much stuff in the game.Lastly, the world itself is interesting enough. There's a good spread of biome specific mobs, and a reasonable assortment of biomes. The fact that the temperature of the area affects blocks as well as the player is a nice touch, it shows an attention to detail that you normally just can't get from most games. The temperature of the area affecting the player would normally be a huge turn off for me, but Creativerse handles it nicely. The extra Corruption layer at the center of the world is a nice surprise, with a sort of ""last frontier"" feel. In the future, I'd love to see more done with it, to give players a few more reasons to visit other than ""this is where you find the 'best' mineral"".Simply put, Creativerse offers a lot, especially considering that it's free. It has some kinks and bugs to work out, some balancing to address, and the other pitfalls that come with games that are still firmly in beta, but it has potential. If you're call my opening statement, I believe it has a lot of potential, but that remains to be seen.			"

								Alright, listen, I use to have A LOT of faith in this game and I loved it especially with the devs listening to there players and adding new stuff every week or month. That is until they added the Pro pack to the game that got rid of ALL of my worlds that me and my freind had and ruined it for the both of us. The devs screwed up with this pro system, I get they need to make money, but dont take away half the game from us for it. Goodbye Creativerse, I will dearly miss you.			"

								look I recommend this game but give it more time its still early access but i dont recommend the creativers pro cuz it is sooo over priced just for custom world jetpack more inventory and flashlight . So if the publisher see this im gonna tell u that all these new thing they are not worth 20$ but maybe between 5$-10$			"

								i played it when it did not have pro in it and that was great i could create new worlds and i had 2 blueprients i lost dous and i never got the money back for them and this happend when a update happend i am not say that the game is bad it is great but i do not think you should have to get pro just to make new worldsi told one of my friends that you could make as many world as you want and you could do anything but now thats not not the truth.you can keep pro but don't make people have to pay for pro to make a new world.i hope you will chage the pro a bit so you can make unlimted worlds and i hope i can get my gold coins that i speat on the blueprients i lost but i do still recommend this game i just hope you change some things.

								Picking up this game, I thought that the mining animation could use a little love, but about 30 mins into it, I had managed to make a crafting station, a roof made of leaves, and then subsequently lit the roof on fire with the moss torches I placed inside my house for ambience. Thankfully, the walls, made of wood mind you, stayed strong. It was an exciting turn of events, I I enjoyed playing it. Might even get the full version if that happens to go on sale, but I am cheap.			"

								Great sandbox game with easy to learn controls and mechanics. easy enough to farm resources and doesn't take too long to get what you need - although starting off is obviously slow to start as is every game. learn the blocks and craft your armour and weapons, build a fort and farm the creatures, start a farm of animals and veg then create your wonders of the world. start a community or explore servers to join one, the world is your oyster.

								Fun game with lots of potential. I only just started checking it out and haven't gotten to far but one issue keeps bothering me. FIX THE FULLSCREEN.... Maybe it is just me but when I am fighting fullscreen the screen suddenly reverts to windowed mode and as I click to attack it starts dragging the window around... This keeps happening pretty much every time I fight making it really hard if not impossible to kill anything that fights back much.I have never had this happen with any other games so I assume it is something about the fullscreen mode.
