												In order to enjoy this game, you need to go in with an open mind and forget everything you know about Ace Combat. This is not an Ace Combat game. It's more like Call of Duty: Jet Fighter Edition. The story is pretty flat and is your typical 'Murrica vs terrorists plot. Also, make sure you turn off Flight Assist and change the control scheme to Original for the best experience.Most people complain about DFM (Dogfight Mode) being too on-rails, and for the most part, they're right. There are some targets (called TGT_LEAD) that require you to engage DFM and follow them through a semi-scripted segment of cinematic explosions and debris before you can do any damage to them. I don't care for this feature myself, but it's not a big deal and it's fun to watch. For normal targets though, it's much more dynamic, as you can play a game of cat and mouse by counter maneuvering each other in DFM, or you can choose to not use DFM at all. Personally, I think that DFM, while a tad repetitive, is quite exhilarating. The helicopter and gunner missions are pretty grueling and last longer than they should, but fortunately there's only a few of them. They can be fun and intense at times though, especially on higher difficulties.The multiplayer is where this game really shines, and now that the game is going on Steamworks, we should hopefully see more players. Capital Conquest is incredibly fun, and you can be a fighter, an attacker, or a helicopter and defend your HQ while capturing additional bases to spawn closer to the enemy's HQ. The aircraft are balanced so that fighters don't do much damage to ground targets, while attackers have an insane damage modifier against them, with the downside of being unable to engage DFM. Once your team captures the central control tower, you can go into ASM (Airstrike Mode) against the enemy's HQ as an attacker or multirole. You can attack the HQ directly without ASM but it's not as efficient, since ASM increases your reload speed. Helicopters are excellent for HQ defense since they can hover and shoot down incoming attackers. If you get 8 kills in a row, you can load up your PAK-FA with Trinity (tactical nuke) and decimate a wide area of ground targets. When your HQ's health bar gets low, someone on your team can make a desperate last ditch effort by launching in a B1 or B2 bomber and deal a large amount of damage to the enemy's HQ, but you better provide cover for him on his way there. There are tons of skills to unlock with points you earn from multiplayer, which include weapon damage boosts, improved homing missiles, increased armor, and improved maneuverability. All the skills are pretty balanced and none are too overpowered (except maybe Burst which maxes out defense, but it costs a lot of points and has a limited amount of uses).If you're thinking about getting this game, get it for the multiplayer, You can play multiple roles other than a fighter, and the dogfighting is more fun and less predictable since you won't be spending the whole round circling each other which ends up happening in most other multiplayer jet games.

												Just like the route taken by many other franchises in the past decade, Ace Combat Assault Horizon is, sadly, what happens when a Publisher/Developer decides to rise the finger towards their loyal fanbase, and tries their hardest to appeal to a different, more modern mainstream crowd.In the end and as a consequence, not only failing hard to get a piece of that pie, but losing the respect and support of those who were with them right from the beginning.The GoodOn the brightest side of things, there are twenty five different airplanes, three helicopters, and two bombers to chose from, each intricately modeled and textured, complete with beautiful, detailed cockpit views.While the graphics menus are an absolute joke (more on that later), I haven't ran into any problems what so ever, everything works as it should, the framerate is stable, the controls are responsive and there are no visible glitches or problematic bugs typical of bad ports...The BadIn an effort to not only simplify the game but make it more ""edgy n'cool"", the developers introduced a new mechanic  that goes by the name of Dog Fighting Mode (DFM for short), a mode that gets you close to the action, glues you to your enemy and takes literally up to about 90% of the control off of your hands, just so you may shoot him down with your suddenly increased aimbot like super accuracy.As a result, DFM is nothing but an on-rails, scripted, nauseating (boy, that zoom in/out camera/field of view) joke that takes you on a quest you cannot possibly fail; It requires absolutely no skill whatsoever, providing no fun a result. Such ain't ""optional"" either, since certain enemies can ONLY be taken down using said mode, and others can also glue themselves to you, forcing such mode on yourself....as if that wasn't bad enough, certain enemies will take you on a rather long scripted adventure (you'll notice those right away, they're bullet sponges) and can only be disposed of, once their fancy ""scripted"" event has come to an end.For the first time ever in the franchise, we're given the opportunity to take control of an Helicopter (in fact, tree of them); This is indeed a breath of fresh air in the game, but unfortunately its implementation leaves a lot to be desired.To start off, the shaky, in your face, zoomed in Third-Person camera, has got to be one of the worst I've experienced in a game, the levitating brick occupies almost three quarters of the screen and flies all over the place, making its best efforts to obstruct your view all the time;Thankfully, there is a cockpit view, and even that has the bad habit of shaking in an exaggerated manner and zooming in every time you lock your weapons on a target....now, as far as Helicopter gameplay goes, it could be described almost as a modern generic Third/First-Person Shooter (only clunkyer) and in the air, which consist off gunning down waves upon waves of ground forces who oppose no threat whatsoever (as in challenge), occasionally dodging a missile or two (it's laughable), and maybe, face off another chopper one on one; Oh, and you cannot crash it.Nothing too complicated... in fact, if you're expecting anything that requires even the slightest amount of thought, strategy and/or skill, you might want to look somewhere else...Be aware though!The game has the bad habit of taking the control off of your hands, constantly zooming into whatever goes boom;Trying a little bit to hard to make people go nuts over rad explosions, I guess...New to the series are too the Turret Sections, which consist of nothing but press right click for ""awesome"".Unfortunately, there are no unique and/or interesting mechanics to the big guns themselves, they don't overheat nor do they run out of ammo, rate of fire doesn't vary from turret to turret neither does the ammunition they consume......and as an effect, these sections come off as simplistic, stale, repetitive, and nothing more.It could be said they exist for the sole reason of instant gratification, and it wouldn't be too far of the truth, as challenge is kept to a bare minimum and all it resorts to, is: Everything you look at explodes and anything that hadn't exploded yet is inoffensive to your mighty immortality.Which brings me to......the Health Bar of old, which is nowhere to be seen, and there is a reason for such; Our friends at Namco, decided it'd be a good idea to borrow, amongst other things, one of the worst fads in gaming; The absolute ATROCITY that is regenerative health.Yes, that's right, Planes/Helicopters fix them selves (you'll notice a red screen displaying Critical, Heavy and Light Damage at times);But wait, this ain't over yet!If that wasn't ridiculous enough, our beautiful flying machines now bounce of the ground as if they're made of rubber.Together with ""Invincibility Mode"", such can be abused to no end......but boy, oh boy, there's more; Amongst other fads brought to the table, is the poor implementation of either intrusive Quick Time Events (QTEs for short), that serve no purpose other than breaking the flow of the game, or QTEs that don't even have an impact on anything (yes some can be ignored completely)!Some cutscenes are unskippable (thankfully those are very, very few and far in between), forcing you to ""take control"" of the camera, as in, moving the main character's head to look around, because apparently someone somewhere thought that'd be fun.To add insult to the injury, not only is our main villain the typical evil Russian guy (because 'Murica, I guess) he's also called Markov; Doesn't this ring a bell?Even the name is similar to an evil guy from a certain overly successful, yearly franchise that's been copied to the point of exhaustion for the past decade!...it might seem like I'm nitpicking by now, but it's blatantly obvious who or what this game has drawn inspiration (or should I say lack thereof) from, there's even a boring, uninspired AC130 mission thrown into the mix, and a long boring one at that (actually, most missions overstay their welcome)! Who finds this fun and why?The UglyWhile this game is properly optimized from my experience, the Graphic Settings menu is a joke, there are only four available options to ""tweak"", Antialiasing (can only be turned On or Off), Fullscreen, Vsync and Resolution. On a side note, while the PC version contains all the DLC included, don't even get me started on how ridiculous and overpriced they were on the console version, which used to charge from $4, up to $6 for individual Painting schemes and Aircraft (Not sure if it still does)!Boy have standards fallen low, uh?Final Verdict:Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a game that tries to hard to be the next big thing; Not only does it feel desperate, like a little kid yelling and screaming for attention, it also feels like a compilation of everything that is wrong with games, the industry nowadays and the mentality of those who Publish/Develop the games we used to know and love.Therefore, earning an abysmal rEvo's rating of 2.5/10I can't remember a single moment where I was enjoying myself; I felt suffocated in the middle of all of its ""edgy"" in your face exaggeration, mixed with boring, generic simplified gameplay mechanics...It felt cheap, it felt empty and it felt outdated... Outdated in the sense that the kind of game Assault Horizon is trying to be, has been copied and beaten to death multiple times in the past decade.It's just not its unique thing anymore, and as a result you'll find ""Assault Horizon's"" core, in any other  brown, cinematic (edgy), military (or not), linear, scripted, simplified, over budgeted, mediocre AAA (triple A) game out there...At the very least, the game's well programmed and functional, doesn't crash nor does it stutter around...

												Oh, Ace Combat, why did you have to do this to me?I'm a big fan of the series, it's always been a blast to play, and yes there were low times, but never so much as this. Now, i'm not saying that the game is 100% terrible, it DOES have it's pros, but it has many more cons. I'll list them below;Pros:-The plane flight mechanics feel tight and responsive, sure they're not realistic, but we're not playing Ace Combat for realism, are we? We're playing it for the fun of doing crazy air stunts and gunning down people along the way.-The sound design is nothing spectacular, but it does it's job. The guns and the music are serviceable. Now, the old Ace Combats had some great soundtracks with some spectacularly memorable pieces. DO NOT expect those here. But, at the same time, it's not terrible. - The planes, while not being the highest texture quality you've ever seen, are pretty damn sexy. As are some of the spark and explosion effects, it does feel good to gun down planes out of the sky and watch them burst into flames. Cons:- The dogfighting system. Now, this one just relies on how you feel about the system. The dogfighting system allows you to lock onto an enemy and kep on their tail while firing at them. Alternatively, enemies can also do this to you. It does allow for some pretty cinematic chases, but ultimately after about three times it's already gotten old. What it actually boils down to is this: Lock onto the enemy. Wiggle stick a bit. Fire. Move on. Find new target. Lock onto new target. Wiggle stick a bit. Fire. Move on. It makes the game just a million times easier and means that instead of having these amazing dogfights where you're doing all these crazy stunt mid air, it just means that you see an enemy...and now he's dead.Most of the time. In order to combat you doing this, the game suffers from the same artificial diffficulty that a lot of plane games suffer from, whereby your target will just perpetually fly away from you. Get an enemy into your line of sight, and all of a sudden they pull up. And up. And up. And then you pull up. And up. And up. And now you're just spinning a hundred times before you can lock him into your dogfighting system. No skill needed. The next thing that annoys me is that the enemies can also lock YOU into the DFS (dog fighting system). It seems like a good idea, having to escape them, but it just boils down to doing exactly what the enemies do to you! You're chasing someone for aaaages and then BAM you're taken right out of it, so what do you do? Pull up until you escape. Now you can continue to chase NOPE YOU'RE BACK IN IT WHOOAAA CRAZY RIGHT? PULL UP PULL UP okay we're free again, now to finally chase that NOOOOOOOPE I'M BACK ♥♥♥♥♥ES.-The helicopter missions. They're awful. You fly around a horribly controlled helicopter, gunning down floor enemies and the occasional helicopter. That's it. The heliocopter controls terribly, as i've mentioned, and the whole missions are just uninspired. Use these boring weapons and this boring helicopter and shoot some cars. Woo. Do that multiple times throughout the game.-The turret sequences. OH? WHAT'S THAT? YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE HELICOPTER SEQUENCES? ALRIGHT WELL TELL YA WHAT, HOW ABOUT WE TAKE OUT THE WHOLE FLYING THE HELICOPTER THING AND JUST GIVE YOU A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TURRET? Yeah, thanks developers. There's literally whole missions where you load in, and shoot a turret for about 20 minutes at some foot soldiers, and then move on. No variety, no challenge, no interest, nothing. Just point at people and click. You don't even get to move around on your own. Just point and click. Oh you wanna do something else? NOPE. POINT AND CLICK.-The voice acting. It's awful. There's not much to say except that everyone is just Mr Generic McGenericson or Mrs Genericson and her Generic babies. Maybe it's not even that bad, but seriously it's so generic that I think it dulled my senses.-The story. Spoilers, i guess, but hoestly just read any Tom Clancy novel and you've heard this story.  While the game is voiced by Mr Generic Genericson, the story was written by his superhero alter ego; JERRY GENERICMAN! American hero. He's the hero we need. Other people. They're the heroes we need. Terrorists have a bad plot to blow up some people! Quick; call America! Oh no, a Generic non-american bad guy who wants to do bad stuff. WE STOPPED HIM JUST IN TIME. BUT WILL YOU MAKE IT BACK IN ONE PIECE? Yes. Roll credits.-The AC130 missions. Just fancier disguised turret sections. Overall this game was a huge disappointment. Are you a huge fan of the series and you're just ACHING for more? Sure, pick it up on sale and just slog your way through it. Only have a slight interest? Just don't buy it. There are plenty of other plane games that you could get that are ultimately better.			"

												Ace Combat's first outing on PC is one of style, cool visuals, and horrible delivery. While the DFM mode adds a cool element of spectacular destruction, it wears out its welcome when it is literally forced onto the player in some sections. These kind of sequences aren't new and they can work well, like in the new Fallouts. However, there you voluntarily activate the sequence. Here, it's required in some portions. It literally becomes an on the rail shooter without warning and only serves to jar. But, the most damning and horrible shortcoming is the control interface: You're literally forced to use a gamepad lest you have to endure shoddy keyboard controls or even worse joystick control. The Joystick support is non-existent. This is unacceptable. Some say this is a game meant to be played on a gamepad and this just smacks of apologetics for laziness that has become so familiar within the industry. Even Tom Clancy's HAWX, which wasn't all that good, had a basic dead zone slider and that came out in 2009, this was early 2013. There's no excuse for this at all. Why can't someone with a joystick enjoy a game about flight? Why is the joystick suddenly a peripheral only for the hardcore flight sim? And why are people defending this lazy thinking as if spending money on a game were a privilege for them?In the end, this is a horrible game and for those seeking a good arcade flying experience would be better served with the original HAWX or, better still, going out and buying a PS2 with its trilogy of Ace Combats. Those games are superior in everyway to this pile of dung. If you're looking for a good arcadey experience on pc? Your regular flight sims can provide; just crank down the physic settings and difficulty. Wings of Prey is also another good choice for that when compared to this.Either way, this games is awful. Skip.			"

												Not the Ace Combat I remember from my good old Playstation days unfortunately. Good game? Maybe. Pros:+ Nice picture+ Not a bad soundtrack+ New game modes (bomber, heli)+ Has quite a few arcade elements from the previous games+ General idea of the ""chase"" is neat butCons:- Forcing people to use ""chase"" mode against VIP targets is just a big NO- Durability of said VIPs is ridiculous- Gameplay in general feels boring somehow. Didn't happen for the AC games I've seen before.- CoD-style missions on the transp. heli minigun- Nanites-covered aircraft which can fix up themselves during the flight given a bit of time. Only works for players.- Barrel roll on the attack helicopters- Unlike previous AC games this one is set on real life Earth which brings politics into play =/- Story and characters just don't make you feel for them. Or even remember them.As the game itself it's quite alright by the standards of modern gaming. But as AC game this one seems to fall flat on its face. As someone said this game is what happens when Michael Bay tries to make a flight sim.Feel free to try it during the sales time. It might appeal to you but I can't recommend this.			"

												As a long time fan of the Ace Combat series this game was a major disappointment. The new ""Dog fight mode"" looks cool for the first few times you use it but then you realise that all control is being taken away from you and that the dog fights are actually highly scripted. You'll activate dog fight mode and while you're chasing an enemy plane the game will make you fly through explosions and under collapsing buildings, it looks great but it's more like watching a cutscene than actual gameplay.For some reason Namco also decided to scrap the science fiction elements found in the older games so there are now no awesome boss fights against gigantic flying fortresses and the plot and cutscenes feel like they're ripped straight from a generic modern warfare shooter. The helicopter levels are terrible too and have awful controls.There's even a boss fight where you can't kill the boss untill the game decides you can, you'll shoot him a thousand times and it won't make a bit of difference because he only dies during a cutscene. That is some silly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Pick it up on the cheap or better yet, if you have a Playstation 2 or an older PS3 get Ace Combat 4, 5 and Ace Combat: The Belken War, they're awesome and very cheap. Or emulate them.4/10.			"

												If you never played Ace Combat before, you may like this game. Fans like me of the other games will pretty much be dissapointed in it. Both parties however will find the DFM or Dog Fight Mode novel at first, but after a while its extremely repettative and sometimes just broken, and the sad part is you need to use DFM on some planes so the fly by sequence can run its course to progress in the mission, these planes are basically invincible unless you use DFM. Some cool fictional planes make a reapearence as bonus content like the CFA-44 Nosveratu from Ace Combat Six, but the special missiles are sadly nerfed, and somewhat useless in DFM. Pros: -Better diologue then previous cheesy anime inspired diologue,-The B-2 Bomber mission is pretty cool.-Game gives you the ability to customize the color of your fighter.-Previous games planes when shot down would just fall to the earth, now they expload and fall appart with oil and shrapnel and bits going every which way.Cons: -Broken and repetative Dog Fight Mode which is pretty much forced on you.-Attack Helicopter Missions are clumsy, and theres a sad lack of gunships to unlock and choose from.-Helicopter Gunner missions are extremely irritating, luckily there is only two of them. (then why bother have them in there at all)-C-130 mission is just in there for the hell of it. -Game is pretty short, even on Ace Mode. -Cinamatic Swquences are intrusive and annoying.-The first half of the game has little replay value because of tutorial popups which cant be turned off. -Multiplayer could be good if there were more players (not really the developers fault, but still an unfortunet fact.)TL/DR: Mediocre Ace Combat experince, give us a PC port of Ace Combat 6 or Infinity instead please...

												I can't tell you how good (or bad) Assault Horizon is compared to previous Ace Combat titles because I never played any of them. As a newcomer to the series, I quite enjoyed my time with it.The graphics are good, except for ground textures, which are what you would expect from games of this genre – low-resolution and blurry. But there's a plenitude of 3D buildings, the jets and helicopters are well crafted, explosions look nice, and even characters don't look bad at all.Fighter jet gameplay is simple enough and shooting down enemies while in DFM (dog fight mode) is very satisfying. The only problem is that the HUD (heads-up display) can be a little intrusive, with too much information on screen. This can prove distracting at times, especially with the amount of dialog going on.Helicopters are absolutely dreadful to control, however. Luckily there are only a couple of helicopter missions in the campaign, and they're far between.As a side note, I might add that the game can be perfectly played with mouse and keyboard, but was clearly designed with a gamepad in mind.The story is utterly forgettable, but I reckon it is not the selling point of this game, so it can be safely ignored.The sound effects are decent. On the other hand, the soundtrack, while not bad per se, is very repetitive and does not go together well with the action.Lastly, multiplayer is fun, even if few people bother with it due to Games For Windows Live.Overall, a solid game.UPDATE: Since the writing of this review, Games For Windows Live has been patched out of the game.

												Let's get one thing straight.I have almost over 4,000 hours and 10,000+ sorties on this game on all 3 platforms combined.I know what I am talking about, thanks.This game's on sale right now as of Thanksgiving 2015, and I hope you'll read this review and take it to heart.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is Assault Horizon, NOT an Ace Combat game. This is 60 FPS Arcade Aerial Combat at its finest.Assault Horizon is a very under-rated videogame that was shunned by it's Ace Combat fanbase, worth it solely for the multiplayer experience.This was an experiment by Project Aces to solve the QAAM Spam from Ace Combat 6's Multiplayer.The game is niche, and Ace Combat players hate it for the DFM mechanic. I don't fault the Ace Combat players in that anything hurting their precious singleplayer experience is to be hated on immediately, but I can't blame them because DFM is so forced in the game that it hurts the overall feel of the game, but all you need is 1 playthrough. 3 max if you're 100%ing the game.If you're new to the game you'll see that the DFM mechanic is very forced in singleplayer, this is to prepare you for the main bread and butter of the game; Multiplayer. It's what Assault Horizon was built around, and it's a fine tuned experience.Unfortunately Multiplayer is deadish, only very few hardcore dedicated fans stick around, and the community is very small bringing in under 150ish aces platform wide, with about 15 of them being top tier, and about 5 out of that tier being active.I'd aliken AH to Quake in that skilled players online will dance circles around newbies, nobody wants to play when your only opponent is a guy that can beat you blindfolded, right? It's a game that's rewarding to master, and it shows.If you're looking to achievement hunt this game, get it and download a 100% save, then flesh out your achievements.If you're looking to buy this and play singleplayer hoping for JETS and AWESOMENESS, then pass it up. You'd be better watching a Youtube Let's play of it. Trust me, you're not losing much by missing out.If you want to play a 60 FPS arcade jetfighter game with some hard-core veterans, then download it and pop me a friend request. I'd be more than happy to play with you.			"

												☺ Varied Missions.☺ Good Controls.☹ Lacklustre Story.☹ Dull plane vs plane combat.(NOTE: This game was played with an XBox controller and only takes into consideration the Single Player portion of the game).Ace Combat Assault Horizon is an interesting attempt at making a more accessible Aerial Combat game, which, not helped by a lacklustre story, fails to get the blood pumping or really manages to keep you engaged. It's a very arcadey approach to the genre that often feels like its a compilation of the variety missions that appear in modern military shooter games, rather than its own game.The mission variety is very good, from dogfighting over cities in a selection of modern fighter jets and weaving an Apache Helicopter between buildings to providing air support from an AC-130 Spectre Gunship or a series of late night bombing runs; what's on offer is varied and has a nice pace to it, changing things up so you don't tire of the same thing again and again.The biggest let-down for me and my main reason for purchasing the game originally is the Dogfighting. Ace Combat Assault Horizon introduces a feature known as DFM, which is clearly an attempt to keep engagements fast and thrilling. The problem is, in most cases it feels like you've been strapped into a rollercoaster and been given some bread rolls to throw at the head of the person in the seat in front of you when ever you line up. Enemy planes can absorb a large amount of bullets and apart from a few non-essential targets, will quite happily shrug off direct missile hits - it just seems to lack impact or enough fidelity to get the blood pumping and tends to feel like you're chipping away at a health bar until the target explodes. This is made slightly worse if you decide to replay a mission and notice some essential targets are heavily scripted and fly the same paths along specific set pieces.The visuals do a good job although are nothing special, vehicles are decent, explosions look good, smoke trails don't look out of place and the quantity of modelled buildings rather than just a ground texture is nice to see.I played with an XBox Controller and the controls never caused frustration, the game certainly lends itself more to the arcadey approach than a Simulation.All in all, the mission variety on offer doesn't make up for the run of the mill story and disappointing combat. The games singleplayer clocks in at around seven hours with the ability to replay missions and I personally didn't experience the multiplayer, although I imagine with the removal of Games for Windows Live (Ace Combat Assault Horizon - Enhanced Edition now requires Steam only!) more people will be willing to give it a try.It's not a bad game and is indeed, well made - they just should have waited for a clear lock before firing this one off.

												I tried. I really did. But I hate this game. I tried looking at it as a generic spinoff, but it didn't work. The underlying game is just so god-awful. Even outside of non-optional DFM segments, I don't feel like I'm flying a jet at all. I'm just some amorphous blob of missiles spinning around in fart-circles. Ace Combat has always been arcade-y, but this game full-stride sprinted past the threshold of acceptability.The controls are slippery as all holy hell as if drag is completely nonexistant in this universe, gameplay is sacrificed in lieu of truely dreadful cinematic scripted events, furballs drag on and on and on and ON AND ON AND ON AND ON, and the story is incoherent and entirely inconsequential. Non TGT_LEAD units are dumb as a box of hair, whereas TGT_LEADS have infinite chaffs and cannot ever be killed at all. That is, until you engage them in DFM, in which case they happily fly in a straight line and will gladly take a million missiles up the ♥♥♥ for you, but not before giving you a wonderful tour of the GRITTY IN-YO-FACE CINEMATIC™ SCENERY first. Outside of that, any challenge at all comes from fighting with the controls to get them to do what you want them to do. I got this for 1 dollar and still regret it. The only pro is the soundtrack, and it still is easily one of Kobayashi's weakest scores.Please never make such a collosal ♥♥♥♥-up like this again, Project Aces. You're better than this. Good god.

												Well just like the title says, this game is no where near as fun as previous ace combat games. It's basically more of a action game than a flight simulator. It seems as if namco went away from the bread and butter of the series and went full Michael Bay on this edition. The game is also short compared to other games in the series such as ace combat 5.

												I've always been a HUGE Ace Combat fan. to this day, I hold that Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War is one of the best games I have ever played. But this.... wow. It was alarmingly clear that they looked towards Call of Duty for inspiration. let me explain.in every previous game, the story took place in a fictional world. on top of that, the protaganist was always the silent type and was never truly identified or shown, allowing you to more easily insert yourself into the story and get immersed.in this game, you play as American McCheeseburger who's been dreaming of his own death over the skies of miami. as you can imagine and predict, that's a spoiler for a portion of the last mission. to make everything worse, the entire game is PAINFULLY predictable, playing into the ""surprise! Russians are evil! SO ORIGINAL"" trope. The story involves every single war cliche you can think of. Russians are evil, you're a war veteran, the woman suddenly loves you at the end for some reason, your wingman takes a missile for you, the Russians have WMDs and attack D.C. with them, etc. it's so poorly thought through that it was truly difficult to care in the slightest about any of it.Most of the gameplay isn't... horrible, I guess? the DFM takes away 90% of the control you're given and they force it on you throughout the game. the entirety of the end of game is so horrifically scripted, but the dogfights between are fun and true to the original games. (assuming you never use DFM that is) my main complaint is that they simulate difficulty by having the AI straight up cheat. they can pull manuevers insanely faster than you ever can, they have unlimited flares with no cooldown for them, they can straight up ignore your cannon making them impossible to damage until the game says they can be.but the cardinal sin of it all is that they introduced regenerating health for your aircraft. this was never in any of the previous games. not having it forced you to return to base and think about what you're doing more carefully. in this, you can just avoid damage until your plane suddenly decides it's not broken anymore.At the end of it: Go play Ace Combat 5. you will VERY quickly see why the Ace Combat communtity shuns this game.

												The series has really gone off course with this one...Pros* Bombing is neatCons* Ridiculous anime skins for the planes* 4-5 hrs play to completion* Simple, cheesy, predictable plot* Planes practically fly themselves* Almost every takedown must be done through a straight-up junk dogfight mechanic where the only control you have is how close to the opponent you are and lining up your reticle* Dogfighting flight is extremely erratic, almost to the point of motion sickness...* Opponents with the red TGT tag, 9/10 have to be shot down with the gun in dogfight as they have infinite flares* Plane heals itself in flight, no more RTB* All planes fly very similar to each other within their category, bombers fly the same, fighters fly the same with the exception of the a-10 which feels very heavy (kudos) unless you are turning and braking, then it does a bat turn and whips on around* Apache missions are the same, same heli, go here kill things, then go here kill things, shoot down heli, then go across map to kill some things* Not a as wide variety of planes as previous versions* Multiplayer is crap, its a constant dogfight with other peopleThe cons are pretty much endlessAll in all, don't waste your time or money on this game. It wasn't worth the $60 when I got it and its not worth the $20 now. If you must spend your money on this series, at least get a game that will be worth it such as ace combat 4 or 5. I would recommend 'Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War'For what its worth,Raz			"

												I was a big fan of the original series of games on the Playstation and jumped at the chance to grab this when it was on offer. Big mistake. It bears little resemblance to the originals, the dogfight mode is utter garbage and takes away any skill required to try and gun enemy aces down. The helicopter mode is a joke, the control system for it is terribly thought out and trying to adjust the controls through the menu makes little difference.I cannot comment on the story as I have been deterred by the awful gameplay from playing through, but the cutscenes and dialogue are pretty impressive. I can't help but think that if they had spent less time polishing the cinematics and more time focusing on the game, it would've been less of a travesty.The series takes a nose dive here. Avoid.

												As a huge fan of all of the Ace Combat titles on the PS/2, this game was a HUGE LETDOWN. Flight controls are extremely limited, and worse yet they added a ""dog-fight"" feature that locks your plane into place to fire machine guns. So if you enjoy the ""flying"" element of aviation games, there's no fun to be had here.			"

												I generally avoid games with mixed reviews but in this case I'm glad I didn't, the game is nowhere near as bad as the reviews led me to believe. I went into this completely blind with no expectations, I played on normal difficulty using a controller. The campaign lasted me about 10-11 hours and I haven't tried Free Mode or Multiplayer yet. I don't like writing long reviews so I'll sum things up:Unlike previous Ace Combat games, Assault Horizon takes place in the real world and features a fairly large variety of missions putting you in different roles, ranging from a door gunner, to a helicopter pilot among others. (I HIGHLY recommend using first person view while using the helicopter). My only major gripe with the game however is Dog Fight Mode, it's actually not too bad most of the time, but the game forces you into using it on tgt_lead enemies to execute scripted events, you can't kill these enemies without DFM. All other enemies can be killed without it however.+Large mission variety+Many different aircraft to choose from, including a nice selection of paint schemes and missile types+Game looks great visually, lots of different environments- Scripted/forced DFM events- Story is fairly uninteresting			"

												An Ace Combat game that's completely on the rails. The only effective way to shoot down aircraft is through a dogfight mode which flies the aircraft for you, the movement is so erratic in this mode that it just gets annoying over time to try and focus the cursor over the enemy jet while it's doing 10g moves. Most of these dogfight sequences are heavily scripted with the enemy jet not blowing up until you pass through scenic explosions and carnage that wouldn't have happened otherwise and that's what bugs me the most. Sometimes planes can take 2 missiles and explode which is usually the fastest some standard jet planes can go down, but sometimes planes can also take up to 4-6 missile hits and a barrage of guns only to explode after we see some stylized collateral damage.The story is also uninspiring when compared to past Ace Combat games. Anything interesting in the plot could've been seen a mile away with as the game tries to hold your hand through its already weak plot.The game tries to make up for its lackluster gameplay by expanding on what you can do in the game: bombing and helicopter assaults. Helicopter missions are a bit weak while the bombing ones are actually interesting althought there is only a total of 1 bombing mission in the game.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game if you're a fan of the series or want to avoid an on the rails game.

												Hard to recommend but I like the game and enjoy playing it!Well after 4 hours I think that I am able to write a review. The story is about some bad guys who want to blew up the world and you have to stop them... but you do  not play games like these for an 'amazing' story right?You play it to blew things up... and by that I mean a lot of things! The best thing about that.. it is pretty fun!The game controlls are at the beginning a little bit clunky, but after a while you getting used to it and after setting things up in the input-config file to enable the mouse support things aren't that bad. (You should also create a 'NAMCO' Folder inside your documents, otherwise the game won't save any settings!)Flying and fighting in a plane makes a lot of fun and it is pretty hard to fail. While blewing things up the soundtrack keeps pushing you so motivation shouldn't be a problem.Edit: The helicopter missions are annoying but there are luckily there aren't much of them & Missions are take a little bit too much time..The graphics are for a PC Port. pretty good. (No eye-candy but therefore exist other games right?)I recommend to get this game during a sale for 5€ or 5$ or whatever currency you are using.Review may change in details while I continue the game.

												If you enjoyed the previous Ace Combat titles, you may not like this one. For me, there are way too many on-rails gameplay forced on you - especially Dogfight Mode (DFM). Essentially you follow the tail of an enemy jet doing crazy unrealistic maneuvers but you don't even have to control anything except fire missiles and guns. Well you do have to control turning the aircraft a little bit (BUT most of aircraft flying control is automated in DFM).  In fact, certain required targets, those marked TGT_LEAD, can only be destroyed by initiating the on-rails experience of DFM. They tried to make this game too cinematic like Call of Duty and the DFM is very cinematic but repetitive.I liked how they added helicopter Apache missions, a bomber (B-2 Spirit or B-1 Lancer) mission, a AC-130 gunner mission and transport heli gunner missions. However, there were not enough jet missions and jet mission variety (especially when compared to older Ace Combat games).Never played multiplayer because it is dead and found zero online games to join (on a Sunday afternoon) . I didn't bother trying the online Co-op.Air Strike Mode (ASM) is at times required throughout the game, and it's kind of like on-rails bombing gameplay. Fortunately it's only forced on you a few times and most of the time it's optional. It's not overly done so it doesn't feel repetitive.All in all, they added many new features to this game, but I think most of them made the game worse.			"

												In Ace Combat Assault Horizon you will take on the role of a handful of characters that fight for a joint-NATO Russian military working to put an end to a steady growing rebellion. As you fight your way through a surprisingly large amount of missions, the reliability in your allies come into question and will shape the direction of the war you find yourself in. Playing primarily as Lt Colonel William Bishop or “Warwolf 1”, you’ll fly alongside your Warwolf squadron as they race against the clock to prevent nuclear weapons from reaching The United States.Assault Horizon hits the ground running with fast paced combat and intense dogfighting engagements, however, it forgot to tie its shoes and winds up tripping down a set of stairs for longer than you’d probably care to watch. A very notable and important piece of information is that Assault Horizon is not a simulation (despite being tagged as such), it as an arcade shooter and shouldn’t be penalized for not following suit with other Ace Combat games. With that being said, I don’t think simulation like controls and gameplay could save it anyways. So what does Ace Combat do well? For starters, it’s fun. Assault Horizon is simple, you shoot baddies for ten minutes and then you move onto the next mission. No real depth or complexity in it’s gameplay, you fly a wide variety of jets and bombers, destroy a handful of vehicles like bad jets and mean bombers, artillery trucks and large naval vessels. Explosions and action sequences fill some destructive void in the heart of us all that’s craving can only be quenched with blowing things up. Dog fighting mechanics include a feature called DFM that hones in on your enemies allowing you to achieve a solid lock on your target, or get more up close and personal to fire your main guns. It also includes evasive maneuvers that require a fair amount of timing to avoid rockets and enemy missile locks.After about 30 minutes of the aforementioned void filling, ACAH begins it’s descent into boredom. Controls are slow and cumbersome, so a gamepad controller of some kind would be highly recommended. Even on a controller, flying each jet feels more like flying a really fast kite, hard to handle, at times almost guide themselves, and aiming outside of DFM is about as difficult as flying said kite in your living room. The only responsive aspects to Assault Horizon are the missiles which are arguably the only effective tool at your disposal. This formula drags on for a good five hours, missile the hell out of everything, complete the mission, rinse and repeat.Graphics are neither here nor there. Landscapes, vehicles, and visual effects exceeded my expectations, however the cutscenes are laughably mediocre. Bishop looks like Robbie Rotten, your wingman looks like a muscular thumb-hotdog conglomeration, and D-Ray the helicopter pilot’s helmet does a good job at hiding his cone shaped skull. In combat, view options are as follows: Cockpit that has no depth whatsoever, nose of the jet (fair), and a third person camera that’s two inches away from being entirely inside the jet engine itself. An FOV slider may have made up for some of that but the only graphic options are Resolution and Anti-Aliasing [On/Off]. Sound effects are up to par, and light years ahead of the dialogue, which consists of questionable military lingo and Bishop exclaiming “Damn!” So much so that you’d be sent to the hospital if you  based a drinking game around it, and you’d still fly about as well as I did sober. At one point the President comes over the radio and gives a speech in some awkward attempt at boosting moral and inciting patriotism, for a moment it felt like Independance Day. That alone almost gave me hope that Assault Horizon would make some triumphant come back in terms of storytelling. (There were no aliens. This is not Independance Day. Damn!)The lack of technical depth in each mission offers little to go back to in terms of replay value. While they present a unique atmosphere each mission, the only reason to go back is for achievements, earning a higher score (if that’s what you’re into), or filling that explosive deprived void. Sadly my few attempts at connecting to a multiplayer session were futile (Damn!), though I had low expectations of finding a game regardless.Ace Combat Assault Horizon is fun and nothing more. For a $0.33(.3333333) game on Humble Bundle I can say that I got my money’s worth of enjoyment out of it. However, the combination of poor graphics, eye-roll inducing dialogue, and shallow gameplay mechanics don’t make up for it’s mediocre attempt at building a memorable experience. Damn!			"

												You know this was the first Ace Combat written by western people when the plot has no sense, its the most patriotic thing ever done in a videogame, based on the real world (not on Strangereal) and the second mission is a motherfugging TURRET SECTIONTo add to the injury the DFM is overused and it seems that they forgot to add the ""homing"" to the missiles.Overall its fun yet repetive, great visuals and the OST its okayish but the cons outweight the pros by a landslide.Not recommended for full price, consider this game a spinoff of the main seriesTurretsection/10			"

												Many people have heard of the Ace Combat flight arcade games, and hundreds of thousands of players around the globe are fans of the series. However, Assault Horizon was an anomaly. The game's producer, Kazutoki Kono, saw fit to try a different formula for the series, and the results were varied. I'm going to attempt an honest review with little bias from the rest of the Ace Combat series. First things first, imagine this game didn't have the ""Ace Combat"" name in front. Because it's not a part of the series at all. Got it? Alright.Story: The game's story is tightly integrated with the missions, allowing for a smooth transition and preventing the player from getting lost (although it can definitely be intrusive at points). You are flying as Colonel William Bishop, a renowned fighter pilot, for Task Force 108, a multi-national task force including units from the United States, Russia, and even France. The plot is centered around Colonel Andrei Markov and his personal vendetta for revenge against the United States, as well as a rebel uprising within Russia.Yeah, it's not anything we haven't heard before. If you've played any modern warfare shooter released in the last 5-8 years, you basically got it all. What it does do, however, is give us varied characters. To be quite honest, I loved flying alongside Russian and French pilots - they actually seemed more interesting to hear over the radio than your own American squadmates. But other than that, character interaction is really cringe-worthy and there isn't much development to speak of.Graphics: Holy. Crap. Yeah, they're not the most beautiful thing, but Assault Horizon in 1080p at 60fps on PC, or higher, is probably the greatest thing to happen from Project Aces until Ace Combat 7. The aircraft are all gorgeous, with fully-modeled cockpits and animated control surfaces. Explosions are a little Michael Bay-esque, but something I will never get sick of is seeing an enemy aircraft shatter to pieces from a charged missile hit or the individual holes I create with the machine gun. The level of detail in the environment completely sucks at close-up views, but in general the game is so great to look at.Gameplay: Obviously the meat of the game. Fair warning, I play on ""Original"" controls, which emulates ""Normal"" in older Ace Combat games. The game is set by default to ""Optimum"", which emulates ""Novice"" in the older games and makes the game a lot easier (or a lot harder, depending on your playstyle). So if you have the game and it's not controlling the way you think it should be, take a look at the control setting and see if it's this you gotta look at.Assault Horizon's gameplay is pretty great at its best times, but really flawed at its worst. Everyone by now is aware of Dogfight Mode (DFM), which allows you to initiate a close-range chase sequence between you and one enemy aircraft. Guns are more accurate and missiles can be charged for insane accuracy and damage, but you run the risk of the enemy aircraft performing a counter-maneuver to get behind you. A lot of people claim that this is an on-rails sequence, but for the most part that isn't the case. The player still has complete control of their aircraft and must stay locked on with the enemy to keep this sequence going.Playing with fighter aircraft is the core of the game, and it works. You can still dogfight without DFM, but DFM is unfortunately required for some boss-type enemies - these guys have plot armor and are set up to give you a cinematic experience with additional dialog, you know the drill. It definitely retracts from gameplay a little too much, especially when the game cuts away from your aircraft to give you a cinematic close-up of the aircraft being destroyed. I stated before that I loved seeing this, but not in the middle of a big dogfight with tons of other units firing on me.Assault Horizon also introduces, for the first time, gameplay with bombers, helicopters, and a gunship to the series. However, I listed them in order from best to worst. Bombers are pretty fun to fly due to their unique weight and power, and you get to perform a strafing run with dozens of bombs at your disposal in the unfortunately single mission you get to have them. Helicopters, however, are really difficult to control and the missions designed for them are really poor - they're insanely difficult and seem to be aimed at shooting you down unless you follow a specific path. The gunship is the worst - anyone who's played an AC-130 mission in other shooters are sick of these already. The (thankfully only) one mission designed for it is enough to fit into the horror genre given its difficulty in the number of SAMs and AA guns that are trying to shoot you down. There's also two missions that are on-rails shooter sequences using a Black Hawk's machine gun, and they definitely overstay their welcome in terms of time.There are also a few glitches you may encounter, such as enemy aircraft flying through the ground (this has been a common bug in the entire Ace Combat series) or cutting away from DFM at insane angles that you can't follow. But for the most part, thankfully the fighter/multirole missions are the core of the game and they do work, just with a few rough edges for sure.Other: By the way, I didn't mention music or sound effects. These are gorgeous, and everyone on the Assault Horizon OST, from Rio Hamamoto to Hiroshi Okubo to Keiki Kobayashi and more, deserve insane credit. Also, be advised that there are two glaring bugs that no one has fixed since GFWL was removed: you can't rename aircraft skins or skill sets, and trying to access the leaderboards crashes the game. Additionally, the game will definitely tax on the processor for some computers. On an older machine, I couldn't run AH in tandem with a Skype call since it would lag every now and then. These are definitely minor things, though.Summary: Assault Horizon is definitely a flawed game but, for the most part in my opinion, it works. There are some things I didn't mention, like multiplayer (which is dead) and Air Strike Mode (which works just fine). I own the game on the PS3 and paid $60 for it, and I don't regret that at all because I felt it was worth it. Most won't, but the Steam version costs $20 when it's not on sale, and it goes on sale for $5 or less every now and then. So, for $20, I think it's worth a try. For $5 or less, though, it's definitely worth it. Just remember, this ain't Ace Combat, bro.			"

												If you buy this, do NOT buy this expecting a traditional Ace Combat experience, instead buy it expecting a blockbuster action experience similar to Call Of Duty in the means that it has some on-rails gameplay and deviates from the gameplay that is known for the rest of the series.What's changed?Alot! I went into this seeing the mixed reviews and I expected alot of change but didn't know what... for starters, the game is very story driven, there are Metal Gear-esque cut-scenes at the bunker, quick time events during combat, helicopters missions and infared bombing missions. It's strange to see Ace Combat goes this route. The music is no longer Steve Vai/Joe Satriani stuff but is that orchestral moody stuff you'd expect to hear while playing something like God Of War.Alot annoyed me at first but the gameplay is addicting as ever!The multiplayer stil functions and is acrually pretty awesome.It's okay, I like RaidersSphere4th better but this was passable after getting used to the changes. If this didn't have the name ""Ace Combat"", it would have recieved much better reviews from the player base. It's not bad, it just does things differently.			"

												Either you like it or not, Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a decently good game.For the fighter jet missions, Beautiful graphics, The fast paced in-your-face dogfighting combat is fun and makes you feel bada$$! Awesome soundtrack, definitely not dissapointed!  It's a really fun game when you look at all the action alone and stuff. DFM (DogFightMode) mode is fun, but a bit OP, as all you have to do is lock in DFM and fire missiles. ASM (AirStrikeMode) is difficult, and you have to align the plane to face the targets to shoot them down with the machine gun if your missiles don't recharge fast enough. Personally I thought ASM is a bit dissapointing.The helicopter missions are a bit ehh, slower paced and can be a bit boring as your objectives are to cover the ground allies and shoot down cars and other helicopters. Guess how you dodge a missile in a helicopter? By doing a full sideflip lol. The helicopter missions are the ones I don't really enjoy that much to be honest. The angle isnt the best on 3rd person, so I suggest 1st.  The helicopter door-gunner missions are also slower paced and can be a bit boring. Kinda laid-back gameplay. Also for the door-gunner mission, the camera is behind the soldier, which makes looking out a bit difficult.The objectives for the game is mostly: Cover you allies, Destroy enemies ASAP etc etc. If you do not do it in time, you will fail the mission. Also, the concept is the typical Americans vs Russian storyline, nothing too special.Overall:Pros:Awesome Soundtrack,Nice Graphics and fast gameplay is exciting.Flying and fighting jets is pretty fun.Impressive fighter jet gameplay.DFM mode is actually alright.Cons: Helicopter and Door-gunner missions are a bit staleBad Angle for Door-gunner missions.Helicopter missions can get boring.Mostly same objectives.ASM mode is a bit difficult.Stale storyline.I would give this game a 6.5/10.So is it worth it???? For 20 bucks, No.On sale for 5 bucks, Yes. Could be like 4 or 3 bucks tho.			"

I'm playing the series since Ace Comabt 3: Electrosphere for tthe PS1 and I felt highly disappointed by the gameplay mechanics choices that have been made for Assault Horizon, completely discarding the provebial ""bread & butter"" of the series. To be more specific: they cut down the simulation in exchance for action, which didn't worked out well enough, as it seems that the simulation is much less realistic than the preveious games, despite the surreal and fictional weapons from the previous ones. I won't go down in more details since I've alreay expressed them on my angry rant above, which I am sorry if I offended someone or sounded threatening. I just couldn't hold my emotional outrburst.If you're a fan of modern action and casual (and rather silly) games, I recommend it. Give it a try and you might enjoy it.For hardcore Ace Combat fans like me, I probably don't have to say anything else.Best wishes.			"

												2/10Looks pretty, but throws everything that made the AC series great out the window in favor of forcing you into a QTE to shoot down every single plane.And there are a lot of them.Prepare for 45 minute missions to shoot downa handfull of aircraftMarvel as you watch your plane magically repair itself mid fligh!Stare astonished as that common fighter plane dodges your locked missile for the 20th time, forcing you into the half minute-minute long QTE to shoot it down!Laugh with glee as the Strangereal setting and plot(s) are tossed aside in favor of the real world with a typical summer block buster plot of evil Russians!Regret spending $5 on it during the sale and go back to playing AC Infinity!

												this game is nothing like to original games.   if you loved the original ace combat games and your looking to enjoy those games again. just hook up your PS2... It hurts me to say it but.. This games is nothing like the ""shattered skies"" ""Balkan war"" or ""Unsung war"" we soo loved.  They tried to modernize it and really hurt the legacy.  "

												If this is the ""worst"" game in the series, then the rest of the series must be pretty damn good. As a non-Ace Combat player. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Get it on sale, because although it's a rather good game, $19.99 is not justifiable. The first mission is basically how air combat works, if you don't like it. You should be able to ask Steam for a refund as long as you haven't played 2 hoursAssault Horizon is rather ""fast-paced"" and plays more like a Michael Bay movie.Gameplay: DFM (Dog Fight Mode) is how you're going to take down most hostiles, if you have slow reflexes, this game is not for you. This is the deal breaker for most fans, but since I was new, it didn't affect me that much. It may get a bit repetitive and frustrating if you aren't quick enough. Also, lots of missions REQUIRE you to initiate DFM in order to progress (Ex: You need to initiate DFM with a target leader and then you'll chase an enemy under a bridge or something)ASM (Air Strike Mode) is how you're going to attack ground targets, same thing with DFM, it can get frustrating at times. Also: Two Missions require you to be a Door Gunner of a Blackhawk. Two are taking control of an AH-64. One is flying a bomber. One is flying an AC-130. Rest are flying planes Music: Eargasm, Keiki Kobayashi did an excellent job with the soundtrackStory/Campaign: Nothing new, more Russian terrorists, does a good job with the setting thoughMultiplayer: Basically deserted, next to impossible to find a game unless you're with friendsRealism: 404 not foundMisc: You can also practice your foreign languages. There are six audio languages (English, French, German, Japanese, Italian, and Spanish) and Nine Subtitle languages (English, French, German, Japanese, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Polish, Russian)TL;DR Action Plane shooter. 8/10Again, the first few missions are basically how the rest of the campaign goes, so if you don't like it. You should be able to ask steam for a refund. (As long as you haven't played 2 hours)			"

												If your a fan of the traditional Ace Combat games, stay away from this Quick Time Event masquerating as an Ace Combat game. But if your coming from the outside i'll list some of the main gameplay points and how it plays out.The DogFight Mode is the new feature in the serise that prides itself on close quarters air to air combat. The sad thing about it is most of the time it is clunky and annoying and sadly the only way you can take down most air targets. If the targeted aircraft in the Dog Fight Mode is one of the many scripted QTE's you cant take it down until it gets to the point where the it becomes some planned out a gigantic Micheal Bay esque chase scene or explosion, sometimes if you take out the target to early or to late in the event it will slam you into the ground or a building because of the location of the QTE causing either massive damage or mission loss. Also there are many counter manuvers in DFM like slowing down and fliping over the aircraft behind you and then entering DFM behind them, which is the easiest and most damaging coarse of action. Or you can speed up and franticly speed around in the oppisite directions of the engagement circle. Which isn't terrible, but much less rewarding than doing the flip like counter manuver of speeding down. DFM makes up most of the Fighter/Multirole missions so after about the second mission it just feels so tedious going in and out and in and out of dogfight mode and doing the flip or speeding to either direction of the engagement circle.Also Fighter/Multirole flying only accounts for only half the game, where the rest is filled by either flying an Attack Chopper, being a UH-60 gunner, a AC-130 gunner or flying a B-2 or B-1 PilotFrom most fun to most annoying, it would go from in my preference: B-2 or B-1 Pilot, Attack Chopper Pilot, UH-60 gunner and then the AC-130. But im just grasping at straws because they're all poorly planned at mostpoints, dont get me wrong they can be fun at points, its just every time i've seen it demonstrated in other games (CoD (AC-130), Battlefield(Attack Helo)) its done way better. But i digress, the bombers and the Attack chopper are really the only things that let you control your fate because you have the power of maneuvering and firing in the area where you destroy targets. The UH-60 gunner and AC-130 gunner are on rails 100% and sometimes your getting hit by missles or gunfire from enemies that have either just spawned and instantly start firing or are totally out of your viewing area. For the AC-130 portions, if you've played call of duty you'll feel mostly accustomed to the mechanics. The major downside is the poorly placed AA missle spawns that sometimes are out of your viewing area. For the UH-60 gunner the gun never overheats (which isn't a complaint)so its just holding the fire button and point and shooting all of the ground targets, though like the AC-130 missions you sometimes have enemys outside the viewing area and are getting hit by things you can control. For the Bomber and Chopper portions manuverability comes at a cost of sometimes way to many enemys on the screen, from helping allys to being tageted by surface to air missles your time is spent going from point to point killing scripted enemy spawns, doing impossible flips (in the Chopper no less) and dodging god knows what so you can just get to the checkpoint.And now we come to the plot. Most people that have played an Ace Combat title before this one has been spoiled by good story telling and great mission structure. I can see if this was someones first Ace Combat title they would enjoy this story, it has everything you could want from a modern day war story. It has the rebels with WMD's and and the heros trying ther darndest to stop them and a tincey bit of mystery. Though at some points its just rediculous and thats saying alot for an Ace Combat fan. From DogFighting in a CAT-5 hurricane to being hit by a nearby WMD and basically sleeping it off, it really stretches the imagination at somepoints since this is supposde to be the most ""real"" story of the franchise. The characters can be very cliche, have little depth and just overall bland. If your a fan of the traditional american warstory than this ones for you.To wrap it up, this is hands down the worst ace combat. Though, if your coming from the outside it may be a taste of what the franchise has to offer, the Fighter portions are what make up ALL the Ace Combats besides this one and DO NOT feature the dogfight mode. The bomber portions were something that had never been tested in an Ace Combat before and were actually a breath of fresh air in this game with sticking to the oldschool Ace Combat formula of free range of flight and bomb placement, and they actually work pretty well with the traditional Ace Combat mechanics so they were patched in the F2P game (Ace Combat Infinity) on the PS3 and transitioned very well. The Chopper gunner missions are just way to on rails for them to be enjoyable and consist soley on the scripted spawn enemys. The Attack Helicopter missions are fun at times but erratic enemy placement can spoil the fun. And with the AC-130 missions, they can be fun like the Call of Duty missions but ultimatley fail at the always on rails premis and lack of target visibility. For the Fighter/Multirole portions there are many times where i'm enjoying myself, but then i realise the target im trying to attack can only be killed once i go into DFM and kill 3 other targets that sprout out of the ground.If you can get this game for the price i did $1.00 its atleast worth a shot, cause really any AAA title for a dollar is somewhat worth it. But the full price of $20.00 or $10.00 is just robbery,for an Ace Combat Fan. If your looking to wet your beak, give it a try you may end up liking it. I and many other people were just spoiled by the old classics on the PS2. If you end up liking this game and want more, i beg you to try out the original trilogy of AC4, 5 and 0 they're classics and offer way more missions, planes and story than Ace Combat: Assault Horizon			"

												I was expecting something like Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere, which I loved on PS1, mostly for its futuristic desings and cool missions. But instead this game is like Call of Duty about pilots, with cut-scenes all the way, about some military conflict in the Middle East, seen that, been there. Boring helicopter-gunner mission included. Although this game has some cool dogfights and pretty good effects, it is a dissapointment for me.P.S. ♥♥♥♥ GFWL			"

												This is the cancer that is killing the video game industry.Granted, I came expecting an arcade flight sim experience much like Ace Combat 2, 3, 4 and 5. Instead I found an overly and extremely casualized flight sim, if you can even call it a flight sim, full of QTEs and basically a ""dogfighting minigame"". Whereas in previous games you actually had to outmanouver the enemy top planes here you just press a series of buttons to kill everything.You can't even fly inverted or do loops. In that regard this game is exactly like the ""plane"" game AfterBurner for Sega Megadrive that came out in the 90s.This isn't even worth it at a 90% discount. Do not get this game, it isn't even fun.			"

												A disappointment to an Ace Combat fan like myself. The ""dogfight mode"" is very clunky and glitches out very frequently, making the screen spaz. Combined with a sub-par storyline and lacking those superweapons that made prior Ace Combat games so much fun, and the fact that no level can be played without using Dogfight Mode or some variation of it beside the badly controlled helicopter missions, this game really was below my expectations. It is definately one of the most disappointing releases since Ace Combat 3 (the English version).			"

												DISCLAIMER: I say a lot of this having gotten the game for a mere $5, and with little former Ace Combat experience.	My rating out of ten on this game sort of fluctuates depending on my mood.  I think it’s at most an overall 8/10, though there are moments it really feels pretty great.  Obviously you probably are here looking through the prominent negativity of the general reviews and maybe you spotted this one of, like, three positive ones.  If you, for instance, are coming back to the store page for a visit, you’re probably confused about how anyone likes this game.  I don’t know.  What’s wrong with me?	Well, first off, we should probably glimpse at what people are consistently saying is bad and I can, to some degree, verify.  I’ll save the big one for last:Apparent US/NATO bias, and other sort of national things: Though it seems the PAK-FA is the penultimate plane in all of this, the game seems to focus on America with Russian alternatives.  There are other planes- The JAS-39, EF2000, Rafale, and Mirage show up, in addition to the F-2 (...as a strict attacker, whilst the AV-8B is a multirole fighter) and the fictitious CFA-44 and ASF-X.  However, it seems to glorify the F-22, has two playable American bombers while neither of the Russian ones that show up are playable, and a lot of fighters from other nations that I would have liked to see (granted I don’t think a few of them, like the J-20 and ATD-X, were well known at the time) were missing, and one that I would have LOVED, the MiG-31, was present but unplayable.  With that said, the US planes don’t seem all that much stronger.  What I’ve also seen mentioned is that the Russian characters seem like walking stereotypes, and undeniably the story is focused on America, even when you play as non-US planes.  And, yes, I know that the game is Japanese.  That’s what makes it a bit weird...Story: So, I hear the story is bad.  I thought it was ok.  I mean, as said above, it is focused on the US, and, without spoiling too much, a Russian superweapon has been taken and is being used for purposes of terror by a Russian separatist group, so in a way it…  does sort of pit the US and Russia against each other, even though everyone is actually working together to fight the guys who happen to be Russian.  There was also this one part where it makes a few Russian helicopter pilots look like idiots.  Of the story itself, I don’t see what was so bad.  I mean, maybe mediocre, but certainly not actually painful past that.  There were even a few parts that I liked- I thought the briefing scenes were nice, and the scenario does highlight the intensity of the missions very well.Unrealism in some areas: So the game, which seems to try to be realistic (at least until you notice the payloads), has some unrealistic areas.  The first is something that all Ace Combat games have, I think (I remember in 04, which I played, it was like this).  You have way too many missiles- near two hundred default ones and about thirty of a special type.  This is cool though, just don’t think about it too hard.  Then there’s the gun.  Unlike my experience in 04, the gun has unlimited ammo- there’s even a part of the plane stats that tells you how much ammo you have and it just has dashes there, as if they initially wanted numbers.  It does overheat, though.  Speaking of the gun, it one-shots tanks.  Yeah.  The controls also have two modes- the default is more like Star Fox than Ace Combat, having automatic roll and pitching when you press either side key instead of manually needing to bank and then pitch- at the same time, it actually seems to do weird things to the aircraft flight model, for instance the force applied by the rudders seems to always be parallel to the ground in this.  But you can turn it off.  Furthermore, things don’t feel like they’re actually there in a weird way.  Just look at how the planes land.  The helicopters have also been panned as unrealistic.  For one thing they have JC2 controls where they just translate magically instead of actually moving by pitching, yawing, and rolling.  They could have plane-like control for rotation, throttle for collective, and slave the gun to whatever target you have locked- seems like a much better setup and about as easy to code in hindsight.  If Aces ever goes back to helis, I think that’s how they should do it.  Also, and I’m actually not sure whether or not this works in real life, the helicopters can do an aileron roll as an evasive tactic instead of flares.  Holy Hell, if that actually works…The big one: The main criticism is the “Modes”.  Air strike mode (ASM) is not that bad, in fact in its absence the ground attack missions actually feel a bit lacking (EDIT: Not that I would suggest bringing it back).  But the main complaint is Dogfight Mode (DFM).  DFM is definitely unrealistic and, though it does do its job to keep combat close and intense, is overall a pretty bad thing for a game that seems to want to keep some realism.  Basically in DFM, you start playing a Star Fox on-rails level, where the direction is picked by the target.  Via fancy maneuvers you can break the guy off of the tail (or more often, give him whiplash), but otherwise…  It’s Star Fox.  And no, I don’t hate Star Fox.  To see how screwed it is, just try entering DFM from a distance and look at how your plane moves on radar.  Other times, the enemy plane decides it can move through this particular area of the terrain, forcing you into an unavoidable crash.	With all that said, I think most of it is true.  I would have loved some more realism in the controls and the helicopters, and while I don’t think I could have played with KBM controls as is without DFM handholding me, I would have preferred smoother controls to it becoming a rail shooter temporarily.	The good things it offers, however, are…  Good…  Yeah…  It has a nice variety of planes, great graphics, anime, high immersion, a few ground attack missions that you don’t normally see, a lot of variety, anime, excellent music, huge and detailed maps, anime, adrenaline, anime, anime, anime.  Anime.  Even the DFM does, as mentioned above, do its job and get really intense.  However, as I stated, I have little experience in Ace Combat.  For this reason I assume I could have gotten every good bit of this from another AC title, and Assault Horizon isn’t really bringing anything to the table…	Except maybe that multiplayer.  I haven’t played it myself- I hear it’s dead.  No one online, and by this point, they may have dropped online support (especially with Infinity out- that could use the resources).  But from what I’ve heard it’s quite good.  I imagine that facing other players would make DFM much more fun, and furthermore, you have access to more than just the fighters.  Again, not entirely sure, but if it flies, I think you can play it, from choppers to fighters to bombers (maybe not the AC-130U and MH-60 gunships), and not only that, but all in the same match with AI ground units, so a nice touch of combined arms there, certainly sounds nice.  Maybe someone popular could pick it up on a free weekend/sale and have everyone play it at once until it gets old.  Still though, what I’ve seen called THE good point is dead.  If there’s anything else to be said, it’s the only cross-platform game of the series, and the only one on PC.	But, hey, Project Aces recognizes it as a non-canon spin-off, so feel free to pretend it doesn’t exist.			"

												Ace Combat's first outing on PC is one of style, cool visuals, and horrible delivery. While the DFM mode adds a cool element of spectacular destruction, it wears out its welcome when it is literally forced onto the player in some sections. These kind of sequences aren't new and they can work well, like in the new Fallouts. However, there you voluntarily activate the sequence. Here, it's required in some portions. It literally becomes an on the rail shooter without warning and only serves to jar. But, the most damning and horrible shortcoming is the control interface: You're literally forced to use a gamepad lest you have to endure shoddy keyboard controls or even worse joystick control. The Joystick support is non-existent. This is unacceptable. Some say this is a game meant to be played on a gamepad and this just smacks of apologetics for laziness that has become so familiar within the industry. Even Tom Clancy's HAWX, which wasn't all that good, had a basic dead zone slider and that came out in 2009, this was early 2013. There's no excuse for this at all. Why can't someone with a joystick enjoy a game about flight? Why is the joystick suddenly a peripheral only for the hardcore flight sim? And why are people defending this lazy thinking as if spending money on a game were a privilege for them?In the end, this is a horrible game and for those seeking a good arcade flying experience would be better served with the original HAWX or, better still, going out and buying a PS2 with its trilogy of Ace Combats. Those games are superior in everyway to this pile of dung. If you're looking for a good arcadey experience on pc? Your regular flight sims can provide; just crank down the physic settings and difficulty. Wings of Prey is also another good choice for that when compared to this.Either way, this games is awful. Skip.			"

												(DISCLAIMER: I played this on the PS3 when it came out and hated it; I decided to revisit the PC version to see if I were wrong about it. TL;DR version: I wasn't)Hey, do you remember the days of bad NES games that were 4 stages long and still lasted half your lifetime on this Earth? That's what Assault Horizon is.Coming to us from the dark ages of modern PC gaming, when PC ports were an afterthought at best and console gaming was all about machismo military jingoism. Namco thought the best way to revitilize the great Ace Combat series would be to remove it from its anti-war imaginary parallel earths and drop it straight into the real-world, in a conflict in Africa where NATO forces clash against rebels, who have managed to get a super-weapon from Russian Ultranationalists. Because if Call of Duty did it, why can't we?Not only is the game missing its predecessors' charm, but the gameplay is absolutely the worst; not just in the series, but among many flight arcades. The flying has moved beyond ordinary figher jets and now includes attack helicopters and long-range ""hey let's squash the ants with our giant american ♥♥♥♥-cannons from the sky"". The vehicles have REGENERATING HEALTH (yup, that is absolutely true) and for all the developers' efforts, the flying feels woefully... boring. There are a lot of gimmicks, especially when flying fighter jets, to make the game look 'cool', but all it does is dumb down the flight into a series of button presses and remove player agency. Levels last for far too long, with far too many objectives that are comprised of ""shoot that"" and... nothing else. How many times can you hear ""OMG REBELS ARE COMING IN"" before you just fall asleep eyesocket-first into your flight stick?The port is alright in that it runs and, surprisingly, even supports my Logitech 3D Extreme Pro stick right out of the box. Having said that, the visual and sound options may as well not exist, considering how barren the menus are.It's a terrible game. It's an affront to the name ""Ace Combat"". It's a waste of money. All of that simply because it's mind-numbingly boring. You start a mission, you try to get into it, but it soon devolves into repeating the exact same task a million times. Do tell, Namco and Team Aces or whoever is responsible for this tragedy; why did you think it would be challenging to repeat the same exact objective 15 times in a single mission? Because that's what this game is. This isn't a high-octane action arcade shooter; it's a shooting gallery with nipple-tearing controls. An excercise in patience.Not recommended. At all. Stay away. I can't stress this enough; I have played other Ace Combat games, I know how much the PC is yearning for this type of genre and that sims aren't always enough to fill that gap, but Assault Horizon isn't the hill to die on. Not at full-price, not on a sale, do. not. buy.0/10 would start playing my games as soon as I buy them so I can at least request refunds.			"

												Listen. I grew up on flying games like Top Gun: Combat Zones, Jetfighter, iF-22, and later HAWX, Ace Combat 6, and Sky Crawlers (an INCREDIBLE piece by Project Aces). One thing these games all had in common is engaging, fast-paced, and straightforward dogfighting that demanded precise control and a keen wit to spotting enemy maneuvers and countering them to your advantage. I grew up with these learning to dogfight using only the stick, yaw, and throttle to create dynamic dogfights and neverending fun. The unlimited freedom of flight is really why flying games are my favorite.READ: THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GAMES.Fair warning: I will vent. HO' BOY AM I GUNNA VENT-The game opens on a dramatic cutscene-SKIP JUST LEMME FLY I DONT NEED PLOT I NEED PLANES-and a storm of fighter jets over.....Florida...? (NO ACE COMBAT GAMES ARE SET ON EARTH HNNNGGGGGGG WROOONGG)You drop right into combat and you're in your jet! Cool! Can I shoot things now?NO YOU HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS GREAT NEW THING WHERE THE GAME PLAYS ITSELF FOR YOU CALLED DFM (DogFightMode)Oh okay, I'll give you the benifit of the doubt. Flying games have always had some wierd new mechanic to make them ""unique"" (gotta admit though, I love playing around in the ""Assist Off"" mode in the HAWX games).So this fresh new thing is basically a dogfight autopilot that forces you to tail an escaping enemy. Cool, I guess. You just hit B a few times to launch the (booming echo) NONDESCRIPT HOMING MISSLE THAT OPERATES PURELY ON DFM MECHANICS. Some (booming echo) CINEMATIC EXPLOSION shrapnel fly into your engines and your (booming echo) GENERIC GRIZZLED WHITE MALE PROTAGONIST says he wants to check his systems. Cue generic control tutorial. *gasp* CAN I DOGFIGHT NOW CAN I CAN-...nope just go into DFM again and do a gun tutorial...now?Nope! More autopilot! And this time a bunch of bad guys fly directly in front of you solely to get themselves blown up LIKE FRIGGING SPACE INVADERS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE*deep breath*Okay, that was boring. Game wants me to use DFM again? No, screw you game, I'm doing my own thing and dogfighting old school like I payed money to do!*long silence*.....what...why....I can't... I can't.... kill them...I PUMPED COUNTLESS MISSLES INTO EVERY ENEMY AND YOU LITERALLY /CAN/ /NOT/ /KILL/ /THEM/ /OUT/ /OF/ /DFM/That HAS to be only the tutorial, righ-NO.ITS NOT JUST THE TUTORIAL.YOU CAN'T KILL ENEMIES DUBBED AS ""ACES"" UNLESS YOU USE THE STUPID BORING DFM AND I'M NOT SWEARING FOR STEAM'S SAKE BUT CHRIST I AM ON THE INSIDE.No really, I tried. They all have infinite flares that never fail and even if you manage to bait them with one missle, wait for flare, and fire another while they can't deploy more, YOU CAN HIT THEM /ENDLESSLY/ AND THEY WILL NOT DIEI SPENT TWENTY MINUTES ON /ONE/ GUY AND JUST LOADED HIM WITH MISSLES ENDLESSLY AND HE WILL NOT CRASH. This is the point where I said ""screw this trash"" and shut the game off.Did I mention that the tutorial leads directly into a rail turret mission? A RAIL TURRET MISSION. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PROJECT ACES WHAT ARE YOU DOING. THIS IS A /FLYING/ GAME. YOU MAKE /FLYING/ GAMES. I DIDN'T PAY REAL CASH MONEY DOLLARS TO HOLD RT DOWN FOR TEN MINUTES AND ENJOY THE FRACKING SCENERY.I don't even wanna KNOW what the AC130 missions other reviewers mentioned are like.Few more nitpicks from a flight sim/arcade vet: The stalling mechanic is just your nose falling. Yeah, that would have been acceptable in 2002 ON THE PLAYSTATION FRIGGING TWO. You know, I seem to remember a real-feeling stalling mechanic IN A GOOD ACE COMBAT GAME.All that happens when you brake while turning is you move a little faster. There's no smoothing or feel of a real plane decelerating and slowly tightening its turning radius or any kind of physics at all. It blows my mind that all the things I HATE about this game were already features IN PREVIOUS GAMES THATS NOT HOW PROGRESS WORKS-tl;dr: Sorry I really needed to vent all that. If you like arcadey, almost shmup action with all kinds of cinematic flair? This game is for you. If you like flight sims or ANYTHING RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS ACE COMBAT GAMES THEN NO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STAY AWAY. I'm glad I got this from the Humble Bundle because if I had paid $20 for this I would probably sue Project Aces,God... I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a game that I have to just stop playing to avoid future embarassment. I've never written a review. This made me so upset that I sat down and wrote a two-page, 850 word review about how disappointed I am,Out of ten? How low does the scale go? Because that's my answer. Screw this game.

												I have been a fan of Ace Combat since the original and I hate to say I would probably avoid this title. Ace Combat Assault Horizon, unlike most of the other Ace Combat games, has real world locations which is a nice addition to the series and you can now pilot some helicopters. The developers unfortunately added ""Dogfight Mode"" and ""Air Strike Mode"" which turns the game into an on the rails quick time event. It is an unforgivably terrible addition to the series and cannot be avoided as many objectives require the player to use this mode. Some players might be able to work with this game mode and still appreciate Ace Combat's attention to detail and diverse plane selection, I however could not; preferring to play the older titles and hoping on the newer ones.

												I've played several ace combat games for ps2 and xbox 360 but this is by far the worst gameplay for any in the series. Now to be fair i decided to play with a logitech extreme3d pro x3d but its the fact i cant barrel roll and the whole time your fighting the plane to stay in the position you want i played with out flight assist then turned it on for kicks making it worse but you can only roll right before you get hit to evade by tapping/hitting a button. i really wanted to enjoy this game but with the controls how they are now i feel like i dont have full control of the plane ruining my gameplay experience i didn't even want to play through the 1st mission.

												Worth $1 on Humble Bundle, but not much more than that.It's about as fun as some of the worse Nintendo DS and mobile Ace Combat games.Do yourself a favor and play any other Ace Combat game. I highly recommend Ace Combat 04, 5, and 0.You have a PC, figure out how to play PS2 games on there.If you are to get an ""Ace Combat: Assault Horizon"" game, get the 3DS game as it is a far superior game. Then again, that game is actually a remake of Ace Combat 2, despite what the name suggests.Pros:Decent VisualsWide array of aircraft to choose fromIdolm@ster aircraft spraysGreat sound designClassic Ace Combat SFX usedCons:Mediocre StoryBland or meh charactersForced cinematic combatSlippery controlsTerrible chopper gunner sections""Damn!""3/10			"

												Here's my short opinion on this game.It doesn't feel like an Ace Combat game. The dog fighting mechanic needs to never be revisited. Constantly I am frustrated by planes taking 45 seconds of constant gun and missile damage just to randomly die at the end of a set piece I wasn't paying attention to. Or to have the same thing happen only to land me a face plant into to ground cause thats where the rail spit me out. Turning a fly around and take down jets game into a rail based 3rd/first person shooter is not a good step for the series.			"

												I returned my Dreamcast to buy the original Playstation 20 years ago because I spent hours in ToysRus playing the demo of Air Combat. One night I went in and some kid was hogging the Playstation station. He wouldn't get off so I bought my own console because Air Combat was just that good. It wasn't til a few weeks later that I discovered Doom and then Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. Air Combat sold me on Playstation.Action, action, action. As soon as you shoot down one bunch, they're replaced with another bunch. That could be a good thing but in this game I just found it to be tedious. You're constantly turning, pulling G's. It seems like it never ends and then they give you an awful cut scene and then they turn you into a helicopter gunner. If fighter jets fought in stadium sized battles then this would be an accurate sim. I almost never feel like I'm flying. I'm just steering a camera around some tight turns with a picture of a jet plane in front of me. They never let you do your own thing like explore the world or the capabilities of the jet. It never feels like anything more than a game. The game is constantly telling you to do things. Sure it is helpful to integrate the tutorial with the gameplay but it sucks when a huge flashing ""Y"" button starts throbbing in the middle of your intense dogfight. The game is ordering you to eject into a cutscene. For an action game I'm surprised they weren't concerned how bad this game is at giving you the feeling of speed and acceleration. At least in the early game the feeling of S and A just isn't there for more than a second. I never feel like I am moving through air or being lifted by lift. I just turn my camera with the pasted on HUD and go to different parts of the background picture. Then they have that part where your computer or console takes you down real low through a forest of smoke stacks and girders. That might have been cool if I felt like I actually was steering or choosing to go there. I am moving sticks and such but obviously there's a lot of ""assists"" going on or something. Its almost a cutscene. You'd think that would be a good thing to be at the controls going through those maneuvers but the whole thing is so fudged and predetermined its just disappointing and annoying. The sophisticated navigation consists of a little map in the corner with glowing arrows. It makes me feel so like I'm in a modern fighter plane. You also won't be bowled over by the airplane models, the HUD models or anything like that. They all are definitely blah.I was a fan of the original Air Combat as it came out on the PS1 and while that wasn't really a sim, it was better than this. If you like a lot of fast action and constant battle or you're just wondering how something this action packed can be so boring  then Ace Combat might be the game for you.			"

												This is an arcade style shooter and not a serious flight sim. So to enjoy this you must forget your previous encounter with the ace combat franchise in terms of gameplay mechanics and even the story telling. This is made like a interactive movie and you are in the ride with limited steering options because the whole thing moves on tracks at high speed. This is the curse and blessing of this game depending how you look at it. It gets hectic and exhilarating but it does not have great characters or story or immersion. I myself like the action which is frantic. Story wise this is as bad as the Michael Bay movies get... The cheesy Russian terrorists to mess up the whole world kind of plot I personally could not care less about. It's not even told in an engaging way, even at a time when terrorism is actually a hot potato right now. I feel like game developers swap back and forth with the washout writers that come from hollywood when they can't make it there, and vice versa. Seriously gaming in general is on a steep declining slope in terms of quality of content. Good graphics don't alone make a good game. However this game for me as I'm a casual gamer,is okay in terms of the over the top, Top Gun'esque action. This is like the 'independence day' version of aerial combat. It's not good storywise or by characters, but action leaves your heart pounding and liking it when brains are in need of relaxing and crave for just stupid action for sake of action.			"

												This particular AC game is extremely simple compared to the previous games. The airial combat is very intense and fast paced however I feel that they over simplified the game a bit.The missions are fun and the storyline is decent, unfortunately though as the game progresses through the main story the missions become more and more tedious and repetative.Overall I'd say you should buy this if you are new to airial combat games or plan on collecting all of the Ace Combat franchise.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Story: 5/10Replay Value: 4/10Overall Rating: 6/10			"

												Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is a flight combat simulator game from BANDAI, Another installment in Ace Combat series from the console.Ace Combat: Assault Horizon gameplay is kinda different from any Ace Combat I ever play. In fact, it is different. Some differences are good, even great, but there is something I considered crazy and not fun too. Let's start with the good stuff. My favorite one is the DFM or they call it Dog Fight Mode, which when you get closer to enemy bogey and lock on, you can enter DFM instead and chase the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ through anything, aim very close and engage with your jets machine gun instead of missiles just because it looks cool and epic. There is also ASM  or they call it Air Strike Mode, almost similar to DFM except this one is for ground target. In some part of the mission, DFM or ASM are not optional because some enemies are just too bloody fast and good to be shot down normally. There are also the new helicopter mission, bomber mission, AC-130 mission like the one in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Blackhawk minigun mission? The campaign story is also quite interesting.Ace Combat: Assault Horizon graphics are kinda great, and quite detailed. Overall the graphics is good. Performances is also great, no problems at all, at least on my end. Soundtracks of the game are kinda cool too.Although, there is some bad things also, like the helicopter mission. While the helicopter gameplay is kinda fun, it's doesn't feel that great, and barrel roll with helicopter every moment you're about to get shot? That's just not awesome for me. The helicopter control itself is kinda restricted, why can't anybody make control of helicopter game like in Battlefield series? Is it because it's too hard for some? At least make it a choice. Then the Blackhawk minigun mission... I thought this is a flight combat simulator? Then the skill of special enemies... boss fight? Wow, they're just so ace that even with DFM they can dodge almost all my missile every single time! Even locking them to enter DFM is kinda hard. I spend quite a time just to dodge instead destroying each other.But aside from those, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon has many good moment. It's good flight simulator game and fun to play. Helicopter mode needs some polish and it has potential. I recommend this.Rating 7/10			"

												As much as I was dying to have an Ace Combat game on my PC, this has turned out to be a bust.  Despite the great graphics and flying mechanics of the jets, combat itself is constantly interrupted with unnecessary visual scenes that literally distract gameplay.  For instance, if you're tailing an enemy and send him down with a missile, the game will cut to a nice little visual that shows him getting destroyed, but then jumps back to you plummetting to the ground.  There are many times where it cuts back to me flying into an object, failing the mission, and ruining the game.  This also occurs with bombing runs, where you're given the option to fly an optimized bombing run path.  There was a mission where the game was ruined from following the path, because all of the cut scenes took away from your mission time.  I found it much easier to not even enter these ridiculous paths, removing some of the stupid dialog and scenes, and completing my mission on time. You could try to claim that one could ignore these ridiculous features and try to complete the missions without using them, but some of the missions either lock you in them or are impossible without executing them.  For instance, dog fighting with vetern pilots are nearly impossible in the game unless you enter the ridiculous dog fight feature.  What's worse is that your jet and your enemies jet heals over time, so your dogfights can carry on for over-drawn out and unrealistic periods of time. If you want a jet fighter game that's realistic, this is not the one for you.  You will be hampered by ridiculous and unrealistic features.  If you want just some cool arcade game, then have fun with it.			"

												This game is certainly underrated due being a late port from the PS game.Game's pretty nice, quite cinematic at times in the main story.It FEELS like a spinoff, because it is after all, it does not take place in the ficticious world but on the real one, with the generic USA vs Russia conflict. (been playing this franchise since the second one) It is not very long (around 13 hours).Multiplayer is amazing, slighty empty due being a late port as i stated above, but it offers quite a competitive feeling, ranks and quite some maps/game modes.For those who don't want to get stomped by aces and such, you have a Co-op Mode which takes you to the main story but with 3~4 friends (can't remember very well) so it's perfect for those who want to get a good time without worrying about a real pilot on their tails.Controls are easy to pick up, and graphics looks really nice for being a 3 years old game. You can customize your plane with colours/skins.It is a gem and even more at $7,50! Pick it up and smell you in game!			"

												It's a mindless shooter, but different from the usual! I've been a lifelong fan of the AC series (having played most - PSX & PS2) and honestly, I am enjoying this game. To me, it's everything an Ace Combat series is, resplete with cheesy dialogue, over the top action sequences (and plane decorations), JRock soundtrack and the 'happy ending, no two ways about it' story.While most people dislike (or downright hate) the DFM, ASM & helicopter segments of the game, I'm quite sure that it's one of the things that the developers tried to bring in to keep the title fresh. Personally, I have no problems against these segments, in fact I very much welcome them. DFM mode shows multi-million dollar planes being reduced to smouldering heaps of scrap and that's ALWAYS satisfying to see - more so when it's the buggering boss! Again, there might be problems with it (unpopulated MP, at least in my SEA region) and other things, but I still like it a lot. I feel its a good title to keep us satisfied while waiting for AC7, probably due out later this year.Performance wise, there isn't any jarring issues and it is optimised wonderfully.Give it a try!

												This game will be a good game experience if you're not looking for a super accurate flight simulator. In this game Konami had prefered to follow something more ""friendly / arcade"" with cinematic appeal.The campaign will take about 8 hours to complete and it is pretty decent just stay aware that there are many scripted scenes on the game, including the last misstion which is about 90 scripted and it REALLY is annoying.I recommend playing the game with a controller (used a X360 one here) and get it for a pretty cheap deal since the community  isn't playing Multiplayer anymore so you will come up playing only with your friends.

This game stole my heart. It's an in-your-face modern blockbuster fighter jet spectacle, where laws of gravity bow down to ace pilots - because ace pilots are badass, baby.The premise/story is very corny and much of the gameplay is rail-shooting in disguise. But the disguise is so well produced that the result is a loveable game. Sound design helps this game a lot; constant radio chatter creates a good military term dropping feel and the soundscape of air combat is amazing.I rarely say ""action-packed"", but this game is. It is purely fun to play, watch and listen to. Great music - a deliberately produced mix of metal and orchestral elements - plays a big role in tightening up the already over the top explosion symphony in the sky.It's linear, it's not perfect, but it always delivers in the blockbuster-kind of way. Love it.			"

												Assault Horizon isn't quite as good as the PS2 Ace Combats, but it's good enough to be a fun jet fighting based game when there are few of those on the market. There are a few issues with it - such as the Call of Duty-esque plot and the forced dogfight sequences with enemy aces where you can't really kill them until after the cutscene finishes.  Overall though, I enjoyed the dogfight mechanic when compared to the old system. It made the game more fun and less having to go cross-eyed trying to shoot down enemy planes on the horizon.			"

												No matter how many times i try to play this, one thing keeps stopping me. That dogfighting mode. The game tries to force you into it, in every way it can. Be it, unlimited no cooldown flares, or the insanly tight turn radius of the enemy planes. Yeah there are other issues with the gameplay, such as the door gunner missions being bland or the helicopters awkward aiming when i the cockpit. but that DCM just takes control away from you and isnt optional. Plus it only really works with the turn left/right controls, rather than the pitch and roll. Shame, i love the Ace Combat games (The first game i ever completed was Air Combat) and would love this one if that feature wasnt so heavily used.			"

												While the game has some interesting and fun mechanics, its downfalls are just too large to overlook. On one side, the game's story is next to non-existant. What little story there is, from what I've seen so far, is about as generic and boring as can be.That said, the story is obviously not meant to be the draw of the game. A game such as this really only has a bit of story to tie the gameplay together. It's the gameplay that is of greatest importance here. So, is the gameplay good? Well... I didn't think so.The game relies far too much on it's new DFM feature. DFM might look cool, and even feel a bit exciting at first, but in the end it just turns the game into an interactive POV cutscene. ""Hold the triggers and then push B when the lights turn red. Repeat until the enemy is dead. Find a new enemy and repeat again.""A dogfight has the potential to be fun and rewarding, relying on the skill of the player to manuver his/her plane to keep on the tail of the enemy. But instead, we're told to rely almost entirelly on this new mechanic that does nothing that drain the game of what COULD have been it's greatest moments.At least the game is pretty. the environments are well put together, and the radio chatter was definitely a treat.In all, I'd give the game a 4/10[I'll update the review if my opinion changes after playing for more.]			"

												FIRST OF ALL: KEEP V-SYNC ON. The game stutters and lags without it, glitching your plane into unrecoverable crashes. Now that's out of the way, this game is by no means a game for an Ace Combat fan like myself. It's been casualized up the ♥♥♥ so it can ""reach a wider audience"". The Dogfighting Mode (More like dogshit mode) forces you into scripted chases and the game CANNOT BE FINISHED without using it. Taking control away from the player is one of the worst things you can do in a game like this. Oh and for some reason, this is only for sale in the US because it's probably a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that no one will buy anywhere else, and that kills the multiplayer scene if you're not in the US. Conclusion: Buy only if a serious AC fan, and if you want better games in the genre, emulate the prequels on the PS1 and PS2.			"

												Honestly, an Ace Combat game, is an Ace Combat game, as long as the title doesn't say ""Ace Combat"" and have playable tanks. Yes, gunner missions are boring. The story is too bland and steriotypical U.S. Vs ""Terrorism"" or World VS Terrorism. I love the Alternate Universe more than Real World, Alternate Universe (Like in Ace Combat 5) you have major nations like Yuktobania and Osea, Belka, ect. But like I typed, an Ace Combat Game is an Ace Combat game, as long as there's jets, stories, and pretty pilots *glares at Nagase* then there's nothing to be angry about.

												This game... it's okay.I say that because there are good aspects and bad aspects. Before I start, I haven't played any Ace Combat games but this game appears to vary in style from the different Ace Combat games according to others. As I don't see this as a sin, I won't include this in the negatives. Allow me to elaborate on the + and -'s:Positives:-Graphics are good, especially in dogfighting mode.-Storyline is somewhat decent too, drew me in a little.-A great soundtrack.-Freedom of choice between different planes, including one with a chemical weapon. (It has a Eurofighter Typhoon too!)-Mechanics are somewhat easy to get used to.Negatives:-The artificial difficulty is painful to look at. It's way too obvious. I'd be dominating a Pak FA and all of a sudden he turns into Yakumo Yukari or something and somehow appears behind me in a split second. They might also fly straight waiting for you to engage them.-The game handles terribly on a flight stick in my opinion. I've tried to get used to it, but it just doesn't work for me. It's best played with a controller.-Some of the reaction times for the counters are ridiculous, I've resorted to spamming the counter button praying I hit it at the right moment. I mean, it's very predictable when they maneuver.-Too repetitive for my liking. Yes, it is a story driven game but they could have done more with what they had. For example, HAWX 2 had different game modes such as Survival and special campaign modes. They could have at least added more like this.My final judgement: Only good for a single playthrough really. If you're feeling lucky, you can try and get a high ranking on all missions but that's about it. Because I am recommending it for a single playthrough, I am rating this up because the story was nice and the other features mentioned contributed. However, if you've played any of the other Ace COmbat games, beware as this is not like the other games (apparently). This is more of a story based game rather than a gameplay based game so I am judging the game with that in mind. If you did not think this review was helpful, please leave advice in the comments, I appreciate it a lot.			"

												Now that Games For Windows Live has been removed from the game, my CD key automatically works, and I can now save the game. I have had no problems so far, and the game is on sale again.The FIRST thing you should do when you get this game is to change the control style to ORIGINAL. The new control style doesn't give you full control of the planes. If you cant go upside down, it aint Ace Combat. The game is pretty good overall, but the ""dogfight"" mode is just plain annoying. It doesnt really take any skill to do, and doesn't give you any sense of accomplishment when you do it. Being basically forced to use it isnt cool. The helicopter levels are boring COD style minigun action. And the 3rd person camera, which is behind the gunners shoulder, does not help. I got this game for around 5 dollars on sale, which was a good price, but I dont think i would pay over 15.			"

												I don't know why people is being so hard on this game. I've been playing the Ace Combat series since Ace Combat 2, and even if this is quite the exception over the whole series, as of story to functions and controls, it's still enjoyable. I've got a great time playing ACAH and enjoying the variety in it, not only on all the fighter planes, but also flying helicopters (which is something many AC players would have liked on previous AC games) and using a gun turret.Well, the gun turret it's the only that seems a bit off for a game mostly about air combat, even if it's on a helicopter, that's the only thing that would belong to a CoD-esque game, but overall, it's still a good game.I wouldn't recommend it only if you are a hardcore AC fan expecting a continuaiton of what was left on AC6.

												God aweful. It brings shame on the Ace Combat name. I hate DFM, its so easy it's boring. It would be fine if you weren't forced to do it. The story loses it's most interesting qualities by becoming a generic 'Murica circle jerk. There are worse Flight sims, but when you compare it to the rest of the Ace Combat series I can't stand it. I didn't even make it half way through before I got bored and quit.			"

												Well, for anyone who never play this series, I strongly recommend you to have a try! It's really a cool and fast game, no matter how well you can play! BUT AS A PLAYER WHO HAD PLAYED ALL ACE COMBAT SERIES, I FEEL REALLY DISAPPOINT, MAYBE NAMCO SHOULD JUST CALL THIS GAME ASSAULT HORIZON, BUT NOT ACE COMBAT, I THINK THAT WILL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER! As you see this game just become a fast game without beautiful music and thoughtful story. Just become  a ‘wula!!!gogogo!!!’ game, so if you had played Ace Combat series before, I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY IT, REALLY A BAD GAME! So anyway, like what I always said, if you like it, just buy it, if you want  more thoughtful stories, buy a Xbox 360 or PS2 or PSP or PS3, and play the old series! You will find more than war in the old Ace Combat series.			"

												Fun game, very arcady (you start withy 200-300 missiles on each mission), especially considering you pretty much can't go without the make-special-move-to-tail-a-bogey mechanic.That mechanic in itself is what turns me down the most in this game. Or rather, how forced you are into using it often as it's pretty much impossible to kill some enemies without it.Story line is not really that much worth, standard evil Russians, good guy NATO pretty much.It's not that difficult, at least on the lower difficulty settings. Just gets a bit repetitive after a while.If anything, this game is made for casual players.			"

												I have to admit I hesitated to buy this game because of the mixed reviews on Steam. I have played and completed almost every Ace Combat to date so I was scared I was going to be disappointed with this one. I finally got it just a few days ago, played it and completed the single player, and let me tell you - it was easily worth it! The graphics are great (It's not the prettiest game ever but it runs smooth as butter and the overall detail level is high; explosions and plane models look exceptionally great), the gameplay is fast and frantic, there is rarely a dull moment in the entire 16 mission campaign. The story is nothing to write home about but it's interesting enough. The missions are surprisingly varied (especially in comparison to older AC games) and a lot of fun to play trough. The planes handle like a dream and the controls are great (I used a X360 controller). I see a lot of people are bashing the new dog fighting mechanic but I have to say I liked it - sure, it happens a bit too often but it never really gets boring and it's not without challenge (I've played the game on HARD difficulty). I also see a lot of people bashing the helicopter missions and the turret sections and I can't agree with them. The helicopters are a great addition to the game (it's not without problems, sure, I died many times because of the controls, for example) and the turret missions are short and fun, just as they should be. All in all this is a great game, easily recommendable to any fan of AC or action games in general. Just don't expect a simulation or something like that :) Oh yeah and - this IS a TRUE Ace Combat game, but I guess haters gonna hate anyway :)			"

												This game had been on my radar for some time but I decided against buying it because I'm a hardcore flight simmer and arcade  flight titles are like a heresy to us genuine simmers.With the free weekend trial however I decided to try it and I have since been able to appreciate the game as is after spending about 7 hours into it. That is not a flight sim per see but a light shooter game centered around the theme of planes (and I love planes).As a light game this game delivers some serious fun especially online. Many people aren't able to appreciate the DFM (dogfighting mode) part of the game. But to me it's a brilliant mechanic to get a feel of that personal knife fight aerial dogfight. The suspense in DFM is quite real and very very fun.The single player campaign which can be played co-op however, can be a little too tedious for many however.I just wish more people would play this game online where the gameplay shines!

												This is not Ace Combat 04, 05, or Zero.This barely even FEELS like an Ace Combat game.If you play this you will spend 95% of the game struggling with the fact that the game is designed to try and force you into D.F.M. which is nothing more than a rail shooter chase scene with other planes to try and shoot them down. If you don't, you're going to learn real fast that the enemy planes can pull more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moves than HAWX or the movie STEALTH. I want to like this game. And I can...if I consider it an airborne version of a Call Of Duty game. Not as an Ace Combat.Here's to hoping Ace Combat 7 does a better job since it's going back to the StrangeReal world.			"

												If you enjoyed this game, go pick up a PS2 and find a copy of Shattered Skies. If you didn't enjoy this game, do the same. It was the first game of this series I ever played, and much better than this one. Dogfighting system was a fluke, as many of the exisiting comments will tell you. Online is dead, story is straight from any generic Tom Clancy game, and it's an extremely short game to completion. It's not terrible, especially since it came as a package deal in a Humble Bundle, and it made me a bit nostalgic, enough to go play the before mentioned Ace Combat 0. Not worth the 20 bucks, gameplay-wise, but you can get a few hours of enjoyment out of it. Until you realize it's the same thing you did only a short while ago, stop playing, and then pick it up again a few weeks later. Like I said, it's not a bad game, it just didn't live up to its predecessors.			"

												Ever since CAPCAM added achievements for its aged games, fans of RE (mainly) have started to replay these games existing only in memories. However clever this decision is, I don't see if CAPCAM has saved this one:ACE AH. In retrospect, when this game first came out, its revolutionary dogfight mode won round applause. It has given new life and excitement to the series sacrificing the long competitive tradition.The singleplayer is just about OK, nothing mentionable at all. Helicopter is fun to play at the start but soon gets boring. The AIs are sometimes dumb few times genius. You could spend half an hour just trying to get behind one of the enemy aircrafts flying parrallel but in different direction to you.I can't say anything about multiplayer, cuz it has been sitting on its death bed for so long. I don't know if anyone at all still plays it, I reckon we all have something better to do.In conclusion, don't buy it.			"

												Well where do I start with this?I ragequitted...really, I put the controller down and uninstalled it..on a free weekend. That's a first timer for me.Good things first: It has nice visuals and it tries to add varietyBUTI hate railshooterparts, especially when the controls are horrible (Why the efff am I able to use my mouse for aiming in the Gatling gun section, but not in the Bomberpart? - Thats where I ragequitted because of the cwappy controls and cwappy checkpointplacement)The game has a Dogfightfeature which pretty much puts you on rails..I would be okay with it, if I would be not FORCED to use it. It is for me similar to the E.R.S. from HAWX, which was there to help you with certain stuff, but you were free for the most part to ignore it. And whos idea was it to put a bloodyscreen into this game? They should rename this into Call Combat: Modern Horizon. Since I haven't played any other Ace Combat, HAWX is the main competitor for me and what can I say? It's the better game. If you want an arcady jetgame get HAWX. Ace Combat only has the upper hand in grafics and ""variety"" while HAWX offers better controls, gameplay and a similar story.TL:DR: Get HAWX (The first) instead			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon. When I first heard someone on my friends list say it was an arcade combat flight game with Fallout's V.A.T.S. system I was slightly intrigued. I even went as far as buying it just because of that description, and believe me when I say I normally can't enjoy these type of games, because they become repetitive too soon. And yes, Ace Combat doesn't manage to spice things up all that much, but it gives you many ways to play the game, more than many other games in this genre. Missions are diverse and the gameplay is fun, with indeed some sort of V.A.T.S. system in place to kill enemies. It's a fabulous way to make games like these more exciting. The action also regularly slows down to give you some eye candy to look at. It all looks great in motion and playing the game with a controller (or joystick, I guess) is the right way to play it. I was really, really impressed by its visuals. Everything looked clean, and sharp and the people looked like real people (in a way). The camera is always close and the parts where you're not flying your aircraft look like you're watching a movie, with the right amount of motion blur and angles.The game doesn't do everything right, of course. There are missions that rely on depth perception. There's one mission in particular where you have to use stealth in order to avoid getting seen by the radars. The reach of these radars is shown in large, moving, green triangles, but they're so close apart that I had to repeat the mission several times because it's so hard to see. All of this would've been unnecessary with the use of more color (darker green or light green, for example) or by setting them further apart. It's one of the few times that I was really frustrated.Concerning the length of the game; this is perfect. It's not too long and not too short, it's just right. You can finish it in 8 or 9 hours so there's plenty of gameplay in it.Ok, time to wrap things up again: Ace Combat Assault Horizon is by far my favorite arcade combat flight game so far. Highly recommended ![Rating: 82/100]			"

												Español and EnglishI had the opportunity to play Ace Combat 1, Ace Combat 2, and Ace Combat 3. I consider those as excellent games, so I was really interested in revisiting this saga with Ace Combat Assault Horizon, I can't say that I regrer my purchase, however this game has more defects than virtues.The Bad:The Dogfight camera is vomitive, there was a time when dogfight required skill and now its just a common QTE.Your wingman is useless, you are a one man army where the allied units are only for decoration. In the old games you got the feeling of big operations where the allied AI was more reliable.The enemies magically appear and disappear just to make cool scenes of multiple missiles.The story is meh.The good:The music.Yo tuve la oportunidad de jugar Ace Combat 1, Ace Combat 2 y Ace Combat 3, y siempre los considere y los sigo considerando excelentes juegos. Es por eso que estaba muy emocionado con la oportunidad de revivir esos momentos con Ace Combat Assault Horizon, aunque no puedo decir que me arrepienta de comprarlo, este juego tiene mas defectos que virtudes.Defectos:La camara en el dogfight mode es vomitiva, antes entrar en dogfight requeria de habilidad, ahora no es mas que una especie de QTE.Tu wingman es un inutil, te sientes ejercito de un solo hombre donde las unidades aliadas solo sirven de adorno, antes te sentias parte de operaciones mas grandes donde podias contar con que la IA hiciera su trabajo.Los aviones aparecen, desaparecen o se quedan quietos solo para que las escenas con misiles multiples se vean cool, y la historia es pesima.Todo esto representa varios pasos atras respecto a los demas juegos de la saga.Virtudes:La musica.

												It boggles the mind how an arcade flight simulator, not bound by any expectation of realism, can end up so incredibly dull. ""Dogfighting"" is reduced to simply staying in a turn, and pressing a button whenever you hear the beep. The flight models have had no real care put into them, and without an interesting game mechanic, flying a Phantom or an F-16 ends up being even more tedious than flying a DHL cargo plane, and no amount of explosions or flashy action shots are going to distract you from that.

It makes things a lot easier. Sometimes way to easy. It feels like it's the game that is doing everything for you. Although i really like this game, the graphics and storyline. Maybe DFM can suck sometimes really hard, it is actually usefull but I feel like a noob sometimes because old AC games don't have this feature making it very hard to keep up with enemies making it usefull for new guys like me.

												So far starters I'd like to clarify that I've been playing Ace Combat since Unsung War on PS2, I'm not as experienced as the extreme veterans but I've clocked hundreds of hours into each Ace Combat game that has released since. With that being said, I don't think Assault Horizon strays too far away from its old style with this one. There's this new mechanic called dogfight mode which is a step away from the traditional ""Lead your Target"" tactic for dogfights. Instead of using your skill to out manuever planes, you can use a snap lock on feature that automatically locks you onto the enemey's tail.I'm imagining this is where the game gets its hate. I honeslty don't have a problem wth it because it gives a very interesting cinematic approach to dog fights. In this mode the plane sollows completely behind the enemy while the target tries to escape. This can be a number of things in a number of places depending on where you're fighting and I find that interesting.If you ever feel like you're sick of it, just stick to firing rockets-never fails!  Like I said, a step away from intense dogfights but still a solid flight combat game. Another really interesting feat is that you fly multiple typs of airfract, helicopters, AC-130s, etc. This is a step in a new direction of ""Ace Combat"" glory. Is it enough to stack up to a game that you want to come back to? Well I like it.			"

												If you are willing to put aside gripes about not being set in the usual Ace Combat world and the total disregard for realism, this game can be a genuine enjoyment. My biggest gripe with the game is the fact that often, when you are chasing a high-ranking bad-guy, he will become unkillable until he leads you to a certain location, just so a cool killcam can occur. This bothered me because I feel it stifles your freedom as a pilot and negatively effects gameplay, just for the sake of showing off the visuals (which are fantastic btw).

												(I've finished this game before I get the PC version)First off, this is NOT...- An Ace Combat game even it has the name ""Ace Combat""- A combat flight simulationInstead, this is a different game from the whole AC series, this game isn't that bad if you don't treat it as an AC game, it's even a decent game in my opinion.And since I can't write an article properly, So I'll just list all the pros and cons.Pros:- Awesome OST- Story is set in real world- Close Range Assault, makes the combat more intense- You have a decent selection of planes, even at the begining- Rather intense combat- Helicopters and AC-130- Idolmaster skins- Idolmaster skins for the Strike Eagle- Player can perform ugachev's CobraCons:- Story is typical, it's another America(with good Russians) saves the day story- Close Range Assault, especially when the player's plane fly towards the ground with the AIs, damaging the player's plane, DFM also makes the dogfight much easier- Helicopter controls with controller sucks- Control setup and graphic settings won't save unless you fix it manually- Scripted battles, and you won't know when will that happen, The final battle against Akula is the prime example, you can see him being hit by dozens of missiles and still flying, because you have to stick with him long enough till the game allows you to shoot him down- Game is shortOverall, if you can get over the fact this is game is NOT a real Ace Combat game or you wanna play something different from the other AC games, go ahead and buy it.UPDATE:The girl who flies the AC-130 is mai waifu			"

												Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is best described as a mixed experience. Where the gameplay, sound and presentation excel, the story greatly disappoints, rarely doing the title justice. AC is a risky gamble by developers. In marrying the niche genre of flight action represented by its past titles with the pick-up-and-play modern-warfare genres enjoyed by masses of casual and regular gamers. AC boasts a completely revamped destruction engine, full-spectrum missions that expand into helicopter and support-plane varieties, as well as a brand-new 'Dog-Fight Mode' flight mechanic intended to bring jet-on-jet action right into the face of the player. This it does very well. Transitioning between the standard flight controls into the shooter-inspired DFM is smooth and crisp, and letting the game take partial control over your jet while you focus on keeping the enemy plane within your sights and unloading lead and missiles upon him is incredibly entertaining as you see his plane fragment bit by bit, oil streaks splattering over your screen as he finally explodes, debris burning past you. Even more satisfying is chaining multiple DFMs together then turning the tables on a pursuer with a well-timed stunt maneuver that puts you behind him, and right on track to blow him to smithereens. But once you engage in DFM you dont need any skill at all to chase your opponent. It's all auto. You don't need to care about natural obstacles and such because the AI simply removes it from equation. When an enemy engages it on you, it takes luck rather than skill to shake it off you. Without DFM engaged it's almost impossible to destroy enemy planes at medium and long ranges, so no need to carry missiles for that purpose. Bosses and main targets can only be destroyed in DFM.Helicopter missions offer a more down-to-earth approach, as you weave between buildings and get closer than ever to the ground in missions that have you taking out tanks, infantry positions and even other choppers. There are also bomber runs with incredibly satisfying explosion shots and even a heavy bomber mission that plays rather similarly to that famous sequence in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, offering the same entertainment value, with a tad bit more action as you can now be shot down by enemy missiles.Joypad controls are easy to pick up and the camera offers a nice 'over-the-shoulder' view of the action.Technically, AC is not the best-looking game, but it doesn't look too bad either. Plane textures and models, in both third- and first-person cockpit views, look great. The ground looks decent from most altitudes, with buildings and structures modeled with sufficient detail to remain presentable.Plus AC is easily one of the best-sounding games. Explosions rumble your bass speakers as bombs make their impact, and the sound of lead shredding through metal as the your Vulcan cannon buzzes away is one I cannot get enough of.			"

												This game is terrible.If you're a fan of the old Ace Combat games, and don't like Call of Duty, don't play this game--It forces you to go into an 'autopilot' mode called ""DFM Mode"" to kill some enemies. A lot of enemies, especially those marked by TGT_LEAD cannot be killed otherwise, I've tested this extensively by both watching the code with a third-party engine, and using a program to test damage values.Thanks whoever made this terrible game, please stop making games now.

												I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I love flying games. I love them to bits. I relish the speed, the adrenaline, the viceral sense of the bits of metal that rocket past you at mach 2 as you riddle another plane with bullets. Ace Combat Assault Horizon offers all of that and that is why I like it. Ace Combat has a long history that I have never experienced; so you will not get any comparisons with its predecessors from me. Instead I will tell you exactly why this game is awesome and why you'd do yourself a disservice when not playing it. Let's start with the obvious; the mental presentation. Stuff is literally thrown at you. You are experiencing a barrage of unyielding terror and excitement all at once. The game runs overtime to get you the best angle on the action. The camera will cut back from the action to show you the minute details of your enemy's plane as it disintegrates when you unleash a flurry of bullets and missles at at. If it wasn't enough, the game might just give you a front row seat and follow the missle as travels toward its mark. Not exciting enough you say? Lets talk about dogfighting; the bread and butter of any aerial combat game. Initiation a dogfight in this game requires you to close the distance. A quick button press initiates the special pursuit mode that hooks your plane to your target and the pulse pounding chase begins. Your plane broadly follows the target, but the goal is to keep the crosshair in the center at a insane speeds to make your lock-on kick in faster to shove your deadly missles up his rear end faster. Your mark can escape though. By swaying and dodging, or by hitting the brakes hard and leveling the craft at the right moment you might find yourself being chased. Even then, if you can react fast enough you can instercept his manouver and rivet his plan as he flips in front of you. Everything is carefully accentuated with flares, scratches, explosions and other effect that really make the game's catch prase seem like the real deal: ""Make metal bleed"" The story mode is a wee bit short. And by a wee bit I mean seriously short. One day is all you need. You do get some variation in missions and vehicles. Such as flying an Apache Helicoper, B2-Spirit Bomber or a DC-130 gunship, but the real kick comes from flying the many jet fighters. From the F-14 all the way to the latests supersonic machines. Multiplayer allows you to test your skill against other pilots, or cooperate in thwarting the CPU from bombing major cities. The only real problem is the general lack of players. So if anything, this review should have convinced you to shell some cash and come fly with me, cause I can use a few wingmen.			"

												Don't buy this game. My god, don't do it. I like QTEs so I thought 'Oh, this is the Ace Combat I want to play!' but no, it's just bad. The helicopter and gunship missions are terrible but the worst stinker is the ASM (Air Strike Mode). You have to keep your aircraft extremely low to the ground, since usually during air strike missions if you go too high you get shredded by SAMs and AA, which wouldn't normally be that dangerous except that ASM forces you into extreme low speed if you want to hit all the targets they point out. Which is a danger in and of itself, because of course if you go too slow then you stall and since you're so low to the ground to begin with... you crash. It's just not fun. Pick up Assault Horizon Legacy on the 3DS instead, despite the name it's a remake of Ace Combat 2 with newer mechanics.			"

												Overall a pretty fun game. As a former Tom Clancy's HAWX player, I have a game to compare it to.  The graphics and aircraft detail are much better. Plane handling is similar to HAWX, but it is still a little better. Mission storyline once again has to do with extremists and Russian rebels taking control of the Russian government and mission 4, the AC-130 mission, now almost seems standard in this type of game. Also, the AH-64D Apache missions, to be frank, suck. But overall, a pretty nice game. "

												Summary: Long-time fans of the Ace Combat series may have mixed feelings about changes that Ace Combat Assault Horizon has brought to the gameplay, but it's still a solid arcade-flight game with some new approaches to the tried-and-true formula of previous installments. This includes the addition of bomber and rotary-wing missions, QTE-type events, and the steel carnage concept of dogfighting, all of which attempts to present the action in a fast and furious flurry of button mashes and swerving. If you're a fan of the series, most of the game will feel right at home, if you've never played any of the previous games then this is a good entry point. Overall it's a solid 4/5.The biggest point of discussion about Assault Horizon is the new mechanics they brought to the gameplay that were not in previous incarnations. First off, there is roughly three types of missions throughout the game and they revolve around a fighter, bomber, and rotary-wing roles. Fighter missions for the most part are unchanged from previous Ace Combat games but with the addition of a few features. This includes the use of Dog-Fight Mode (DFM), which is a mode that will activate when you click on the L2 + R2 bumpers together when near an enemy unit. This brings your perspective right up behind the enemy aircraft, and your plane will have an easier time gunning it down with your main cannon or locking in with your missiles. I hate to say that this is not just a nice-to-have mode, it's absolutely essential to finish the game and you'll be continually forced into using it. Now if you're being chased by another fighter, you can enter DFM and do a reversal on him, you'll just have to hit the bumpers at the appropriate time.In the first mission, the DFM really seemed to be heavily scripted where you were taken on very intentional paths throughout the city of Miami. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but it just seemed that the game was programmed with two types of DFM-type events. One that was scripted and designed to take the player through parts of the map, like sweeping through a pier or nearly dodging the pieces of a collapsing Washington Memorial as you're chasing the enemy. Other times, DFM took you through where you would naturally end up while flying. Just from my playthrough, however, most of the scripted events took place in the first and the last few missions.When utilizing DFM, you also get a taste of what Project Aces is calling ""steel carnage."" To bring a certain type of visceral, gritty sense of air-combat, aircrafts are almost personified as living things. Sounds a little far-fetched, but as you shoot down enemy aircrafts, they start to break apart...seep out fluids and billow out dark fumes like blood and sweat, usually ending the aircraft completely breaking apart or the cockpit being decapitated from the rest of the aircraft. This type of up close and personal approach to dogfighting will feel different, but by the end of the game it becomes very intuitive and natural. In fact when you play through the final missions, you'll end up replaying scenes from the beginning of the game, and it was kind of interesting to see how far I had come in grasping the different concepts of the game.Bomber missions are also new for the series, but for most people it won't be as alienating or groundbreaking as you might imagine. The first type of bombing mission is with the AC-130 ""Spooky,"" which if you've played Battlefield or Call of Duty, it's essentially a carbon-copy of those experiences. The second gives you control of a B-1 ""Lancer"" or B-2 ""Spirit,"" which controls very similar to the fighters but has specific weapons that allow you to carpet bomb an area. They've essentially taken away your missiles and replaced them with guided bomb units (GBUs).The last set of missions and the biggest addition is the use of rotary-wing aircrafts. Again, there are two types of rotary missions with the first being a door-gunner and giving you free-range over a minigun. This also plays similar to missions in Battlefield or Call of Duty. The second allows you to directly take control of an AH-64 ""Apache"" or Mi-24 ""Hind,"" which plays very differently from the aircraft in the game. You have the ability to manuever your helicopter around the map, lower/raise with the A/B keys (XBox 360 Controller), lock-on and focus a main gun and rockets onto, and also perform ""evasive manuevers"" when a missile is locked onto you. Which by the way, is pretty amazing since it involves barrel rolls...  Anyways, the controls are easy to pick up and will take a matter of minutes to figure out. The rotary wing missions for me personally were well-done. The fighter missions are for the most part air superiority-focused and you'll spend more of that time moving in-and-out of DFM. Rotary missions play very differently, for the most part you're moving around with guns ablazing and rockets firing every which direction. It's very action-packed and there are less ""annoyances"" than with the fighter missions, where you're constantly dodging enemy missiles and lining up for the next DFM.The plot is very different from the previous Ace Combat games as well, with a story that is grounded more on real-world politics and issues. There is no Belka, Erusea, Mobius One, or Garuda Squadron, it's a story about the United States, Russia, and the Middle East. Personally I didn't care for the story much, I would have much rather played something relevant in the previous Ace Combat universe, however I think that the Assault Horizon game was built to be a spinoff rather than a continuation of the series. Much of Assault Horizon's storyline pulls of cliched tropes, with the classic vindictive Russian waging a war against the world with weapons of mass destruction, a conspiracy within the Russian military that forces a coup, and the Americans coming in to the save the day from utter devastation. Now, it's still well-done and I did enjoy the ending, but still this is a plot that is way overdone. There is minor character development and for most of the game I didn't even know who my wingman (Warwolf 2) was from the cutscenes, but by the game's finale it all started to pull together well. However, Warwolf 2 is nothing like Kei Nagase or Chopper and will bring less of an emotional pull that they did from AC5.So to summarize, I recommend the game to both fans and newcomers to the series. It's an arcade-style flight shooter, so it's not supposed to be highly realistic. If you want an actual flight simulator, try ArmA or the DCS games, but the downside is that with realism you lose out on the quick, fast-paced action that a more arcade-styled game offers. I think the game is more polished than the HAWX series, but I've enjoyed both series. 4/5 "

												No matter what the title of the game says, this isn't Ace Combat.Ace combat series was all about having a gallore of nice jets to fly with some with unique secondary weapons, fighting impossible odds always thrown right into the action.This abomination forces you for half of the game to pilot an helicopter with boring gameplay and ridiculous missile evasion maneuvers , oh and a 10-15min long stage where all you do is use the minigun of a helicopter's door.The cutscenes are average at best, but they really break the pace of the game how long they are, and they happen in the middle of teh game too breaking immersion , also they introduced Dog Fight Mode DFM in order to take down ace pilots, but really is the only way you have of playing this game at all, you end up using 99% of the time becoming really boring.None of the pilots will ever shut up trying to create some sense of character's personalities but really they all as bland as a pudding.

												I've finally found a sense of accomplishment after finishing Ace Combat Assault Horizon, but this didn't come without a price. This was probably one of the most painful action games I've struggled through. The first struggle I had was buying this game when it still had GFWL included which is probably why I never bothered to finish it until recently. Thankfully that intrusive DRM has been removed and the game is now exclusively Steam based with achievements. The second struggle was painfully getting through the almost infinite number of enemies during each mission.Now all the mission objectives in this game are great and fun. I loved the story and the gameplay is easy to enjoy. The variety of jets and bombers available to fly is also satisfying. The biggest issue for me was the sheer number of enemies during each mission. It made each mission feel excessively long and excessively repetitive. The fact that it takes multiple missiles to kill each enemy didn't help matters either. I get the arcadeness of the game and that aspect actually made it more enjoyable over a realistic flight simulator. But enemy after enemy after enemy after enemy after enemy...you get the point. There is a moment during each mission where I found myself asking, ""Good Lord, when is this going to end?""Ok so that is pretty much all I didn't like. That aspect left some battle wounds and those scars will likely never fully heal, but I loved the game overall. The story is excellent. There are a wonderful assortment of mission types and objectives and it is generally a fun game to play.			"

												This is a great game.  Not as fun as Shattered Skies, but a lot more in depth.  Flight controls are pretty responsive and the storyline is great.  I wish there was a free flight in every map like there was in Shattered Skies, instead of being forced to play a mission.  The multiplayer mode sucks.  Overall, I was happy with the wide variety of flight platforms and how easy it was to customize each one.  If you're an Ace Combat fan, I'd definitely buy this.			"

												Ace combat moves onto the next generation gaming, shame that its trying to copy the call of duty franchaise.  The originals are what we want, but in this version you get allies that more or less there to fill space so theres a reason to hear radio chatter but otherwise you are out there on your own.You are the ace of the fighter squadron but in this case you are constantly tring to out run missile after missile lock ons so much so at many points in the game you will find that you are chased by more then 5 or so fighters.  Each fighter is just queuing to shoot you down and when you lose one, the next will take its place while the one you lost will find itself at the back of the queue.Not only that but you get the new and exciting chase camera where granted it is very exciting as it is mostly auto pilot flying and you are just focusing on aiming and shooting the target down.  On occation you will shoot your target down and find that the auto pilot lets go plummeting you towards the ground without any chance of recovery or slams you into a building as the moment you take out the enemy fighter, it was trying to evade you between buildings.On top of this they will pull off impossible flips and end up behind you just as you fire missiles point blank after filling your aiming recticle to max in a increased chance of hit rate.  This game is very exciting in the flight and fight action, shame that all the bits don't work out and no wonder this game is full of check points.Tried multiplayer with a friend, in the end we believe that the game sadly does not scale for the actual number of players but is set to max whatever that is.  We were constantly tailed by 5 fighters each all throughout the mission, ran out of missiles even if 70% of them all hit and ran out of time for the mission even though we were killing them decently if slowly.Simple terms this game is very exciting if you like cheating npcs that constantly gang up on you and you only get 10 seconds to shoot someone in the calmer moments before being chased again. And again this isn't the ace combat games that we know of and the rumours that this is a bad game is sadly true.			"

												In full disclosure I will admit that the only other Ace Combat game I have played is AC04:Shattered Skies, AC04 is one of my favorite games with an excellent combination of good story telling and solid controls, as such I am going to be using it as my reference point and I expect the majority of the other titles in the series to follow in AC04's vein. I will also admit that I have not played much of ACAH due to its multitude of problems, which include the issue of controls and the radical shift in game play compared to AC04.	The controls are awkward to players use to the traditional combination of mouse and keyboard flight simulators, they involve a combination of the arrow keys for the place of a joystick and place the yaw and acceleration on to the wasd. This setup does not give the precision that a mouse and keyboard or a controller gives, it just feels really clunky. Though the control settings claim to support mouse and keyboard, that is only during the helicopter and rail gun segments, the mouse is not supported when piloting fixed wing aircraft. This is a serious problem when you consider the fact that the game focuses on close range arcade style dogfighting, something that inherently requires precision, and leads to frustration at overturning your opponent almost constantly.	 The gameplay itself is solid, if this had not been an ace combat game I may even call it good, it involves closing behind the opponents aircraft, pushing a button, and entering a “dogfight mode” where the camera is zoomed in and your reticule is expanded. In the dogfight mode the opponent is locked to your speed and can only turn, the goal is to use your cannon or a well timed missile to knock out your opponent. But my real issue is the fact that the gameplay is just so different from AC04 that it feels like a completely different series, it feels more arcady and badly put together. The controls don't help the game in anyway, so you really should buy a controller or a supported joystick (of which there are few) before purchasing the game. TL;DR: Controls are clunky and require a controller or joystick to use, the gameplay is so radically different that it might as well be a game from another series. A good game, but not a good Ace Combat.			"

												/this game in a nutshell: press x to make a ""OMG WATCH THIS"" maneuvre, play minigame ""keep an object within a circle"", woah, ka-blam, burning fighter hull flying towards you/I hate writing negative reviews, and usually just forget about the game it didn't like, but this time it was a real disappointment(or, as they like to say in the net, a nuke-grade b**thurt)Maybe I should have read reviews of other people before purchasing it, but you know, summer sale makes people blind. I've seen that the ""red line of hate"" under this game description is menacingly long, but I assumed that be the result of ""virtual pilots'"" attack(you know, those guys who think it's wise to compare simarcade with microsoft flight simulators).. Wish I knew how wrong I was...You have totally NO CONTROL over your aircraft. Damn, you can't do even the most basic barrel roll here by yourself! Roll rate is limited to 90* - you can't position your plane upside down(if you don't make a vertical turn, of course, but in that case, lol, you can't position your plane normally).  And dogfight mode.... Well, AI complete takes away control  from you, while you play stone age-old arcade ""keep an object within a circle"", with high chances to hit the buildings/ground due to autopilot's ultimate stupidity.The closest rival of this game was the HAWX(i played the first part, which was older than AC-EE). People blamed it for being too simple. Damn, there the dogfight mode counterpart had some challenge, as VR drew you optimal path to target which was often challenging to follow, there bots couldn't evade a radar guided missile with help of (wtf?!) IR flares, enemy fighters were approaching from OUTSIDE the map(while here they just randomly spawn on the battlefield, sometimes even right behind your tail), you could command you wingmen and(oh-miracle!) they would actually SHOOT DOWN something or clear your 6, flying over even a single SAM battery POSED some danger and well, stalling a plane meant ""omg, I'm gonna crash, level out the plane"" and not just falling down vertically... And UBISOFT considered it a failure! And what's more, they refunded the players' purchses!I heard many good things about ACE COMBAT series, but... well, at least this game didn't fulfill even 20% of my expectations. I wanted to play some fun arcade sim for lazy aviation enthisiasts, and what I got was an aerial call of duty.(yeah, if you played CoD you will constantly having deja vu feeling... Ultranationalist takeover in russia, chopper gunner shooting everything that moves gets blown up with a nuke, ""AC-130, don't shoot the church.. oh, sorry, ancient ruins!"")Congrats if you read this far			"

												Have you ever played any Ace Combat series game before ? No ? But I do and all of them was awesome. I've waited soooo long for Ace Combat release on to PC platform. And finally , there it is ! There is no words to discribe this game it's absolutely awesome, remarkable. Delevopers had added a heli control so now there is more fun.

It was kinda smooth control of plane, while at pc it sometimes 'lint' . Another thing to discuss is all ot those cutscenes when you're chasing enemies... well it's fine and looks awesome but unfortunately you cant take down enemy planes if you won't use 'intercept mode' . At 'standard' mode they are simply indrestuctible.... and that's awful ;/ Anyway despite those defects game is still great. I'll give it [ 8.5/10 ]			"

												One of the best Ace Combats by far. The new system makes dogfighting incredibly interesting compared to the old more sluggish and underwhelming system that relied too much on the story and less in the gameplay.

												This game takes the fun out of dogfights with its DFM (dog fight mode?) feature. Instead of having to tail the enemy as best you, you simply get somewhat close behind them and initiate DFM which takes over control over your plane aside from speed. All you have to do now is spam missiles when prompted until the enemy plane is no more. Even then flying outside of DFM is rather mediocre.All in all I think Uncle Grim's review of this game said it best. So if you enjoy being an amorphous blob of missiles spinning around in fart-circles, this is the game for you!			"

												Not just one of the worst flight combat games I have ever played, but hands down, one of the worst games I have ever played period. Clearly intended for the lowbrow, this offers one of the worst and least realistic flight combat mechanics I have ever seen, and I've been playing flight combat games for 22 years. While some of the visuals and graphics are stunning, and the story is somewhat engaging despite flat-as-cardboard acting performances, the gameplay is jerky, unresponsive, confusing, and.. well, horrible. It fails to deliver any of the excitement that is promised and is frankly just a boring, frustrating mess. It is exactly what you should expect from a console to PC port. A piece of unrealistic eye-candy that does about as much justice to modern air combat as the movie Pearl Harbor did to the battle it is named for.The controls totally ruin an already bad game. Even though I had selected keyboard/joystick setup for my PC play-through, the functionality of both are a total miss as the support kept bugging out, and the game seemed to keep forgetting the controls that I had mapped for functions. Helecopter control was the absolute worst I have ever seen, even worse than the console version, if you can believe that. The ""tutorial"" system is still the most intrusive, unhelpful piece of flaming MiG-15 wreckage ever, and doesn't even display the proper keys to be engaged (it displays the gamepad controls left over from the console version). The infamous dogfighting mode is still like fighting in a tunnel and does not give you any sort of freedom of flight movement that is needed on close combat. I couldn't even adjust my rudder to bring my gunsight down onto my banking target. The gunsight (determined by my aircrafts seemingly on-rails AoA) refused to line up on any target despite my constantly trying to wrestle the controls into place.In the end, the PC port of this game is even WORSE than the console version. I had intended to play this all the way though as I did on console, but after the 3rd mission I found that I was totally unwilling to stomach this ""game"" again in an even worse version. Uninstalling now to make room for games more worthy of a place on my SSD. The only upside: This silly thing cost me less than a burger at Carl's Jr. (I'd rather have the burger).			"

												This is not a horrible game by any stretch of the imagination; however, i can see why people may not like it. For one thing, the keyboard controls are garbage and I would recommend that this game only is played with a controller, although, I do know some people who managed to play with a joystick both successfully and unsuccessfully. Anyway, this is not to be thought of as an ace combat game, instead, you should think of this as an extremely fun and relaxing arcade flight sim and not a full on combat flight sim. If you do this then the game is a blast to play, the planes are really nice to look at and the explosions are awesome. For the PC you get all of the DLC planes and skins which are always a plus. Overall I would rate this game a 7/10 (not a bad arcade flight sim). I got mine practically for free ($1.00) through humble bundle, but I can definitely see this game going for anywhere under $5 and it would be a great pickup.			"

												5.5/10A spinoff for Ace Combat series, the second one that set in real world.Gameplay-wise, it's a far cry from the previous Ace Combat games, with its dogfight mechanic, also you can play as a door gunner as well as a helicopter pilot. Which is, quite frankly, doesn't feel like an Ace Combat game at all. Though the mechanics is quite engaging, it becomes stale and overused. Also the game is heavily-laden by scripted events, the TGT_LEAD aircrafts for example, must be engaged in a dogfight mode to take down, including the boss fight.Story-wise, it's not the game's strong point, written by Jim DeFelice, a very obvious patriotic American writer who loves to portray USA in the better light and Russia in a bad way, it's shallow, predictable, and features overused tropes and devices commonly found in a biased story. Overall, as a spinoff, this game does well, it felt entirely like a whole another game. The Ace Combat is only in its title. For hardened Ace Combat players though, better steer clear from this game.			"

												Well, first off I'd just like to say now, I WAS an ace combat fan prior to this game.I played this game previously when I was a console junkie, on the Xbox 360 after loving Ace Combat 4 for many years on my playstation 2, Back then, i was expecting it to be just the same old lovable gameplay mechanics, just updated graphics and a new storyline based in a fictuous world.I was wrong, on all fronts.They brought in dogfight mode, or as I liked to call it, dogshit mode, which held your hand through something that wasn't particularly hard to do in the first place in this franchise, which is dogfight. Now I remember Ace Combat 4 being unremarkable in the sense that there were very few moments where I'd actually have to break contact and fight off an enemy attacking from behind. But dogfight mode goes over the top with it, it happens too much, and suddenly in order to maneuver and engage a radar target behind me, I have to press a button rather than have the ability to, do it myself.not only that but the sudden need to change the camera mode in third person, i don't particularly like 3rd person anyway, but suddenly I need to zoom in on my guns when I fire them, and the same with my bombs, too. okay, namco, keep taking those tablets.  I could no longer pitch and roll like in previous games, no, instead my turning was forced at a certain angle and my speed affected how much I turned, not exactly a wrong thing, speed does affect your turning, but it just felt wrong...not to mention, suddenly your aircraft are like the T-1000 from terminator 2, they have regenerating health... HA! how laughable. Next, the storyline was America vs Russia, oh dear, not only have they removed the fictional worlds I was used to in Ace Combat, but they've also jumped on this bandwagon? seriously?!I won't say too much because, spoilers, but it feels like the aircraft version of call of duty in terms of the story, in fact most of the time it feels like story elements have just been ripped right out of Modern Warfare and applied in the most generic way possible to this game. The characters were very obvious and quite frankly unprofessional at most times, there was the overly masculine edgy black dude, the pretty blonde girl who looks like the woman from Ridge Racer Type 4, who is so obviously into the colonel, who is this really edgy legendary fighter ace (apparently) who likes to say ""♥♥♥♥"" and ""damn"" alot, then tell people to cut the chatter when he's the one talking. Then theres Guts, the overly enthusiastic dude who wants to impress his squadron leader. then of course there's the stereotypical vodka drinking russian dude who speaks with a russian accent, and you SO can't tell that he's a bad guy or something, because this game SO isn't obvious(!)so the storyline annoyed me a little but I gave it a chance at the time, trying to find something to love in this game, along with that, your player character is no longer an enigmatic pilot who you only know the callsign of, and also that he/she only flies jets (the addition of helicopters made me want to cry)so it's 2014, I feel like trying it again, following my departure from my Xbox and the entry of my PC.by this point I wasn't really an ace combat ""fan"" anymore I got around to playing 6, and then I started using my PC more, realised that there was more fun to be had so I let ace combat gather dust....I played this on the free weekend after i saw it advertised and old frustrations brewed up, the same criticisms above applied, only worse because of how badly this game was ported.   While I can say, for a 2013, game the graphics are quite good, but the options are horrific, you get to choose whether anti aliasing is on or off, and that's really about it. not only that, but the menu isn't even mouse friendly, no, you have to use your keyboard/controller.speaking of controllers, good luck finding a controller configuration that actually makes any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense! remapping the controller is a nightmare, and unless you know what button is what, you're going to find the first level a frustrating guessing game. I spent a good 20 minutes on the first level figuring out whats what. oh and that tutorial level, isn't much fun anyway, its a hand holding bunch of nonsense in which you MUST do what the game tells you or you can't get off that screen or the other guy won't die. in other words, this ""enhanced edition"" is a sloppy console port with upgraded textures... oooh wow.Namco, if you read this... I'd play Ace Combat again if the next one had an option to turn DFM off, and just have classic ace combat controls, and gameplay on a carefully ported game. I'd gladly pay £40 for the next game if it were like that.there's a point where a game can be innovated too much, and people reject it, and this is a classic example. I wouldn't recommend it, purely for the fact it's a sloppily made game with too much hand holding going on.			"

												One has to approach the Ace Combat series with the proper expectations.  If you are expecting a deeply-accurate simulation in the tradition of DCS or even Falcon 4.0, you will be sorely disappointed.  This game is essentially a distillation of Sega's Afterburner -- planes with literally a hundred or more missiles, infinite cannon ammo and explosions galore.  This game is perfect for those who want to fly fighter jets, but don't want to have to memorize a 1000-page tome on how to properly start the plane's engines.  The cheesy but serviceable story serves to move the combat from one setting to the next and you won't mind as you shoot down enemy planes from the vintage MiG-21 to futuristic concept designs straight off the blueprints.  Never has aerial warfare looked so beautiful.			"

												I love the Ace Combat series. AC6 was by far my favorite Xbox 360 title. Much as I wish Namco-Bandai would port that one over to PC, this game makes for an adequate substitute. At first I was a little upset about dog fight mode (a semi auto-pilot mode that for the most part keeps up with high-maneuverable enemies automaticlally while you just and and shoot at them), but after a while I realized; 1) It does have it's drawbacks, such as making it more difficult to evade missiles; and 2) You don't ~have~ to use it.Keyboard crontrols are pretty terrible for me. Thankfully I have an Xbox One controller, making the experience pretty much identicle to AC6 on the 360. The only difference (and a negative one in my opinion) is the absence of ""Low-G Turning"". The default controls can be set to classic style, which I've done being an Ace Combat veteran. I can't help but feel classic style should have been the default - a very minor gripe.The story is set in the real world, which I think was a bit of a mistake on Namco-Bandai's part. I'm not incredibly deep into it yet, so I can't comment on whether it's good or not.Overall, if you like the Ace Combat series,..well...this is an Ace Combat game. You'll probably like this one too. Still crossing my fingers for the slim-to-none chance they decide to bring AC6 to the PC.			"

												The jet sections are bad with having to use DFM to kill anything, and takes all the skill of having to lead targets or actually postion your plane behind them. Now you press a button click missle twice and done. Repeat this 30 times and the mission is over, and got boring before the tutorial mission even ended. Factor in helicopter missions that control so bad I had to go back to mouse and keyboard, this game is a train wreck. The health regening helicopters were far to arcady for me. You take damage and then hide to full heal, so instead of dodging missles you face tank them and yolo to get through the missions faster, how is this the best strategy. Also **** that turret mission, felt like I was playing a free flash game.			"

												Having played this game to completion multiple times on consoles in the past, I decided to get it recently with the humble bundle pack to try and check out its multiplayer; following is my review applying both to the overall game (pc and console) and some pc only stuffIt's the worst ace combat game of recent time... which means its still a good game because ace combat games are usually amazing.HOWEVER; the single player alone for this one is just not worth full price (awlful plot, very few missions, and limited missions at that, including some filler missions that might as well not be there at all with how they absolutely lack any sort of real gameplay)which is unfortunate because multiplayer is deadnot that it matters in the end because the pc version of this game is BROKEN AT A BASE LEVEL; as in, for about 80% of people the controls will either just NOT work, at all, work with severe issues that will make it impossible to play, or require massive jumping trough hoops to have them work.Stay away from this one, save your money for ace combat 7 and pray to whatever gods you worship, if any, that they dont f-up the pc version on that one.

Also I fail the mission if I dont initiate Dog Fight Mode™.Edit: the """"boss"""" is actually the one shooting missiles at me while I'm behind him. They launch and do 180s.

The DFM mode is fun but gets overused and is irritating when it is forced on you to kill aces rather than use your own skill. A gamepad is HIGHLY recommended as PC controls are too complex to be practical.			"

Many flight sims are far too heavy, but this game gets it all right in my opinion. You get to control all kinds of fighter planes, helicopters and bombers in combat scenarios. There's also an AC 130 which can be controlled very similiar to how it's done in Call of Duty. The graphics are really detailed but always so smooth. Can't fault the game, it's excellent.

												Under Rated game... Not the game for everyone but if you are looking for an intense IN YOUR FACE experience in jet warfare here you go, look no further. The storyline is forgetable the door gunner sequences are boring but survivable ... Personally i like the helicopter missions ... specially when S hits the F in Moscow... that was one helluva intesne fight... for Planes... Its Ace Combat + a few good things and - a few things from the original.Here what i like as new stuff for Jet gameplay: DFM (when not scripted) when you enter it against a normal AI it just kicks ♥♥♥ to see the enemy plane from close up and your guns fire rockets fly out and when the enemy goes down... that mini sceen of their plane falling apart never gets old. Here is what i dont like that much ... Health Regeneration (dont event start me on this one .. its just ... just remove it from games PLS) DFM when scripted, I understand the idea of having a crane fall next to my plane or a building collapse by me while i chase an opponent but at one of the boss fights a scene like this played along and the enemy planes movement + mine was just irritatingly impossible... being thrown from ""wall"" to ""wall"" while trying to get back control over my plane that the Scripted scene took away was just a downer... the idea of DFM is good but dont script it next time.also a Con is the lack of settings just like with Dark Souls... you barely can change stuff around to achieve any nice and smooth gameplay (it runs nice in SP but in MP i get some lag)overall the game is good and has the Ace Combat feeling to it when flying jets the Music is outstandingly good, the Scripted DRM can cause a headache but all other aspects are fine (mostly) wonder if any other ACE Combat will come to PC i would weclome them with an open hand (Wallet)			"

												While the gameplay is a lot of fun, the story is as typical as it can get. Some rebel group in the Middle East/Africa is supported by a Russian mercenary group that somehow manages to spark a Russian civil war, now how many times have you heard that ? It's bad enough Namco would think that moving from our beloved Strangereal to real world is a good idea and now they can't come up with a better plot ? Come on guys ! Aside from that i enjoy it. All the mission is a lot of fun and DFM and ASM, although making the game looks like and on-rail shooter is fun enough. The helicopters and bomber mission is a good improvement and it doesn't make the game repetitive which is a good thing. Multiplayer is...well...chaotic, but still fun. Another thing i like is that they included homage to the previous Ace Combat, although the console version gets it as DLCs.Overrall 7/10 it's a good game, but not a good Ace Combat game.ps.sorry for my english, it's not my native language.

												Do not buy this. ace combat 4, 5 and 0 were great.... this is not. more than half the game feels like its on rails... because it is. even in dog fights, half the enemies you come across cannot be shot down. you may score a hit but they are invulnerable. you have to enter ""DFM"" (rail mode) to be able to shoot them down. even in DFM they will avoid your missiles over and over until you are in the right section of the choreographed roller-coaster, then, then you may shoot them down.controls are awful. there are sections when you walk around the airbase (on rails). you can control your characters head... but why? there is nothing to look at except badly animated characters and poor texturing.selecting your aircraft? you had better just remember what they look like because the aircraft  menu makes you load to another screen just to check the paint scheme.

												This game really divides opinion. It definitely makes a case for a non ""sim"" flight game.If you played HAWX, there will be familiar elements in this game, but even HAWX didn't push it this far.. The atmosphere is great, the visuals are good, the dogfighting is jarring, but does a good job predicting what you mean to do (although it looks sloppy at time.).Do I feel cool playing through as a combat pilot? 60% of the time I guess. However, I would say that the single player campaigns in scripted combat games like Call of Duty deliver a similar cool effect for a higher percentage of your gameplaying time.In many ways this is a great experiment and game worth playing. Currently it is in the ""cheap"" tier in a Humble bundle too.			"

												I think this game is great but it is NOT A REALISTIC SIM so I wouldnt get it if you're looking for a sim DONT  BUY IT, but if you dont mind the fact that it isnt a sim this game is great except for a minor things. My first problem with the game is the apache missions the controls are wierd and I found shooting down helicopter was harder then the final boss. The problem with shooting down other helicopters is the lock on system for the gun aims where the enemy helicopter is, not where it is going to be so the only way you an kill the enemy is if the helicopter is still. The second problem with this game i have is with getting kills in the miami section of the game, this is a problem because I have a clear missle lock i shoot the enemy doesnt use flares or any counter measures i dont get the kill because it is part of the progession of the level whereby a jet has to fly in and around the city. I found this to be very fusrating. Overall i found that the amount of pro's did outwiegh the cons with amazing jet models that would be consided to be good graphics to this day this also gives a game a great deal of replayabilty as most missions you can choose1 of like 15 fighter aircraft to fly, but the cut sence with the pilots we wont talk about (straight up 2011 graphics). This game i found was really great to re live my childhood days of ace combat on the ps2 and ps3.Overall this game is amazing fun if you dont treat it like a simulator and has a fairly long campaign with many great missions such as one in the AC 130 gunship and the bombing missions. I would recomend this game if you dont mind it being an arcade sim			"

												DO NOT BUY if you're a fan ""Ace Combat"" games.This is not an ""Ace Combat"" game.I'd give this game a 3/10 solely for visuals, the full ability to rebind keys, and the fact it recognizes a gamepad plugged in and you can set and use any input devices it recognizes on the fly if you feel the need to switch between a gamepad to the keyboard and mouse or whatever. I found everything else poor.In my opinion this game is the Silent Hill 4, or Final Fantasy 13 of the series. The point where successfull great games and IP's become multi-million dollar + countless man-hour spent on making something that betray long time fans and are bad games on their own. I often wonder if such horrible games are the developers answer to the few people who griped about how bad certain aspects of previous good games were.Here are the reasons why I think this is a bad game:The controls for this game are absolutely horrible. I thought the $35 price point dropped instead of $50 would be worth the inclusion of random helicopters and stuff, but no. I looked at a review on IGN and I'm a fan of Ace Combat games so I thought ""Hey why not give it a chance, they switched a little gameplay between the other ones I have, and they turned out really well!"".I was wrong. You're fighting the controls in this game every single second. In 4, 5, and Zero the games had VERY GOOD controls that actually did what you wanted and nothing else and flowed really well. After beating those on normal difficulty setting and got skilled I beat them on Ace mode.In this game there's twitchy controls that roll too much, and do nothing when I need to, often at the same time in logic paradox ways. Your personal skill or strategy has very little do with success in missions.Instead of being an arcade-y aircraft game like all the previous ones, it's an On Rails Shooter and the controls similar to previous AC games are just to get you on the rails and used to fool you into buying the game. It's more like a series of quicktime events than anything else.Dogfight Mode has caused me to crash into the ground more times than all the previous titles combined! It will shove you out of DFM randomly sometimes and since many planes go down near the ground when you enter DFM this often leads to heavy damage or death. In the one or two missions with bad weather it's very confusing, as if flying in a storm wasn't disorienting enough. When in Dogfight Mode the camera has a tendency to shake violently the whole time which is hard to look at, and a serious health hazard to anyone who has even the slightest epilepsy or proneness to limb twitching/ convulsions. I'm also glad I don't get sea/car sick because I'm sure I'd have vomited many times by now.Missiles only 1/100 actually hit what you fire at, except in Dogfight Mode, not even the QAAM's which in previous titles were sure hits you saved for enemy aces, nor the SAAM's while having a lock on them the whole time.This is especially bad in the missions to kill enemy bombers which should be easy targets but you still have to enter Dogfight Mode and hit them with half a dozen missiles, even though your allies SAY they'll take out fighter escorts they don't actually do anything helpfull.Enemies are often invincible and not even targetable until you're told to attack them, even though they are already firing at you and your allies, some of them mission critical allies. Even after you are told you can attack them, ground/sea targets are often still invincible unless you enter the bombing run version of Dogfight Mode.One bomber aircraft mission is nothing but that, and it interupts you with ""tutorial tips"" that take control away from you in the middle of a bombing run making you unable to hit the targets causing you to fail the mission over and over.In the ""gunner"" missions where you man the heli gatlin or that huge planes cannons you are fighting the controls to aim at what you're supposed to be hitting because the targets are outside the edge of where you can shoot most of the time.Dodging missiles is difficult because there's hardly a second in the game that you aren't hearing MISSLE MISSILE MISSILE MISSILE (repeat constantly for hours). Flares appear to do nothing whatsoever, not that you can tell when you NEED to use them because of the previous thing, and have a ridiculous reload time. The only mission I noticed Flares actually save me is the above paragraphs bombing mission where you choose between the 117 or the B2 bomber both of which can spam flares and have dozens of flares.The bigger map radar you can switch to shows an area MUCH larger than the actual mission area, and enemies and allies are a worthless blob of colored dots mushed together in a small portion of it.Once an enemy is on your tail in their Dogfight Mode there's no way to shake them except by spamming the DFM button. It tells you to slow down and when there's two icons overlapped to level out... Gee! Okay! I'll just level out and allow the enemy to lock on while my allies are worthless and do nothing while I take several more missiles and die repeatedly! There's a hard to explain thing where you slow down and speed up to get the icons to overlap so you can press the DFM button.TOO MANY of the respawn checkpoints in air-to-air missions start out with a head on squadron of enemies already locked onto you. It's difficult not to get hit right from the start.There's also no mission briefings. The previous games had great mission briefing scenes and screens. You get no information past a little place with two words above where you select your aircraft on whether it will be air-air, air-ground, or whatever. And even that is no real indication of what you might be facing or are expected to do. The couple cutscenes that look like mission briefings give no real information, they just take several minutes to say ""hey these are the bad guys, and look at the bomb we're looking for"" all of which you already knew, the end, pick a plane.The ""story"" for this game is weak and sparse, and in most of the cutscenes there's button presses and looking around for no good reason relevant to story or gameplay. No outcome of the story or cutscene changes based on where you look or if you press a button or not. It's their way of saying ""we know alot of you have ADD so press this button, monkeys"".I might actually like this game if they called it ""Desert Strike: Subtitle"" (remember that game series for the Genesis which included Jungle Strike and Urban Strike?) and only had helicopter missions with the controls from this game. If they improved the camera angles - specifically the lag in cockpit view between looking in a direction and actually turning that way and a further up and back outside the heli view. And if they improved the weapons - you can't see individual targets until you're right on top of them and can't do anything intelligent like firing from maximum range - the 4AGM refuses to have a set target lock so you often waste missiles while strafing unless you sit still taking fire while trying to fire them at specific targets. Minus the annoying physics defying barrel rolls.That's it. End of my review of the problems with this game.Edit: I'm adding that I played this on the medium difficulty ""Pilot"" and turned the controls to ""Original"" AC mode and did not use Flight Assist which I'm not sure what that even does as I never noticed any difference in how the planes handled. I was using a gamepad to play the entire game. I did play this game all the way through because I liked the previous games so much I thought I'd see it through just in case it ever got good. It didn't.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon (ACAH)I really dig flight simulators, especially flight simulators of military aircraft.  I'm a fan of Microsoft Flight Simulator and am also a fan of the techno thriller genre from Ace Combat series or the great Tom Clancy HAWX games.  Yes, I get that Ace Combat (or even HAWX) is scarecly a ""flight simulator"", but I also frame these flying games in the realm of flying exotic (and highly classified) aircraft on a console or PC.  The Good:  Flying military aircraft on highly classified if not outright impossible missions.  The developers here did an outstanding job of replicating the aircraft inside and out!  You even fly an Apache and as a gunner on the side of a Blackhawk.  Graphics during the cutscenes are awesome!  Even shooting down some of the enemy aircraft are eyecatching events with the oil splattering and aircraft breaking apart.The Bad:  Why the developers strayed from a winning formula is beyond me.  It would seem that they tried to combine a flying game with a fighting game (think Afterburner meets Mortal Kombat).  There's only one way to destroy certain enemies and that's to engage them up close and fly low to the ground with the cinematography of a Braveheart or Gladiator swordfighting scene.  To escape some of the missiles, you need to pay attention to two arrows lining up.  Basically, they tried to hard to make this game stand out.  Controlling the Apache or the Blackhawk gunner was clumsy.   The Ugly:  Interesting story...from what I know of it.  The game play is awful!  So awful, that I couldn't trudge through it and get immersed in the game.  It pains me to say this as I love these types of games, and wanted to love this game so much as I've loved the other Ace Combat games.   The voice acting (or the script) needed work but it wasn't terrible.  Like other flying games, even the good ones, your missions require you to fly against a numerically superior air force.  Thankfully, your aircraft carries a numerically superior amount of missiles.  IMHO, this ""numerically superior aircraft vs you and your missiles"" theme leads to repetitive and quickly boring gameplay.  It didn't help that some of the missions dragged on adding little if any value to the overall story!    It breaks my heart to do this, but no....I cannot recommend ACAH.  If you get it for free, then maybe.  But no, I can't recommend this game especially since it doesn't even approach the standards of Ace Combat Fires of Liberation.			"

												This isn't worthy of what this series has produced in the past.  Imagine an ""arcade flyer"" but on rails and with the most annoying ""keep the targetting reticle on the moving thing"" minigame ever... called Dogfight Mode.  Honestly, this is just a huge disappointment.  I'd compare it to HAWX, but HAWX is magnitudes better in every way, and I don't even like HAWX all that much (although, it is a fun diversion every now and then).  I can honestly say I don't think I'll even launch Ace Combat Assault Horizon again, and I've only played through four missions.  It's that repetitive and, well, unfun.  Let's hope we see a lot less of that in the future.			"

												Not even worth the 1 Dollar you can get this game for. It's basically a load of scripts bundled to make an Aricraft-Call-of-Duty but even worse. You can see how broken those scripts even are, when you throttle up to max speed to reach an objective and enemy minions spawn around and behind you, because the script can't anticipate you being so fast.

												Its not bad at all, with the exception of the ""Dogfight Mode"" that makes it a railshooting jet rather than an actual dogfight. I wouldn't expect a realistic plane sim because this game is far from that. However the action and story is there but could be better. Overall gameplay is good. Music is very well made but hard to hear in the game. IDOLMASTERS and other customizations make it feel better to play rather than looking at the same stock plane.Very Japanese influenced game and plot. Although many Ace Combat Veterans wouldn't appreciate much of this game's direction, they would be best playing Ace Combat INFINITY which seems more at home to them and a better game than this. This game is worth the buy at a reduced price. [NOTE] The online/multiplayer seems to be dead.			"

												I got this game based on positive opinons on the series as a whole. Flying was good, DFM was okay, the turret section was boring, the plot was generic in subject matter and execution, and the helicopter mission's controls and level design were so awful that I stopped playing there. I don't understand the principle of cashing in and taking inspiration from Call of Duty, because all of the people that like COD are already dedicated to COD. Also, the Ace Combat series has a smaller audience that didn't appreciate the casualization of their series, so reviews and sales weren't good as it failed to appeal to a larger fanbase. Maybe I'll play this again, but it would have to take some real boredom for me to reach down to the bottom of the barrel that is my Steam Library.			"

												First of all, I will recommend this game for people who love jet arcade fighting. If you have or like these game (H.A.W.X, H.A.W.X II) you probably will love AC:AH too.if you really want to play AC, don't read my review afterwards.I really love Ace Combat since it's first apperance in PS1, and I just can't deny this AC:AH is a dumb-down version from every Ace Combat ever released. to summarize my review, I'll point out the pro & con.Pro :+ Graphic are nice and well done, the cockpit view are beast+ Loading time is good. lol.+ There's many option for jet, jet color, choice of weapon, in every mission. So you can refining your playstile well.+ Homing missile mechanic are improved from the latest AC, it's hard enough to avoid it, but didn't make it too hard either. You can do tricks like stall tho.+ The story a bit interesting, but back again to Russia vs America fairytale.Con :- The DFM mode really breakdown this game. here's the problem and why; some enemies (like boss or some red target) can't be taken down by just aiming missile, they must be forced to DFM with you to trigger the scripted storyline. And you will notice it just the same if you repeat the mission, even if you are miles apart from the last DFM happening. (the triggered event like, dogfight beyond the building, or valley, or pipe tower, or else). What's the point with that? you just literally, only control to have your opponent in the crosshair, and your speed. The steering is auto-pilot, LOL!- Since when your jet can regenerated health?! There's no damage breakdown like any other Ace Combat, what we like is we know if our wing is hit, or our tail-wing is broken and we can feel the downside of it. not just LIGHT DAMAGE, MEDIUM DAMAGE, HEAVY ♥♥♥♥IN DAMAGE, and you can heal up like nothing happened...........- If you play MGR:R, you'll ♥♥♥♥ yourself knowing the story almost have the same background for the protagonist. So people, if you want to be the hero, let yourself having a PTSD.Get it on sale! not worth the full price! "

												I wish I could even take time to form a better opinion on this game. However the game was just so awkward and fustrating to control I put it down after the first misison. The game does not let your rebind keys (or atleast it does not tell you how in-game) claiming that you must""unbind"" a key if you wish to map it to something else while giving you no indication what so ever as to how to unbind keys in the first place. Not to mention turning on mouse steering does not even work might I add. Throw all that in there with the 4 video settings and you have a bad PC port.			"

												I have always been a huge fan of the Ace Combat series, but this game is a huge let-down.  I will disagree that the DFM system is necessary to take down the Target Leads like many of the other reviews have stated, but the enemy forces the mode far too frequently to be realistic or to make the harder difficulties even remotely enjoyable.  Attempting to bait enemies away from a furball is next to impossible unless they are not a main target.  Main targets remained locked together in a mess on one side of the battlefield and you are forced to go into it to get anything done and that results in constant missile dodging and lock-ons from the enemy and being forced into DFM by two enemies at a time at every moment.  The AI pilots on your side are useless and pretty much never get kills or even assist in combat, unlike in HAWX.  Their only purpose is as a distraction for the enemy and they don't even do that well.  In general, I enjoyed the game up until the obvious betrayal of the Russians.  Many reviewers have said that the storyline is forgettable, but, again, I would have to disagree.  While predictable, the story should interest anyone with a good understanding of military and how warfare is engaged in.  The multiplayer seems to be where this game shines and what it was intended for, because I am completely finding the campaign difficult to enjoy solo.  Perhaps in co-op it would be more fun.A patch to the AI is definitely necessary to enjoy the campaign in this game.  Fortunately, playing multiplayer seems to feel like a much more realistic combat scenario than the BS you go through in the campaign storyline.  I will still recommend this game to people.  On lower difficulties, the game is fun and worth going through, but since higher difficulties are necessary for some of the unlocks, you won't be able to get everything like that.  Multiplayer will be a rewarding experience all around, though more people need to buy into the game so that there is more population available for multiplayer.			"

												In the sense like HAWX did introduce new ideas, for what to do with the air combat simulation games, so does Assault Horizon inject it's own new idea and works with established and classic, perhaps simple arcade-style air-combat with a touch of extra incentive to get up-close and personal. The new Dog-Fight-Mode (DFM) works very well and the story gives at least a small bit of more recognizable characters for the player to care for.All around: Worth the money, even if at full price (for current Steam standard price of about EUR 30,-)			"

Very bad Controlls, booring and odd Missions:(I'm sorry for my bad english..)The controls of this game are really bad. They are made for consoles, not for PC. You can't control the planes with the mouse, you need to use the keyboard bothhanded. It's absolute hateful to play like this. For the helicopters you can use your mouse, but either the mouse is to fast - or to slow to turn the heli around. And the mouse control is very jerky, too. On the other side you have autoaim, but.. wth? No one likes that (on a PC)...Even other vehicles or weapons are hard and very bad to control.The ""settings"" should really not been called ""settings"", you can't change enough.The graphics are more or less ok, but only for the vehicles you fly. For ground based enemies... it reminds me of ""C&C Generals"", which is now really old - this graphics are bad.There are only really really simple graphics settings available: Brightness, V-Sync and Anti-Alaising on/off. Nothing more..The missions aren't really exciting. There aren't even all in the same context as it seems.The missions are long, you don't really know so much whats happening there - and why. You are doing always the same for what felt like half an hour. (And this with this bad controls.)  Enemies just appear right from nowhere, even if there was absolutly no one a second before..Sorry, but just don't play this game..It looked good, but it isn't.			"

I found i enjoyed a lot of the game but there was serveral parts that i think they should have worked on to be better, namely the helicopter parts. These parts were by far the worst part of this this game and they are long and unskippable. There are so really good parts tho, you get turret gameplay sections which are like call of duty modern warfare (firing from an AC130 gun ship). The normal plane sections are quite enjoyable, you can choose from a bunch of aircraft to accomplish your mission, its not all dog fighting, theres also bomber parts.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon may not be a ""true"" Ace Combat game, but that doesn't mean that it's bad. I enjoyed this game, and i think it's a good one. The difference is basically two things: more variety, meaning that there's missions where you'll fire a helicopter gun, pilot a helicopter, drive a bomber and shoot from an AC-130. These missions are less fun, especially the helicopter ones; secondly, the jet missions have the gameplay aspects that you expect, adding 2 new mechanics: one where you use your plane as a bomber to target ground targets (which is less fun) and the other where you fight other jets up close and personal. This one is the highlight of this game, but it's overused. Beating bosses without it is almost impossible. All these aspects made this game different, but i still liked it. The story and charaters aren't nothing special but get the job done, the graphics are OK and the music good. There's also free mission with ranks and multiplayer to keep you engaged after finishing the 8-10 hours campaing. If you like this genre, grab it on sale.			"

												As a formor huge fan of ace combat games, this shot don't everything I was hoping for. This is the least realistic Ace combat I've ever tried(and the default ""helpful"" turning is horrible, but can be turned off, for more realistic flying) and finally you can fly a chopper...  But the chopper physics are more or less unexisting and horrible controls.(stupid that bf3/4 have such better chopper physics and controls, when its per se is originally just a FPS shooter game)   Then I quit the game and uninstalled.. Unbelieveble that Ace Combat were so good at flight games back in the days of consoles and have sunken to this level. :/			"

												Highly polished Jet action, with a thin Single Player and fun Multiplayer. Well worth the money when purchased 75% off. Great fans of the series may consider this a spin-off rather than a 'classic' Ace Combat game, and they would be right. With  the addition of Dogfight Mode the creators clearly tried to make a more visceral, cinematic experience, and they did succeed in that regard. Only after playing this game did I realize that the previous iterations in the series often reduced you to repetitive battles against large collections of HUD indicators, but here the designers have tried to get the action as in-your-face as possible. You can see what you are fighting, what your weapons are doing to it. The camera shows your plane in all it's glory, missiles launching, bomb bays opening and guns firing. This is the best-looking Ace Combat yet.Complaints about this game being the Call of Duty of the series mostly stem from the storyline, which hits all the appropriate but tired old cliche's. The story is set in the real world rather than the 'Strangereal' alternate reality of previous installments, seemingly to make the story more realistic and relatable. But it is sadly not exploited to the fullest. All characters and factions could as well have been their Strangereal analogues, making the choice to do a standard 'America vs rogue Russians' setup all the more puzzling. The only real benefits from this new setting are the locations (beautiful renditions of several cities) and the use of proper markings on the aircraft. Otherwise, both setting and story seem underused yet at the same time conspire to make the Singleplayer Campaign dull and the characters (while animated and voiced acted well) undeveloped.As far as equal gender representation goes, a grand total of 1 (one) woman is present. She may be considered part of the main cast and is portrayed as a strong, mature female person amongst the group of male characters. Sadly she is the playable character only once during the story, and in the end is reduced to the 'female admiration reward' without the writers even bothering to introduce a proper romantic subtext.The multiplayer is what will ultimately redeem this game for many people. It is well designed and fun to play, the designers clearly made a good effort to make this more than a simple tack-on deathmatch with a couple of maps. Multiple modes are available, and there are rankings, call signs, aircraft and perks to be unlocked. Certainly one of the best mutiplayer modes for a flight sim I've ever seen.Even if you already own this game on console (as I do), the improved graphics, added planes and skins and the ability to use a proper flight stick make this worth it. If you still need ancoragement, think about this: the game, when discounted, probably costs less than all the DLC you would need to buy for the console version to get the same content.			"

												This is game is very engaging, and all the more so if you're a fan of contemporary martial aviation. The graphics are great, which does nothing to harm the feel of flying a decent selection of different air craft from different parts of the world in either third person or ♥♥♥♥-pit mode. I'm a big fan of Russian war planes, and this game delivered for me from the MiG-29 to the Su-35 and 37. If you like F-22s and F-15/16s and stuff, or are into European advanced fighters like the Raphael or Eurofighter or something, it will suit you fine as well.The feel of the controls took time for me to get used to, as it's a strange way of doing a flying game for me. I found myself making customized controls for some time before i found something I got comofortable with. Also, I take issue with the apparent need to go into this close-up cinematic combat flight mode that becomes an important part of the cmapaign very often; sort of takes away from the advanced manuevering skills players need to hone that come with just flying around shooting hostiles in air to air dog fights with no assistance but a radar lock. It seems somewhat optional otherwise, as the game has plenty of hostiles that can be taken out in the more fun manner of dogfighting. I'd give this game either a 7/10 or an 8/10; depends on how much you're into contemporary dogfights and military aircraft stuff. It's pretty cinematic, sometimes the levels can be a little boring or reptative, but the flights themselves are still pretty cool.			"

												I finished this game and I enjoyed myself.  Here's why:* Arcade style gameplay.  I wasn't looking for a simulator, and this game allowed me to learn to play quickly.* Pick-up-and-play.  Menus weren't a pain to navigate, missions lasted long enough to feel satisfying, but not so long that they interfered with the other things I have to do in life.* Good graphics. They're not 4k graphics, but the game does look great with it's combination of textures and lighting.* HUD and UI. The targeting system was good. You can identify enemies, you can spot allies. I don't know if there's a colorblind mode though.* When you get close to certain targets while dogfighting, the game will switch into a fast paced chase mode. It's really fun, but there's a small learning curve.  I thought it made the game more cinematic while still keeping gameplay intact.* I enjoyed the story. I'm sure there are points against it, but I'm glad the story didn't take itself too seriously while still retaining the drama.* Multiple airplanes, including helicopters. Helicopters flew well. Some planes steered like cows.* Scaling difficulty.  Lots of easy stuff so you feel like a badass, but the game requires more and more skill from the player as the story continues.Like any game, there are some bugs and glitches. "

												Ace Combat Assaut Horizon (ACAH) is air fight simulator, as much as Call of Duty is soldier simulator. While it looks like one, it's made to be a game, not a flight simulator. Plot? As American pilot, alongside with russians you fight with some rebels. But it's predictable like kid with knife to us that russians will eventually turn against us. The plot twist? Not all of them. Yay.Ending with plot, ending with sarcasm, I promise. ACAH has some pretty nice mechanics. Most of the time player sees the world from planes' cockpit. Nice thing is, there are plenty of fighters (Not only american!) to choose, each comes with unique cockpit. At the beginning of the mission, player may also choose camo for his fighter. Looks nice when you dont like cockpit sight and preffer to play in Third person camera.  Last camera mode is placed on the fighters'  neb. Mission objectives? Hm... essential part of every level are fighter fights. If you are playing as fighter, you can be sure that there will be air fight. Besides, pilot might have to perform air strike, protect transporters (by fighting planes) or shooting down a warhead. Why if? Namco knew that featuring only fighters would be boring, so in certain missions you use different aircraft. So you provide air support as assault chopper pilot (somehow flying in theese make me feel as I were playing some console port - hitting anything without using lock on is really time-consuming), operate minigun in Black Hawk (as for me - best  part of the game), fly AC-130 (copied from CoD, but still awesome) or drop bombs from B-2 Spirit Tactical bomber. Plenty of attractions, aren't there?Make the metal bleed was the games' motto. I agree on that. Explosions, destroyed fighters and soo many more were awesome. Playing the game for graphics is totally worth it (okay, maybe ground structures could've been done better, but come on, you barely look at the ground!). And all that looked flawlessly on Nvidia GeForce GTS 250 and 4GB of RAM.To sum up, ACAH was great game. If you like fighters, and modern air combat - don't hesitate.P.S: No word about multiplayer, because I havent even tried it			"

												I Totally recomend this game. As a hardcore fan of Ace Combat, i will be the first to admit that this game is very different from the past games in the series and it does take more of a mainstream approach like call of duty, however, the fact that this mainstream approach is being done on a game that is focused on combat flight simulator style of game is something worth seeing and playing. It's fun, distructive, and you still get those awesome vibes that i've felt throughout the whole ace combat series so far. If you are interested in the more traditional Ace Combat  games, there is Ace Combat 4, 5, and zero on PS2 and Ace Combat 6 (my personal favorite of the whole series) on Xbox 360. I give Ace Combat:Assualt Horizon a 4 out of 5 :)BTW, this PC version of the game  is supior to the Xbox 360 version however, this is one fix that u need to do to get this game working right on PC. here is the link and discription of that one fix. http://steamcommunity.com/app/228400/discussions/0/864958088271414103/ besides that, this game runs perfectly.

												This game is one of the worst games you are ever likely to play. As you can see my time playing the game is very limited, so some may say this is a very cursory assessment of this game. However the reason is quite simple, I'd rather saw my face off with a shard of glass than waste any more time playing this game. Some games deserve a chance to show you their true worth, this game however needed only '0.5 hours' to make me realise what a hugely regrettable mistake I had made.Basically, the flying mechanices feel like it is Road Rash for the air, although frankly that would be doing a disserivce to Road Rash. But basically, it feels like you are still and the map/environment is coming towards you.I was interested in a co-op dogfighting simulator and when I bagged this in the sales I thought I was onto a winner, alas this turned out to be utterly fallacious. I quickly realised that the developers must have been cackling all the way to the bank and I had been royally bu##ered with my pants firmly around my ankles.If you like having your pants pulled down and being royally buggered, this is the game for you!

												I'll just list off what I liked & disliked, and why.+ Visuals.  While not amazing, they still look a little bit better than Ace Combat 6 (An infinitely better game, go get that for the Xbox 360 instead)- There's no Aircraft and Weapons buying RPG element that I always liked about the old Ace Combat games.  It gave a nice sense of progression and it's sad not to see it here.- DFM.  Basically it automatically tails the target and allows you to shoot or launch missiles at the target.  It's completely unecessary, and sometimes the game won't let you progress until you use it at certain points, not that it would tell you that.(There's a mission where you face an ace and try to defend a jet.  I didn't realize I was supposed to use DFM and trigger a cutscene, so even after I hit the dang guy several times with my missiles I still lost.  Yay.)- Story.  For some reason they decided the best idea would be to transplant the cheesy Ace Combat story into real life, automatically involving real emotions from real people and making it gritty.  I'll be honest, I did not enjoy it at all.It's like the Pierce Brosnan take on James Bond vs Daniel Craig.  James Bond isn't a serious movie series to me, so I enjoyed the former a lot more.  Sidetracking aside, it could do with a little goof to make the game feel better.-Difficulty spikes.  I'm all for having a difficult game (I'm playing on the highest difficulty at the moment) but it comes and goes between so easy you don't have to really pay attention, and 'oh god why are there eight missiles coming at me from every direction'.  It's usually after a cutscene that this happens.  Thankfully usually with a checkpoint.-Small aesthetic points.  One of the fun things about the game series is that you can look around the cockpit at all the details.  With this game that's harder to do, and the planes seem oddly lacking in detail.  You have much less freedom to look around at the panels in your plane.  Yes, maybe this is a small complaint in the scheme of things but it's all the small things that makes the game less enjoyable as a whole.Overall I can't reccomend this game.  If possible, I would go for Ace Combat 4 for the PS2 or Ace Combat 6 for the Xbox 360.			"

												Don't buy it, even if you're a fan I wouldn't recommend you to buy it. Only if it's for less than 3USD or your local currency's equivalent.Why? because of this[www.gamespot.com].On my own words, this game went in the wrong direction. It tried to be something it isn't.The game features several mechanisms (minigames) to make it easier or to try to change the formula. The dogfights are part of said minigames (if you don't use the dogfight mode, you're at a very HUGE disavantage), If you don't enter ""ground attack mode""you can't use your A2G missiles. Horse crap.And the stupidity found in certain missions, but that contains spoilers: There's a mission in whichyou have to defend an airfield of being overrrun by tanks and protect the incoming cargo planes of enemy aircraft. The most infuriating part is when you absolutely have to destroy the planes in dogfight-mode before engaging the tanks, or these won't let you do anything. Remember: you have to engage A2G mode to attack the tanks, there'sno way to defend against A2A while in that mode.And, on the final mission, you are supposed to have a 1vs1 fight with your ultra nemesis,however, that nemesis is so OP, he can travel from the ""battlepoint"" where you're supposed to fight him, to where the bombers are located waaaay back in less than a second, you can test that and see that in your minimap. I LOL'd hard when I saw that happening. And of course, you're supposed to take him down in dogfight mode before engaging the bomber that you also have to destroy in dogfight mode.This is the first game that made me RAGEQUIT in single player mode.TL;DR: if you're looking for the classic Ace Combat experience, get it somewhere else.

												A rant from an old Ace Combat fanboy.Skip to the bottom to get a summary.I don't know what to say about Assault Horizon. I want to like it, but I just can't bring myself to. Being a Huge Ace Combat fan I was hoping to see past the flaws and enjoy the game for what it is. But god damn, is it awful. I thought Ace Combat 6 was the worst Ace game I've played. This takes the cake, bar none. I take it back, Fire of Liberation!First of all, DFM and Gameplay. I hate DFM. It literally ruins the game for me.Some targets are quite obviously unkillable UNTIL you engage the DFM. Why? You can tell. Any plane with TGT will pop flares endlessly and go from 0 to 60 in 1 second to avoid your conventional missles. This is obviously to get you to use DFM. To force your plane into an often very scripted chase scene. Sure, it looks fantastic. But after the eye-candy wears off it becomes an object of pure annoyance. It takes the feeling of being a Sky-badass away and makes it into a very boring rollercoaster ride. Sometimes you'll be asked to do quick-time events as well. Press W to see something happen! If you don't press that button..nothing happens 9 times outta 10. It's completely pointless.-Second. The missions. Endless waves of very dumb Targets. Now I have no problem with scores of enemies. In fact I love it when AC does that. But when it involves mostly being forced into the ""Bogey on Your Six"" Mini-game (that's incredibly easy to boot) and DFM it really does become painful. There is little variation between the Red targets they throw at you. No enemy chatter, or at least none compelling enough to take note. The whole point of TGT was to make them special targets. Not things you hurtle at the player endlessly like the regular grunts.Missions are split between planes, helicopters and bombing missions now. I can appreciate the variation but the Bombers and Helo missions are terrible linear crap. Not to mention very boring. Blah. Toss those out.-Third. Story. Story isn't the worst thing to this game, even though I dislike the real world setting among other things. I will forgive the very typical Modern Warfare-ish plot as well. Don't expect the typical Ace Combat War drama here. It's nothing out of the ordinary.The characters are likable, albeit forgettable. I didn't quite like having the protagonist blabbering on while I'm playing but that's more of a personal nuisance.-Fourth. DifficultyI can really, really tell they lowered the difficulty of this game. I know previous Ace Combats weren't all that hard to begin with (hence the mega-bosses and tunnel missions) but A.H. really drops the bar. Playing on ""Elite"" is no where nearly challenging. Again, this points back to the various mini-games and the DFM.If you get the hang of the DFM (and you will within 10 minutes) you'll be shooting down the hardest Aces in mere minutes (so long as it's not a scripted event). You can take MULTIPLE missle hits on Elite, to which your plane will seemingly regenerate health. You have unlimited bullets (not like they do anything to begin with) and still have over ONE HUNDRED missiles on Elite. You can almost Bounce off the ground on Elite, something only seen in previous games on the easiest difficulties.-Fifth. PC edition flaws and other crapThe controls are quite awful to get a handle on. You really must have a controller to ""enjoy"" this game because Mouse control won't help in the slightest and trying to fly with the bloody Arrow keys is near impossible. Of course, all to be expected from a Console series.There's no real PC settings to get a hold of. Just resolution, AA and some other things. This was quite sad to see, since adding AA also adds significant lag for what looks to be little difference.Now the game itself looks good. Like DAMN good. They finally made the environments you play in interesting and vibrant. Not the flat Google-Earth imagery of old. The planes explode and tear apart magnificiently. Character models are well done. Overall, a good job. On the graphics. Multiplayer is mostly everything above only with REAL PEOPLE.I enjoyed it, even with DFM. Sadly, I don't buy ACE games for Multiplayer so I'll just leave it at that.Another minor annoyance that came with the ""Enhanced Edition"" was the inclusion of those stupid, stupid IDOLMASTER skins that I hate oh so much from Ace 6. God damn, we don't need stupid pink anime skins in Ace Combat. Even if a small ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ portion of the fanbase asks for it. Just don't. Please. The Nagase fanservice was bad enough.-----TL;DR Overall I give this game a 5/10. It's just Average, bargin-bin videogamin'. Nothing wrong with getting it cheap but it's not worth anything above 14 dollars. New-comers will have fun, but older fans might feel a bit left behind. Multiplayer is a nice addition, sadly a little dead now though.I can play it, but it's still probably the worst Ace Combat yet and it has some serious, needless crap thrown on it.Even worse is how it failed to gain that ""new audience"" it was clearly going for, since Ace has now been reduced to a F2P game for the PS3. Shame.;_;7  Mobius One weeps for the future of A.C.			"

												The storyline doesn't stand up to the other AC's storylines, but it had the best gameplay out of any of the ACs I've played (4,5,Zero,6)For the best game experience possible go to settings and set the control scheme from optimum to classic (Gives you more control over your craft.) and play with a controller. (However it DOES work with mouse and keyboard.)Even though it's a good game, few people play online and those who do frequently abuse poor balancing decisionsDon't be thrown off by the bad reviews, they're most likely people who didn't know they could change the control scheme to classic, or people upset that the gameplay has shyed-away from slow turn fights.The soundtrack is amazing by the way, look it up. ""Naval Warfare"" is my favoriteAlso, Angry Joe has an excellent review I would recommend watching if you're on the fence about this game. As well as the game putting you into the action fairly quickly before the steam refunds 2 hour limit is up.			"

												Pros - You can fly planes with Project IM@S skin and rub Yayoi chan's awesomeness in the face of evil Russians- Realistic and well polished aircraft designs compare to other aircraft shooting games.- The game system is quite actiony and unique compare to other aircraft shooting games. - Cool finishing motions. - Your 12 years old child will totally love it.Cons- Ultimately ♥♥♥♥ story and its also quite short.- Repetitive and stupid game system. It just keep spams Close Range Assult system.   - You buy this game to fly fighter planes, but there are many missions which you have to become a gunner of AC130 gunship or control helicopters. Those missions are just full of stupidity. Its a bad influence from CoD. - So much unnecessary explosions that Michael Bay would totally fap to this crap. - Stupid in-game cut scenes that decreases your IQ. Conclusion- Yet I still recommend this game. Dogfighting in pink F-22 is always refreshing.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon is quite entertaining if you like arcade combat flightsimulators without the depht of a real flightsimulor. Storyline is nothing special, it's very cliché en predictable but it's ok. Note: I haven't played the Ace Combat series before and I was looking for a combat flight simulation game. Within minutes you are able to handle te plane like a pro. Hower if you play with a gamepad you need to change the control to ""Original"" instead of ""Optimum"", otherwise you won't get the total freedom of steering etc. I have played this game with a Logitech gamepad and also a joystick which both works perfectly. If you have a joystick I recommend to use it, because it gives this game a little bit more like a simulation feel. Positive:+ During the storyline you'll get the chance to control different kind of planes, helicopter and control even as a gunman or bomber (precision bombing).+ Gamepad and joystick compatibility.+ Lot's of actions.+ Customization in colors of your plane.+ Different choices of airplanes.+ Graphics (in game) and sounds are fine.+ It is an entertaining game and I have enjoy it.Negative:- Lack of more simulation and realistic feel and depth to this game. It's very arcade!- Most of the time the actions come's way to quickly after eachother which you'll get tired of it and wondering when the end will comes. - Dogfightmodus which you can trigger if you are close enough to an enemy is way to arcade and unrealistic. Ok somtimes it's spectacular because it triggers other animations and events, and most of the time it is also easier to shot the enemy down but this doesn't feel and look right. - No fly-by or rocket cam.- No free flight modus. - Bought this game last week and finished it already within 3 days.Note: If you are looking for a realistic simulation game like I was, then this isn't the game you want. However I do have enjoyed playing this game and finish all the different kind of missions with satisfaction.. If you are looking for an arcade combat flightsimulator with lot's of actions, then this game will do the trick.But frankly, the game is not worth the money (yet). I bought this game for 20,- Euros, wait till it's 10,- Euros is my advise. Despite all this I will recommend this game in this genre. This game do meets all the facets of an arcade player, it is an enjoyable action game and controls are great with full gamepad and joystick compatibility.			"

												DO NOT BUY if youre a fan of the original Ace Combat series on PS2. An Ace Combat game that's completely on the rails. The only effective way to shoot down aircraft is through a dogfight mode which flies the aircraft for you, the movement is so erratic in this mode that it just gets annoying over time to try and focus the cursor over the enemy jet while it's doing 10g moves. Most of these dogfight sequences are heavily scripted with the enemy jet not blowing up until you pass through scenic explosions and carnage that wouldn't have happened otherwise and that's what bugs me the most. Sometimes planes can take 2 missiles and explode which is usually the fastest some standard jet planes can go down, but sometimes planes can also take up to 4-6 missile hits and a barrage of guns only to explode after we see some stylized collateral damage.The story is also uninspiring when compared to past Ace Combat games. Anything interesting in the plot could've been seen a mile away with as the game tries to hold your hand through its already weak plot.The game tries to make up for its lackluster gameplay by expanding on what you can do in the game: bombing and helicopter assaults. Helicopter missions are a bit weak while the bombing ones are actually interesting althought there is only a total of 1 bombing mission in the game.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game if you're a fan of the series or want to avoid an on the rails game.

												This game is a disappointment. The single player story is weak, specially when compared to previous titles such as Ace Combat 5 or ACZero (6, the first title on the 360 and PS3 and directly previous to AH, had a pretty short story as well); it feels like the story has been completely cast aside in favor of the multiplayer, which is also extremely poor and mostly dead by now. It feels shallow, and the characters are very dry, with bad voice acting to match. The helicopter missions, one of the new additions of AH, are absolutely terrible, with sketchy controls and no real way to control the heli's nose; on the other hand, the C130 attack plane is very fun to play with. The real world setting made more bad than good to this game - you won't see any of the fantastic boss battles you had on the other games, such as Scinfaxi and Arkbird from AC5 or Excalibur from ACZero, since those were made up technology; instead in AH you'll have unimpressive fights against a cruiser ship and occasionally shoot some missiles off air, and that's it. The battles against other aces (which are too few to actually cause impact on the players) are heavily scripted rail shooting sections, with little to no skill involved.Over all, this game feels like a huge letdown for the series, with many things that made the series great being cut off, in favor of poorly thought and badly realized features. 4/10, a waste of money if you're expecting an actual Ace Combat game.

												Note: I'm burning through my Steam backlog and trying out every game I have so this is based on about an hour of gameplay. I'm a big fan of Ace Combat on PS2. Now I haven't played an Ace Combat game in many years before today and sadly, the series looks to be in worse shape then when I last saw it. Firstly the presentation: The overall presentation and feel of the series I remember is gone and replaced with a more Tom Clancy-ish / Call of Battlefield modern military cinematic style; which wouldn't be so bad if this were some other game. The story is pretty generic and forgetable as are the characters; but then I never played Ace Combat for the story so it's not that big of a deal. Just a little bit of a let down. The Combat: It feels dumbed down. I remember having more control over the aircraft previously. Dogfighting  now comes down to switching to an on the rails mode briefly while AI controls your aircraft following the enemy. It does provide a more cinematic experience I guess but I didn't buy this game to watch a movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy arcade style action, but that's not what Ace Combat is about for me. Other Issues: In order to integrate variety into the game, helicopter and turret missions have been added. The helo controls just awfully and I HATE turret missions in any game so there's that. Besides, why would Ace Combat need anything else besides the aircraft missions? This really hurts the game in my opinion.Overall Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is not the worst thing I've ever played but it's certainly not worth 20 dollars. The Fighter Jet missions are still kind of fun despite being dumbed down and the aircraft all look pretty cool. I can not recommend this game based on the price, but if you can pick it up under 5 bucks, it may be worth an afternoon.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a turn-and-burn flight-sim-lite that offers stunning visuals even on older hardware, and offered up a good variety of aircraft to fly, including AH-64D Longbow Apache, doorgunner in a MH-60 Blackhawk, various fighters including F-15, F-15E, F-16, F-22, F-35, bomber such as B-1, and even the AC-130 Spooky gunship.  (Though in case of AC-130 and MH-60 you act as the gunner only).  There are even more alternate planes to fly and enjoy if you want to replay the missions. The turn-and-burn roots of the game are obvious when you are armed with several HUNDRED missiles and shot down probably over 1000 aircraft by the mission's end. Though obviously there are some tactics to the whole thing, as you have multi-lock missiles. What's new was Dogfight Mode, where you enter into a ""close pursuit"" mode where you need to keep the aircraft in the aimming circle, and when the circle turns red, your missile does extra damage (possible one shot kills rather than multiple hits).  The ground attack was handled nicely as you are encouraged to adopt ""corridor runs"" where you engage the initial point much like dogfight mode, and while in this your weapons fire faster and do more damage. Obviously most battles are done with guided weapons (except in the Bomber mission where you do need to use iron bombs). Gun kills are possible esp. in the Apache Longbow against enemy Hind gunships. The controls will take a bit of getting used to, and controller is highly recommended. As mentioned before, graphics are very nice, even on outdated hardware, and all the planes are nicely textured and detailed, as are the ground buildings. The visuals are comparable to the Ubisoft HAWX series.  And the controls are responsive. My main problem is the difficulty curve. While the first mission was easy, the second mission (Longbow) was incredibly difficult, esp. near the end, even on recruit difficulty. And subsequent missions have uneven difficulty levels. Some I can pass with a single attempt, others require multiple attempts. Fortunately, game has a savepoint system so you do not need to restart the whole mission if you do choose to quit in the middle of a mission. The game also has a robust multiplayer mode which I did not test. All in all, ACAH is a fun turn-and-burn flight-sim light, though people expecting a flight-sim may be turned off by the very arcade-feeling ""dogfight mode"" (DFM) and the ""counter-move"" (force the guy on your tail to overshoot). But it is exciting to play, and it was fun, except for the super-difficult missions.			"

												I was so excited when I saw some gameplay of this game on youtube, that I installed it as fast as I could. This is the trial version. In the tutorial, the gameplay was smooth until I flew really high and I locked on or targeted someone behind me, for some reason. My game always crashes when I go the the leaderboard, and I am not able to play online in all the gamemodes. I think if I go to create game I am able to do it, but seriously, how can the game be that broken? I have heard rumors that there is even a game breaking glitch on the first mission on the campain. I do believe it, mainly because of how broken this game is. I thought the game was so awesome by looking at some gameplay on youtube, but once I tried it, I lost all the respect to this game.Recommended? For Xbox version? Maybe. For PC version? F*ck no.			"

And most important, this is something fresh, something exciting.You who keep within the Strangereal games don't know it's true potential until you lose your mind of there, and go in this game with a fresh mind.This game can be hard at times, sure, but not frustratingly hard, hell, wouldn't be fun otherwise, eh?

												I rarely give out negative reviews or shoot down games (aren't I clever?), but this game is unlike any other Ace Combat game (especially my beloved Ace Combat 4) in the absolute worst possible way.  A textbook no-imagination ""Call of Duty"" style story, extremely limitied flight controls and paper-thin characters you can't connect or sympathize with at all.And don't even get me started on dogfight mode.  You are forced into this horrible linear pigeonhole to complete most of the game.  It turns free flight into the dullest, flattest roller coaster ever.I'm glad I picked it up for less than $5 on sale.  It isn't even worth that.If you want to play Ace Combat, go break out the Playstation 2.  Stay far away from this title.			"

												A very arcade-heavy game. If you like simple air-shoot-em-up-in-3D gameplay, don't need too much realism and if you're resistant to seasickness (flightsickness?) then this game is for you. All the airplanes and helicopters in the game are rather well modeled and look quite nice, explosions and other effects are mostly decent. The mission backgrounds/maps are rather well made and look quite nice from high above, even though they're not as pretty anymore when you're flying very low.Gameplay, as mentioned before, is very arcade-like. Every plane carries several hundred missiles and the machine gun has unlimited ammo. Enemies fly seemingly entirely unburdened by what few laws of physics the game has, they have no limit to their maximum speed and just about most of them do a lot of turns that would just right out kill any real pilot. Mission design is mostly limited to ""There's a group of planes there, kill them. There's another group of planes there, kill them too. There's another group of planes but they've got a bomber this time, kill the bomber first then the rest."" and so on. Enemies seem to have a limitless supply of pilots and airplanes, coming out of nowhere, the story never even remotely ventures into the areas of ""Where do they come from?"" or ""From where did they launch 120 air superiority fighters this close to Washington DC or Miami or Dubai?"".The occasional rail-shooter sequence as gunner of - OF COURSE - an M134 Vulcan mounted on a Blackhawk don't really make things better. And then there's the parts where you actually get to FLY a helicopter... --- WORST CONTROL SCHEME EVER! --- I will also mention the final bossfight. Now, I hate bossfights, I usually really do, not because I can't beat em, but I have no patience and no interest in unfair fights against entities with ridiculous scripted behaviour and massively overpowered stats that defy any logic and are usually only beatable because there's some ridiculous intentional flaw in their behavior patterns that allows the hero to win by exploiting it again and again.This bossfight, is of course no stranger to this stupid phenomenon. The final boss is invulnerable until you have completed a series of headspinning useless sequences of automatically following him while shooting useless limitless missiles and machinegun shots at him.

 This sequence tends to be extremely annoying, Akula (the boss) flys maneuvers which are impossible to follow and would with certainty kill any real pilot from G forceshe can do 180° turns on the spot at supersonic speeds (not joking). Well... the story.... uhm... what story... ah yes. The americans are the good guys and saviors of the world, and you are the greatest pilot ever along with some of your friends (which are apparently aswell). Everyone else is either completely incapable of everything and the russians are (of course) the bad guys. The story itself centers around some elaborate new form of city-buster-sized warhead which those russians have developed. It does the exact same thing as a nuke, but it can't be a nuke because that would invalidate the entire story, pretty much. (Oh the russians have nukes? That's NEWS!)Dialogues are mostly rather flat and uninteresting. Quick time events are rather pointlessly strewn through the game and don't seem to actually do much mostly. Did I mention that the russians are the badguys and the americans are the good guys? Alright, that's pretty much everything you need to know.Well, all things considered, I cannot really recommend the game. It's nice to play for a short time if you want something arcady but it wasn't too much fun to play. Worth less than 5 bucks I'd say.			"

												A crushing disappointment and a total let down.This game doesn't even let you barrel roll nor does it let you fly upside down, you have very little control over the aircraft which, if you're anything like me, completely ruins the game as it doesn't let you have the play/flying style that you need. You can move side-to-side or up and down, diagnal movement happens but it is clunky and forced.If you're looking for an Ace Combat game that, you know, let's you fly a plane, then this is not it.If you're looking for a fight simulator that holds your hand and confides you to its own will, then this is perfect.I rate it: unbelievebly disappointing/10			"

												No doubt the worst ace combat I have ever played.  I play inverted like how a real air plane is, and when it forces you into gun mode/dog fighting mode, its NOT interverted and its so fast that your not really supposed to fly either, your supposed to just chase them down using the basic starfox controller which DOES NOT allow you to do a classic barrel roll when in dog fighting mode.. and whats even dumber is that when your out of dog fighting mode; you go back to the hardcore/classic controls which allows you to roll the plane whenever you want... its so akward and hard to play because you can't get a good feel of the plane each time it engages like that.. and sadly.... MOST of your engagements will do that.  NOW if you played in the basic starfox type controls then I guess you are alright.... BUT you run into the problem with dog fighting.. because in a real chase I want to have that feeling like I can go upside down and go side ways and really move the plane how I want too... which is impossible without the plane having the ability to roll.I have tried again and again and I would really like to LIKE this title, but this maybe the very first ace combat that I have truely disliked and it might be the last of the Ace Combats I will purchase as well... I have lost faith in the company.			"

												Overall this game is outrageous,full on action gameplay.I recommend this to people who enjoy dogfighting and are interested in Airplanes(fighters).However there are some difficult missions,the stealth power has kick in ya,when it comes to close quarters combat with enemy aircraft.I would rate the game 10/10.As I said earlier it is outrageous and awesome  game to play.You need to be motivated to play the game,don't give in your hate if you continue to get killed in flight. There is certain times when you have climax moments.In conclusion this game is amazing in graphics,gameplay,teamwork.Keep on the good work Ace Combat series!			"

												I actually enjoyed the parts where you fly a fighter jet and the parts where you are the gunner on a helicopter were pretty exciting. And then they put me into a chopper and the game just sucked. The controls are terrible, especially compared to the dozen of other chopper games I've played throughout the years. It uses a control method that some early 3-D shooters used in the early nineties where you turn by pushing the aiming reticule against the side of the screen. Of course if you want to aim at something that is now in the middle of your screen you'll have to turn the reticule all the way back. And making a quick turn is impossible so you can't strafe around a target while aiming at it. There is a reason why only a few games ever used this control method and why it rarely makes a come back nowadays (I think there are a few WII games that use this control method, which kinda proves my point) ... it sucks big time. Since there are no alternative controls for the chopper and you can't skip the chopper missions those missions ruin the entire game for me. The developers can't claim they implemented these controls because they wanted to make them more realistic. Either choppers have their machine guns mounted on the sides and the aiming reticule would then move with the chopper (unlike in this game). Or the machine gun can swivel and aim independently from the chopper (in an Apache helicopter for instance the machine gun follows the head movements of the pilot and will aim where he is looking) which also doesn't match with the controls in the game.

												I downloaded this game in a fit of anticipation, but have never felt such crushing disappointment. I hadn't seen a new Ace Wombat game in years, and never dreamed that my childhood favourite would ever hit the PC. Back in the early 90s,  gaming was all about the three big console mascots: Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog and the unforgettable Ace Wombat. While Ace never quite had the broad mainstream appeal of Nintendo and Sega's icons, the adventures of the cheeky, baseball-cap wearing marsupial filled my childhood with near-limitless joy. 1993's original The Adventures of Ace Wombat redefined 16-bit platforming with its streetwise style, punishing bosses and catchy gangsta rap soundtrack. The 1995 sequel, Ace Wombat 2: Marsupial Madness, was much of the same, ableit with a superior level of polish and new multiplayer modes featuring Danny the Disco Dingo (I'm sure we all remember his awesome catchphrase: ""Can you dig it?""). 1997 brought the first shaky 3D effort: Ace Wombat vs. the Lizard of Oz. Unfairly maligned at the time for its awkward camera controls and risque tone, Ace 3D pioneered gameplay and storytelling techniques that wouldn't be adopted by the mainstream until the PS2 era. Sadly, following the lackluster commercial performance of Ace 3D, the franchise was put on hiatus for almost a decade, and only the most ardent fans held out hope for a return. However, in 2006 our prayers were finally answered with the phenomenal 4Ce Womb4t: The 4th Wall. Informed by lead designer Trip Hazard's battles with substance abuse in those dark days, The 4th Wall was a  surreal, dreamlike trip into the psyche of one of gaming's iconic figures. Blending the game space with reality and destroying the lines between player and avatar, it takes inspiration from sources as diverse as the games of Hideo Kojima, the artwork of MC Escher and the literature of Jorge Luis Borges. Unfortunately, the experimental nature of the game didn't translate into solid sales, and the studio was shuttered soon after. We all thought the story would end there.Now, imagine my astonishment when I see Ace Wombat: Assault Horizon pop up on Steam. I furiously charged through the payment and download screens, palms sweating with anticipation. As the download ebbed and flowed I found my heart beginning to race. Finally - a new Ace Wombat game, out of the blue after so many years of silence.Sadly, it wasn't to be. They had lied. Exploiting my cherished memories of youth, they'd cruelly duped me into buying yet another cookie-cutter military shooter, albeit with the standard ground combat supplanted by aircraft. Where was my beloved Ace Wombat, whizzing across the screen on his rollerblades? Where was the Acemobile? Where the hell was Danny the Disco Dingo???Namco. Bandai. A plague on both your houses!			"

												Utter. ♥♥♥♥ing. Garbage.I tried. I really did. I really wanted to like this. Alas, I didn't even make it probably halfway through the tutorial. I knew I was in trouble when I was greeted with the ""Please do not turn off the power..."" splash right off the bat. Plenty of decent console ports, so NBD right?  ""Please press SPACE"", hmm, I guess Space is the new Enter. Wait, did I accidentally pull the mouse out of the USB port? No, one simply cannot manipulate the menu with it aside from mouse wheeling through selections. Press E to rebind? Really? R to reset to default? OK whatever, ♥♥♥♥ it they said I could use a mouse and keyboard with this game so let's see.. Aha mouse steering. There it is, good. Set to on, I'll fiddle with the rest later. Into the game I go. Twenty seconds later I'm back at the main menu. Mouse steering does absolutely nothing. At least in ""plane mode"" And maybe I'm just tired, but I SWEAR adjusting the ""mouse sensitivity"" option actually made turning with the with the arrow keys faster. Go figure. So fiddling with the rebind options I discover that you can rebind pitch and yaw to the mouse axis controls. OK, lets try that. I'll fiddle with the rest later. Two minutes later, I'm back at the main menu. I can turn left. I can turn right. Up and down? Nope. So apparently I'm going to need either A: a controller (which i refuse to use), or a flight stick (which I don't have) in order to get the most out of this. I was about to uninstall right there, but I took a breath. No, lets see if theres any entertainment value to be gleaned from this cluster ♥♥♥♥ at all. Back into the options menus. Well, lets see if we can make the game look any better. Graphics options are as bare bones as they can possilbly get away with. Worse then Borderlands 1. So hooray for ♥♥♥♥ ugly 8 bit pixelated matte painted ground textures with  tufts of green ♥♥♥♥-on-a-stick popping out of it to simulate a city-scape. Fine. Whatever. Let's try to get these controls configured in a way I might be quasi-comfortable with. And that is where the REAL game began. I liken it to a sliding puzzle game since you can't use a key that's already in use until you bind that control to a different key thats not in use. Fifteen minutes later the house of cards that was my control scheme was almost complete. Now to bind the mouse keys. No response. Wait, didn't I already successfully rebind these mouse keys the first time I tried it? Now its not working? Wait, did clicking the currently still unbound right mouse button just escape out of the menu? WTF?! OK deep breath. Lets just restart the program, after all the ""saving"" symbol at least appeared so maybe restarting will fix the mouse issues. Game restarted, back into the keybind options and... The whole ♥♥♥♥ing thing is reset to defaults. Game over. Uninstalled. Thank you for the free weekend Steam. At the very least it saved me from buyers remorse. ♥♥♥♥ you Namco/Bandai. Please take this pathetic cash grab port and ram it.			"

												Ace Combat Assault HorizonI loaded Ace Combat 5 into my PS2 and was blown away. Everything about that game was great. I mean, that game was perfection. I beat it on the hardest difficulty and unlocked all the secrets just because I loved the game so much.When I got ACAH it was still GFWL. Now it's not anymore but I've already beaten it at this point. Seeing as the campaign was VERY hand holdy and there wasn't much room for amazing dog fights with the DFM. DFM basically rails you onto a line and takes you through a QTE.The storyline was average. I suppose I shouldn't have expected more. AC5 was corny as well but it was a better corny. ACAH was just convoluted. They dropped the alternate reality in favor of putting it in the real world and they got rid of all the sci-fi elements in favor of... giving the main character a premonition?Also, by default you are in Casual flight mode, which I didn't realize meant that you couldn't preform rolls. Turn that off as fast as you can. It's just not right for it to even be on.			"

												I rarely give out negative reviews or shoot down games (aren't I clever?), but this game is unlike any other Ace Combat game (especially my beloved Ace Combat 4) in the absolute worst possible way.  A textbook no-imagination ""Call of Duty"" style story, extremely limitied flight controls and paper-thin characters you can't connect or sympathize with at all.And don't even get me started on dogfight mode.  You are forced into this horrible linear pigeonhole to complete most of the game.  It turns free flight into the dullest, flattest roller coaster ever.I'm glad I picked it up for less than $5 on sale.  It isn't even worth that.If you want to play Ace Combat, go break out the Playstation 2.  Stay far away from this title.			"

The ""Dog Fight Mode"" forced combat system is completely baffling, both useless and tedious. The helicopter levels are shameless padding, requiring no skill and thus offering no challenge. To top it all off I had problems with tearing no matter what settings I tried. Please, Ace Combat, never do this to yourself again.			"

In the tutorial, the gameplay was smooth until I flew really high and I locked on or targeted someone behind me, for some reason. My game always crashes when I go the the leaderboard, and I am not able to play online in all the gamemodes. I think if I go to create game I am able to do it, but seriously, how can the game be that broken? I have heard rumors that there is even a game breaking glitch on the first mission on the campain. I do believe it, mainly because of how broken this game is. I thought the game was so awesome by looking at some gameplay on youtube, but once I tried it, I lost all the respect to this game.Recommended? For Xbox version? Maybe. For PC version? F*ck no.			"

												Freedom! Terrorists! USA Number One!Not recommended. Mostly because this is not a game. It's a press-space-to-win Murica propaganda video.First, the storyline. Don't worry, there isn't one. You're firstly thrown into a dogfight with some invaders in SU27s - oh look, Default Enemy #1 - The Russians. Why are they invading? Why are they attacking Miami? Who knows. Second mission - oh look, you're in the desert. But no, this isn't Iraq (yet. I assume that comes later) and you're shooting 'rebels'. This is the point where it turned my stomach. No motivation, no cause, just some guys trying to run away and getting gunned down by the USMC. No.At this point the second HUGE problem of the game kicked in and I just couldn't play any more - motion sickness. Sometimes you have control, sometimes you don't. Dogfight mode puts everything RIGHT UP IN YOUR GRILL and you have to fight with the terrible control system to get a lock. It also seems to have some kind of selective auto-aim that throws the camera off as well - so you're basically spending half the time trying to chase an enemy and the other half fighting the camera.I felt so sick by the end of the second mission, I had to stop. Whilst I'm talking about the controls, Why can't I fly with the mouse? Why am I using the keyboard? The keyboard isn't a controller. I've never used WSAD as controls to look around.Basically, this game is garbage. Battlefield 4 has better aerial combat than this. Everything this game is meant to do, it does badly, and blasts its message of American superiority so hard it makes Call of Duty look like a balanced view of world politics. Spend your £2.49 on an American flag and go and stand in your local park yelling xenophobic comments at people instead.			"

												First the pro arguments:+ Quite high fun factor + Good graphics + Nice plane design + Realistic cockpits - Background doesn't look THAT nice.+ Controls are quite good = I played this with the XBOX360 controller for PC, keyboard + mouse may be different in terms of smoothness+ The soundtrack.Following up the neutral arguments:= Multiplayer + Community seems to be sorta active, may be due to FTP weekend = It was laggy sometimes for me, depending on the host + Good hosts mean good fps - Bad hosts mean HORRIBLE fps. - Searching for games takes sometimes forever - Connecting to a match takes also forever.= Gunship parts in the story. They were acceptable. + EH MAH GERD IT'S THE AH-64 APACHE + WAIT IT CAN FLIP TO AVOID ROCKETS?!? + OH MY GOD LOOK AT THE MISSILES IT HAS - The gunship controls were a nuisance though. Kept shooting allies instead of increasing altitude. - Oh and the gunship suddenly turns into swiss cheese once Hinds show up. And in the end, duh, negative arguments:- Story took me 5 hours to play through. There should be some more story. - The story felt like a CoD story, only in short. And with planes. And helicopters. - The ending. I won't spoil here I just didn't like it. - The helicopter minigun parts were just... I didn't enjoy them really. More planes instead of miniguns would've been nice enough.- Is it just me or seem SP and MP map the same... (lazy map designers)- Steam achievements spoiled my story (of 5 hours but still it's about the principle!)In the end I give this game 6 out of 10 possible honey pots.Even though there are more negative arguments, I still enjoyed it. Seems like a mix of CoD and some ""realistic"" air combat. If you're into multiplayer, this game could be for you, cause the story is just... no. But be sure to have some patience cause it may take about 5 minutes until you find a match.			"

												Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is probably the best arcade/flight simulator I got on PC. Although it doesn't near good enough as the Playstation 2 titles but still fun to play, the Dogfight Mode is kinda awesome although sometimes I hate it when some enemies are requiring DFM to be destroyed. I don't even mind those Modern Military Shooter-esque plot as long as it's sensible.Verdict: 8/10Recommended for those who seeks the fast-paced arcade/flight simulator and not Recommended for those who prefer the old classic AC gameplay.

												This game is a disappointment. The single player story is weak, specially when compared to previous titles such as Ace Combat 5 or ACZero (6, the first title on the 360 and PS3 and directly previous to AH, had a pretty short story as well); it feels like the story has been completely cast aside in favor of the multiplayer, which is also extremely poor and mostly dead by now. It feels shallow, and the characters are very dry, with bad voice acting to match. The helicopter missions, one of the new additions of AH, are absolutely terrible, with sketchy controls and no real way to control the heli's nose; on the other hand, the C130 attack plane is very fun to play with. The real world setting made more bad than good to this game - you won't see any of the fantastic boss battles you had on the other games, such as Scinfaxi and Arkbird from AC5 or Excalibur from ACZero, since those were made up technology; instead in AH you'll have unimpressive fights against a cruiser ship and occasionally shoot some missiles off air, and that's it. The battles against other aces (which are too few to actually cause impact on the players) are heavily scripted rail shooting sections, with little to no skill involved.Over all, this game feels like a huge letdown for the series, with many things that made the series great being cut off, in favor of poorly thought and badly realized features. 4/10, a waste of money if you're expecting an actual Ace Combat game.

												Note: I'm burning through my Steam backlog and trying out every game I have so this is based on about an hour of gameplay. I'm a big fan of Ace Combat on PS2. Now I haven't played an Ace Combat game in many years before today and sadly, the series looks to be in worse shape then when I last saw it. Firstly the presentation: The overall presentation and feel of the series I remember is gone and replaced with a more Tom Clancy-ish / Call of Battlefield modern military cinematic style; which wouldn't be so bad if this were some other game. The story is pretty generic and forgetable as are the characters; but then I never played Ace Combat for the story so it's not that big of a deal. Just a little bit of a let down. The Combat: It feels dumbed down. I remember having more control over the aircraft previously. Dogfighting  now comes down to switching to an on the rails mode briefly while AI controls your aircraft following the enemy. It does provide a more cinematic experience I guess but I didn't buy this game to watch a movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy arcade style action, but that's not what Ace Combat is about for me. Other Issues: In order to integrate variety into the game, helicopter and turret missions have been added. The helo controls just awfully and I HATE turret missions in any game so there's that. Besides, why would Ace Combat need anything else besides the aircraft missions? This really hurts the game in my opinion.Overall Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is not the worst thing I've ever played but it's certainly not worth 20 dollars. The Fighter Jet missions are still kind of fun despite being dumbed down and the aircraft all look pretty cool. I can not recommend this game based on the price, but if you can pick it up under 5 bucks, it may be worth an afternoon.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a turn-and-burn flight-sim-lite that offers stunning visuals even on older hardware, and offered up a good variety of aircraft to fly, including AH-64D Longbow Apache, doorgunner in a MH-60 Blackhawk, various fighters including F-15, F-15E, F-16, F-22, F-35, bomber such as B-1, and even the AC-130 Spooky gunship.  (Though in case of AC-130 and MH-60 you act as the gunner only).  There are even more alternate planes to fly and enjoy if you want to replay the missions. The turn-and-burn roots of the game are obvious when you are armed with several HUNDRED missiles and shot down probably over 1000 aircraft by the mission's end. Though obviously there are some tactics to the whole thing, as you have multi-lock missiles. What's new was Dogfight Mode, where you enter into a ""close pursuit"" mode where you need to keep the aircraft in the aimming circle, and when the circle turns red, your missile does extra damage (possible one shot kills rather than multiple hits).  The ground attack was handled nicely as you are encouraged to adopt ""corridor runs"" where you engage the initial point much like dogfight mode, and while in this your weapons fire faster and do more damage. Obviously most battles are done with guided weapons (except in the Bomber mission where you do need to use iron bombs). Gun kills are possible esp. in the Apache Longbow against enemy Hind gunships. The controls will take a bit of getting used to, and controller is highly recommended. As mentioned before, graphics are very nice, even on outdated hardware, and all the planes are nicely textured and detailed, as are the ground buildings. The visuals are comparable to the Ubisoft HAWX series.  And the controls are responsive. My main problem is the difficulty curve. While the first mission was easy, the second mission (Longbow) was incredibly difficult, esp. near the end, even on recruit difficulty. And subsequent missions have uneven difficulty levels. Some I can pass with a single attempt, others require multiple attempts. Fortunately, game has a savepoint system so you do not need to restart the whole mission if you do choose to quit in the middle of a mission. The game also has a robust multiplayer mode which I did not test. All in all, ACAH is a fun turn-and-burn flight-sim light, though people expecting a flight-sim may be turned off by the very arcade-feeling ""dogfight mode"" (DFM) and the ""counter-move"" (force the guy on your tail to overshoot). But it is exciting to play, and it was fun, except for the super-difficult missions.			"

												This game is an arcade shooter. It is a good looking, mainly QTE-driven Japanisation of a Flight Nonsimulator. Neither enemies nor you follow any laws of physics while flying. There is up, down and the soil you smash into. Some obstacles like buildings scattered around the map. You can even crash into them and survive it. The air combat has nothing particular complex about it. Missiles almost always miss unless you are in QTE mode meaning you enter a rail  shooter like phase during which you have to follow an enemy close. With a little skill and two exceptions during the campaign you always win those encounters. The main story is OK, you see the twists coming from a mile away but thats fine. The motivation of the main antagonist seems plausible though his means are (like in most games) way over the top. But its a japanese action game, right? The planes you are able to fly are are interesting. As PC Gamer its recommended you are willing to face some technical problems. Always first installation and crash after the first mission as well as the game forgetting graphic settings are just a few. The soundtrack of this game is extremly good. If you want to have just some fun shooting stuff and be entertained without thinking to much AND you got a controller - go for it.			"

												The worst Ace Combat I've played. The idea of ""DFM"" is copied from Tom Clancy's HAWX, ""Spooky"" is copied from COD. The difficulty levels are lack of design, make some missions are literally uncompletable (in ACE level). The funny thing is, these uncompletable missions are happen to be the missions that own new elements (helicopters,spooky boomer,door gun missions etc). In some scene, the target remains invincible for a really long time (espically in the final mission), makes the mission become long and boring. And btw, your enemy can still kill you in that time. Sometimes I even don't know if I'm playing the game, or the game is playing me.			"

This game also lacks a free flight mode. DON'T buy this game. You will be frustrated. Also, no DLC, and no online gameplay. There is virtually no one ever playing this game online. As for menu organization, why can't a player reduce the music volume in multiplayer mode without exiting the multiplayer mode? What kind of air combat game does not provide a check box for mouse inversion?! This game seems like the result of obvious mismanagement of the dev team. You can clearly see the talent of the development team is there. BTW, missions are too ****ing long!			"

												Im saying this as a long time fan of the Ace Combat series, THIS IS ♥♥♥♥, THE ABSOLUTE WORST, never since the ps1 and ps2 games has anyone had to run semi call of duty missions of gunning down patches of zero threat ragdolls from a helicopter, that is NOT what Ace Combat is about.It should be about planes and not even a simulator at that end wich brings me to the second point, their attempt to emulate real life dogfights, in wich the only objective is to get close behind a certain target and initiate the event of chasing it, its way too repetitive specialy when the targets also go on a certain path (i.e. fly through a canyon, between buildings,etc) just for the OH THIS GAME IS SO MOVIE LIKE, MUCH ACTION, WOW feel.I hope Project Aces didnt have anything to do with this piece of garbage aside of lending the plane models because their games from ps2 were decent.If anyone wants to try this just to be amazed at how developers can miss the mark so bad remember to keep an eye on the play time because you will want your money back.

												Well I have a mixed opinion on this particular addition to the frachise. I have always been an avid Ace Combat fan with Ace Combat 6 Fires Of Liberation being my favourite (Xbox 360). Assault Horizon just does not hold the same feeling of fun that ace combat 6 offered. The forced use of dogfights while cool in concept just becomes annoying and less feeling like you are able to fly as you wish like in ace combat 6. Although that being said I still think it worth a play as the game still shines in some areas such as cinematic plane finishers and some dogfights can be pretty intense as the game goes on. Performance wise this game ran flawlessly in full 1920x1080 on a 6GB GTX 980Ti at a locked 144fps (144hz monitor). So no issues with performance.7/10 All in all worth a try but don't expect it to be like how you have previously experienced the franchise.			"

												The tag for the game is ""Never before has combat been so fast in-your-face."" If by fast they mean a bunch of quick turns done by the Dogfight system which you barely control, then they would be correct. This is by no means a traditional Ace Combat experience. The game itself feels more like a mobile game because the controls are so ""Assisted"". By assisted, I mean that any dog fight situation will mostly involve the game following the enemy plane with a little help from you while you fire a missle when the circle goes red. The games narrative is pretty bland, the voice acting is subpar and even in the cutscenes the audio doesn't match the cinematic. The flying even feels heavily assisted and not how you would expect an Ace Combat plane to fly. Missions tend to get extremely boring, exscort bravo here, blow up truck there, do a barrel roll. I can't recommend this game because it is just generally boring and unfun.			"

												The worst game in the franchise by far.TL;DR: to summarize: Unsalvageable music and story, horrible and long non-jet missions that play like completely different games even though you bought Ace Combat to play Ace Combat, and the only good part of the game (the jet flying) is mediocre to just about okay. I bought this game for 3 bucks and I still feel ripped off.Stay away. Play the classics (even Infinite, which isn't good, is much better than this) and wait for Ace Combat 7.FULL IMPRESSIONS:The story is completely nonsensical. I'm more than halfway through and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, who I'm fighting, why I'm fighting or even who I am and who I fight for!The only actually memorable music is the one that plays in the intro mission. It's absolutely fantastic, even, but then the game immediately drops the ball. I can't remember liking (or even remember, period) a single tune beyond the opening stage.The helicopter, door gunner and AC-130 missions play like something straight out of Call of Duty. Totally unbearable and play nothing like Ace Combat (which, y'know, is the game I want to play if I buy a game called Ace Combat). You'll force yourself to get through them just so you can go back to actually playing Ace Combat. They simply shouldn't have been there at all: Their problem is not that they are done wrong, it's that they couldn't have been done right. They're the equivalent of having a first person shooter segment in your racing simulator.When you get to the actual jet flying, the game is actually pretty decent. It's still the worst Ace Combat has ever been, but even then it's still okay. I could see myself finishing and even mildly enjoying this title if it had nothing but jet missions. By far the worst part of the flying is the infamous DFM (Dogfight Mode, sometimes referred to as the more crass equivalent of ""Dogpoop Mode""). Basically, it locks your view onto an enemy fighter and puts your general flight trajectory on-rails so that you are always flying behind the other pilot. You can still move the jet, but only a little bit so that you can aim the guns and have a fragile illusion of control.It would't be so bad if it was optional, but ace pilots (marked as TGT_LEAD on your screen) dodge everything like madmen and are sometimes straight-up invincible to gunfire and deploy infinite flares when chased by homing missiles, literally forcing you to use DFM. But even with those enemies that do not technically require using DFM, some of them still dodge like absolute gods even on the normal difficulty. It's just very obvious that they designed the game around DFM itself, and that's a huge blemish on the gameplay.			"

												Remember times, when comparing something to COD wasn't an insult?Well this is like call of duty with planes (when call of duty was cool)Arcady and simplistic, but insanely funny and addicting this is a perfect game to relax, even on high difficulties, when you can die relatively easy.Apart from ace combat being generally an arcade game AH brings this even further with dogfight mode, despite the fact, that you are glued to your opponent, system works exeptionally well by adding more cinematic look, feel of contact with your enemy, and, occasionally, beautyfull scenery around, with falling cranes, towers and planes. Out of DFM its your general flying game, when you can't spin out of control, run out of fuel, or die of some malfunction, since your plane regenerates health at alarming speed.despite its simplicity game has some nice touches - all control surfaces are articulated, flight computer voice changes, depending on the plane, variable wing geometry planes actually thansform if you change speed, all stealth capable planes have their payload hidden inside and properly animated, and the most subtle, yet awesome - all modern russian planes have unique dodge animation - cobra move, which is a signature move for sukhoi planes.Good variability between missions, standart dogfights, AC130 missions, heli missions, bomber missons.Bad things include:dead online, boss fights, helicopter missions( because of bad cockpit view you will have to fly in second camera mode, or suffer unresponsive controlls), and missons on ground attack planes (because some gun emplacements are indestructible, and some others will spawn on spaces you grounded seconds before, sometimes it also hard to understand - is it your mistake, or enemy is just invulnerable right now).Final boss battle is a complete mess, over which you have almost no controll of, in my list of crappy bossfights it takes second place, right after Liquid Ocetot fight in MGS4. (probably devs tried to make a product placement for PAK-FA, but damn, flying at mach15 and shooting rockets backwards, ain't that some hardcore sh*)Story is a total garbage - evil general BALALAIKA stole some nuclear BEARS to seize all VODKA in mother Russia, helping him are two ace pilots BORIS MATRYOSHKA and PYOTR SRAKIN, who apparently care only about nuking Moscow and some other New Yorks. Feeling sorry for voice actors, who really tried their best playing their characters. Also - main antagonist is the only character, that can decently speak russian, but his dialogues are written by a complete mоron. Japan is always falling several years behind when it comes to western market trends, year before AH came out SC:Conviction where russians aren't main bad guys, so seing so much trash is a surprise, (again, think about COD)Graphically game looks rather nice, it has some blurry look to it, but planes are drawn in great detail, and ground surface got quite a lot attention from designers, Flying in Dubai, Moscow, and DC is a real pleasure. you can even see ground troops, if you try hard enough.Overall, recomended even for non flight sim players, and to old AC fans i can recommend to give this game a fresh look and play it as it is, and not as part of legendary series.

												I've played the Ace Combat series from AC3:Electrosphere, right through to the Belkan war (the point i gave up console gaming and moved to PC)So as soon as this version was released, I bought it the second it was available on here...and then quickly gave up with it.Now the AC series is an arcady aerial shoot em up game, but this release takes that to a whole new level...Dog fight mode? Really? And those impossible counter manoeuvres, where you do the stupidest backflip and land perfectly on your enemies 6. Why?Also, if you do not change the game setting, you're forced to fly with limited control and the inability to roll your aircraft upside down, Why would they have that set as the default control setting? You want to get in, go, dogfight and play the game, not fettle with the settings to be able to have full control.Its as if, during the planning and developing of this game, they were like ""hey, how can we make this as arcady and silly as possible""Its still fun to play, but the extreme arcadyness of it takes the old Ace Combat feel away from it.I played the first handfull of missions then gave up...But with the announcement of Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, to be released on PC, I have been giving this game another go, as I said, its still fun to play, but the nostalgia from the old Ace Combat games has gone, they added features that were never needed.But I really do hope, that AC7 is like the older AC series, and does not have all these unnecessary features that Assault Horizon has.As far as I know, the man who created to storyline for for the PS2 versions of AC, is back with the team for AC7, so heres to hope for an epic story to the game. All in all, Assault horizon has alienated the most of the fans of the AC series, but the game itself is not a complete wash out. "

												I must say I really enjoyed this game. Well most of it. The story and cut scenes were really long and boring, so half way through I just started skipping them. This is a very arcady flying game. The dog fight mode is cool because it adds more excitement to these types of games. The variety of missions was great. Sometimes it's fun to just sit on a gun and drop guys. A few things I didn't like. When you blew up the last of a group, it would cut outside your vehicle and show the explosion up close. It was neat a few times, but then it started happening too often. Also when you are on the gun in the bomber, it's really jarring. Missions were really long. I probably would have prefered a more smaller missions. The game also tries to automatically flip you upright. I found myself fighting that part of the controls. That feature was useful once you just let it happen. Overall it was a good experince. I didn't try the multiplayer, I've got too many other games to try. If you are looking for more of a flight sim, this isn't the game for you. But if you are up for a fun gameplay experience, give it a shot!			"

												There is still fun to be had from playing this game but like many others i got this in a bundle so i wasn’t expecting it to blow my mind or at least I don’t mind if it doesn’t. DFM, a mode in which you enter a dog fighting chase with the enemy, is overused and the missiles seem to have no AI at all. Normal units are dumb as a rock and TGT_LEADS, equivalent to the elite mob bosses in world of Warcraft have infinite flares and seem to be untouchable, until you engage them in DFM where they toss you round like rag through the ground assets until you crash. This game i think has a steep learning curve and is better played with a flight-stick which i suspect is the reason everyone is having a hard time with the controls. Story line is admittedly a bit point less they should of kept it basic like the ones released on PlayStation one, no talking strait to business would have been better. Money I’d pay = £4.99Personal Rating = 6.64/10Hours of fun = 4-6 hours without friends "

												As a longtime fan of the Ace Combat series, I have always enjoyed it's place in the arcade fighter simulator genre. Cool planes, crazy aerial boss battles, canyon/trench run challenges and conflicts in the fictional Ace Combat universe were hallmarks of the series. Unfortunately, Assault Horizon decided to completely throw out many of the core gameplay elements and themes that had made previous Ace Combat games so enjoyable, and decided to pursue a Call-of-Duty approach to gameplay and storyline. One of the most egregious additions is the Dog-fighting mode, where with the press of 2 buttons, your plane magically maneuevers itself on the tail of the enemy and sticks there with minimal effort. Meant to highlight the ""action"" it just turns dogfighting into a glorified QTE. One new direction that AC:AH took that had promise, but was poorly executed, was the expansion into other types of aircraft, including bombers and helicopters. Unfortunately, these levels seemed less about flying and more about aiming your recticle over targets on a screen (think AC-130). The end result was gimmicky execution of what could have been some very interesting and fun set pieces. Overall, AC:AH has been a disappoinment. It could not deliver the experience of previous installments and failed to win me over with its new mechanics.			"

												If you've played any of the eariler Ace Combats such as IV, V, or Zero, this will be a major dissapointement.  Realism is nonexistant.  You don't have complete control of your aircraft while engaging in a dogfight, which is a major disappointment, especially when performing ""special"" maneuvers.The cutscenes are definitely something out of a Sunday evening soap opera.  Everything they say would never be said by anyone and their actions to match situations are plain embarrasing.  There's not even a decent selection of aircraft to pilot.Graphics are exceptional, but it doesn't make up for the awfulness of this game.

There's just not much of a sensation of flying, just a giddy open space with the ground at one end.2nd level is a helicopter gunship mission like the one in COD4, only...  I spent the entire mission shooting at my own side out of a bloody-minded sense of rebelliousness and mysteriously passed the level. Seriously, I didn't shoot (at) a single 'bad' guy and apparently it didn't matter one bit. Oh, does the level end in a big mushroom cloud just like in COD4? Yes, it does, only... smaller.

												As a series-long fan I was initially concerned about the more realistic direction that the franchise seemed to be taking with Assualt Horizon. However, because I enjoy the development team and flying games in general, I gave it a shot. Other than to satiate curiosity, I wish I hadn't given the game my time. While the flying itself is solid, the introduction of the dogfighting mode added cinematic flair, but also removed me from the action. Additionally, during some of the larger skirmishes, it seemed to open me up to more missile shots than I'd normally expect in an Ace Combat game (even on harder difficulties). The fighter gameplay is acceptable, though not on par with the other entries in the series, and unfortunately new flight additions to the game only detracted from the experience. The helicopter controls didn't feel quite right, nor did the shooting while on board. I see what the devs were going for, but they didn't succeed in it. Likewise, the AC-130 experience was virtually ripped from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Certainly there's only so much one can do with an AC-130, but the experience felt put in to appeal to a broader audience, but at the cost of what Ace Combat has been about for almost 20 years. Graphically the game is solid, nice effects. The soundtrack was fairly forgettable, standard military game fair. The controls were solid (I used a wired 360 gamepad), so no big complaints there. Finally, the story wasn't the fantasy/reality blend of previous titles, but more standard military drama with obvious plot twists that one could see from 40,000 ft. As a fan I was not impressed, and frankly other games have told the same story in better ways. Ultimately, I would not recommend purchasing Assault Horizon unless you need an arcade flying game fix. Previous Ace Combat games were better, there are a great deal of excellent flying games on the PC to play instead of this.			"

												this game is abomination to the ace combat series.  i have played nearly all other ace combat games and had high hopes for this.  graphics:as far as graphics this game is nice to look at, the airplanes fly like they are supposed to and visually it looks on par for the current generation of games.  controls:if you have played any ace combat games the controls are familiar especially when using the xbox 360 gamepad.  it plays very well using the gamepad gameplay:this is where the game takes a turn for the ugly.  at first your put in the game its a very familiar ace combat experience.  you fly around with plenty of chatter going back and fourth.  some evil faction is attacking a city and you need to defend it.  then your are strapped into a sweet f22 armed with 100 missiles and told to go kick some ♥♥♥.  whats wrong with that you may ask yourself?  well you can get good position on an enemy and have lock on them and fire all your missiles and miss every time.  the game forces you into this weird dog fighting mode that attaches you to the enemy and you take it down with a series of missiles or guns.  its cool for the first maybe second time you use it but after about the 10th enemy you take down it becomes and exhausting effort for which becomes repetitive very fast.  their are also helicopter missions which increase this feeling of exhaustion.  this mode exasperates the feeling of mediocrity when you just cannot control the helicopter like you want it to and ultimately get frustrated and turn the game off.  the story is also very boring and just does nothing to draw you in and make you want to play the next mission.verdict:overall this game is pretty, controls very well, but ultimately the story and the forcing of these new features (dog fighting mode, helicopter missions) really kill this game.  I only played a couple of hours in this game but once i killed about 20-30 enemies exclusively using the dog fighting mode i was frustrated and bored.  there is no skill involved in using this its pretty much lock on and the computer controls your airplane and you shoot down your  enemy over and over again.  then when you think the game could not get any worse you get the helicopter mode which is where i turned off the game.   I wanted to like this game soooooooooooo much i love ace combat games i even bought the ace fight stick for ace combat 5 for xbox  but this game is such a letdown i wish they would have just stuck to what makes ace combat so good and got rid of all this extra crap (or even allow a player to avoid the extra modes).

Watch a playthrough on YouTube if you really want to find out what the fuss is about, because there's not much difference between that and being led by the nose through its short, disorganised grab bag of missions, too many of which are wasted on aircraft which aren't jets or particularly fun to sit through.

												Reviewed in Oct. 29, 2011 at...http://that-riyadh-gamer.blogspot.com/2011/10/review-ace-combat-assault-horizon.html“Make Metal Bleed” as the back cover of the game saidIf you ask me what’s my best jet fighting simulation game i’ve played in my life, that would be Ace Combat series. I played most of them since the first one on PS1. All my life, i never found another game that can par with NAMCOs’ masterpeice. After a long wait for consoles since Ace Combat 6, it’s back with agressiveness pushing away other games that tried to challenge one of NAMCOs’ pride and asset. Though did it delivered well? We shall see as i share my thoughts on the game. Presentation:“Modern Warfare in the sky”The set up is now mentioned in actual world locations, mentioning from previous trailers are Miami, African locations and many more. Surely the game won’t be complete without a storyline and now it’s been aided by a New York Times bestselling military author Jim DeFelice and shaped a story about Lt. Colonel William Bishop from the Warwolf Flight Squadron and his quest to stop a Russian terrorist named Col. Markov “Akula” who has a weapon that can blow up pretty much a city. Unlike the previous and traditional Ace’s direct mission briefing then take off segment, they added some QTE (Quick Time Event) elements for you to react while off the plane (Heavy Rain-ish) which basically pointless for me to be honest. But gladly the phasing is fast & it won’t take long till you get on a mission. It’s a new gesture from the game and also trying other weaponries and aircrafts. Let’s say aside from flying planes, one of them is you can fly an AH-64D Apache Longbow, a gunner on MH-60 Black Hawk and other planes with different functions depending on the given mission. So basically it’s a different curve but it’s still a welcomed add on.Graphics:There are no traces to disappoint the game in terms of visuals. The textures on a blown enemy aircraft is spot on, however I laughed when I saw a blown pilot wasn’t ripped to shreds as I blew his plane sky high. But I guess to avoid being flagged as a bloody game perhaps. But none the less, seeing a shattered plane gives you the sense of sweet victory after taking them down on plane after the other. Gameplay:You fly a plane & blow some stuff up, simple? Well it used to be like that but the new installment has some treats to keep you occupied for a bit by flying attack choppers, bombers and also a gunner. Though the main meat of the game is to be the Ace in the air and fly planes with different specs and specialties for each given mission. The new main element of the game is the Close-range assault “Dogfight mode”. It can be activated when you’re close enough to an enemy plane; there, the controls will turn into a semi automatic tailing enemy planes (which is a bit silly for me but it made up by taking control on a close range attack) and stick with them as long as you can till you destroy them in mid-air, that way you will feel the sense of satisfaction after each kill. However there are two kinds of control mode whereas semi auto pilot “Optimum” for those who are new in the genre (which I don’t like to use) & the “Original” mode for those who are veterans (like me) on the game that will let you fully control your plane and do as many barrel rolls as you pleased. Each plane has their own special weapons and class whether a bomber, an air-to-air or both. There are tons of planes to choose from and that will also please the fans and keep them busy searching for their favorite plan/s (where are my Su planes from the start of the game!!!). Aside from the single player, the multiplayer is back with co-op or a death match for all 16 players and plane customizations. In co-op mode, you can team up with a trusted buddy while on 16 multiplayer, first there’s Capital Conquest where each team has a group base to protect and destroy the other team’s base; there’s also Domination where you capture ground installations and lastly there’s the classic deathmatch where it’s more intense than the single player by taking down a real player to see who dominates the skies. So basically the other half of the fun lies in the multiplayer.Audio:In terms of voice acting, it’s pretty stiff which sometimes feel like the character’s movement didn’t blend well to the voice acting. I also found out that the sound quality wasn’t that epic enough for my 5.1 surround sound headset which I found that the music was louder than rest so I had to adjust the volumes. But on the brighter side, its well done in terms of explosions, weapons and epic OST which has a mixed of Rock Metal & Orchestra feel to it; plus a one of their track called “Rush” gave me Goosebumps whenever I hear the guitar solo. Overall:Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is actually a good game but not as great as Ace Combat 5 for me. The gameplay, graphics, OST are there but the storyline fell short and wasn’t as epic as I experienced in AC5s' “The Journey home” song which the game also represents “world peace” from two giant fictional country fighting earch other that almost made a world war. But none the less, this game is a welcomed from its genre; Project ACES still is untouchable and cannot be compared when it comes to making a good arcade jet fighting simulator game. So if you ask me again what’s my favorite fighting simulation game? I’d still say NAMCOs’ Ace Combat series and this will be one of them but the best of them. This will be welcomed for young aces with the help of putting a modern feel to it; and for the fan of the genre, go get it, it's worth the wait and you can't find anything better than Ace Combat.Pro(s)Intense new Dog fight systemAwesome Multiplayer Breath taking OSTUsing other air craft Faster phased air combat in the seriesCon(s)You can forget about the storylineA few missions doesn’t feel rightPointless off battle interactions at timesPointless QTEs			"

												Having played Ace Combat when I was younger on Playstation and Playstation 2, I've always been a huge fan of the series.  This game is not like the others.  Sure it's pretty to look at but I can't get over how the chase feature is completely rammed down my throat.  I should be able to kill how I see fit.  The chase mode should be an option to kill, not THE option.  I can't help but echo some of the reviews below me, the story is bland, the characters are uninspired.  For God's sake... there's a part where you're on a helicopter doing barrel rolls. smh.   I can't believe Bandai Namco did this.			"

												this game is abomination to the ace combat series.  i have played nearly all other ace combat games and had high hopes for this.  graphics:as far as graphics this game is nice to look at, the airplanes fly like they are supposed to and visually it looks on par for the current generation of games.  controls:if you have played any ace combat games the controls are familiar especially when using the xbox 360 gamepad.  it plays very well using the gamepad gameplay:this is where the game takes a turn for the ugly.  at first your put in the game its a very familiar ace combat experience.  you fly around with plenty of chatter going back and fourth.  some evil faction is attacking a city and you need to defend it.  then your are strapped into a sweet f22 armed with 100 missiles and told to go kick some ♥♥♥.  whats wrong with that you may ask yourself?  well you can get good position on an enemy and have lock on them and fire all your missiles and miss every time.  the game forces you into this weird dog fighting mode that attaches you to the enemy and you take it down with a series of missiles or guns.  its cool for the first maybe second time you use it but after about the 10th enemy you take down it becomes and exhausting effort for which becomes repetitive very fast.  their are also helicopter missions which increase this feeling of exhaustion.  this mode exasperates the feeling of mediocrity when you just cannot control the helicopter like you want it to and ultimately get frustrated and turn the game off.  the story is also very boring and just does nothing to draw you in and make you want to play the next mission.verdict:overall this game is pretty, controls very well, but ultimately the story and the forcing of these new features (dog fighting mode, helicopter missions) really kill this game.  I only played a couple of hours in this game but once i killed about 20-30 enemies exclusively using the dog fighting mode i was frustrated and bored.  there is no skill involved in using this its pretty much lock on and the computer controls your airplane and you shoot down your  enemy over and over again.  then when you think the game could not get any worse you get the helicopter mode which is where i turned off the game.   I wanted to like this game soooooooooooo much i love ace combat games i even bought the ace fight stick for ace combat 5 for xbox  but this game is such a letdown i wish they would have just stuck to what makes ace combat so good and got rid of all this extra crap (or even allow a player to avoid the extra modes).

												I have no idea how you make high tension dogfights with incredible graphics so horribly bland, but ace Combat accomplishes this perfectly. I found myself just wanting to exit the mission that just DRAGS on but not wanting to have to relive the horribly paced dogfight circle dogfight the game forces you to do AD NAUSIUM.   Its just waves of boring cookie cutter aircraft showing up out of nowhere and attacking, no story, no face to the enemy, not even very well used setpieces.   The best part was the randm missions they throw in where I actually get to shoot something but this requires me to be out of the aircraft the entire game is built around. Not even on sale is this worth your cash.			"

												An insult to the Ace Combat series.You have no controls over the flight, you can't roll or yaw, only go left or right, the game is gonna decide how to do it, when you're upside down it just doesn't let you do what you want and tries to readjust to a ""normal"" position. Most of the shooting mechanics is relegated to a ""dogfight"" mode which takes autocontrol of the plane and you just have to position a reticle over the enemy plane to hit it. Stay away from this, if you want ace combat play 5 or zero, they are the best.			"

												What have they done?I was so excited when I saw this on Steam. Been a fan of the series since Ace Combat 2 on the PS1. With a score of 77/100 on Metacritic, I thought it would be a good fun game, since I have enjoyed other games with a similar score. Even though reviews said it was not as good as previous titles, I thought it would still be an enjoyable experience. Boy, was I wrong...Ace Combat has always been an arcade flight simulator - never going for complete realism. But, this game is out of control. it has gone from a fun shooter with an enjoyable story, to a Quick time event (QTE) monstrocity with a the most generic, predictable, over-the-top, ridiculous and boring plot I have even seen. Gone are the days where you fly around picking and shooting bad guys out of the sky. If you try that, you will never get anyone as they just fly around in circles. Now, you have to get up behind virtually every enemy and enter a QT event - press ""Q"" now... press ""Shift"" now - in order to take enemies out. The combat has mostly been replaced with other rubbish too. You have to use a gunship and sometimes take control of a gun on a helicopter. Even your old health bar is replace with regenerative health. You can see they are trying to appeal to idiotic Call of Duty fans.Then there are lazy port problems. I never experienced any bugs, and it ran perfectly well with everything up. That is where I must begin: the graphics options are the most limited I have ever seen. All you can really do is change the resolution. And, when you set your resolution, the game does not look very sharp, as if it has been upscaled to your native resolution. It is also not enhaced in the slightest. Tom Clany's HAWX looks better than this. Textures are all muddy, particle effects are a joke, and models have quite a low polygon count. Then the lighting is just an over-use of bloom. The FOV is also rediculous; the plane takes up far too much space on screen. It is liked you are playing zoomed in the entire time.Then you have the controls. They are just Xbox 360 controls assigned to keyboard keys. Very bad; they take no advantage of the PC's capabilities. Becomes quit irritating, trying to navigate the menus and such.In ""Call of Dutying"" the game, Namco have completely destroyed the seres in the process. Could not even finish this game as a result. This is one of the worst purchases I have even made, and does not deserve the 77/100 on Metacritic. Do NOT buy this game, even on sale.3/10			"

												I am really liking Ace Combat Assault Horizon. It really is easy to learn but hard to master kind of game, I love the action and the speed of the ""dogfights"", overall I find the experiance of flying fighter jets in ACAH thuroughly enjoyable, but nevertheless there are some issues. I have found Ace Combat AH has a ton of bugs (mostly menu related, at least I have experienced a few of them, they are as follows. I crash alot when viewing the leaderbored, I crash during a certain cinematic in single player and there is a ton of wierd for me when I navigate the menus, now I dont always experience these bugs, but they are occurring frequent enough that I mention them in my review. Overall though I think Ace Combat AH EE is worth a play, It is worth the 5 dollars USD its priced at the time of this reveiw, but if you get a chance to try it free even better. You just it may so happen that you will agree with me, A.C.A.H. E.-E. is pretty cool.			"

I've gotten a kill several times only for the pre-scripted debris fly-though to leave me pointed at the ground with 50 feet to go... Not great.			"

												Honestly i don't see why fans of the older Ace Combat games Hate this one so much, It has amazing Graphics a Kick ♥♥♥ soundtrack and around 40 planes to Fly into combat.  The DFM mode makes multiplayer possible, Instaid of akward long matches with people Effortlessly avoiding all of your rockets DFM makes your enemy EAT your rockets!,  It does have some problems though, The campain is pretty much Russia Bad, Murica Good! and none of the charecters are really that memorable. All in all this is a Great Arcade sim.			"

												This game was recently patched to remove the GFWL which is good.  However the game is still contains gamebreaking bugs.  At first when I got this I couldnt even start the game using a controller the menu would just infinitely scroll.  While I may expect that using a third party controller this is a standard everyday no frills wireless 360 controller.  Before the patch I couldnt start the game.  With the patch I can start the game and the jet parts with fights work well.  Anything with a helicopter it seems are broken and the triggers dont work for some reason.  I dont know if it will be patched now its been years for them to make the menu work so I could launch the game and maybe in a few years the helicopter part will work, who knows.  The jet flying for aerial combat is pretty strange, enemy planes tend to fly in circles right around you or right behind you for some reason.  There is an odd mechanic where if a plane is behind you, you can QTE by pressing LB + RB and you flip behind the plane somehow and you blow them up.  This is odd because in the game this maneuver cant be performed as in you cant do a flip in your plane.  So yea its real basic and I guess half the game works if its split between jet fights and helicopter fights since the helicopter fights dont work with a controller.  There is also no horizon control meaning if you turn right you turn right, and there is no way to keep the plane level or adjust this making this just a terrible flying game in general since even the basic ability of being able to play is it messed up so badly.The game uses a VATS shooting thing like from fallout but in this game its called DFM for DogFight Mode.  Its a zoomed in battle making it like an FPS in the air.  A strange choice for an aerial combat game and doesnt really feel like it belongs and isnt very fun.  The concept should be fly a plane and blow up stuff, not change to FPS mode to do it, it just doesnt make any sense.Still broken, but the jets controls work now, so its half a game.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												Really didn't like the direction that this version of Ace Combat took. It departs from the previous games and turns dog fighting with jets into a series of QTE's. Yeah ok.. I still wanted to play and then the helicopter level happened. It totally sucks. The game sucked so bad I let this game take HD space for over a year. I guess I kept wishing that I would come back to it and forgive it's manys flaws. My fond memories of earlier versions of Ace Combat wasn't enough to overcome the suck. The suck is strong in this one my friends and as such it was uninstalled forever.This is not the ACE COMBAT you are looking for "

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.   Let's see...how to begin this.  I love the Ace Combat series.  So much that I have some sort of stockholm syndrome and ignore the normal cheesy 'writers do no research on war' storylines.   First, unless this game is ~$5, DO NOT BUY IT. Period.  Your steam code will not activate GFWL.  That means no multiplayer.   Half the game gone like that.  There is no solution.  Steam will direct you to GFWL and GFWL will direct you to Steam, any further comments will be auto-ignored. Seriously, read the discussion boards.    The highlight of this game was ""Written by americans who professionally write tom clancy style novels"".  Not only does this not fix the writing problem previously stated, but it's more painful because its set in the real world.  The writers obviously did not google ""NATO relations with Russia"".  Real world makes it worse if you know anything about history.  Let's move on to the game.  Plenty to talk about DogFightMode.  You can see the good idea behind it, except that it forces you to use it.  It forces you because half the enemies are immune to damage unless you DFM them.   Camera angles are jacked up.  The camera does not stick behind you like all 7 previous games and when doing maneuvers will face the ground making sure you have no idea where you are guiding yourself exactly.      Speaking of controls, they put a flight game on the PC and gave it no flightstick support.  The xbox AC games have support....and a special flightstick made for it.  WTF.  BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE GAME : PACING.  Cutscenes are fine and help develop stories, but do I need to be forced to walk through hallways in buildings for 5 minutes only allowed to turn my head and looks a people with no interaction?  It does not help except to give me time to get a beer from the fridge.  In game too, many missions including the helo/gunner missions just drag on...sometimes for 40 minutes.  There is no skill in these modes, but it just wont stop.  I want to pass it to get to the next jetfighter mission, so I just rubber band the trigger (hint: you cant die and you have infinite ammo).  The helo mission don't even fit into the story flow and little reason is given.  It is direct jealousy of the Call Of Battlefield franchises. Just like how the R6 games failed starting with R6V2.  The last part I will comment about is the skill.  There is no thrill anymore because missiles are near infinite, life of you and the enemies regenerate fairly quickly, and you can survive from hitting the ground and other fixed objects.   Final thoughts:  TORTURE.  You can clearly see the AC game and fun you could be having with this, but everything seems to be set up to make it as annoying as possbile all while demeaning you.  Especially with achievements.  ""You passed the tutorial"" ""you pressed 'Y' when we told you""  ""You watched a cutscene"" ""You hit objects with an infinite chaingun"".  Good for you.			"

												Free is too expensive.But in case you need more convincing, let me tell you what's what. Ace Combat is not - and never has been - a flight sim. It's a long-running franchise hailing from Japan, eminently focused on high-speed arcade action. It has always had very, very little at all to do with reality, save the inclusion of detailed plane models based mostly on real-life military fighters and bombers.As a flight-sim enthusiast, some would consider it a crime for me to admit that I really do enjoy arcade flight games. They're a great fallback for those times when you want to splash some bogies, but you don't have the time or the inclination to go full-real (or even semi-real, honestly). I've played Ace Combat games for years, since I was a kid, and it was probably Ace Combat among other games that helped foster my later interest in more authentic fare. I started with Ace Combat 2: Electrosphere on the original Playstation, and let me tell you: the title of that game says it all. Ace Combat has a track record of featuring crazy, wonky, way-out-there fantasy elements, up to and including the absurdly massive flying superweapons that are a genuine staple of the franchise.Ace Combat was never about being serious. It was about flying around a surprisingly well-modeled, realistic-looking plane incongruously stuffed with 200-plus anti-everything missiles, and blowing things up with reckless abandon. This and Armored Core was where it was at back in the day, and it was a glorious time to grow up in.Now, AC4 tried to shake things up a bit by introducing a ""relatable"" ""story"" with ""characters"" and such. And it's fairly poor. Thankfully, it doesn't detract from gameplay too much, as the background chatter is easy to tune out, but if examined at length...oh boy. The writing was chunky and oftentimes silly, and the low-grade-anime-quality voice actors delivering the lines made for a very embarrassing experience.""Yeah, we won! Now let's sing our dramatically overwrought national anthem as the camera pans dramatically around our planes! YEAH!""But AC5 didn't improve its horrible dialog and hand-wringingly bad voice acting. In fact, it made it *worse,* as ""story"" became an increasing focus. And then AC6? Oh my and dear me. Just go YouTube the intro, or look up ""dance with the angels - "" actually, no. Don't do that. You'll die of embarrassment. Actually, you should, because the sheer temple-drilling horribleness of that dialogue atrocity is actually important to this review.For years, the core gameplay never really changed between sequels. It was all about going from one target to the next, getting a lock-on, and then double-tapping the missile button to launch precisely two missiles, and flying off to the next enemy. It's fun, for a while, but without any real evolution going on in the background, franchise fatigue was inevitable.So what did they change? Is this game ""Call of Duty with wings,"" as so many reviews claim? Ha, well, the answer is that they changed everything, while actually changing nothing. Let me explain in brief.The ""innovations"" consist of one central new ""feature:"" Dog-Fight Mode. That's right. ""Mode."" As in, one of the core aspects of air combat is now a ""mode."" There's also a differently-named variant for ground attacks, but it's the exact same concept: press a combination of two buttons, and you lock into a more or less on-rails scripted sequence where you keep your target or targets centered while your missiles lock on.I don't even really mind the system in theory. Really, they HAD to do something to change things up, because even as a long-time AC fan, I was getting bored of the one-button double-tap missile fest the game had stubbornly been for years.  What they were trying to achieve with DFM was to add some depth to air battles, make them more dependent on timing and reading movements. It actually plays much better in practice than it sounds going by my description of it. But here's the problem: occasionally, the game uses DFM as an excuse to pretty much put you through an on-rails theme-park ride that's scripted to the end. Don't balk too much - after all, Grand Theft Auto has been doing the exact same thing for years with every single one of its ""dramatic car chases,"" and it's a million seller. But let's be honest - it still sucks.DFM is actually okay on its own. It's got flaws, but the core idea is sound. It takes all the concepts of energy and g-forces and simplifies the crap out of them so as not to burden the core arcade experience with excessive realism, giving the occasional dog-fight a fraction of the intensity and strategy of the real thing. The enemy suddenly peels left, so you have to slow and follow to keep from losing him. He dives and burns, so you have to throttle up to keep pace. A lot of scripting is required, sure, and all of these maneuvers do constitute a sort of timing mini-game in all honesty, but still, the nature of the game's AI would ordinarily prevent exciting dog-fights from actually taking place to begin with. So in that regard, it's nice to have a sort-of-dog-fight experience every once in a while.The problem is when DFM triggers a heavily-scripted setpiece, as mentioned above. It tends to happen at least twice per mission, and you have little to no actual control over the events. Your subject plane becomes temporarily immune to all damage until a sufficiently exciting number of explosions occur within your relative field of view, and the setpiece is over.It's fun the first time, sure, but if you eat a missile (or two, or three) and die, and one of those setpieces occurs after your last checkpoint, be prepared for your next DFM attempt to trigger the exact same pseudo-cutscene again. It will do so the next time you die, too. And the next time.Thankfully, most enemies can be defeated the old-school double-tap way, but you're still avoiding an entire facet of the gameplay. It sucks because these scripted moments, when they do occur, detract from the good the devs achieved, and all but ruin the feature completely. Regular DFM battles are just fine.The ground attacks, though, are boiled crap. They force you on a linear path, often against ALL COMMON SENSE, and it becomes a game of struggling with the lock toggle to send your missiles to the right target. It's just plain horrible, and unlike DFM, it's straight-up forced on you. Do it, or mail your fission, 'cause it's game over.The devs know all about the importance of cushioning a bad landing. In case their grand gameplay experiment failed, they needed a scapegoat to blame for the negative reviews. And so: thematic shift! They hired a half-decent American writer to pen an actually coherent script, applied some color-grading to the post, and for the first time placed the game's events in the real world. So of course the new ""direction of the plot"" was the game's real failing. Oh, yeah, definitely. Don't worry, fans. We'll never do that again, we promise.Sadly, this nonsense seemed to have worked. Most people hate the game because it's ""too American,"" while claiming that the prior games' plots were so good, that they moved them to tears. ""Dance with the angels."" Search it. I'll save space in the review. Anyway, it's not the fault of the ill thought-out gameplay mechanics - it's because they Americanized it. Yeah, that's it. Certainly it, no question.Anyway, in summary - I just can't recommend it. It's broken, it's frustrating. At one point, a dozen planes spawn right behind you when the game expects you take out a boatload of ground targets in less than two minutes. Another has you struggling to shoot down an ICBM whose exhaust causes unavoidable damage. Sucks if you get THAT checkpoint while already critically damaged...like *I* did. Time to restart a 30 minute mission!...or not. Save yourself the trouble, and save yourself the scratch. This game needs to go dance with the angels.			"

												This is my first and only experience with the Ace Combat series.  Many reviewers here who are fans of the series often argue that the changes made to the gameplay have deprived the game of any sense of challenge and thus made the experience extremely boring.  I'm inclined to agree with that statement.  The real perpetrator in regard to dumbing down the gameplay is the new ""Dogfight mode.""  Whenever you get close enough to an enemy fighter, you can trigger a mode where the camera zooms in on your opponent and the game glues your jet to his rear.  At this point, the game practically plays itself for you.  In Dogfight mode, staying behind your opponent requires pretty much no skill at all.  Your fighter is basically placed on a set of rails in DF mode, and there's really no sense of accomplishment when you do take down your foe, because, as said before, there's practically no skill involved.   This might not be so bad, if the campaign did not force you to make use of this mode at certain points.On that subject, the campaign itself is equally bland.  Most of the time you will be  in your fighter engaging in the rather dull air-to-air combat, broken periodically by the chance to fly an attack helicopter or control the targeting computer of an AC gunship or some other gimic.  To the game's credit, I enjoyed some of these set pieces.  Manning the door gun of a helicopter was good fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed the AC gunship section of the game.  Basically, any part of the game that wasn't marred by the flawed movement and dogfighting was pretty enjoyable.  Unfortunately, air-to-air dogfighting comprises the vast majority of the game.  Periodically, you will be required to line up your aircraft to do strafing runs against ground targets, but the joy that could have been had with that is also ruined due to the mandatory use of a ""ground attack mode"" that places your jet on a set of rails, again depriving every last iota of challenge or fun.  The one enjoyable aspect that applies to all parts of the campaign is that periodically when you destroy an enemy, the camera will zoom in on your kill, showing off the ensuing fire, explosions and wreckage in all its destructive glory.  These bits were always pretty impressive to watch.  The story is pretty uninspired; something to do with a civil war in Russia and some ultranationalist group.  It's completely forgetable.On a final note, if you are interested in giving this game a shot, I strongly recommend that you use a controller, as this game does not suit itself well to a mouse.  While AC: AH offers some terrific visuals, the game is held back by some terrible gameplay mechanics, and at the end of the day, a polished turd is still just a turd.			"

Huge issues with launching it through steam and having to manually go into program files to install crap which is un acceptable. The game crashes all the time for no reason which is very annoying. You have to connect to a Microsoft windows life account which is fine I have one but it always says I have the wrong product key when this is the original game i bought FROM steam. This is a common issue a lot of people run into. I played the demo on the xbox 360 back when I had one it was cool. This game is not like the original ace combat series of games which were and still are AMAZING in my book with game play and story line. Just be warned and wary of what you get into before you buy this game. It works for some people and plays fine. But a lot of people it does not. The risk and headache is up to you.			"

												I am just going to go ahead and say it: This game is pure sex.By that I mean that most of the combat invovles pressing the right button at the right time and not making any sudden moves. As shallow as this is, it is intense. It is full of quick-time events and cinematics of destroying targets with insane amounts of fire power. One can also have fun customizing the paint job and load out of your favorite aircraft and flying your favorite mission.All that said, this is not a game for simulator enthusiists. The control is unrealistic and if you can't **** yourself that there is a chance that getting hit with a salvo of missles could kill you, then you will likely get bored. If you're not into flying jets or giant explosions, this game is not for you.Also, I personally love the power metal-esque sound track.			"

												Hello! This is going to be coming from someone whos played Ace Combat X and X2 on the PSP and has finished playing the full campaign in Assauly Horizon. I'll start by saying the positive and thats that the games got gorgeos graphics. The planes look amazing the the terrain is quite beautiful too. Most of the maps are really well thought out and the artworks on some of the planes are just ridiculous! You get to kill enemies in a pink plane! Things can't get better than that. Unfortunately, thats where all of the noticable positives end for me. I really dislike the games new dogfight mode. It takes away the skill previously required from the Ace Combat series and in addition to that, it gets boring really quickly. Due to its ease and quickness for taking down enemies, most past players of the franchise may find themselves unwillingly using it to quickly make work of the more than necessary enemies thrown at you. I really dislike the alternate helicopter and gunner missions which take away from the jet fighting albeit the bomber missions are refreshing. Lastly, I'm really dissapointed with the storyline. It does not make you feel like that Ace from the Gryphon Squadron like the other titles did and it does not live upto, atleast what I believe a true Ace Combat story line. No giant ships, no ridiculos missions, in trying to make it real with real life environments and maps, they took away the awesomeness of being able to take down flying fortresses which was jaw droppingly thrilling.I understand that this was an experiment, hence did not have a number associated for it, but for a first release, I wish they did not experiment with us. I really do hope they make one with the chemistry the Ace Combat series is known for for the next release :)			"

												I didn't expect much from this game but it still managed to disappoint me utterly. I don't even know where to start. The gameplay is horrible. You basically have 3 ways of destroying the opponent and none of them is fulfilling in the long run. You either press B (on an XBOX controller) to shoot a rocket when the square mark on your opponent turns red and hope it hits. It usually doesn't so then you enter the dogfight mode. This means pressing RB+LB which puts you just right behind your opponent and then you again have to wait for a circle mark to become red and press B to fire missiles. Sometimes when you're in the dogfight mode a script activates and you can see a cam shot of your opponent exploding, which gets boring really fast. The last way to kill an opponent is to do a turn around on him when he tries to rocket you from behind. In that instance you wait for two arrows to cover each other and- guess what- press RB+LB to appear behind the enemy in the dogfight mode again. The whole game is basically a big, repetetive, boring QTE event.Flying itself is really disappointing. It feels nothing like a plane and every plane model flies exactly the same, despite different stats. The controls are unprecise. Also, I have to mention the camera work- it's just atrocious. The FOV is way too low which makes you see nothing apart from your own machine and after some time spent in the dogfight mode I started feeling dizzy. You can also fly helicopters- don't get too pumped, though. It comes down to pressing LT when your crosshair is set on a land target and then pressing RT to shoot it- the end. It also induces the most camera problems- cockpit view is the only way to play (it's an opposite story with planes- the cockpit view is utterly useless).The story is forgettable (blah blah Russians blah blah betrayal blah blah Murica). Initially I wanted to praise the soundtrack but it becomes repetetive fairly quickly, especially that it plays one chosen track during each mission and hearing it over and over again during missions that can last over 30 minutes makes you sick pretty fast. I'd also like to mention this game features the worst French accent in the history of gaming but it's not a big deal- the voice acting is decent overall.I'm also under impression that the game tries to artificially prolong your gametime, usually by excessive time pressure, at least in higher levels of difficulty. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy this game for more than initial 30 minutes- and I've raged through my playtime all the way. It's cheap but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Heck, I wouldn't even recommend playing it for free.If you're looking for a pleasant, semi-challenging game featuring planes (including jets) try War Thunder. It's free and it doesn't try to be something it shouldn't be.			"

												As a long time fan of the Ace Combat series I would like to say a few things about Ace Combat Assault Horizon a very fun game, great for anyone who is into jets and aircrafts in general, fast paced action and great soundtracks. The series has always had some of the best soundtracks around and Assault horizon delivers again. The graphics are a step ahead of any previous entry into the series, everything is nice to look at esspecialy the jets, there is an ingame viewer just for looking at jets which is great. The story is okay but nothing particularily memorable, same with the characters but the missions are extremely fun to play (multiple times). Now on to the gameplay which has always been great but there a few features added to Assault Horizon, one being DFM which is Dog Fight Mode which basically allowd you to engage your enemy in a closer proximity and puts you right in the action and allows you to pull off some pretty awesome maneuvers BUT these maneuvers are very dumbed down from previous games (before you would have to learn and execute these maneuvers on your own) now you press a couple buttons and its done for you so alot less skill is involved which is a letdown to me. Now this is a port from the console verions of the game and its pretty much a barebones port no extra graphical features just resolution, vsync and AA options which is a big minus to me, but it also includes all the DLC from the console verions which is a plus. All and all though Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a very fun game to play with a few minor flaws in the gameplay which are my own personal taste I'd have to give this a 7.8/10. If you like this game I would recommend picking up a PS2 and playing Ace Combat 4 or 5 which are probaly the best in the series.			"

												Just by the name alone, if you ask any of the long time fans, they'll tell you what they think at the drop of a hat. Having played through the campaign fully, I can see just why this game was made. The article I read prior to playing the game comparing it to a certain hyper-popular first-person shooter cemented my opinion in stone already. One part of me wants to like this game, but the other part screams at it in disgust.Ace Combat Assault horizon is a frank departure from the series established bizzaro earth in which it takes place in the more familiar setting of our world. It seeks to establish a cast of loveable characters from the outset with plenty of dialogue inbetween missions. While the game certainly stands on its own as a certifyable Ace combat game, it definitely has the feel most fans of the series have come to expect, but has a flawed core that sours the experience.From the core, it tends to lean to hard on its own gimmicks to draw in new players, and it shows in the gameplay, the addition of Dog-fight Mode is a sort of,""On Rails"" mode to help new players take on enemies. its an easier to control help-to-kill method, and concurrently show off the much touted,""Aircraft Gore"" as defeated planes spiral and tumble helplessly with much unnecessary amounts of oil, flames, and debris splattering on the screen, and an unskippable dramatic camera to show you your kill in gruesome detail as it suspends you from play. Counter DFM, is a feature called,""ASM"" which is initiated in the same way as DFM is. ASM allows you to turn on your persuer and take THEM in DFM.As a whole, the usual Ace combat control scheme is bogged down by this new control addition and a step back from the tight controls many have come to expect from the series. the timing required to pull off the ASM is far more strict and leaves  you more vulnerable than outmanuvering your opponent and mashes itself in your way, and many of the mission components require you to use this DFM to complete some objectives properly. Many of the games enemies seem to have been made with this mode in mind as they all zoom and boost impossibly out of your reach if you decide to engage them in any other form of combat other than DFM, I saw this mostly on the ""required"" targets and seemed to me as a way to railroad the player into using it at expense of artificially lengthening the game time.Moving on.From its mission structure to its characters, it tries real hard to make Ace combat fit within the confines of the modern game while still leaving a bit of salt from the previous games to flavor it. In the end, AC:AH Feels short, shallow, and unmemorable, nevermind the technical issues that mar it.the choice to cast the title in the current modern world left the game with a bland pastel of identity to draw upon let alone the suspension of disbelief to hold, the characters have no origin, we know nothing of why the characters have the motivations they do, they cast off the primary reason for conflict and instead leave a revenge plot with no plausability for its existence.The story for me wrapped up in 8 hours, accounting for deaths and failures due to awkward DFM controls along the way. To draw some comparisons between this and one of the previous titles, some of the titles had branching mission structures, and depending on how you play, or what you do, the story unfolds in a different way, giving some area of control and feeling of detail. The mission structure of AC:AH is linear, the missions are short and there isn't any replayability in them as most missions are roughly 5 or so minutes long.(they can drag on because the game wants you to rely on DFM) The details of each mission are traditional for the Ace Combat library, in fact, as far as to say, they don't use any of the more interesting mission structures that the previous titles have. It goes to highlight the limited scope the modern world presents from a reality standpoint. From what I gather from this game, it was made with multiplayer in mind, (Singleplayer is just one long tutorial) and I'm sure it does it acceptably, but doesn't warrant me trying as coming away from the singleplayer, left me a lot more sour than sweet.As a fan of the series, I'm dissapointed that Project Aces had to push out a title that was more than likely a cash grab to monopolize on the current trend of modern military shooters, not of their own volition, but by their parent company.The good I gather from the game is, that I hope any form of success has made Bandai-Namco think strongly about porting previous Ace combat titles, and developing future numbered games to the PC as a viable platform. This review isn't supposed to be to complex or properly formatted or well worded. but it does get across a number of gripes I have with the game, and goes to highlight what happens when game companies try to,""Follow the leader"" instead of doing their own thing or doing something new.TL;DR: As a fan of the series, steer clear (but I'm sure I don't need to tell you that), but if you're someone who wants an arcade-y flight game to kill some time online. look no further.

												Let me just say I'm glad I got this game for $6 on the humble bundle. There's unfortunately a lot of flaws with assualt horizon. Let's start with the story it's bland and generic with truely awful voice acting and I usually skipped all the cutscenes because they are just so boring. The pacing is not so good and it's all over the place during the gameplay and the story. The turrent sections are by far the worst part about Ace Combat AH as not only do the sections drag on for far too long but this doesn't belong in an ace combat game at all. What's worse is the helicopters controls are just awful and it results in a lot of cheap deaths. Thankfully the rest of the game including the fighter stuff and the dogfights are just awesome and extremely enjoyable. The number of skins for your plane are insane and there's a good reason to go back and earn them. The flying is exteremly good and is very high odrelen and I love that the debree can fly in your face which is awesome and I wish more flight games did this. Outside of that there are a few things I would like to mention. The PC port itself is good, the controls for both flightsticks and controllers are really good however the game sucks with a keyboard as it's almost unplayable. The graphics and the options are also good I'm glad the game runs above 60FPS and it looks quite good despite being a PC port. I'm happy to say that as of 2015 the game does not have GFWL anymore so If you were worried about this being in there then fear not it's been removed and replaced with steamworks. The music on the other hand is just terrible and Ace Combat games usually have an awesome soundtrack but AH is just terrible and not a single track stuck in my head.So overall would I reccommend AH, for me if you can get past the awful turrets sections and the forgettable story then I think this would good flight game for you to pick up on the cheap. At $20 it's not worth but if you're looking for a good flight game with a lot of high impact moments then assualt horizon is a good choice.			"

While ""Optium"" is grant more ""advantage"" to DFM/ASM, it's make original feeling of previous Ace Combat is fading-Customable color name can't be changed-Skills making more easier for me (But, its helpfull when play on Hard or Ace difficulty)-(For myself) Lack of the ""Legendary"" Aircraft form previous AC's series (Ex: ADF-01 FALKEN, ADFX-01/02 MORGAN)Overall, it's a good game to me.

												First of all, if you are an veteran in Ace Combat, forget everything you know about this game before judging. This game, like the developers said, is a test for new systems such as the DFM. Although we have seen that DFM did not work as great as they expected, it was a good try to add more content into the Ace Combat series. For the ones that just picked this game up and know nothing about Ace Combat, it is important to note that this game itself is quite satisfying. The DFM may be boring and repetitive in the single player, but it is the most thrilling part in the multiplayer. However, there aren't many players in the multiplayer, so try to stick to capital domination and deathmatch or bring a friend to join you in the air.Overall, AC:AH is a great game in itself. Although it does not fit to the traditional Ace Combat series, it is important to note that this game was a testbed for new ideas, and it has served its purpose well.			"

												A good air ""Modern Warfare"" version game. (Note: I play this game using keyboard & mouse, if you use controller/stick, your opinion/review MAY be different)Pro : -DFM/ASM are really helpfull if you NOT play this game with a controller/stick (For aircraft)-DLCs are included (CFA-44, ASF-X, F-4, and color scheme for other planes and helicopters)-Customable color for all planes/choppers (Including the DLCs)-A lot unlockables (Not mention the DLCs, aircrafts, and choppers, though)-Unboring mission/campaignCons :-Play this game with ""Original"" control type for aircrfat, it little bit hard if you NOT use controller/stick, especially when use ASM/DFM. While ""Optium"" is grant more ""advantage"" to DFM/ASM, it's make original feeling of previous Ace Combat is fading-Customable color name can't be changed-Skills making more easier for me (But, its helpfull when play on Hard or Ace difficulty)-(For myself) Lack of the ""Legendary"" Aircraft form previous AC's series (Ex: ADF-01 FALKEN, ADFX-01/02 MORGAN)Overall, it's a good game to me. Bring me to memories when i play previous Ace Combat series, altough lack of Falken and Morgan, though10.5 of 10 "

												Pure arcade, not really good for you if you are used to play simulators. People often told me that Ace Combat is better than Tom Clancy's HAWX; now I can see that it is not exactly true. Viewing a fighter cockpit from the inside is not enough to make people's feelings authentic or at least close to such. The unability to control your aircraft completely is especially annoying: it simply doesn't let you move as you want to, and it automatically returns to horizontal flight if you stop pressing the movement keys. As a result, you feel clumsy against those super agile enemies, who move so swiftly and easily as if they were flying dishes of some remote sci-tech alien civilization.At the same time, the game is rather spectacular, it is intense, and it offers some lengthy and difficult missions. Graphics is good, storyline is... engaging. An interesting alternative to HAWX. A combination of the two would have made a perfect game.			"

Some missions for single mode still confusing me. The story is too wide for the game.9/10 for the graphic. All of design is awesome. The most fighter aircrafts look so real.

												Before I say anything else, I should point out that anyone who claims that they can't invert their plane or do a roll in ACAH didn't have the sense to even look at the options menu. Seriously. This option between control styles has been a thing since the PS2 Ace Combat games, and even if it wasn't, why would you not check the options menu?Moving on...I actually really like ACAH, but with two major complaints. What are those complaints?1. Helicopter missions literally give me a headache. I almost didn't buy the game during the last free weekend because of this.2. The infamous DFM is required to take down certain enemy aces, and there's no shortage of these aces.A minor complaint I have is that in the cockpit view, the HUD isn't integrated into the cockpit. I'd be fine with stunting my abilities a bit (as an optional thing of course) to have a slightly more immersive cockpit.Those two msjor points certainly do damage the game, but it's still an arcade flight game that I find myself coming back to more often than others. It's just a lot of dumb fun. DFM is actually a nice mechanic when it's not shoved down your throat, and being able to get right up into the tail of an opposing fighter as it explodes makes for an interesting change than just seeing a  tiny puff of smoke a kilometer or two away. DFM for the most part is a system about managing your speed to be able to keep on the tail of an opposing fighter while being able to easily lock onto it and/or shoot it down with machine guns. If you get in too close then an enemy can pull off a counter maneuver to get behind you or simply make a hard brake into a direction you're not expecting to escape your sights, but if you're farther away, your acceptable lock-on circle gets smaller, and obviously it's harder to hit with machine guns. It's not quite as ""on-rails"" as some people would have you believe, but it certainly does assist you quite a bit in maneuvering.An interesting note relatinmg to DFM is that I find myself actually having to use DFM to perform as well as in other titles. For whatever reason, pinning an enemy with machine guns seems much harder in ACAH than other arcade flight games I've played. I'm not sure if it's the speed of the game, the AI, or the control sensitivity, but there it is. That said, dropping behind an enemy and firing a couple of missiles works just as well as ever... unless it's an enemy ace. Then it doesn't do anything helpful at all.As much as I like DFM, the game would most certainly be better if it didn't shove it down your throat (I know I made this point already, but it needs to be said again). It takes you on scripted sequences through exploding set pieces, which looks cool, but I'd rather just be able to take down enemies as I like and as fast as I can.Aside from DFM, ACAH makes good use of visual effects to give it a pretty nice sence of speed not captured in most games. This is actually a large reason that I like the game so much, even thought it's pretty much a purely aesthetic thing. The feeling of speed is just... nice.Anyway, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is a fun game. It's not like other games in the genre (or even in the Ace Combat series) due to its controversial DFM system, but that's not such a bad thing.			"

Besides the UI, HUD, and Aircraft, it did not feel like an Ace Combat game. The story line was lacking, and because of that i felt no connection to the characters. The gameplay is terrible and feels like it belongs in a  Chuck E Cheese, and DFM over complicates fighting. Counter DFM seems to be next to impossible, which basically lead to being totally annilated anytime an enemy got on my six. I am disappointed that this is where Ace Combat is at now.			"

The first few air combat missions were fun, the new mechanics got a little tedious but all in all it was exhilerating. Until I got to the first helicopter mission, which just went on and on, and then required me to precision snipe around a friendly target while overpowered enemy helos tore me to shreds. The first few tries I kept killing the friendly, and then 8 tries later I gave up. It wasn't fun, it's not what Ace Combat is about and I want my $5 back.			"

The gameplay in this garbage has NOTHING to do with past Ace Combat titles.This is was dumbed down version of Ace Combat. It's like an Ace Combat for the modern gamers and gaming journalists, in other words, it's a game made to please idiots with no skills that only want to look are pretty explosions on screen while thinking they are hardcore because they are playing a game with no color and angry military characters.If you have a 3DS, go buy Assault Horizon there...

												I tried to give this a chance, and i enjoyed the first view mission because it brought back memories of flying as Razgriz squadron, but ultimately the game was lacking. Besides the UI, HUD, and Aircraft, it did not feel like an Ace Combat game. The story line was lacking, and because of that i felt no connection to the characters. The gameplay is terrible and feels like it belongs in a  Chuck E Cheese, and DFM over complicates fighting. Counter DFM seems to be next to impossible, which basically lead to being totally annilated anytime an enemy got on my six. I am disappointed that this is where Ace Combat is at now.			"

												Oh man I so wanted to like this game, and I bought it thinking the negative reviews must surely be too harsh. Well, I tried, and sadly the game just wants to be hated. The first few air combat missions were fun, the new mechanics got a little tedious but all in all it was exhilerating. Until I got to the first helicopter mission, which just went on and on, and then required me to precision snipe around a friendly target while overpowered enemy helos tore me to shreds. The first few tries I kept killing the friendly, and then 8 tries later I gave up. It wasn't fun, it's not what Ace Combat is about and I want my $5 back.			"

												I remember playing ace combat on the PS2 when i was a kid, the game was amazing, and i still think it is. The fast pace combat in dogfighting and difficult pc controls makes the game very hard for people who just started the game. I beated the game in 12 hours but theres multiplayer and some replayability for plane skins and unlockables.			"

												I actually really like the franchise and I give them credit for making 5, 6 & 7 have different play styles rather than letting it go stale like, say, CoD.I don't like the close range chases, I don't like how after the cam focuses on the kill and spawns you in a location near it. I would prefer holding the B or O button and watch it when I want to.Pros :Good variety*, bombing, AC-130, helicopter beside the usual dogfight.Action packed, Micheal Bay would be proud. Good PC port.Free paint jobs.Great vehicle models, choices and planes talk the language of the country they were made in. ^Attention to detail.Cons :Gets stale fast after you play your favorite missions a few times which there are not enough of compared to 31 or so of AC5.Story and narrative is meh compared to 5 or 6 having some layers besides ""I'm mad at this guy, I gotta stop him"", no real depth. ""Boss"" fights were a let down. Chasing a missile, ICBM and a dogfight. The on-rail dogfights is not something I would like to see in the future, won't blame them for trying something new or differnt though.No Pre-game map showing some ground/air targets, I brought bombs to a dogfight here.Little replay value, compare to 5 which you have to play at least 2 times just to get the secret plane or 6 where once you get the CFA, you just want to keep coming back to it and just destroy everything in your path.No Fuel Air bomb, not even on the A-10, I miss dropping mini nukes :(.Would gladly buy 5&6 if they were available.What I'd like in the future :Abilities of 6 (friendly/enemy electronic support on the map).Narrative of 5 (letting us make choices on what we say midflight makes me care more about wingmen).Gameplay of 5&6 (chasing dogfight is better than a dogfight on rails going from target to target. Having the ability to command wimgmen is welcomed).Variety* of 7.Cutscene interactions of 7 but with more depth would be appriciated maybe make it have impact or consequence.Difficulty of 5&6, Planes less agressive unless in a swarm, larger numbers and easier to kill with dmg that doesn't heal (AC6 ""WMD"" mission) unless I go land and come back to the battlefield. Please don't force me to on-rail dogfight every time just because it makes it easier.Soundtrack of 5&6 (I still have both the OST's and love em).Smacking into the ground should be instakill on any difficulty. Bumping into a plane since its softer, is a good idea though.Bosses of 5&6, This game took itself too seriously and ended up not being as fun. I love the Aigion and Megalith, needs more of that.On the bombing mission, it's the only time to go on a bombing run, I would rather not be OP and actually put in effort into bombing ground, which needs more targets on every mission.A bomber with 99 flares going on approach for a corridor of death is cool, a plane with 6 flares VS a destroyer wrecking you that you can't even shoot missiles at is sad.

												The combat in this game is trash. Absolutely awful.Expect to spend every single dogfight with an AI pilot ALWAYS on your tail at all times. Your evade ability will eventually stop working for no reason. Enemy aircraft take 3 (THREE) missiles hits to destroy. THREE MISSILES! And that's hits. You'll actually need to fire more like 5 or more because they'll use countermeasures on you. The machine gun is entirely useless and you wouldn't notice if it wasn't in the game at all.Absolutely, positively, do not recommend. Go play a real game like HAWX 2. Sure uplay is annoying but that's nothing compared to this trainwreck.			"

												This game will definitely appeal to certain people...but I'm not one of them. It is, overall, a pretty braindead game that you will never really put much thought into. Dogfights, though visually appealing, aren't strategic in any way. No interesting story or characters to speak of. The overall experience felt like a bif explosive rollercoaster that was designed for me to win rather than for me to think my way through an actual challenge (think singleplayer Call of Duty in the air). I'm no grapgics junkie, but the ground textures were the absolute worse I've seen in any case of recent memory. A few trees and buildings are actually rendered in 3D over a mesh, but the rest of the world is a extremely low res flat texture laid out on the floor like a newspaper. Homeless people sleep on prettier things than this. This is not a game where you will want to fly very close to the ground...ever. If mindless, Japanese military-wannabe games is your thing then you'll enjoy it. I personally wish I could have the time I spent on this back.			"

												TLDR: Bad PC port, don't buy.Game can't handle a HOTAS, especially not in combination with foot pedals.It could easily be fixed with settings for deadzones, as most games have, this game however does not. Ends up with you having constant inputs all over the place, good luck trying to change your settings when the menus keeps scrolling because you have imputs from all over the place.Also, the game won't let you barrel roll on the standard settings, you need to go into settings, controls and change from their default setting ""optimum"" to the setting ""original"" to even be able to roll your plane all the way around. Took a while to figure out.			"

												So, here I am, at the end of the game so I can finally write a review. I still haven't beaten it, but i'll get to that in a second. I love the Ace Combat games. I played many of the other Ace Combat games and this one remains fairly true to the series. I don't care much for the helicopter scenes, but the AC-130 and B2 missions are pretty cool. The graphics are fine and the gameplay itself is good.....overall.So, why a negative review? Because of DFM, dog fighting mode. The concept itself is a neat idea, but it doesn't work in reality. But is something like that really worth a negative review?Spoiler*****Yes, god yes, it is so worth a negative review. At the end of the game you must fight a boss who is invincible. Not invincible hard, LITERALLY invincible. Missles LITTERALLY appear out of thin air and start flying at you in AND out of DFM while you try to shoot the boss down. It's a timed event and it's stupid. I don't know how many times I have repeated the final mission just to try and kill the final boss, but I end up dying just before the end of my timed invincible boss event. I'm giving it a negative review solely because of this right here. This moment is one of the most frustrating in gaming I have ever played and I don't know that I will ever have the patience to beat the final boss.			"

												Not only ""No"", but dear god NOOOOOOO!!!!Okay, let me save you.. Yes. Yes... it REALLY IS THAT BAD. I had to find out for myself, even after reading all the reviews. If you have ever enjoyed any of the previous Ace Combat titles (I have... every one, since the original Playstation..) THIS TITLE OFFICIALLY KILLED ALL THAT WAS GOOD. It gave it a graphics facelift, then put it all on rails. Spare yourself, and remember AC fondly with whatever your last game was. Why? Just WHY!!?? In case you're still thinking about it, here's more. For a PC title, I would expect these to be a given.. they are not: AWFUL peripheral/joystick support, no TrackIR... Trust me, I tried desperately to find some redeeming value in this title.. I thought, ""Well, if it's awful, maybe being able to use my peripheral w/ Ace Combat (childhood dream come true!) would make it worth it."" Forget it. This game should be burned at the stake. P.S. Folks... Medal of Honor did a better job (much better really) with an Apache.. and that's SAD!Do yourself a favor, pretend Ace Combat died peacefully in it's sleep with the previous title. If you're looking for just some fun arcade-themed aerial shenanigans, I don't know what to tell you. If you're looking for excellent graphics, realism, and peripheral support... it's time to come over to DCS. Cheers!			"

												I love the Ace Combat series, it has always been a good blend between sim and arcade. I feel this latest iteration the series has leaned much more towards arcade. My biggest complaint is toward the dog-fighting mechanic. Yes, it makes for great cinematic but it is often too difficult to really see what is going on and the controls only makes it worse. I have tried playing with a controller and flight stick, neither feel great for this game.Typically I would just ignore this “feature” altogether, however, you can't. The game forces you into these cinematic dogs fights and certain enemies cannot be shot down unless in dog-fighting mode. The entire thing just feels “off” to me in a modern aerial combat. Don't get me wrong, I don't love the Ace Combat series for it's realism, I love it for it uniqueness and story. I loved the crazy and sometimes frustrating boss battles. I love the characters and stories it told. The game could be dull at times but I enjoyed just flying around. Unfortunately, in their attempt to make something new and interesting, to me, it just feels like a series of gimmicks.			"

												Another badly ported console title. Arcade = gamepad, sure, I get it and I have one, but why _pretend_ supporting flightsticks in the first place? If you're gonna support stick then do it properly.The level of difficulty seems to vary randomly from map to map and eventually you'll get stuck as I am, surrounded by a swarm of migs which all seem to get a lock on you simultaneously... I don't care how good you are I don't think you can shake 7 missiles coming at you with 1 second intervals.This title had potential, but some exec somewhere had to ruin it by rushing it out, because that's how it feels like, unfinished.

												I love the Ace Combat series. Played all of them (from Air Combat up until AC Infinity), this one... well... is diffrent.Remember AC4, AC5 for PS2? Yeah, it's nothing like those, so, that takes away all the playability. It has a new feature called Dogfight mode (DFM for short), and fans don't really like it. Me neither. Also, there are pointless turret segments. ""Break away the monotony..."" some say, but really, this game is about plane dogfight, not stupid turret segments. There is a nice amount of planes to fly, and even helicopters. HELICOPTERS. Sounds bad already, but, guess what? It's because it is. But, they have alot of skins to pick, including hentai skins (Vomit inducing hentai skins). But, alot of missions and nice variety. It's not the worst game ever, but, it's still awful.5.5/10 (Disapproved)			"

Assault horizon is the only one with its special features, kill cams, and being a door gunner of a helicopter in the campaign.If only i could use my controller right off the bat then it would be perfect. I'm recommending it any way.THIS IS THE WAY AN AIRPLANE COMBAT GAME SHOULD BE.			"

												If you are going to buy this game, you should first find out if it suits you. I bought it, because this fast paced over-the-top immersive action was very appealing to me from all those gameplays. Am I happy with the purchase? Hell yeah, because this game rocks and makes a lot of fun. I usually don't play flying games, but I always loved airplanes and so on. It was the main reason why I loved San Andreas so much, to be honest. All those negative reviews are fans of the original Ace Combat games and I understand that their points, after watching some gameplays of older games. But to be honest? Even by the packagin, the backcover and all the screenshot you clearly see that this is not your typical flying-sim. I was watching reviews before buying and I am really statisfied. The game looks, except those mushy ground textures, really good and all those effects are neat. Especially the camera changes from normal gameplay into dog mode...everything is really fluid and has a nice feel. I really recommend this game to anybody who wants to have fun shooting down other jets. If you are a fan though, you should probably pass. This game only gets hate because of not being like the old ones, so don't worry about the quality of the product it self. There are surely a few mission where I was just cringeing e.g. those chopper missions. Just why, damnit!? Anyway - very fun game for only a few bucks, when it's on sale. You definetly should try this one.			"

												This is NOT a recommendation. This is a warning.Not only is this game a waste of money, but also an extreme waste of time. Due to my computer being more powerful than the consoles it was designed for, the game speed was accellerated to twice the speed viewed in the trailers. I had to stall out my plane just to be able to fly under the speed of light.The controls are VERY clunky and un-coordinated. Inability to destroy fighters without going into dogfight mode is aggrovating. Dogfight mode being entirely an on-rails experience is rather disgusting. Enemy aircraft can trick you into a dive then veer 90 degrees to both lose you and make you run into the ground.All in all, this is by far the single worst game I have ever played and didn't even get through the first level without wanting to pull the eject levers.It's CoD in the air. Save your money. Go play a classic Ace Combat game.(NOTE: Installation and Setup is an even worse ordeal. You have to set up an XBOX LIVE ACCOUNT to play! WTF!!! How does that make sense?!?!)			"

												This game is basically arcade-flight game. I prefer simulators more, those where you can actually feel wind beneath your wings and enjoy thrills of aircombat to the maximum. There really ain't that much control over your plane here, it's bit like sitting in a flying sledge full of stones and shooting missiles like some b-a Santa from hell. So if you're seeking for simulator consider something else.  But if you're ok with nice graphics, nice action and don't expect anything else for you money - well, that's actually what you will get. I liked it even though I felt disappointed. With proper flying model this game would be really good, now it's only ok.			"

The designers really dropped the ball here and created the ultimate CoD air sim, all the dfm scenes seem to be on rails and everything you do is just waste time until you hit the hidden trigger to deactivate the boss's god mode and be able to shoot him down.As a closing note, i really hope the 7th game will be more in the spirit of the old console versions and not another cod with planes.ps: i got this game for 1$ from humblebundle and i'm happy that the other 2 games were better than this horse dung on rails.

												I played every game of Ace Combat since the Playstation 1 and this is by far the worst in the entry.  The onrail parts truly killed it for me since you have to use it to down certain enemies.  I would say that everything else is excellent in this game but I just can't get over the way that the gameplay is limiting.			"

												A subpar entry in a series of great games.A few things you need to understand before buying/trying this game:Ace Combat is not a flight simAce Combat is not meant to be realisticAce Combat is primarily a console gameFirst off, the only graphics option is resolution, and that maxes out a 1440p. Even so, the game looks fairly nice, aside from the annoying static cockpit reflection in cockpit view. The story is a wannabe Tom Clancy USA vs. Russia, which is particularly annoying considering the previous games were set in a very interesting alternate universe with fake countries that are allusions to real life counterparts. Sure, the prewvious stories were corny, but you could get really into them. The story in Assault Horizon is both difficult to get into and corny. Another issue in this entry is limited plane selection according to the mission. The game has a fairly large selection of planes, but it's wasted potential since you can only use a few each mission.The music is composed by the same guy who was doing it since 04/5, so it is superb as usual. However, in this entry, the music is different from others in regards to their style.My biggest issue with this game is that they wanted to attract new fans by making the game Call of Duty style with more emphasis on on-the-rails action than the freeforming fun of previous games.I recommend all the other games in the series before this one, but Assault Horizon is still a decent arcade air combat game.However, as an Ace Combat game, Assault Horizon fails in many aspects.I recommend every previous entry other than this one.Also, make sure you have a joystick/controller, as it is near unplayable otherwise, especially online.

												 Actually not a bad game. Combat is nice, story is nice, what else cani say?. Only cons are that the controls are hard to get used to and i would NOT reccomend getting this game for full price. Other than that its pretty fun			"

												I actually really like the franchise and I give them credit for making 5, 6 & 7 have different play styles rather than letting it go stale like, say, CoD.I don't like the close range chases, I don't like how after the cam focuses on the kill and spawns you in a location near it. I would prefer holding the B or O button and watch it when I want to.Pros :Good variety*, bombing, AC-130, helicopter beside the usual dogfight.Action packed, Micheal Bay would be proud. Good PC port.Free paint jobs.Great vehicle models, choices and planes talk the language of the country they were made in. ^Attention to detail.Cons :Gets stale fast after you play your favorite missions a few times which there are not enough of compared to 31 or so of AC5.Story and narrative is meh compared to 5 or 6 having some layers besides ""I'm mad at this guy, I gotta stop him"", no real depth. ""Boss"" fights were a let down. Chasing a missile, ICBM and a dogfight. The on-rail dogfights is not something I would like to see in the future, won't blame them for trying something new or differnt though.No Pre-game map showing some ground/air targets, I brought bombs to a dogfight here.Little replay value, compare to 5 which you have to play at least 2 times just to get the secret plane or 6 where once you get the CFA, you just want to keep coming back to it and just destroy everything in your path.No Fuel Air bomb, not even on the A-10, I miss dropping mini nukes :(.Would gladly buy 5&6 if they were available.What I'd like in the future :Abilities of 6 (friendly/enemy electronic support on the map).Narrative of 5 (letting us make choices on what we say midflight makes me care more about wingmen).Gameplay of 5&6 (chasing dogfight is better than a dogfight on rails going from target to target. Having the ability to command wimgmen is welcomed).Variety* of 7.Cutscene interactions of 7 but with more depth would be appriciated maybe make it have impact or consequence.Difficulty of 5&6, Planes less agressive unless in a swarm, larger numbers and easier to kill with dmg that doesn't heal (AC6 ""WMD"" mission) unless I go land and come back to the battlefield. Please don't force me to on-rail dogfight every time just because it makes it easier.Soundtrack of 5&6 (I still have both the OST's and love em).Smacking into the ground should be instakill on any difficulty. Bumping into a plane since its softer, is a good idea though.Bosses of 5&6, This game took itself too seriously and ended up not being as fun. I love the Aigion and Megalith, needs more of that.On the bombing mission, it's the only time to go on a bombing run, I would rather not be OP and actually put in effort into bombing ground, which needs more targets on every mission.A bomber with 99 flares going on approach for a corridor of death is cool, a plane with 6 flares VS a destroyer wrecking you that you can't even shoot missiles at is sad.

												Ace Combat AHEE is a fast action air combat game. The controls on the control pad feels great. The music and sounds are fantastic. The chatter during mission make the game exciting. Story is simple and predictable. Graphic are decent. I have not played other AC games recently, I can't compare it to previous installments. It might had been more fun if you could only activate DFM (Dogfight Mode) against TGT_LEAD planes and when you have a plane trailing you. I had a blast playing Ace Combat. It felt like an arcade game. I completed the game around 8 hours. I recommend this game when its under 20 bucks for people who are looking for a fast action arcade roller coaster shooter.			"

												A few notes before we begin. This game is truly and sadly unplayable without a controller or joystick. A mouse and keyboard simply won't grant you any enjoyment. Furthermore, I'd make this review neutral but since I did have fun and the co-op is great and story decent I'll give it an upvote to compensate for the negatives without much sense.For the rest of it, can be summarized by the fact that it's ""lesser"" in everything. The previous games had masterful soundtrack, this one has a good one but it's still inferior. The very same applies to gameplay which is far more casual and can be applied to everything besides graphics essentially.Nonetheless, on steam I highly doubt you’ll find a more enjoyable game when out there looking for some fun without actually needing flying skills. Casual is key here.. Assuming you fork up a controller - which kinda defeats the purpose of PC gaming in the first place.			"

												Good game - recommended. However levels are faaar too long. I just want to pick up the game and play for 5 minutes. I don't want to be playing for 30 minutes wondering when i can exit the game without saving progress. Also the controls aren't good. Star Conflict has the best combat controls. All controls should be like star conflicts.			"

												It is what it is, as far as these types of games go this ones pretty good. Although this is not a simulation game its arcadey all the way, if you enjoy abit of fun without taking it too seriously then pick this one up on sale. Dont expect anything mind blowing, Overall 6.5/10			"

												If you are going to buy this game, you should first find out if it suits you. I bought it, because this fast paced over-the-top immersive action was very appealing to me from all those gameplays. Am I happy with the purchase? Hell yeah, because this game rocks and makes a lot of fun. I usually don't play flying games, but I always loved airplanes and so on. It was the main reason why I loved San Andreas so much, to be honest. All those negative reviews are fans of the original Ace Combat games and I understand that their points, after watching some gameplays of older games. But to be honest? Even by the packagin, the backcover and all the screenshot you clearly see that this is not your typical flying-sim. I was watching reviews before buying and I am really statisfied. The game looks, except those mushy ground textures, really good and all those effects are neat. Especially the camera changes from normal gameplay into dog mode...everything is really fluid and has a nice feel. I really recommend this game to anybody who wants to have fun shooting down other jets. If you are a fan though, you should probably pass. This game only gets hate because of not being like the old ones, so don't worry about the quality of the product it self. There are surely a few mission where I was just cringeing e.g. those chopper missions. Just why, damnit!? Anyway - very fun game for only a few bucks, when it's on sale. You definetly should try this one.			"

												New, and 2nd game download attempt, with no go on this one. New anti-virus, I will check that now and make sure steam is allowed to download, but other than that. I have ove 1500 aircraft in MSFSX. I can usually get thru....   Mouse is deactivated at ""Do you want to creat a save file"" No mouse, k.b., or other funtion except control Esc. I would like to add that this type of game I like very mush. I posess all of the P.S. Ace Combat games, but rarely ever operate the old playstation anymore. My rigg is Alienware, with a very good video card, audio, triple head, 5 Tb of memeory upgradable. I would give this game another chance if I can get it activated.			"

												Not much like the Ace Combat I know and love from Playstation and Playstation 2, too cinematic, action not super-tight like in those console games.  Yeah I know, I'm playing on a PC which isn't really optimized for games the way that a console is, but I'm okay with turning down the graphics settings until its barely more than blocky polygons but the game just won't let me go that low.  I think this game tries too hard to be like some other games like call of duty where you have a bomber gunning stage and a helicopter stage, while forgetting what made this series so great: the epic dogfights.  I think they also messed up the controls, seems like too much stuff is on automatic mode where in the console releases they left a lot up to the player's skill.  This game is taking the modern trend of putting you in like a cinematic press X repeatedly to advance the cutscene crap instead of letting the player make their own cutscene by shredding up the enemy with clever combat.  Also, this game pretty much forces you to use a controller, the keyboard controls are really clumsy and I don't think they had keyboard and mouse users in mind when they tested it.  Still fun to play, since I like blowing stuff up in the sky, but not really the Ace Combat game I was hoping for.			"

												It's nothing like the other previous titles, not even close. I would rather have played fires of liberation if I still had my 360. The game has a  boring, no feeling of accomplishment story with heavily scripted battle system. The dog fight systems is sometimes disorienting  and in some levels it needs to be done in order to advance. You will sometimes fire lots of missles on an enemy plane hitting it multiple times and it would still be up. So will be stuck in some cases why is that plane not going down. I wish they would have added a solo wing fight instead of this dog fight system. The AC-130 and Apache missions felt call of dutyish and added nothing exciting to the game. Throughout the whole game I only wanted to see if I could spot Kei in the background. Buy it not out of curiousity for flight sims or if you're a fan of the series. Only buy it if you stole money from a friend who betrayed you. Then after giving them the game as a gift showing what you wasted their money on.			"
