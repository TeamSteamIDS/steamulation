												Game needs a lot of work to get in a more playable state.  Currently, things seem very broken, you randomly have to recreate a lifeform, the change to family member just changes you to a random ai that isn't the same lifeform you made, and a lot of the parts don't seem to work right.  Sad thing is the game isn't even marked as early access...Seems like the cell stage of spore with more advanced features; just needs a lot of work to become playable. Is currently no mouse support, looks like a quick port from a phone game. Other than that, seems like a game with a lot of potential, and I really hope this dev sticks around!Love the idea!No other reviews because the dev never even bothered patching the game with steam.  Therefore, steam does not even read that your playing it, thus you can't reach the 5 minute time cap for a review.  Did a hacky method to get around this ;).  Is a very early access (appears to be a prototype build) game.  Do not purchase unless you want to watch as the game developes, while supporting game development at the same time.			"

												Bottom Line: If you loved Spore like me, then go play Spore... In it's current state, this game is a BIG step backwards.  If the Dev feels compelled to make major gameplay changes, it might be worth it down the road.  I have not played the first Evolution, but if this is an improvement, avoid it like the measles.Pros: -  Body parts can be eaten individually, changing the physics of how creatures move/behave-  Low price ($3.00 I will never get back, but could've been worse)-  I  was unable to play the game at launch, but the Dev fixed the issue the same dayCons:-  Lack of content / body parts-  Not clear how to encourage evolution down a particular path-  Chunky controls (keyboard only?)-  Poor sound design / no music-  Creature designing should be fun (it isn't)-  If you take the time to design a creature, your design seems to be lossed upon death-  Felt more like a simulation in which nothing I did mattered-  Would've gotten more out of my $3 by making dinner with a can of catfood and broken glass			"

												It seems like a wonderful idea, very spore like but with it's own twist, but as of right now it is unplayable. The controls are clunky, your objective once within the game itself is totally unclear. After fooling with it for a few minutes I noticed the tutorial option, which wound up being four pages of nothing helpful whatsoever. The 'character' creation screen was very confusing as well, and I somehow wound up with three different sets of legs, two of which were non functioning (Wat?) It seems like it has wonderful potential but it needs alot of work. I would like to think that this is an early access game even though it isnt listed as such on Steam. I wouldnt reccomend it unless you're into early access games. I spent three bucks because I hope to see this game get alot of work and progress over time. If Im wrong, Im only out three bucks.			"

												I brought this game not expecting much because of all the negative reviews and low price. However, when I started up the game what I was expencting seemed more distant than the centre of our universe. IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK WITH A MOUSE! The evolution system is all messed up. You spend a long time creating a quality creature, then the game just scrambles it. A game this bad should not of been put up on Steam, no matter weither it's free or not.			"

												For some reason, it not showing my real playtime. I'v put about 30 minutes into this piece of Kardashin♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Honestly, I went into this game knowing it wasn't going to be good, and I only got it because it was $3 and I wanted to know the feeling of being the first reviewer (Which now will not happen because the game wouldn't record my time) but boy howdy, this game... I know it was only 3 dolla bills, but I would have had more fun buying tampons and making arts and crafts out of said tampons. I'm no professional reviewer, but I'll try me best to try and tell you why this is silly, not in a good way, I assure you.1. Stock images. 2. Clunky game play.3. Awful, ear rqping sound effects and visials.4. Gameplay consist of creating a freak of nature, running up to other freaks of nature and, for a lack of a better term, booping them. It's extremly boring.5. The menu screen looks like it was made in Micro-soft word. No effort was put in at all to make it look professional.6. If you tab out of the game, the icon is a fycking X-box 360 controller. It's a fycking Xbox arcade game.7. Doesn't simulate what it was trying to simulate (That being Evolution though Naturally Selection) correctly. You don't♥♥♥♥♥♥♥out a new creature made out of a finite number of body parts every couple of seconds and try to eat everything else until its only your ""family"" left. That's not how it works. 8. Horrible option menu with very little ""Options"".I give it one thing, doesn't matter if you're Atheist, Christian, Buddist, A follower of ALLAH ACKBAR or a Spess Marine serving in the name of the Holy God-Emperor of man-kind, I think we can all agree that Steam need some fycking quality control.Pure shjt. Don't buy. It's not Early Accese, so I don't know how the fyck they manage to release it on Steam. Go buy some M&M's. Thems good eatings. Not the regular ones, the peanut ones. Oh my God, those motha♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ peanut M&M's.			"

												This game feels like an early release flash game. It is super addicting once you figure out the mechanics of the evolutions, but it needs a few more things before it feels right on steam, such as a much better evolution tree and an actual goal. I think this game has some high potential to anyone who like the cell stage of spore, it just needs someone to keep working on it.			"

												This is truly, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sibling of Spore.I bough this game despite the primitive graphicsbecouse I have looked a long time for a evolution simulator game.Dont buy this. I have really tried to enjoy it and I cant play it evenif I just want to figure it out.This is not the alternative to to the other evolution games you are looking for.Just becouse its lacking it in design and graphicsdoesnt mean a game have game play value to compensate.

												It is not even worth $2.99. It is that terrible. In fact, I'm even surprised it got on Steam. Sure it's fun for 5 minutes but it gets glitchy every time and I'm confused about the gameplay. This is more or less a browser flash game more than a good Steam game.P.S. It gave me cancer. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												I'm a bit baffled by this game. It seems like it should be Early Access, it needs more parts and to not just randomly reset your creature when you evolve. This game has all of the components needed to be a great indie game, but none of them are polished.Unfortunately all of the branches are shallow and your creature can be maxed out in about three  levels. The sound is horrible especially the error sound when you've maxed something out as far as it can go. The controls are clunky, and the game lacks Mouse Support. Overall, just some minor modifications could have fixed all of these issues.The game feels like it has a ton of wasted potential, it sucks that they're selling it as a finished product for a low price and you can see what it could have been with just a little polish and content, this could have been a truly addictive albeit casual game.If this were an early access game with a sustainable price model I'd be excited to see what's next, as it stands, it's only $3, I guess it's kind of worth it as an interesting ap to fool around with until your get bored of it.
