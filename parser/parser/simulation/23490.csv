												I own all the Tropico games and I enjoy them all.I would pick Tropico 3 as the most fun of them all.It is not as challenging as Tropico 2 but that is not the kind of challenge I'm into so I didn't mind. The original and it's expansion are classics but I prefer #3Tropico #3Pros-#1.Good Graphics#2.Many Buildings to build#3.Custom El Presidente#4.Rebels will fight you if you don't please your people#5.Some good music#6.The radio guy can be helpful and funnyCons-#1.Building buildings gets old#2.The roads are too big#3.You can't make roads anywhere on the map.You would think you could get a bulldozer or dynamite and have enough slaves I mean your people lol to lower/raise/flatten any land you want.Not being able to connect all the roads sucks#4.It is really easy to beat the rebels once you learn how to play#5.One of the songs in the game I don't like it and they don't allow us to control what song is played.I just mute the music for a few minutes and then turn it back on.They could of added more songs also#6.The radio guy gets really repetitive and I'm sure some can't stand him.I can tolerate him for awhile but I get sick of him too#7.The maps are so small and it makes putting the tourists buildings in a area they can all fit and is allowed a serious problem.You can't place the buildings anywhere or less people will go to them.It would be like telling you to stay at a hotel in the ghetto part of the island.Some tourists just wont do it.That is realistic but the maps are so small.If they fix this the roads can remain big#8.The majority of edits you never ever use.A few are good but most of them there is no reason to do them#9.USA and USSR will circle your waters if you don't do something better.You will just lose if you don't fix it.If I am going to lose come on my island and shoot it out with me and my soldiers then#10.I don't think the cops do anything.I saw they drive around and arrest people when you tell them to.I don't know if it lowers crime rates but if you are playing to help your people you wont need cops#11.Prisons are even less needed.Unless you are going to act evil you wont need a prison for sure.I never saw a cop arrest anyone unless I told them toThe Bottom Line -Tropico 3 is a fun game that will let you create your own city.I found the rebels first attack on me to be a wtf moment.It was funny and cool.I would also call that realistic.Once I got the hang of it I could make my people happy and defend myself and make plenty of moneyI played as an evil El Presidente and it was ok but I could kill anyone that wasn't related to the military or cops/prison officers and get away with it.The rebels couldn't beat me because I treated the military so much better than everyone else and I always had an army.I never killed the wives of my soldiers and I wonder what happens then.I doubt it would of mattered I could just replace them.I found it less fun to act evil because they can't beat you once you have the military setup the right wayOnce you are making good money the game gets really boring.I would of liked it had I been able to make a full military.Have buildings create Tanks,Fighter Jets ect and prepare for war.Then after that conquer another island or be invaded by a country that was a more even fight.I don't mean fight the USA or USSR but a similar country.It would of made a multiplayer game really funTropico 4 could have 2 settings#1 FinancialAll it is about is building and money and they remove the rebels.This is great for kids and people who don't even like the rebels killing you or you killing them#2 Financial and WarYou have the same buildings as #1 but also weapons buildings and navy/air force/army/marines related buildings.The rebels would be there but the rebels would create and/or even take over your buildings.Make them tougher with more tactics.Plus the objective of the game is to stay in control of your own island which would be harder and then take over other islands.Then you got the multiplayer versionThis would create not only a better game but it would appeal to more people.I hope Tropico 4 looks something like this as I have not played it yet but if it doesn't I hope Tropico 5 does.My 2 centsDan			"

												Tropico 3 is a pretty fun game. While you don't have as many options of creation and aren't really in battle with any other nation as you would in Civilization games, you're faced with a much different, and in my opinion player-friendly playstyle.You're essentially in control of an island. As ""El Presidente"", you're given the options of running said island however you wish. Want to be an industry titan, producing oil, cigars and rum in mass quantity to make your city prosper? Or will you make the island a ""paradise"" and profit off tourists in hotels? The choice is yours.Well, ish. The industry option MASSIVELY overpowers tourism in revenue, and also is better of when you focus on just one type of product. However, the game is still quite fun and the possibilites endless.The events and occur in the campaign are interesting and add a twist to your gameplay, which by the way, is still themed as you being a dictator on an island. The said island has different interest groups, and some are more powerful than others. You may  wish to build a church over a factory if elections are close and the religious group is upset. Or maybe even an army base, lest you wish your own generals and soldiers turn on you. The way you control these groups is up to you. Do you praise democracy and have free elections? Or do you declare martial law and shoot any protesters on sight? The choice is yours, Presidente.I got this game through a Humble Bundle, and do not regret the purchase.			"

												City building games have been a staple of PC gaming since the beginning. It is a subset of the RTS genre that helped to pioneer both sandbox gameplay and the concept of nearly limitless replayability. Fastforward to the present and the genre remains very much alive and well in Tropico 3; a game that takes the foundation of the genre, adds a great deal of social and economic depth, and finally puts a Latin twist on it for good measure. Developed by Haemimont Games and published by Kalypso Media, Tropico 3 has all the features of a city-building game developed by the mainstream likes of Electronic Arts.The first thing that will grab your attention is the visual quality. Tropico 3 brings the beauty of tropical islands to life very similar to the way Far Cry did. From lush forests to arid deserts, the varying environments on a single island help to break up any visual monotony that would normally be a problem. Of course, this isn't to say that the random map generator can't and doesn't create maps with little variation. Thankfully, the game does allow you to preview the landscape before starting on a new island.If the visuals aren't impressive enough, the soundtrack will get certainly get your attention. The music attempts to capture the authentic Caribbean style and does a fairly good job of it. In fact, the only real downside to the soundtrack is that there doesn't seem to be enough tracks. You will hear the same tracks many, many times during one game, which can last for hours depending on whether you're playing in sandbox mode or a campaign.In order to maintain the game's authenticity, the majority of the voice acting is Spanish. Moreover, any immigrants or workers hired from other countries will mostly speak English. Only the voice acting that the player needs to understand is done in English with a decent Latin American accent. For example, there is a radio announcer that provides regular updates on the situation of the island.The gameplay isn't the standard city building players have come to expect from games like Sim City. Instead, Tropico 3's focus is on the social, political, and economic development of the island nation. The game introduces a few factions that the people align themselves with such as Capitalists, Communists, Nationalists, Militarists, Environmentalists, Intellectuals, and the Religious. And, the player is tasked with appeasing these factions whether by building structures such as churches or military bases, signing edicts that reduce pollution or ban contraceptives, or signing treaties with either the U.S. or the U.S.S.R.The faction system brings a lot of depth to Tropico 3, and it isn't just about increasing the happiness of the overall population. Every couple years an election is held on the island that the player must win. Appeasing a majority of the factions helps secure votes, but it's based on more than making all the factions happy. For example, a majority of the population may belong to a single faction, thus making that faction the most important focus. Knowing which factions to appease and when is crucial to getting reelected. The player can choose to give political speeches during each election, and even pick what topics to address, which can have an effect on the voters.The elections aren't the only thing to worry about it. There is also the potential for members of a faction to become rebels. If the player makes a faction angry enough, it will increase the number of rebels. Then, those rebels will attempt to sabotage infrastructure, take hostages, spread propaganda, and even assassinate El Presidente. Of course, being in good standing with the Militarists (the army) allows the player to fend off against rebel attacks, which even play out on the streets when they occur.Economically, Tropico 3 is based entirely around three major sources of revenue: industry, agriculture, and tourism. The player can use farms, which can be set to harvest a variety of crops from food to tobacco; industrial buildings, which take those crops and produce products; and/or tourism attractions, which bring people to the island who will spend money.Based on the map the player is given, some economic resources such as oil wells and mining deposits, may not be available, forcing the player to rely on other ways of growing the economy. Economic progression in Tropico 3 is a slow process, even using the 3x speed feature that's available. Moreover, it needs to be closely watched by the player because of random events that may occur. For example, throughout the game, the state of the world economy may fluctuate, causing an increase or decrease in the price of your exported goods. These events will impact the player's economy dramatically, forcing the player to take action.Tropico 3 doesn't offer a huge number of building variations or options like many city building games do, but it doesn't need to. The depth of the game doesn't stem from the cosmetic look of the buildings, but from the dizzying level of depth and customization. For example, all the farms look exactly the same, but the player can set each farm on the island to grow a different crop. Better yet, where the farm is placed affects what types of crops it can grow. Some crops grow best at high altitudes, in high humidity, or in sunny areas. Picking the right crop for the right location can make or break your economy.To add to the depth, the player can also set the wages of the workers based on the job or education level. Even better than that, players can set wages based on each individual building. For instance, the cooks at one restaurant could make $15 while the cooks at the restaurant close to the tourist's hotel could make $20. Players are also able to easily set the wages of all the cooks, regardless of which restaurant they work at, as simply as clicking a button. The same thing goes for the education level options, which allow the player to set the wage of all employees with no education, a high school education, or a college education.Player will have to deal with a variety of problems such as pollution, economic disparity, crime, housing, political unrest, foreign influence, overcrowding, extreme weather, and a variety of random events that can impact the island. Hurricanes can sweep in and destroy key buildings such as electric substations, which could create rolling blackouts across the island, reducing the output of industry buildings that require power and lowering the overall happiness of the population.Despite the game's astounding level of depth and options, however, there are a few problems that can cause headaches. For starters, the in-game tutorial is a less-than-adequate introduction to the game mechanics. It does a fine job of getting the player used to the UI and where certain information is represented, but it doesn't explain how to actually grow the economy or reduce the threat of rebellion. For example, the tutorial will tell the player how to build a farm and set a crop, but it doesn't make it clear how exactly it contributes to increasing revenue.There are also some minor control issues. For example, when selecting a building to place on the map, the player uses the middle scroll wheel to rotate the buildings orientation. However, the scroll wheel is also used to zoom in and out, which means the player needs to zoom in close enough prior to selecting a building to ensure the placement is correct.Overall, Tropico 3 should be applauded for its depth and customization. The game's visuals along with its unique and authentic soundtrack help draw the player into its Caribbean setting. And, regardless of its few problems, none of which are game-breaking, it does an excellent job of focusing on the political, social, and economic pieces of the game, each of which often affects the others in some way.

												Tropico  3 is a light city/state building simulator. + Nice graphics+ Polished gameplay+ It gets you in to that tropican mood.+ Funny- If you've played an older Tropico, its more of the same. Even the character traits are the same. I expected more or different elements to the game compared to Tropico 1.- Building roads is a hassle in this game. - Experienced some CTD's- its a bit light if you are looking for a serious city game. Overall a fun game but more of the same			"

 Originally posted on April 9, 2011 Tropico 3 is a delight of a game. It features funny and charming music, atmosphere, and little details that continue to make me smile. The varieties of different approaches you can take to building an economy or satisfying your people are great, and the balance between diplomacy, economics, and and politics is very good. My major complaints with this game are that many game mechanics are not explained at all (very poor tutorial) and the ways things effect each other are not readily apparent in many situations. When first playing the game, youll often find your economy suddenly tanking, and youll have to dig through the economy hunting for clues as to why it is doing so. The constant effect of each building and policy should be more visible immediately within the UI, in order to avoid situations where the player doesn't understand the causes of an event. Also, the AI needs a lot of work, and the garage and combat systems are very flawed. Overall, I'm excited to see where they take it.			"

												Tropico 3 is just as great as any tropico but just as simple and limited. Actually i would say it aint worth playing tropico 4 if you got tropico 3 and vice versa... Its a series that doesnt change much... most changes look like mods or tiny expansions... the dlc of tropico 3 for example, was pathetic and 1 of the biggest wastes of money in my steam history... Tropico is an original idea and a refreshing series, but unfortunetly the changes are pathetic and playing 1 of them is more than enough....			"

												For all those who have a dictator inside (or maybe you just like feeling powerful), Tropico is a game you will enjoy from the very beggining. Although this version (Tropico 3) doesn't offer a really improved experience compared to the first one of the saga, besides some graphical improvement and a more 3D environment.As the commander of a banana republic, this game offers a different feeling from other city government simulations you've may tried. This one is really political and you'll often have to choose between communist/capitalist ways to rule a nation. You are going to try to make your Tropico nation a wealthy one, but of course, not forgetting about your own Swiss Account.The sound of this game is one of the things I like most. Of course, I speak spanish and I like latin music, but besides that, background music mixes within the sense of a Tropican country, and your people dialogs are so much fun, it really is one of the things I'd recommend Tropico for.The sense of humour of this saga, and the entire parody thing is one of its strongest's points, if you're unfamiliar with Tropico games, I'd recommend you to start with Tropico 1, or Tropico 4. This version isn't more than a graphical improved Tropico 1.			"

												El Presidente Version 3This is my first Tropico Game and after some time of frustrating restarts and head meets desk moments,i finally figured out how to be a good El Presidente. Sure some folks are always bothering me, but meh i got a prison.You have many ways of getting rid of negative people as well as options to make your people happy.Beating these small shacks, your worst enemies, can be difficult, since they tend to pop up in the worst moments.Also your workers are damn lazy, they dont build your houses and ignore the big ♥♥♥ transport ships in your harbor -.-Overtime, you can teach them how to work better and soon you can grab the great ressources like oil and rum ^^Just sayin, but the street tool is damn awful >.<Oh and lamas tend to assassinate your favourite dog >.<But yeah, you are EL PRESIDENTE, this makes all the bad stuff up ^^Become a good friend of the USA or UDSSR or stay neutral and raise an army to defend yourself.This game is slow, but when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan you know someone invades your place >.<Also make sure you dont provoke a traffic jam! And attract loads of tourists!Important note:The most important persons in your state are your people. Make them happy and you can stay El Presidente forever!			"

												I have never played a Tropico game before. However I like playing management sim games. Although I was a bit sceptical for this game because I saw that it is based on island life. I was thinking about a big city, zoning tiles etc. To my surprise, the small island had same amount of fun and challenge like other city-building sims. The campaign was too good and full of fun. Few campaings are very easy and few are hard but overall my experience was very good yet also provided some challenge. One thing I didn't like is, I cannot place buildings in uneven terrain and there's no possibility of bulldozing it and make it even (unlike simcity). Apart from that I like the way it is handling the business management part. * Don't go woth the time mentioned in my profile. Due to offline mode, I've lost at least 15+ hours into it.If I've to rate this game in a scale, I will give it 8/10.			"

												Having never played a Tropico game before I didn't know what to expect in this game. I got this free from Humble Bundle and I have found it incredibly enjoyable, sometimes too easy and also slightly frustrating at times but on the whole fun.The scenario you're placed in is a fantastic idea (small banana republic torn between capitalism and communism) and gives your small towns a personal feel rather than just a mass of housing in a giant metropolis. Essentially you're a poor nation building up a small island to become a global success through tourism or commerce. Your main aim in the game is to please these sims and you can view each one and what they're upto by clicking on them or completely ignore them and play the game like you would simcity, the choice is yours.I will also try the new games of the series. Anyway If you like City Sim games you'll probably love this. [8.5/10] "

												As a newcomer to the Tropico franchise I found the game very simple and easy to get into. You're given choices on how you develop your Island nation. You can go North Korea/Cuba style or go South Korea/Jamaica style. Overall, Tropico 3 is a good-looking, surprisingly deep, charming city-builder. Lots of good ideas that make intuitive sense. More than worth the price of admission.

												I wasn't really a Tropico fan until this one. The original Tropico had a lot of good ideas in its individual citizens and its banana republic politics, but it was held back by technical limitations and short-sighted designs. After an odd detour with Tropico 2, the developers returned to the original concept and polished it up in a brand-new 3D engine, and the results speak for themselves.Tropico 3 places you into the spit-shined spats of a Carribbean dictator, charged with helping his hapless little island flourish. Each individual citizen is modeled with needs, jobs, opinions, and motivations, so the key to success is keeping enough of them happy (or suppressed) to achieve your own agenda. This is mostly done by building homes and services they want, and making sure they have enough money to enjoy them. You'll be building churches, clinics, restaurants, casinos, and more, in addition to the farms and factories needed to fund them.The big stumbling block of the first Tropico was that your little Tropicans couldn't be trusted to actually get ♥♥♥♥ done when it needed to be done. That's not a problem here, as your citizens spend far more of their time on their tasks and only go astray if their needs are very conspicuously not being met. And as it turns out, when your island is running like it should, the money just pours in. Even the most basic exports like excess food or meat will earn you everything you need to outfit your island. And once you get more complex industries up and running, money will never be an issue again.As a result, Tropico 3 is way, way easier than its predecessors and a lot of its contemporaries, but this is by no means a bad thing. Economic prosperity allows you a lot more freedom to build your island the way you want, with all the services and luxuries you can stuff into your borders. You'll need them too, because your citizens are noticeably pickier than in previous games and won't hesitate to turn to armed rebellion. Some scenarios lean heavier on this aspect but managing the different factions and quelling uprisings are a larger part of the game, as they should be.One very welcome feature added for this outing is the opportunity to customize your dictator. Tropico 1 let you choose his or her traits but 3 lets you give them backstories, change their outfits, and then watch them walk around and interact with the people. You can actually use your little avatar to inspire workers to work harder or give rousing speeches to the commoners. The traits also seem much more powerful this time around, and honestly work as a sort of difficulty system. Taking traits that help with scenario goals can make a huge difference, but you can also choose flaws that add a greater challenge.In the end, Tropico 3 is the game the first one should have been. The core mechanics are not very far removed; most of the buildings and edicts are the same, and the politics are virtually unchanged. But everything works the way it's supposed to, is balanced to not be so frustrating, and is presented in some charming, picturesque 3D. There's no reason to go any further back in the series than this, so if you've ever wanted to lord over your own tropical island, start here.			"

												Have you ever wanted to be your own dictator and/or president? If so, play Tropico 3 :D It is like being a dictator but without the world harassing you, only a radio personIn all honesty, I really enjoyed Tropico 3. It is my second entry into the Tropico franchise and the first that I bought. Being able to have so much control over the island is soooo much fun with what you can do and what can happen.I even bought it for my girlfriend​, and she loves it :DGive the game a try ^,^			"

												Brilliant city building game with lots of tropical flavour, lush graphics and a fun soundtrack. There's a nice political element to the game which means you have to keep citizens with different tastes and needs happy so that you are re-elected and avoid rebel attacks etc. There's also plenty of things to build that cover different aspects such as housing, entertainment, tourism and industry etc. Every citizens life plays out in great detail too and from the moment they arrive on the island you can follow them around from work to home and everything inbetween. Highly recommended.			"

												Tropico 3 is two things: it's essentially an HD reskin of the first game except easier, and it's arguably a stripped down version of Tropico 4 that's more difficult.The core game is still the same good Tropico experience, and there's two campaigns' worth of unique missions that are great fun. Ultimately though, Tropico 3 is probably more for series completionists, people who were turned off by the first game's age, and/or people who want to trade the more freeform experience of Tropico 4 and 5 for a challenge. The rest of this review is about how exactly Tropico 3 differs, and how it's more difficult for it.Apart from the new buildings, edicts and other stuff in the Absolute Power expansion (which is absolutely required if you're going to play this game), the inclusion of actual roads and cars, simplified construction, and new missions, it's a remake of the original from a time before remakes were cool. It introduces a couple of neat things like deficit spending up to $10,000, a tilt-shift effect when zoomed out and an isometric view.Tropico 4 doesn't have those last two things for some reason, although it more than makes up for it since 4 really is kind of a Tropico 3.5. It runs on the same engine, the UI works pretty much the same, and it doesn't change up the gameplay much, but it simply has more content both in the base game and from its own expansion & DLCs.It's more difficult than 4, since you don't have its convenience features or raft of DLC buildings to save you from tight spots. You must select two clearly defined character strengths and flaws for your Presidente, instead of 4's more even-keeled traits that usually ended up being good. Quick building doesn't exist, which forces you to plan ahead, and you can't do missions to patch up relations with factions, superpowers, or just to get yourself out of a tight spot. The missions are oriented more around long-term goals instead of more immediate objectives, which is a nice change of pace and allows for more leeway while also not handing you as many rewards simply for playing the mission.On the flipside, the fact that construction workers no longer have to clear the foundations for new buildings and the mere existence of roads, cars and garages make the game easier than the first one. You still need to plan ahead with road and garage placement, and even then sometimes traffic will be bad, but honestly, even Tropico would have cars, wouldn't it? (The black humor is arguably more sharp than 4's humor as well, which relied a little more on references.)Weirdly, if you own both the base game and the expansion pack, you can't even launch the base game without getting a prompt to play or install the expansion. You'd want to buy and use the expansion anyway if you ever play this, but it's still weird. It appears to overwrite the EXE of the base game while still appearing as a separate game in your library.It's also weird how it actually runs worse than Tropico 4. Even maxed out on my GTX 560, it stutters. Fortunately the game as a whole can still look good.You also must make an account that is apparently separate from any existing Kalypso launcher accounts to access the online user challenges. I'm not sure if there's any life left in whatever 3 had for a community, but if you're stuck with this game for whatever reason, the user-made challenges are probably worth playing.Tropico 3 definitely has a style of its own, a pretty good one that's worth pointing out in the face of otherwise little difference from 4's meat and bones, and something that might be worth experiencing for series fans. Some miscellaneous obervations about said style:* The music is great, definitely more varied than Tropico 4 but not nearly as much as the original. It's mostly more upbeat than Tropico's, too.* Unfortunately, the map generator is pretty generic: it usually makes flat discs as opposed to the more characterized islands of the first game. 4's map generation is better with this.* It's interesting to note the difference between Presidente avatars in Tropico and Tropico 3. In Tropico, it stayed out of view because the player sitting at their computer was supposed to represent the presidente. In 3, you can move your Presidente around on the map and micromanage them if you desire.* There are immigrants from the USSR/USA that can come to Tropico in this version - I'm pretty sure you don't get American or Soviet immigrants in 4.* 3's interface has a very pretty Cold War aesthetic, but is actually a little less ergonomic than 4's. I'll take 4's efficiency any day, but I'll always miss 3's look.* The cover/banner art is the best in the series. Nothing quite matches El Presidente literally handling Tropico like his own little puppet.			"

												Tropico is a great sim series where you are put in the position of ""El Presidente"", the defacto dictator of the island of Tropico. You guide civilization on the island down multiple paths based on playstyle and choices you make leading to a variety of different cultures taking hold in your society. Does your nation become a capitalist industrial powerhouse? A (not so) peaceful theocracy? Maybe you give rise to a Communist paradise! Its pretty much all up to you in Tropico. Can you lead your nation to success, or will you end up a failed state? Overall I would give the Tropico games a recommendation if you are a fan of sim games. That being said, even if you are new to the genre, there is a very good chance Tropico 3 SSE could make a great addition to your library.			"

												This is just like AoE, Total War, Civ, Banished, etc. It gets you playing then next thing you know its the next day. This is one of those games that is hard to walk away from as it has the spark that most, if not all, RTS' and City Builders have. I love this game you its core mechanics and its comical nature as it is not as hardcore as a game like Banished and makes you laugh at times. It has great voice actors that make the expirence entertaining and keep you sitting in your chair for hours. The game is very involving and very well done. I would recommend buying this game over the others although I have not played the others I have read reviews and most say this is the best one. Hope this helps your decision making process!

												I'll just start off by saying that I caught Tropico 3 on sale, about 3 or 4 bucks. And a price like that is literally a STEAL for a game like this.One thing I'd like to say is that it's a good solid game. With plenty of challenges and acheivements to acheive (Sadly though, they aren't Steam Acheivements) So you can get a good amount of hours from this game depending what you do, it's also a good time killer, if you're into those.Another thing I would like to say about this, is that it follows up on history pretty well. Game starting about late/after WWII and taking place mostly during the Cold War. Meaning you will take sides with the USSR or the US, or if you want, juggle relations with both of them.There are also plenty of some real life problems that you can deal with in the game as you dictate your Tropico Island Paradise.I would also like to point out that this game runs well on even weak machines. I'll have you know that at the time I made this review, my Desktop sucks and runs Cities Skylines at 7 FPS average. That's actually one of the main reasons I bought Tropico 3 so I have a City Builder to play until I get an actual Gaming Computer.I think in my opinion that it's fantastic for a game to run on weak machines, so EVERYONE can play, regardless of Computer specs. (Well, unless you play on a computer made in the 1990's, there's no hope for you) Also, Tropico 3 looks VERY GOOD with some lower graphics, so that's also a plus.The only problem I really have with this game is the lack of variety in Buildings. Sure there's plenty of buildings you can place, but they almost always look the same, making kinda of look un-realistic. Not to mention, you don't want to put a Clinic next to a Hospital, because there's already health care in that area. That's mostly just me, what you'll think is up to you, really.So I'm going to end it with me asking myself...:Do I recommend this game? YesI also recommend you should find a day to catch this on sale, because it's like, super cheap by then.			"

												Awesome game but if you will buy it now I suggest you buy tropico 4. It's basically an improved version of tropico 3. The only reason for playing this over Tropico 4 would be to experience it's campaign, which is unique to this game and has lot's of the series charms for music and the funny jokes,especially Penultimo! If you care more about the gameplay, and not the campaign, tho go straight for Tropico 4.Overall Score for me: 7/10PS: If you buy the Gold edition the launcher you should be using it's the Absolute Power one, not this one.

												Tropico 3 is probably the best iteration of the long-running City-Mgmt Sim 'Tropico' series. You play as 'El Presidente', the dictator of a small Banana Republic island and the game does a fantastic job in recreating the look and feel of governing a tropical island paradise - lush mountains and jungles, erupting volcanos, beautiful lakes and beaches, limited natural resources, trade and global politics to balance, pesky rebels from the countryside and a petulant mob of citizens who are willing to shout 'Viva La Revolucion' at a moments notice.Veterans of the series seem to prefer this version to later iterations (Tropico 4 and Tropico 5) for its memorable characters, fantastic soundtrack, excellent graphics, multitude of city customization options and intuitive gameplay mechanics - giving you complete control of a tropical island paradise.As 'El Presidente' you can call for general elections, and then send out a hit squad to assasinate the leaders of all opposing factions that stand against your rule - (8.5/10)			"

There are a few bugs here and there, such as hearing multiple voice overs simultaneously in the tutorial and a frustrating amount talking where one should be playing, however once the tutorials are passed and the game begins, it's a world of fun.

												I love it! Actually, I'm a long time RTS player that loves to play war games on my PC. And I'm aware that this game exist for years now, but I didn't get a chance to try this because I was not so interested in this game back then, or maybe I just don't know how good it was and what are the mechanics that made this game unique to other RTS out there.My attitude with RTS games back in the day was, if it's not Liquid Ent., Blizzard or EA's RTS work like Battle Realms, Red Alert, Generals, Warcraft etc. then I won't try play it.But when Valve and publisher behind this game decided to release and give away free Keys for 24 hours, I didn't hesitate to get one and DL this game immediately and play it. And yes I was suprised how good this game is, its very well made and you will definitely enjoy this. What I like about this game so far: - You will get a chance to run a country like 'Tropico'- You will also get a chance to become a dictator/Leader like Fidel Castro in virtual world.- Manage all the resources and aid given by US or USSR and build structures to grow Tropico's economy.- Deal with all the rebels who's planning to destabilise your leadership. lol- Yeah, the graphics are dated or outdated (whatever you call it) but it won't stop you for enjoying it.- The game's real time AI reactions are really good enough. There are protest, rebellions, International Community reactions, war and even budget deficits that could make your economy down from debts if you build a lot of projects simultaneously.And lastly, I have a suggestion for the devs of this game since this is (old?) and the graphics are no longer acceptable in the standard of this generation. Why don't they port this game on modern powerful Smartphones and Tablets that have Quad core CPUs and GPUs? I think that this game is very ideal for Touch screen devices since this is purely RTS and doesn't require much of buttons to play.. And to end this review, I will definitely recommend this game to anyone, even on Aliens living on Mars.			"

												Ah Tropico, where the money is so colourful, you'll forget it's worthless :DTropico 3 is a mix of city building, (Tropical island themed) and The Sims franchise, where as filling happiness factors is key to smooth gameplay. It does well enough to fit the atmosphere of the title with radio broadcasts, spanish accents and the lavitan background music. As ""El Presidente"" you must get enough votes to remain in power which makes it sometimes satisfying to win the election after some hard citizens to win over, however not much else is done to deepen the voting system in the game. Once you lose an election it is game over, If you win you may continue on until the next election rinse and repeat. You are a leader of a small island nation that seems to be soverign in it's own right, owing no alleginace to any superpower.You can however do dealings with Russia or America, building favour with the Communists or Capitalists, respectivly.It boils down to how you would like to run your nation, (in each mission or map scenario) leaning towards communism, keeps your citizens happier and housing cheaper, albiet loss of export profits. If heading towards the Capitalist end of the spectrum, favoring infastructure, power plants and of course export profits. As an island nation, the economy relies on exports whether or not you are predominatly Communist or Capitalist. Much of the game is spent setting up enough housing for your population, building structures to keep certain politcal groups on the island happy enough to vote for you next election and on occasion, defending your buildings from rebel attacks.Tropican citizens turn rebel when thier satisfaction levels drop too low, clicking on an indivdual citzen will show stars next to factors that determine his happiness. These stars usally 3 factors are noted, represent what is most important to this indivual, for expample job secruity or relgious satisfaction, if these needs are not met for a while he will cease to be a citizen of Tropico and join others hiding out in the island's wilderness.Special buildings can re-educate captured rebels, turning them back into a useful workforce.Another important factor in the economic stability of the Tropican islands is tourism.Tourism can be a huge boost to your government treasury, however care should be taken when you are planning your constructon phase as location of buildings is important, an ideal resort would have garages which produce cars, readily available for quick transport, hotels, entertainmt buildings and other money making buildings found under the tourism tab.Also of note, is the tourism industry can at times cause a flood of people to land on the island, causing traffic jams and lengthy, expensive, holdups, not good for any busy island nation. Take care when expanding.This may seem like a detailed review, however I have only covered some parts of the game, there is still more and I think continuing would only create a bigger wall of text and uncover all things best left undiscovered until one actually buys this game.

												This game, just wow!Gotta say, this is AMAZING! Really, the graphics are probably the only let-down! But their also really not that bad!The characters are fun, the content is packed and for a game I for FREE (With some Humble Bundle Deal!) it's exactly what I like!So far, I have completed the First Campaign (Bananas) and so far, my Economy was bad up untill I bought Fruitina LTD (All for Spoilers for now) and pretty much then saved my Island! (St Helena)Also, the Radio is amazing! I mean, it is just a few talk points on a loop, but it isn't too repetitive that annoys me!Overall, get this game! You WILL have fun playing it! I'll also happily get Tropico 4 and even 5 when I get the Opportunity!P.S. This is where I got that deal from! https://www.humblebundle.com/store "

												If you've ever wanted to be a dictator, or think you'd be better at running the government, you should give this a go. The fact that you need to try and make everyone happy (Spiritualists, Military, foreign goverments and of course, the people of Tropico) is a handfull. Keeps you wanting to play and makes you think.The one biggest con I do have though, and I've seen this con in a couple of other reviews as well, after so long and you have all this money, your island is so small that everything is crammed and you don't know what to do with your money anymore! But is having too much money ever really bad?With this game currently being on sale [woo Steam summer sales~] it REALLY is worth it. Even at full price, I'd buy it again if I had too.			"

												Not enough information! That's my main complaint with Tropico. The game is, in essence, SimCity in a banana republic, balancing city-building with the burden of defending your fledgling republic against the many factions that are trying to destroy it. Its a terrific game, or it would be if it would let me better understand what is going on in my little empire. ""Garage is overloaded"", the game complains. Great, but which garage? And what constitutes ""overloaded? and what effect will that have? Tourists aren't visiting my casino? Terrible, but why not? Is it too expensive? Is it not catering to their tastes? Can't they find it? I don't know. There's a little icon over one of my factories; I have no idea what it means but its probably not anything good. No idea what to do to fix the problem, though. I'm sure there is a complicated, worthy simulation running in the game, but God knows I'll never appreciate it because it refuses to open itself up to me. That means its fun for a few hours but hardly something on which to spend weeks or months, and that's a shame.			"

												My first experience with the Tropico series was with Tropico 4 just over 3 years ago, and with about 25 hours put into it. I really enjoyed my time with T4, and was glad I played it. Fast forward to now, and I try-out Tropico 3, since I heard its scenarios were much more creative than Tropico 4's, and I had figured enough time had passed since I played a Tropico game.Sadly, even after not having played a Tropico game after 3 years, it seems that the Tropico formula's novelty didn't come back, and I found myself getting bored after a few hours of play.So here's my advice: If you're new to Tropico, I don't think you can go wrong with either Tropico 3 or Tropico 4. They're both pretty good, engrossing games. But if you're like me, and see the patterns of how games work quickly, you might find yourself getting bored of the Tropico formula rather quickly. And in that case, you shouldn't feel any fault if you get bored even despite the supposed reputation of the games.			"

TL;DR SUMMARY: Immensely enjoyable sim/city builder game with a unique atmosphere and sense of humour. Its only significant weakness is the lack of more in-depth control over buildings and parametres, which can become a bit frustrating over time, as well as few missions that are genuinely challenging once you get a good hang of how the game works. This is the only thing stopping this game from becoming an addiction for hundreds of hours, but it's still incredibly fun, and since it's also easy to get into, it may be a great first choice if you've never played a game like this and want to give it a try.FULL REVIEW: GOOOOOOOOD EVENING TROPICOOOOOOO, I AM JUANITO- I mean, I am Lib and I bring you this glorious Presidente-approved review. In Tropico 3, you will learn how to build majestic sunlit cities, how to build an epic industry bringing you insane amounts of money while trying to stop the environmentalists from drowning you in broccoli, how to keep all the citizens and various groups on your island happy you can't lololol, how to make the tiny insignificant countries called the US and USSR bend to your supreme might and give you money (called ""foreign aid"" for some reason but who cares about the name) and how to make tourists want to have Tropican flags over their beds. Oh, and how to not get assassinated or overthrown in a coup. And llamas.So, what kind of presidente do you want to be? Do you want to build a socialdemocratic utopia where everyone is happy and fluffy unicorns walk around the streets? Of course you can, just make sure you build up a solid economy first. Or maybe you are a distant cousin of Satan and feel like the ""arrange an accident"" option should be the most fun in the game? You can do that as well, but you might want to make sure that your army likes you and the secret police is doing its job, or your iron fist rule may not last very long. And in either case, issuing edicts will help you along the way, with plenty of options ranging from social security to martial law.But okay, this is getting dark, so JUANITO TIME, TROPICO NEWS TODAY. This game has a unique atmosphere unlike anything else as well as an unhealthy obsession with llamas, with its heavily sarcastic (and yet pulled off with great taste) sense of humour and the constant combination of the ""paradise island"" setting with some fairly dark matters. The graphics are lovely (and I'm writing this in 2017), especially nature and the ocean, but the most interesting part of this game is... sound. I mean, it's a little bittersweet - it's totally unique, in the way the music is pretty much 24/7 Latin American party hard, and as a big bonus you get the already mentioned RADIO HOST JUANITO, TROPICO NEWS TODAY and whoever voiced that guy deserves a Nobel prize for voice acting (I don't care if there isn't one, make one). Still... as fun as the music is, I feel it could use a bit more variety (I think there aren't even 10 songs altogether) and as much as Juanito's lines will probably crack you up, he has only one for every particular event. By the time you have 5 hours played, the ""spiraling into debt"" one will be burned into your mind.But between all those things, comes my favourite thing about Tropico 3 - as simplified and ""tongue in cheek"" as it may be, it gives you a decent idea what ruling is like. There is always stuff to be done, nearly always someone unhappy (the results of which can vary from a small peaceful protest to an invasion) and always room for improvement. If you ever get a comfortable lead that lets you just sit back and relax, it's usually when you're near completing the mission anyway. As a result, this game does the ""just 5 more minutes"" syndrome probably better than anything I've ever played - you'll just want to complete that bunch of apartment blocks, oh wait the religious people are unhappy let's build a cathedral- OMGWTFBBQ REBELS I NEED AN ARMORY, okay that's done but the entertainment happiness is poor, let's build a cinema or something- ...♥♥♥♥ it's 5 AM. And the cool thing is that the game is generally very ""newbie-friendly"" and even though it all may sound very complex, it's quite easy to get the hang of.However, this leads us also to my biggest issue with the game - once you're past that point and know the game well, you'll wish for some more in-depth manual control over various buildings to get things done even more efficiently... but there aren't really any - especially construction workers (though thankfully you can set building priority) and teamsters work in mysterious ways that I don't think even the greatest minds could explain, and farms having half the planet of fertile land around will sometimes pick the most nonsensical spot to plant crops. And in case of statistics and such, the almanac generally does its job very well, but could be a bit more intuitive and detailed, e.g. the various happiness levels - for instance, healthcare quality or liberty are relatively easy to understand, but I still have no clue what exactly affects environmental happiness, and there is no tab with all the ""pluses"" and ""minuses"" like with the happiness of each citizen group.Speaking of which, that's one of the most fun and sometimes challenging parts - a big part of the game is balancing between the happiness of the various citizen groups, as of course they don't exactly all get along (such as capitalists and communists, for example...), as well as keeping good relations with the ""superpowers"" (US and USSR). The missions tend to expand that even further, as you'll encounter various events and your decisions will usually impact your relations with some of the groups or the foreign powers. The events are generally fun and cleverly designed, with the biggest plus being that your decisions usually do have an impact and further consequences, as you'll learn (you made a shady deal that seemed profitable? Well, someone found out about it). And the missions are generally quite fun and somewhat diverse (from ""transform this boring island into a lovely tourist resort"" to ""screw everything, just get money in your Swiss bank acount""), although I really feel the later ones should be more challenging - only one leaves you with a limited choice of buildings at first forcing you to think out of the box, whereas for the rest you'll usually find out a reliable strategy at some point USSR development aid edict OP and it may start to feel a little ""rinse and repeat"" over time.There are two more minor issues with the game I need to mention though, just because of how... bizarre they are. The first one is that many workplaces require employees with a particular education and/or particularly men or women... and especially at the beginning when you have few citizens, the latter can be annoying. Now... it's not surprising priests need to be male or, um, cabaret workers need to be female, but... only men can be doctors (the most consistently annoying one), only women can be high school teachers but only men can teach in colleges, only women can be journalists, only women can work in power plants?!.watThe second one... the cool thing in Tropico 3 is that you get to make your own ""avatar"" (i.e. your presidente persona) with a fairly nice variety of visual options, and you need to choose personal traits and flaws which have an effect on various factors in the game. Your avatar can be male or female, and being my troll self I of course picked female (I mean, is there something more boring than a male dictator, duh). And, well, in a little hilarious laziness on the developers' part, the traits are unchanged and all with descriptions written with a male character in mind... including the Womanizer flaw which remains completely unchanged. I mean, it's not impossible...But did I enjoy those 40 hours? Of course I did.And I miss Juanito already. ;_;			"

												Really fun and seriously addictive game, plus good sense of humour. Build your own tropical island, manage the inhabitants as well as your income and politics. Now the really fun part is choosing how you want to play things: take care of your citizens and give them what they want or rule with an iron fist? Nothing feels better than sending your soldiers to brutally gun down some miners on strike which sends the rest back to work in fear, hyuk hyuk!			"

												I will start off with the fact that the game may not be interesting to people who don't like politics and city building.This game is DEFINITELY not a fully-fledged city-builder as it focuses more on the political aspect of cities. I do reccommend this game for those who like to be hobby dictators or hobby politicians in games. With a wide variety of political choices this game is perfect for anyone intersted in country-ruling.			"

												This game is very fun! but can be hard so I would recommend that you look at some online videos _guides_   , If you have never played the first 2, opening this up right away and not looking into the game at all well , then you will come across some issues as the game has alot of things that you need to get right in order to have a  rich country, but  there is a sandbox mode, put on the god mode, and just build and have fun, sometimes enjoy that more rather than playing normally witch does include some type of know how about the game. :) the 4th game of this collection is not as good, as 3, only has a few more buildings some more powers etc, 3 is very good for the price would say that the game is very fun for its age.

Had some laughs cuz of all the abuse of the Latinamerican stereotypes (I'm from Argentina btw).Pros:A little bit challenging at the beggining.A quite good economy mechanics.You can check every citizen of your country and see what's going on!Many variables to take into accountConsI found a little annoying the way roads are to be built... After playing half the Campaign, the game stops being challenging. I quit before finishing it. Still, I'd recommend this game. I enjoyed it a lot.			"

Apparently about a month ago it was a free on GOG and now about a little than a 1,000 or so people play it daily on average, so I think now was a better time to publish a review of this game so far. Basically, I've just screwed around in the free play mode, but I think I got the core gameplay down and all. Great gameplay, great soundtrack, great humor, great game.

Also it made my game crash like in 2-3 mins without cheats in my saved game with no cheats activated.but all up its still very fun (in my opinion) im in the middle at the moment so its recommended and not recommended.

												I want to like Tropico-- it ahs elements that are amazing, like great graphics, readable interface, and one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while.  That aside, the gameplay feels too constrained; it isn't a sandbox management game, but a targeted development game.  As such, you find yourself doing much the same thigns in the same order on individual maps.  Also, since the game manages workers and builders, you will often find yourself unable to get priority buildings done quickly enough to allow game progression.  I'ts not a broken game, it's just a little below average.			"

												Ok first of all, I like this game. It is rather good. There is nothing wrong with it in a sense of quality and features...It's just...It's kind of dry. I can't quite put my finger on it. But all I know is that I don't enjoy my time playing this. It's just bland. Here's a good way to put it. It's like a rice cake. Very dry and no flavor. But this is a special rice cake, it has that extremely sweet white frosting dazzled on the top of it. So in a way it's good, but it's still a rice cake. See what I'm getting at.Also the game is sold as a city builder, but I'm not feeling that strategy side that all city builders are supposed to have. It's to easy to win this game. Also there are no real penalties to the bad decisions you make in the game. So again, it's a rice cake. Now I'm jumping to the things that I really just don't like about the game. So no more rice metaphors.First of all the road building.....Oh my sweet goodness me. It is supremely dimwitted. It just doesn't listen to what I want it to do! I try to do grids, I get squiggles. I want to do squiggles, I get a grid. It's just bad.Another thing, the builders.............JUST BUILD THE FRIKKIN FARM! IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS! JUST BUILD IT! It gives you an option to speed up the building process by prioritizing the things you want done. But all that does is gets one builders attention for 3 seconds.  So everything you want to get built, doesn't get built and everyone gets angry, and you lose....*sigh* There's another thing. Stop telling me to build garages! I have enough!And lastly. The radio......... I want to tie up Juanito, set him in a boat....made of meat, drench the entire thing in gasoline, shove it toward a shark with a match strapped to it's nose, and then do the same thing to his set of records that consist of only 5 songs. I hate Juanito!...........RICE CAKE! (I lied)Ok now that my anger has been taken out. Let me tell you what you need to do if you want to build a city in a video game and pretend your a crazed dictator from South America.........Buy Cities: Skylines, and use your imagination. Done!

												Today, I will be reviewing Tropico 3.I have been playing this game for over 50 hours, however in offline mode, I recently had a holiday.In terms of gameplay and generally enjoyment, it is suprisingly fun, I only got the game because I found it going very cheaply and I thought it would be worth its price. However, looking back, it is highly worth the current price tag, and to be honest with the knowledge of what great game it is it would be easily worth up to £20.Now, moving on to the actual review, this game through my eyes is an easy pick up and play, going through the tutorial will sure, make your life easier, but to be honest it is not required.In terms of graphics, it is suprisingly good in comparision to what I thought it would be, considering the game was made during the time of Windows Vista, XP, and very early variants of Windows 7, this game was as good as most games I play.In terms of the type of game it is a bit of crossover between a city builder like Banished ( a lot newer but you get the point), and maybe the Sims, purely because of the different groups.Now, I'm just going to throw in a quick memo about groups, and that I think they are so brilliant executed, yet beautifully straight-forward.In terms of the political system I love the alliance with the U.S/ U.S.S.R, I also think the Capitalists/Communist groups are well matched with a real life system. And the huge amount of diplomatic options.In terms of replayability, the sandbox mode gives you that easily, and the campaign will keep you coming back for more every time.Finally, my last opinions of the game summed up: A brilliant game, provides hours of entainment of such a great pick-up and play, the controls are easy to remember, and the gameplay is quick and fluid enough, with a good insight towards to welfare of your citizens.9.5/10I hope you enjoyed this review, apologies for any bad English, I am not fluent. Thank you and have fun!			"

Fun gameplay, cute graphics, happy music, humourous, doesn't get repetitive, easy to learn, hard to master in my opinion. Wasn't expecting to get hooked on it, just wanted something casual, but right now I just feel like playing more.			"

												For any City-building fan i'd say try this out! long story short it puts you in the seat of power of a cold-war era Carribean island, very fun game, a little difficult at first but a few rounds in sandbox mode can easily solve any confusion, and if your STILL lost i'll PERSONALLY help you solve any difficulty you have with the game, guaranteed!

Tropico 3 - Steam Special Edition ReviewCity simulation game featuring the poor and the rich.Tropico 3 is awesome. I got it for free not long ago from the Humble Store and for free, this game is great and I would of probably paid for it. Because of this, I'm thinking of looking into it's sequels and seeing if they're any better than this one. I do like the game though. Customisable character and customisable personality. The reason I like these games, as I have said in other reviews, is because I like the ""Playing God"" kind of game. The kind of game where you control everything and manage everything, build everything! It's all yours, your creation and whatever you want. I just love games like that and if there was a category to describe them, it'd be my favourite genre of game! Definantly recommended! Thanks for reading!			"

And I'm not supposedto be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you.It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee.- Yeah. I'm talking to a bee.And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful.I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that?- What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess.""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny.- Yeah. Bees are funny.

I don't know if you knowanything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cabas they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church.The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon?I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive,but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do?- Sure.

												Hola! Tropico 3 is a city-building sim that does a lot of things right by being both hillariously satrical and rewardingly deep. You can choose your political structure (Democracy, Communism, or Dictatorship?), economical structure (Industry or Tourism?), and how your city is built and functioned. While it's not complex and focused on micromanagement like Civilization or Europa Universalis, its more like an ego-boosted SimCity. If that's your bag, then Tropico 3 will win your heart.

												The Tropico series is back with much improved visuals, modern UI and a bit more streamlined (and a lot easier!) gameplay. The game very well took on board the advances of the gaming industry since Tropico 1.The visuals are quite excellent and atmospheric. I really like the lushness of the rainforest and the many tiny details on the buildings.I liked the music of Tropico 1 a bit more, except for the song ""Asi! Vamos"" which is awesome :DThe game itself has became noticeably easier, which is a welcome change, because I just couldn't keep my people happy and still sustain a working economy in Tropico 1.Having an actual corporeal Presidente is an interesting addition, though I'm kind of ambivalent about it, because having an actual avatar doesn't seem to serve too much purpose. They boost whichever building or construction site they are at, and can give speeches from the Palace's balcony (which draws half the population away from their work for the duration of the speech). Aside of that Presidente just randomly wanders around the map and huffily complains whenever I select them :DVerdict: get the game for a modern take on Tropico's basic premise			"

												Purchased and downloaded today, but still could not play because of ""APPCRASH"" - said by the OS (Win7 64bit, firewall, antivir; on a system which met the requirements).On every play start the game crashes.I tried to apply several community adviced fixes, like reinstalling the game, compatibility settings, steam, system, vga driver, dx update, disabling antivir and firewall, and so on..., but still not found the working one.game crash report: COULDN'T FIND OR PARSE MAP FILEsteam integrity report: 1 files failed to validate and will be reacquired.-----FINALLY the game started.IN MY CASE the proper solution was the complete REMOVAL of the ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE.Hopefully this is just a temporary solution, because antivir soft is important. However I don't think that there will be a fix for this problem from the developers (antivir and game), this is rather an old game for that.Anyway! The following section of STEAM SUPPORT advice gave me the RIGHT IDEA and solution: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9828-SFLZ-9289Thank you for them!			"

So this game has some amazing background music, with amazingly packed adventureious islands although pretty small it is still worth it considering it is only 1.49$ as of the steam summer sale. It has many different buildings and  people, your people could be homeless people right next to a apartment... or a rich doctor sitting on the top of his mansion looking down at a hobo! anyway what i am trying to get at is that this game is Amazing! and it is worth it for only 1$!! so please get this game and enjoy it with me - XDUDEXE3			"

												This game was fun until I ran out of space to build. Over 2/3 of my island is unuseable, leaving me with hardly no place to continue on. I'm at a point where I might as well stop playing. All available land is built on, and I can do nothing else. Between the hills I can't flatten and the rocks I can't move, this game ceased to be fun. I even tried to start a new game in hopes that they would offer me a differnt island, but they didn't. I got the very same island that I had before, not good.  If you are looking for a game that has potential, but really limited fun. You can't even edit the map before you play or during the game, every sim game out today allows you to do that atleast. What were they thinking by ommiting this feature. This is the game for you. But for me, this game is a skip it!			"

												Crashes as soon as I try to start the game. From what I've read, this is an issue affecting those running multiple monitors. The solution is to either disable all but one monitor to start the game (works normally after changing the correct settings, apparently) or unpack and modify the config files directly. Absolutely not worth the effort. This is a huge bug to have missed.			"

												An ambitious game, but ultimately fails due to difficulty, gameplay flaws (and fun value) and tedium.LONG VERSION:Okay, so I bought this game blindly because I heard tropico games are really really good. I install it, (ridiculously small file size, amazed me)I love the game at first. It's charming, hilarious, and fun. However, the more I played over the next few days, I had found that the flaws were really, really glaring. First of all, it seems like you HAVE to have a randomized map. Why? Why couldn't they just put a few more hours just to put the map editor that they used when making the game?Second, why can't I clear trees, rocks, and level terrain on my own? WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING?! Seriously..Thirdly, why is everything so tedious? It seems like after you have more than 100 people it starts to be a chore.The people are never happy, ever. I'd like to be able to lay back every once in a while and watch my people do their thing.Is that so much to ask?Finally, I feel like alot more could have been put into character creation. You are simply too limited to the point that I just barely was able to create Joseph Stalin (comrades 4ever), with his famous Stalin Stache. This isn't a biggy on my end, just that I'd like a little more customization.Last lastly: From what I can tell, there was alot of love and effort put into this game, but it simply doesn't do what it advertises, and that is city building.It's probably one of my biggest gripes about the game. Wanna build an airport on seemingly flat terrain? Nope! Can't do that, joe. Wanna build some houses nearby but not inside of rocks? Nope, the modellers didn't bother making collision models.  Wanna make more than one skyscraper? Nope! For whatever reason, you can't have a CITY that has skyscrapers. Also,skyscrapers are not skyscrapers. They're just really tall buildings.4/10. "

												I really enjoy this game, but I just can't get past the RAMPANT SEXISM in it. There is an assumption that you will play as a male avatar, so the majority of the audio and text refers to you as a man, and when you take control of the avatar you are bombarded with crass and sexist stereotypes. As far as the concept of the game is concerend I love it. I just can't play it with the audio on. I therefore feel compeled 'not recommend' this game because of this glaring floor, in spite of my otherwise enjoyment of the game.Shame on Haemimont Games and Kalypso Media Digital. I hope this does not continue in your other titles.			"

												There are many examples of projects that sour, when the developers are changed. This is not one of them. Kalypso and Haemimont Games have really thought this through, and delivered a game that is updated, but true to the roots.If you too dream of being supreme dictator of some faraway caribbean island, Tropico 3 is the game for you. Like in the original Tropico, you are given a fair amount of freedom to rule your minions as you wish. Do you want to be a fair, benevolent leader, whom everybody loves and adores? It's up to you to decide whether you wish to be the fair, benevolent leader, or the cruel, corrupt tyran.Tropico 3 has a bit of everything; political intrigue, decent level of simulation, good humour and cute graphics. However, coming from the original Tropico, I feel the campaign may be too easy. It's no problem to become filthy rich and make everybody love you. This wouldn't be a problem, if the map generator was better, so you could make challenging sandbox games.			"

												I will be 100 % honest in my review of Tropico 3.The game itself has you be a leader of a big or small island nation, You have a lot of options in the way you want to run your country and this is one of the strongest aspects of this game. I started to really get immersed in my little island nation which was just at the brink of debt. The game is set around the Caribbean in the early 60s during the cold war tension.  Another strong aspect of this game is the political system. The two main factions of the game are the American government and the russian soviet union. Depending on the way you treat your citizens will give you an increase or a decrease in respect -  lean too much to one side however and the other goverment may decide to pay a visit to your island. You also have the people of your island's opinions to take care of and they way you deal with them is up  to you.That's not to say the game doesn't have its problems - the game does show its age sometimes, for example in the ai path finding, I have seen people walk through one another and sometimes straight up walk through buildings. I love this game and I am happy for there to be more dlc availabale after purchase. The game's music, although repetitive, is great to listen to. Any fans of the genre of these games I highly recommend you buy this game despite it age. It is easily a 8/10 must own for strategy fans.    "

												City building/managing has never been more fun or aesthetically appealing as with Tropico. The game looks great and sounds even better. Trying to please all the different factions while trying to build up your economy, maintain optimum levels of employment and deal with the occasional disaster is challenging and fun. You even have customizable perks on your avatar that impart benifits or detriments to stuff like building cost or facton relations. Pro tip: get all the -%building cost perks. The only reservation I have about tropico is its scope. After you complete the campaign missions and play a couple custom maps, there isnt much else to do. Replaying the Campaign is way too easy especially when ypu use the right perks and user created maps are few and of questionable quality. The expansion adds a smaller campaign and some abilites which generally make the game easier.			"

Anyway, the game made me want to try out Tropico 4 in the hope that it's better and more stable. In short, it's fun but be prepared to install a patch and get used to saving all the time, just in case.			"

												Disclaimer: I got this game as a free game from some promotional thing on the internet so I don't have the same viewpoint as someone who spent $10+ on it.I've played Tropico 5, and this holds up.Graphically it's still fairly modern (didn't play on max settings)Runs well multithreaded.In some ways this game is better than Tropico 5 because as a Sandbox player, in Tropico 5 you must use the selective healthcare technique to kill off unwanted population, whereas here it is possible to keep Population Growth under control just through immigration policy.A 50 year game (1949 to 1999) can be completed in 8 hours although the game does allow you to continue playing after the 50 years is up. I got many achievements, but was a bit disappointed to find out they weren't tied to steam, oh well.The radio commentary responds to events both worldly, random or caused by your actions, it is charming but gets repetitive and eventually annoying after a while, same goes for the music.Overall though it certainly is a fun building game, although I disliked the limit on having only 1 airport.

												Lots of fun but glitchy as hell. I was playing on a crumby old windows laptop so maybe that's the problem but a quick Google search suggests that crashing to Windows is common. Anyway, the game made me want to try out Tropico 4 in the hope that it's better and more stable. In short, it's fun but be prepared to install a patch and get used to saving all the time, just in case.			"

I ended up playing it all day, but to be perfectly honest, since I loved this one so much, I bought Tropico 4 when it was on 75% off sale and now I'm stuck on that one. I know personally that you can't go wrong with Tropico 3 or Tropico 4 if you love city builder games!			"

												I will be 100 % honest in my review of Tropico 3.The game itself has you be a leader of a big or small island nation, You have a lot of options in the way you want to run your country and this is one of the strongest aspects of this game. I started to really get immersed in my little island nation which was just at the brink of debt. The game is set around the Caribbean in the early 60s during the cold war tension.  Another strong aspect of this game is the political system. The two main factions of the game are the American government and the russian soviet union. Depending on the way you treat your citizens will give you an increase or a decrease in respect -  lean too much to one side however and the other goverment may decide to pay a visit to your island. You also have the people of your island's opinions to take care of and they way you deal with them is up  to you.That's not to say the game doesn't have its problems - the game does show its age sometimes, for example in the ai path finding, I have seen people walk through one another and sometimes straight up walk through buildings. I love this game and I am happy for there to be more dlc availabale after purchase. The game's music, although repetitive, is great to listen to. Any fans of the genre of these games I highly recommend you buy this game despite it age. It is easily a 8/10 must own for strategy fans.    "

												GOOD MORNING TROPICOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!What can I say? This is the game that gets most people into the franchise. I have 1, 2, and 4 and all the DLC. 5 I got, but the DLC seem kind of sketchy. I've yet to get the Tropico 3 DLC. Tropico 3 is hard to go back to after 4 and 5. The buildings take up a lot of space, the islands are easy to fill up and it suffers from a huge traffic problem as your island gets bigger and bigger. The radio, music and announcers are hilarious and 10 times better than in Tropico 4 and 5. The campaign is pretty ""meh,"" but the custom scenarios are fun on harder difficulties. If you're a fan of the newer Tropicos and want some more, get this on sale. If you've never played a Tropico, this is a great place to start (it's where I did). Don't try starting in 1 or 2, they're so antiquated and obsolescent that unless you have fond memories, they're very hard to get into.			"

												Tropice just keeps getting better. This addition to the series introduces your leader as an actual controllable unit on the map, as well as several mechanical tweaks and a facelift.If you haven't played Tropico, it's a sim that puts you in the role of dictator of a small island nation. You build buildings, detail work crews, control rent, set policies and control production and immigration. Basically, the idea is you're Fidel Castro controlling every aspect of life on Cuba.It's like a gritty, real-world implimentation of SimCity. It's like some devs were having a brainstorming session and somebody said ""I reall like SimCity, but it just feels so sanitized and lifeless. What if it was really dirty and flavorful? What would that be like?""Well, it would be like Tropico. Far as I can tell, Tropico 3 doesn't change the game a great deal, but does provide a much-deserved graphic overhaul, as well as making infographics a bit more meaningful and easier to sift through.I give Tropico 3 a B+. I go back and play it every couple months. It never really gets old.			"

												The game itself is good. It is great fun when starting out. After playing for a whilt it may be a bit on the bland side because it is a bit easy and I find that harder difficulties often make the game easier as opposed to the easier difficulties because you don't have to deal with angry homeless immigrants.That being said though, the music is so awesome that I don't really care. Even when I'm bored of the game I just randomly end up singing or humming along with the soundtrack. Kinda wish there were subtitles or subtitle translations for those songs instead of the radio announcer subtitles.			"

												Tropico 3 is a well rounded economy simulator. Starting on small islands you have to build upwards with certain objectives or obstacles in your way. The game can be as simple or as complex as you decide since many of the subtle tools in your hand, as a kind Pacifist Leader or Ruthless Tyrant, are not necessary to win unless your wish to do so with style.The game offers a Caribbean like atmosphere, with rum, tobacco, coffee, pineapple industry etc. In addition to this the radio station will play island music and offer advise and advise you.To accomplish the objectives on each island you will have to balance the economical situation of salaries, food, population, health care, foreign diplomacy, housing, education and win the election. Now if you thought ""This sounds perfect! Exactly the headache I want!"" I warn you, after the 4th island you will realise that by following more or less the same routine you can create can economy to defeat every objective.The levels slowly become repetitive, the music is 4 songs over and over again. And the radio just repeats the same 5 attempts and ""humour"" again and again.However, I give it my recommendation since if played with moderation and you give each Island time and try not to rush you will have the illusion of going from a banana economy to Tyrant... Sorry I meant Benevolent Leader.			"

												People who love Strategic Simulations which are more oriented towards old school Gamers, should love Tropico 3 since it is just that. A remake of the good old Tropico. Hence it's really hard and sometimes very confusing. It is definetly NOT recommended for starters (you should buy something like Cities XL). This Game can be really frustrating if the Odds are against you. It is hard to get a successful Island running, but if you get it done right, you'll have at least a sense of accomplishment. Which is, in times of Cities XL and XL2011, something we (strategy lovers) rarely get. The only downside of Tropico 3 is that it gets a bit boring and repetitive in the long run.If you know what you have to do, you'll get the Missions done easily, since they're all the same (more or less). It's still fun though.I'd say it's worth the 25 Euros for the Gold Edition.~El Presidente			"

Plenty of buildings to create your city with and also a lot of conditions including the simpathy with the Great Powers.

												Disclaimer: I got this game as a free game from some promotional thing on the internet so I don't have the same viewpoint as someone who spent $10+ on it.I've played Tropico 5, and this holds up.Graphically it's still fairly modern (didn't play on max settings)Runs well multithreaded.In some ways this game is better than Tropico 5 because as a Sandbox player, in Tropico 5 you must use the selective healthcare technique to kill off unwanted population, whereas here it is possible to keep Population Growth under control just through immigration policy.A 50 year game (1949 to 1999) can be completed in 8 hours although the game does allow you to continue playing after the 50 years is up. I got many achievements, but was a bit disappointed to find out they weren't tied to steam, oh well.The radio commentary responds to events both worldly, random or caused by your actions, it is charming but gets repetitive and eventually annoying after a while, same goes for the music.Overall though it certainly is a fun building game, although I disliked the limit on having only 1 airport.

The expansion however give you additional things to do and complete the game quite nicely.

												Why you MUST buy  Tropico 3 ?1) i have a banker who live in an hut near a palace where lives two miners2) In my island the poorness is at the max, the people haven't food or health care, i take a lot of money from the pubbiccash, the U.S.A. are my allied and the U.R.S.S. try to conquer me 2 times... so the communist appreciation is 100%3)At the beginning you have a Radio Speaker, without the radio building4) If the people hate you, and don't want to appoint your canditature: you take 856 votes5)I order to kill an old woman because she compenetrated with my avatar.6) You can found people at the beach who swim or take the sun, when there are Sovietics Ship around your island7)No one cares if there is a nuclear explosion at few meters frome their house8)In the Night Clubs you can found only priestsSo buy this game, but if you love environment, you will hate this game, because the environmentalist of this game hateyou EVER.

												At first glance, I thought this was going to be a generic city builder with the superficial fluff of playing a dictator to add a few laughs. However, Tropico 3 plays less like a city builder and more like a political simulator. Buildings aren't built to make money for more buildings or to create a better life for your citizens. No, buildings are built only to please the various factions and citizens of Tropico so fewer people consider having El Presidente retire to an 'undisclosed location'. The dictator context is mined for its laughs though and the game uses that sense of humor and a very helpful radio show to establish an instant sense of immersion which falls apart entirely when its variety is quickly exhasted. These extras go from endearing to repetitive all the way to obnoxious in the space of two or three missions. Character creation is where this lack of variety is the most glaring. There is a reasonably wide selection of appearances and traits to choose from, allowing for a real custom character. But with the text of those traits and the introduction of the missions being so specific, the character you've crafted floats away in the contradictions. This is not helped by the fact that El Presidente only has two sound sets, male and female, with the female being so cringe-worthy I only used it once. It is also worth mentioning that, as of the writing of this review, the 'Special Steam Edition' is thoroughly un-Steam. No Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, No Cloud Saves. Nothing to indicate that this is a Steam game past the title. It doesn't change the way the game is played and Tropico 3 does have in game achievements to scratch that itch, but the lack of Steam features on a game so named seems a little strange. Complaints aside, I enjoyed playing this game, but I don't have plans to come back to it anytime soon. I recommend giving it go, but maybe play through the demo a few times before dropping any money on it.			"

												WHAT IF YOU WERE ""EL PRESIDENTE""?I bought Tropico during 2013 Summer Sale and I only got around to playing it after playing several games ranging from action and racing to casual and stealth and I felt it was a good idea to play a city-builder game. So...GAMEPLAYTROPICO 3... is a fabulous and addicting game. It's all about being ""El Presidente"", managing an island banana republic and making it prosperous while embezzling some of the money for your Swiss bank account (which is non-crucial, it only serves for high score). You start every game by choosing your avatar, either pre-configured real ones like Che Guevara, Evita Peron and Voodoo Pizzaman or you can create your own. Then you start (always) with a banana republic which is in shambles and then you can do whatever with it by issuing edicts, constructing, pleasing different factions (like socially aware communists, hypocritical religious and more) and you rise through the difficulties and build a prosperous nation based on ore/coffee/rum/whatever exports... Or you pass a martial law and conscription edict and build a giant army... or ♥♥♥♥ off USA and make it invade you; the choices are many.CHARMNext, you have at first charming and humorous, but then repetitive Juanito who keeps Tropicans up to date on current issues, passed edicts and humorous event reports. The soundtrack is short but so sweet, you won't help but shimmy to the infectious salsa rhythm and graphics hold up pretty well (but it's a 2009 game, so it's kind of expected). The humor in this game is terrific and well though-out so you will definitely giggle at some of the event reports (like a llama assassinating El Presidente's favorite hat) and you will grow to curse at least one faction in this game. All of the mentioned elements make for a really freaking addicting game.MODESI first recommend playing the campaign mode, it is great to keep you occupied as you try to get through different goals and finish each island. The campaign mode definitely has some variety however even then, it will feel repetitive doing the same thing over and over again, just with a different end. The sandbox mode is great and there you can develop your island however you please and where you have your own ways of building a rich Carribean country.ITERATIONNow, it seems that this game is simply a remake of Tropico 1 and while I feel that's a good thing for newcomers, it brings nothing new to the table if you played the earlier games. Also, after a while it feels repetitive doing the same thing over and over again, you will eventually grow sick of it as every scenario you play starts the same.CONCLUSION+ Highly addictive and gratifying+ Salsa soundtrack+ Great humour+/- Remake of Tropico 1- Brings nothing new- Repetition8/10			"

												This game is a fairly good city builder with some political aspects. The game works well as you can easily play without getting bogged down in details, but you still have to option to get fairly in depth to optimize your strategy.  The politics, while not to advanced, are decent, and good enough considering the the main point of the game is a city builder anyways.  The game is quite fun, however, and has some humor, although not all of it is very good. Overall, I find the game enjoyable and would recommend it.			"

You have to provide for your people. AND THEN YOU WILL BE REELECTED. If not you can always kill dissidents and let democracy happen. Of course then you might need to provide certain incentives for democracy to happen as it should, but that of course just means that you are a just and benevolent wise ruler.Yes.			"

												I played 5 on a preview weekend, but didn't get it because it had a launcher bug. I got this one instead because it looked like better textures than 4 or 5 (and basically the same as 4, but looked better than either with high quality shadows). Best UI graphics; feel very banana republic. The maps are fun and some of the campaigns are tough.  One problem is that it never real feels like you're picking just one path, like you really have to do everything to win some campaigns. I hate how much some of your buildings rely on skilled workers; you basically need to build a high school before a church in some campaigns, which opens you up to assassination. One thing I liked about 5 that this doesn't have is attacking armies are visualized. In 3, you can only see rebels attack and you can't target them. If US or USSR invades, the game just ends, but in 5, you can try to fight them off. Overall, great and very addictive game. I've sunk near 80hrs into it and will probably sink another 40 before I forget I own it.			"

I have 1, 2, and 4 and all the DLC. 5 I got, but the DLC seem kind of sketchy. I've yet to get the Tropico 3 DLC. Tropico 3 is hard to go back to after 4 and 5. The buildings take up a lot of space, the islands are easy to fill up and it suffers from a huge traffic problem as your island gets bigger and bigger. The radio, music and announcers are hilarious and 10 times better than in Tropico 4 and 5. The campaign is pretty ""meh,"" but the custom scenarios are fun on harder difficulties.

												I love this game.... its a blast.  Actually picked up a little Spanish from playing it.It can be funny, it can also make you understand how people in the islands are under constant oppression and sometimes threat of foreign invasion.  Makes you think about social structures, economics, foreign/domestic policy quite a bit.Seems like something that political science and economics majors would love.			"
