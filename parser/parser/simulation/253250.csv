								I have been playing this game pre-EA release, and I can honestly say it is one of the most enjoyable casual games I have ever played. It has a perfect balance between city building, RPG elements and crafting, and gives you a rewarding feeling of progression. Each citizen has their own stats and skills that can be improved and you get a real sense of a village community developing. I'll just summerise the rest into simple pros and cons:PRO- Fantastic mix of city-building/RPG- Simple yet very pretty graphics- frequent updates and very good developer communication- A slow yet steady rate of progressionCON- villager professions not yet finished so feel abit lacking in variety- a few bugs here and there- can be hard at times as death of a skilled citizen can set you back for a whileI would strongly recommend giving this game a go and looking at the future plans for this game on the developers website, exciting things planned!

								To me, the 25$ was a bit steep for something that you could technically ""accomplish"" within 2 hours. I mean if you're into expanding and creating towns and furnishing the houses with the prettiest of flowers, you'll love it, but if you're like me with just striving to hit the top of the research chain/skill tree, it's a bit easy. I'd say you could compare this a little bit to Banished in some several yet different ways.Pros:-Easy to learn-Visually nice-Can design your own buildings-Nice mix of city builder/management-Some slightly unique concepts-Is playable in it's current state-Slow progression, but actually being updatedCons:-Bugs, lots of 'em.-Crashing is frequent (Until you update your drivers)-Occasionally slightly broken UI (F5 to fix)-Not fully complete job tree (yet)-Weird inventory viewing systemAll in all, I would reccomend this game. I did find it enjoyable for the 2 hours I played, but until more is added, I'll just wait patiently. Maybe a price drop would be nice as well.			"

								A note on the negative comments: I've read through the negs on the reviews and in 99% of cases, the problem is easily resolved if you check the forums on the stonehearth webpage. Usually the problems are solved with a reboot of the game due to errors while the game engine is still in developement. I have almost 900 hours on this game. Already for more fun than most AAA titles with far better replayability. Obviously it's an alpha so there are bugs but I've never seen a company so dedicated to getting the bugs squished as quickly as possible. I really can't give this game a high enough rating and it just continues to get better with every release. It is already well worth the money and it's a game that every member of the family can play.Edit: apparently my review was suspiciously positive and didn't contain enough...something. So, for the people who are suspicious of positive reviews (seriously?) Here's your version:""Ths gam r grate. I ply this game lots and lots. Yay! It's the mostest fun you can hav when not eeting crayons and likking windows"" Yes...I'm looking at you in the comments.....better?			"

								I have played Stonehearth for 341 hours and have enjoyed playing through the developing stages. The game is becoming more polished and seems to be headed in a positive direction. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys a sandbox building and crafting games where they can design towns and villages with a little bit of hostile goblins thrown in to the mix.I do not recommend this yet for someone that is expecting a finished polished product or get upset when an error message pops up.The Good- I find the game extremely fun to play with the ability to design your own houses and structures.  - The pace of the game is relaxing and the music is very soothing. - The Heathing are amusing as they try to carry out your commands- There are more creatures to worry about now as Giant Zombie, Stone Golems, Eants, and what looks like a mutant alligator roam the land. Undead Villages complete with crazed necromancers pop up and flood the night with undead critters.- The ability to create Mods will mean continued content. I hope that this also continues to develop end game content.- Weekly twitch feed keep you updated on developments and lets you give feed back to the developers.The Bad- There are still errors when trying to build structures, and it takes a while to learn what works and what does not. It seems the building logic really wants you to lay down your design in a certain way. I watched a twitch feed were the designer was working on this to allow the engine to be more flexible.- The Hearthling become idler as your town, village, Kingdom expands. I am unsure if this is caused by distance, memory issues or pathing (although sometime it’s because I ran out of wood). The developers have work hard and these issues have improved greatly since I started playing it. (I still have to chop my own wood of course)- The end game is not there yet.  There is a basic scenario evolving Blood thirsty goblins which ends after 4 or 5 encounters.  Following that you only have to fend off random creatures once or twice a day.    I will continue to play and follow this game as it develops. "

								In its current state, I have to recommend this game!Couple of points at the end explain the overall rating.Pros: - Cute Artstyle - AI 90% of the time is perfect - Can build almost anything you want to - Hard mode actually adds survival challenge to this otherwise peaceful town builder - Constantly being developed/improved - Indepth profession system with RPG style progression - Happy to just watch my villagers do their thing!Cons: - AI doesn't work 10% of the time - Buildings you designate to build sometime never get finished (Look at bottom of post) - Combat AI is dodgey. I have to tell them to Defend a location, to get them to attack monstersNotes:The reason it is a yes is solely based upon the ability to use the Command Console (CTRL + SHIFT + C).This allows you to Instantly Build buildings your villagers refuse to build, and you can destroy buildings already created.Without these two commands (IB & Destroy), I would have raged quit this game years ago.I'd say 50% of custom buildings never get finished if they are semi-complicated. Sometimes the villagers, when you tell them to place items, never actually place it and you're stuck with the ghost icon.But with 'Destroy', you get rid of it, and with 'IB' you can sort the building issues out!You even have a Teleport command if your villagers get stuck!Hopefully they will remove the need for the console, but until then I have to give this a 8/10 IF you use the Console.Without the Console, it'd only be a 5/10.

Early Access Review
								This is my very first review for any game, I just feel compelled to do it! My first impression of Stonehearth after watching their video wasn't good. This is my very first uh I don't know what to call it, 2D-pixel voxel game? Anyway, I was a bit turned off by it. I've always avoided minecraft for that reason. Also, the price of $24.99 for this type of game seemed a bit too much for me. Anyway, I spent a couple of weeks thinking about it, watched their intro video at least 4 times and finally caved and bought the game the other night. Stonehearth has been such a delight to play. I thoroughly enjoy the job/class and advancement systems. I love the cuteness that is the game, even the boxy critters and animals are adorable. Building your own homes can be quite a challenge, which adds to the fun for me. I also love being able to use a building template the game provides and customize it to my own preference if I'm too lazy to create my own. I love renaming my citizens! I love that I can assign them to their own beds! I love that the cook helps my farmer harvest the fields :D As you can see, I enjoy a lot of the little features in Stonehearth which is why I felt compelled to make this review and share my experience with others. If you enjoy survival/strategy city-builders with cute pets and citizens + job/class advancements, then I highly suggest this game to you. Imo, this is one of those games that's worth the price tag. I love what the developers have done with the game so far and I'm happy to support this early access title.			"

								Dude. DUDE. Look at this.It's an Early Access game... and they're WORKING ON IT.I've been playing Stonehearth on and off for a while, the interest spikes obviously coinciding with updates, and I am glad to say this game does not have potential. It has promise. Because a promise is something you actually follow through on.Like everyone else is saying, it is by no means complete. Think about it: it's a sandbox game and they only just put the zombies and water in. How complete is that to you?But it all works, more or less. More THAN less. There are peculiarities, certainly - when I tell you tiny voxel people to pick berries, I mean I want you to TAKE those berries back to town - but it doesn't hiccup too often. And there have been some interesting hiccups. The biggest one, which involved two separate timers ingame and their misbehavior, the devs actually detailed in a blog post.Which brings me to the dev team, Radiant. These people talk with their community, and their community talks back. And they communicate often. Weekly - or so, ♥♥♥♥ happens - posts keep everyone appraised of what's going on with/in to the game, which is always nice to see. And I've seen some ♥♥♥♥, man... I purchased Cube World.Now, I want to draw attention to something that I think is important. Stonehearth is currently in Alpha 10 - every time there's a large content update, they bump that number up by one. And it's only just now on Early Access, despite it going up on Steam early so Kickstarter patrons would have an easier time of it.That means they waited until they had a significant amount of content in the game before going Early Access.Seriously, Radiant. Y'all're beautiful.If you like boxy sandboxes and RTS-type games, give this one a whirl. I think you'll like it.			"

Early Access Review
Welcome, to the Hearth!Heya guys, and gals, and welcome to my little review on Stonehearth, a lovable Early-Access title brought to you from the developers at Radient Entertainment, an indie-game studio based in Los Altos, California.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Initially when I first stumbled upon Stonehearth, it was after the dark ages seen from similar titles, notebly the game Castle Story from Sauropod Studios. An early access game as well, and with a similar feel initially, the game suffered quickly due to lack of development and the $30.00 price tag on a -usually- broken and unsatisfying experience. Coming to Stonehearth, I was a bit relictant to try a new title under the Early Access title and with the same feel.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So let's get into it, what is Stonehearth all about?Stonehearth is a meshed combination of a City Builder but with a mix of RPG and Adventure elements. Your journey begins as one of the two (current) races available to play (four are planned so far in total). Starting out, you and your handful of citizens (Hearthlings) are tasked with constructing your very own ""city on a hill"", a home in the wilderness of one of two (current) biomes.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Races and FactionsThere, at this time, is only a single race playable in the game which of course, are the humans. However, the humans are split into two factions (currently) with a third planned in the future. The human factions that are known about now are:The AscendencyOriginally posted by Stonehearth Official Wiki: ""Earnest and hardworking, loyal and well-rounded. Citizens of the Ascendency chop, build, and farm, confident that the known world is theirs to inhabit.""The Ascendency are the basic human faction, based off of Eastern European countries they are home to the temperate biome and start their crafting tree around the Carpenter, a specialist who uses wood resources to create works from tools and weapons, to building components and decorations. They don't do well in the desert however, due to their heavy dependance on wood resources.Raya's ChildrenOriginally posted by Stonehearth Official Wiki: ""The scattered people of the mountains learned early that to survive, they needed each other - and preferable as many others as they could reach. Now, though the members of their trading cities and traveling caravans pride themselves on ascetic disciplin, visitors find them generous hosts with access to goods from all over the world.""The second released human faction, named the Raya's Children, are designed from a more Middle Eastern resemblance. Living a life in the vast deserts in the world, they have learned to cope with the lack of wood and traditional building materials found elsewhere. Instead of a Carpenter, they begin with a Potter, an artisan skilled in crafting bricks of clay and stone to form efficient housing solutions.Th Northmen's Alliance (NOT RELEASED)Originally posted by Stonehearth Official Wiki: ""Brave and handy, the men and women of the north live for the sight of a new dawn over unexplored territory. Armed with compass and hatchet, they form strings of small, defensible settlements and pride themselves in their tenacious adaptability.""The third faction planned for the human race are the Northmen's Alliance. Based on the Vikings from northern Europe and the surrounding tundras, they are a hardworking collection of natural-born explorers and fighters. They are home to the tundra biome, and additional details for them have yet to be released.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GameplayThe game begins with the main menu, as every game should. Upon stating up a new game you are presented with the choices you shall make, the biome you choose to inhabit, people you choose to play as, and the difficulty to which you would like to play as. It is a simple process, freshened up from a traditional selection screen by being presented to you in the form of a story book, with the choices you make appearing to fill the blanks of the story.Once past, you are sent into the Expedition Roster, a list of several Hearthlings which you will start with. Each Hearthling comes with a randomly rolled attribute set spread across three categories.Mind - Useful for those who will become your fine artisans and crafters, Mind stats help these Hearthlings advance in their career as well as gives a boost to their ability to craft Fine items, creations which are adorned with supreme craftsmanship.Body - Granting bonus stats to boost Hearthling health and movement speed, a high Body stat is excellent for Footmen and combat specialists, but also those who will greatly benefit from the passive speed boost, ie. Farmers and Trappers.Spirit - A key for those going into combat, Spirit attribute points grant a boost to Hearthling courage and morale. High Spirited combat specialists will stand firm in combat, even after sustaining injuries.If you happen to have unfavorable traits, you can try again for as many times as you like with the 'Roll new citizens' button, regenerating all seven Hearthlings. Once finished, on the right side you are greeted by a list of various items for purchase, and a small budget of initial gold for you to purchase things or take along with you on your journey.With your citizens ready to depart and your expedition supplies tied down and stowed for your adventure, it finally comes time to select your site to begin! With reach game of Stonehearth, the maps are randomly generated using seeds, viewable at the bottom of the screen. You can reroll maps for as many times as you wish, alike the Expedtion Roster. To note with your location as you move your cursor over the map, the highlighted box around your cursor represents the actual in-game map, which although seems small compared to the world map, offers plenty of space for your city's development and then some. On the right side, you will also see three major variables which change on the area you select.Trees and Plants - This is pretty self-explanetory on the fact that this value shows how many plants and trees are located in the settlement region you have highlighted.Wildlife - This factor represents the amount of creatures found in the highlighted region, useful for your trappers who will need animals in order to efficiently trap and harvest them.Minerals - This final factor represents the amount of ores, stone deposits, and the etc. which are readily located in the highlighted region. You can always however, mine for ore in a region with little to no Mineral rating, it just takes some time.Once you have your region selected and good to go, you can embark on your journey!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Review PartA simple, yet equally complex game, Stonehearth is a game easily loveable by Adventure, RPG, City-builder, and Strategy fans. Built in a voxel art style with a friendly and cute feel to it, it is aesthetically pleasing and especially for those who run the game on higher graphics settings. Keep in mind that there are faults of course, various quirks and bugs are present as you can expect with an Early-Access title, however the weekly Development Team reports and progressing updates are great! There are currently a collection of simple quests and side-missions to keep you interested along with a developing story in the works. Overall I again, highly recommend this title, and encourage you to try it out!Thanks for reading, happy building!- Kyoko			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth is a great game. It's a merge of Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft; The former for it's 'base-building' and management aspects, the latter for it's voxel graphics. TL;DR Pros/Cons list: + Good replay value + Looks great + Large amount of craftable items and professions + Building Designer + Villagers level up and unlock skills + Frequently updated - Rather buggy, villagers tend to get confused very often and so on - Combat is slow and iffy at times - Game will often break if you don't save often to avoid doing things that break it - Some 'texture' issues - Few pre-built structures - Lack of game customisation (monster spawn rates, villagers, etc)In Stonehearth, your goal (if any) is rather simple: to build a thriving medieval village/city, and take care of the various needs of your villagers (known has hearthlings) along the way.You don't have direct control over your villagers like an RTS; you give them orders to perform and they'll find a way to do it (most of the time) themselves.As you progress in-game, and your villagers level up, you'll slowly unlock more proffessions for them to practice, and thus more furniture, decoration, tools and weapons for them to use.You will not, however, unlock new buildings, as the game only has 5 (I believe) pre-built ones. The rest is up to you to build, using the game's Building Designer feature, which works more or less the same as 'The Sims' Build Mode, with a tab bit less freedom.Hearthlings tend to have issues when building; I have had to help them off of roofs, demolish a building because they couldn't build scaffolding or because they just go on strike and won't build anything at all.Be sure to leave at least a block of space around a building when planning it out; your hearthlings won't be able to build the scaffolding if not.Decoration-wise, there are tons to choose from, ranging from beds, to flower pots or braziers. Each crafting profession has some form of decoration. My villages have gotten prettier and prettier over time as I've discovered new crafts.The game's replay value is rather high, as attempting to create a functional village in different environments can be a challenge at times (on top of a mountain, for example ^^).The game is also rather buggy in it's current state; several times I have had to start a new game because I placed a path over another and the villagers refused to build anything else, or because I was planning a custom building and none of my orders would work anymore.Many blocks/items sometimes overlay eachother as well, causing flickering textures which can get rather irritating at times.I've also had issues where my one fighter hearthling has gotten themselves stuck in an infinite loop of 'Attack Golbing Chieftan > Run away from Goblin Chieftan'. Seeing as there is no direct control over the villagers, I can't do anything to get them to stop, and just have to wait for something to hopefully kill them.All in all, Stonehearth is a great game to own if you're into the genre and I highly recommend it.The frequent updates make it a great game to come back to from time to time.If I were to rate it out of 10 like everyone else seems to, I'd have to give it the following: 7/10.For an Early Acces game, it has a good amount of content, looks good, is fun to play, but the bugs it has in it's current state sometimes ruin the experience.

								I have followed and been trying this game out since the beginning. I first got hooked when it was a concept from someone that seemed to have a passion for what he wanted to do and what he wanted to make.This game is the type of early Access that steam needs. More developers should actually follow this style. Here we have a guy that had his game available while in developement with it hardly being playable. We had the chance to see the game receive slow but steady streams of content flowing in and bug squashing. I used to not be able to get 5 minutes before everyone decided they wanted to sit around and do nothing. But unlike other developers, This guy actually kept at it. and unlike other developers. When the cash flowed in... they slowed down, He sped up. The closest relation i can give this developer style is like Dwarf Fortress. Not in terms of gameplay, but how he steadily adds content while fixing issues with the game. and any dwarf loving fan will know that it takes a while for each of the updates to come out.TL:DR - Developer set realistic goals to meet with limited resources. And keeps meeting them.			"

								Well, it's finally here... Steam Early Access! I couldn't be happier for Team Radiant! :)Disclaimer: I am an official fanboy, and hold this development studio in the highest esteem. But in my defense, I think this is perfectly justified given how open and transparent this team is with their fans and supporters.All that aside, what do I actually think about Stonehearth? I think it has the potential to be one of the most entertaining games we've seen in these combined genres in ages. There's a wealth of things that the team has already implemented (building!, classes, crafting, mining, combat) and a whole host of others in the works.With each new update the team trickles out improvements to the game's foundation (better performance, more stability) and introduces new mechanics and content as well for the community to test drive. You will be hard pressed to find another team that is as open with their backers as these folks, and its always rewarding to see topics discussed with the team in their bi-weekly stream actually implemented in the game.I think I'll leave this review for now, and revisit as each new major release is dropped (roughly every month to month and a half). If you are at all interested in the title, I highly encourage to drop by the Discourse and mingle with some other fans and backers. Watch a few LP series and see just what Stonehearth has to offer at this stage of development.I have a feeling you'll be glad you did! :)p.s. if you are interested in watching a town be rebuilt ... *several* times, look no further! :p

								It's an ant farm that you control. Virtual Villagers but infinitely better. Simply the best town sim I've played.Pros- Combat is fun to watch.- Art direction is beautiful.- You can design the buildings.- Skill/design curve is huge so it's always interesting to do something new.- Actually, everything is fun to watch.Cons- Sometimes workers task weird.- Very CPU(?) intensive. - A strong push by goblin armies can wipe you if you're new.- Haven't seen any water yet. Would like water.- Engineer takes way too much to level. Mason -> Blacksmith -> Engineer, way too much of an EXP grind.Protips- Build a wall early on- Always have a standing army.- I figured out the holy trinity of MMORPGS work with 1 knight, 3 footmen, and 1 cleric. I was able to take on anything with this.- Design your own buildings! Increase efficiency by putting ten beds in one house! Your Hearthlings will love you! ( Love not guaranteed. )- When starting, most people overdo the farm plots. Anything over 15x15 would be overkill until later on.- Use the 'maintain' option if you're building multiple buildings.- You can build walls via pasture enclosements or design building.Suggestions- Let us place objects from storage units into the world. I can't access my piles of stone / clay.- Make the market stalls have different merchants.Overall : 9.5/10. A little buggy, but one of the best games that you could buy for 25$. I'd value it at 35$ at most. Make sure you don't run this on an old computer or you could start freezing or crashing. I've had no problems with the game, great direction.SpecsWin 1016 GB DDR4 RAMIntel i5 6600Radeon RX 480			"

								(I have been following stonehearth since fall 2013, so I will admit that I am (more then) a little bit biased.)   Pros   The devlopers (I've found) are actualy involved in their community. Such as asking for feedback, also taking ideas from other people to help build the hints and tips section on their website.    Music is somthing which can make or break a game for me, and I have found that Raj Mann has created some very amaizing music for this game.    The graphics in this game are very light and happy, (This is the only game that I've found that makes goblins look cute while they steal your stuff.) Though at times I wish the hardened look of suriving on nothing but berries for days. But In the end I find it enjoyable  Cons  This is an early access game so their is lots of bugs and so the game is known to crash, but the devolpers are continually working on the bugs.   If you are still undicided look up their twich streams on tues and thus at 6:00 p.m pacific time.    sorry If I happen to have bad grammer			"

								I have been following the game since the kickstarter and it has gone from strength to strength. After a long process of developing the core systems and streamlining the game engine the game has come on quite rapidly. Appreciate at this stage that the game IS an alpha but also know that new content is being made rapidly at this stage. They have a team of full time staff working hard away 5 days a week to make sure this game reaches its fans so dont think that buying at this stage is a ""gamble"". You WILL get the finished product. The game its self is soo fun to play. A perfect blend of city management with sim life without a crazy amount of micro-management. The game also features very easy mod integration and is built using easy to understand languages. The team have published full documentation on getting started on modding too so if you want to get started, you can do so at any time. It's my recommendation that you buy this game now and try it for yourself. At this stage you will get a good feeling for the final product. For the price you will rarley find something that you will get the same amount of gameplay out of.			"

								You hate bugs?  So do I.  You hate that a game can be in Alpha for years on end?  So do I?  But have you been dreaming about building your own 8 bit RPG village from the ground up?  Afraid of all the freaking crap that you have to learn to play Dwarf Fortress?  Want to support a developer who is upfront about the struggle, needs the communities help, and is rewarding that community with continued work?  Well, this is the game.  This gives me hope that Steam Greenlight, Kickstarter, and indie gaming can make truly wonderful games that would of never seen the light a decade ago.			"

Early Access Review
								Before I begin, let me say this:  I understand Stonehearth is in Early Access.  I don't expect everything to work flawlessly. That having been said, the game needs a lot of work.I picked up Stonehearth based on a lot of Steam user reviews comparing it to Dwarf Fortress.  I like Dwarf Fortress, even though the game is notorious for its extremely obfuscated interface.  Stonehearth sacrifices a lot of DF's detailed simulation for a more accessible experience, which is fine with me.  However, as of March 2016, the current build is badly broken.  A few of the weird AI glitches I've seen include Hearthlings that join the settlement, but idle in one place permanently.  After accepting a new Hearthling (hereafter referred to as ""plebs""), I watched her stand on a hill for a week, regardless of any orders I issued.  She was eventually eaten by wolves.  Footmen, Stonehearth's 'soldier' class, will charge after enemies they have no chance of defeating, regardless of their current orders.  When they're reduced to 1/4 health, they flee for a few moments, then turn back and resume fighting.  I've lost at least four Footmen because of this behavior.  Mobs also have a tendency to spawn in weird locations, like at the end of a long tunnel with only one entrance.  I got a notification informing me that one of my plebs was mauled to death by wolves, at the end of a mining tunnel with a closed door at the entrance.  Either something's up with the spawning algorithm, or all dogs don't go to heaven.  I'm saying they're ghost dogs.  Way of the samurai.The building system is suprisingly robust.  The interface makes it easy to plot foundations, walls, upper floors, and roofs.  I actually designed some pretty handsome structures, and the process was fairly intuitive and straightforward.  However, once I actually placed my blueprint and ordered my plebs to build the structure, I ran into more AI issues.  On two separate occasions, my plebs stopped building before the structure was complete.  They'd build to around 3/4 completion, then idle, as though they had nothing to do.  Reloading the game did nothing.  Suspending all jobs, then re-assigning them did nothing.  I simply had a partially-finished shell of a building in the middle of my settlement.  I tried to remove it, but my plebs demolished about half of the building, then idled again.  My town looks like Detroit in 1996.  Shameful display.Despite all the AI issues, I still like the game.  The art style is charming, and the UI makes it easy to place buildings and command your plebs.  Once they iron out the issues with plebs abandoning construction halfway through, I think it's going to be a joy to play.  The interface handles walls and roofs very gracefully, and building blueprints for structures is a breeze.  I remember placing roofs in ""Towns,"" a similar town-building game, was a living nightmare.  Most importantly, while scanning the forums for solutions to my AI issues, I saw that the devs were very active, involved with, and respectful to their players.  That's a very good sign.  For the time being, I'm going to recommend this game.  I was excited enough about the premise that I didn't mind the $25 price tag, but if cost is an issue for you, I'd recommend holding off until they get a beta build up and running.  Bottom line:  despite some pretty rampant AI issues, the game shows a lot of promise.  As long as the devs stay active and listen to their player base, I think this is going to mature into a very enjoyable experience.[UPDATE 3/13/16]  All of my footmen got thwomped by a one-two combo of ghost dogs and giant zombies, so I decided to start a new settlement in sandbox mode.  So far, I've experienced none of the AI glitches I saw in 'normal' mode.  It seems that something about combat, or placing my settlement on defense mode, breaks the AI.  I'm hoping the devs fix this, because I enjoyed the challenge of defending against sporadic attacks from invaders and thieves.  For the time being, however, I'd recommend you play in sandbox mode.

								In StoneHearth, you begin the game on a randomly generated map similar to a Minecraft map. The gameplay is similar to a strategy game, as you do not control directly any character. You just give orders and expect them to be followed. You start with 7 Settlers, each having their own sets of strenghts & weaknesses. One may be thriving in handcrafting while another is suited for military missions. With these settlers, you'll build and develop a camp thanks to all the resources available. These resources are various, and it can be compared here with Terraria for instance.To grow, you'll focus on developing the skills of your settlers, assigning them jobs, and gathering as much resources as possible. But these objectives can be endangered by the presence of enemies at night: zombies, skeletons, goblins. You'll have to manage a small military force to protect yourself.The final objective of the game in its current state is more or less to build your 'perfect base', and survive long enough to do so.Similar games:- Stronghold- The SettlersCool features:- Daily events and Trade, to earn gold and buy resources you lack of- The Building design system, which is quite good and allow you to design your dream city/base- Progression system for settlersIn its current state, the game is good, and the potential is interesting. I recommand it if you enjoy this kind of game (Check the Settlers especially). "

As Daft Punk once said, ""buy it, use it, break it, fix it, trash it, change it, mail - upgrade it"".Or at least, something like that. You get my point.So, Stonehearth (gosh, that's one unfortunate title *cough*Hearthstone*cough*) is a very promising *deep breath* early access city building, minecraftesque, RPG, strategy, survival, crafting game. Whew, that was long.You start by choosing the background of your hearthlings, their place to settle and the difficulty. Then, you take the role of the taskmaster as you have to guide your people. Craft, build, assign jobs, harvest, defend against hunger, goblins, golems etc. NOTE: As nightfalls come and go, be advised that mobs will become slowly, but surely, more difficult to face. The gameplay is all about choosing the best decision about your everyday actions and proper resource management (whether that's your hearthlings or your food). You have to direct your workers to crafting or collecting what you think you need mostly and prepare for the dangers that descend upon you every night. But what if you make the wrong choice? You don't have to worry about that, since the game has a perfect pace to give you the time to think carefully about your choices and correct those that turned up to be a disaster. One very unique aspect, which I enjoyed very much (I got up from my chair and clapped my hands when I saw it), is the ability to design unique houses for your hearthlings. True, you got the default building templates, but you can also choose the size, materials, style, decoration of each construction you plan to make and model it to your heart's desire. Kudos for that, it was an excellent idea from the developers and I don't think any other city building game has ever done that.On the downside, the game is still in Alpha. Be prepared for game-breaking bugs and it's a good idea to report them in order to help the devs improve the game as fast as possible.The hearthlings' AI is a bit clumsy at times too, so don't be surprised if your people simply ignore the goblins stealing their precious resources or taking years to clear a specific side of the forest you ordered them to cut down. Hopefully, it will be improved in future patches and builds.Personal suggestions towards the developers: I look forward to the addition of multiplayer, new biomes, new nations and better AI.Overall, if you are into this genre, give it a shot when you can afford it and you won't regret it. *wink*RATING:Gameplay: 7.5/10 (due to several bugs that can create a big mess)Presentation: 8/10Story: 8.5/10Unique Factor: Entertainment: 8.5/10OVERALL: 8.1/10 "

								I've been following this game for a long time, I actually missed the kickstarter by a few days.. and it is unfortunate because I really wanted to support them in a bigger way. This game means quite a bit to me it really got me back into gaming which I was very apathetic about all newer game titles. I've been in the testing phases of this game for a long time pretty much as soon as they allowed you to buy in from their website and I honestly have never regretted it. The game itself is quirky. There is a lot of stuff going on and bugs happen, but I can absolutely assure anyone who is put off by this that it will be fixed. In the older builds there were major funny, and breaking bugs.. which messed up the gameplay but the devise are always diligent to squash anything they can as promptly as possible. I can't recommend this game enough simply because it has such an amazing community. It already has modders, the devs are very active and as transparent as possible, biweekly dev streams where people in chat can actually influence the shape of the game, devs are very appreciative of their community and open to suggestions, and much more. The team definitely has a vision of where this game is going, and they are honestly working their asses off to achieve it.. And so far they are hitting the nail on the head every time. Their over all may not be exactly what I was wanting... But the modding scene well have us covered on that front. New builds come out every few weeks.. Sometimes they are buggy sometimes they are not. It all depends on what what changed or how much new content is thrown it. Fixes usually come within a few days but sometimes require a larger update to fix. I pretty much play this game for 5 or 10 hours every other weekend testing the new content, trying out new ideas, etc.. The content is steadily growing at decent rate. Overall for me this game scratches an itch I've had since finally abandoning dwarf fortress. I look forward to participating in this community for years to come.			"

								When I took a screenshot of Stonehearth, and shared it with my friend, the first thing he asked was ""Is that a Minecraft clone?"" Seriously, no. If you think a complex city building and management game is a clone of Minecraft, you need to really get a reality check, bud. Anyway, moving on to the actual review. First, you should know that I've been playing Stonehearth since the pre-alpha days, and that this review is for Alpha 10.5. I'm also basing this only on the content that is currently available, and not promised stuff due out later in development. Though, I'm personally looking forward to PvP combat, which is going to be a feature later on. SOUNDSound design is average, and everything you'd expect to be there, is there. You've got grunts, a catchy (if not a tad repetitive) soundtrack, and all the other standard musical cues you'd expect from a video game. -7/10GAMEPLAYYou've got the foundations of a pretty awesome city building game, though there's a clear lack of content as of this writing. The core city building aspect is most definitely there, and you're able to build custom structures, mine for resources, and even fight invading monsters. I've yet to actually figure out what happens if you lose all of your guys to a city invasion, and the enemies don't seem to do much other than invade, and rush you with numbers. But at the very least, it's the start of something major. You're also able to create squads to better fend off enemy invasion, and the city building animations are fascinating. I found myself building random structures just to see how my little minions (yes, that's what I call them) would construct it. -9/10FEATURESUnfortunately, the game is currently lacking in the feature department. While the actual gameplay is polished beyond what you'd expect for an Early Access game, it isn't without its faults. For starters, there is very little in the way of configuration. There's no graphic slider, or volume control. This is really just a core experience right now, and you know what? I'm oddly okay with that. This is just an alpha after all. Things will improve. -8/10CONCLUSION All in all, Stonehearth offers a very solid city building experience. Considering as how this is only just in alpha, Stonehearth feels like a finished product. It has polish, it has style. It's just an all around fun experience. Sure, there's a fair number of bugs, though none of them are game breaking, at least in my testing. This is an alpha, so a bug or two is expected. But the fact that Stonehearth plays and feels like a finished product? Well, that's just darn amazing. So yes, I recommend Stonehearth. Final rating? 8.5/10. (note: this review was for alpha version 10.5)			"

								This is the video game equivalent of a handful of vicodin and a glass of white wine.  It's very simple, calming and satisfying.  You just sit around in your little hot air balloon and yell at these little kids playing minecraft to destroy the earth and remake it in your image, and they just snap to it.  Just ""You, your job is crops.  You, you're in charge of all wood.  You, you make fox jerky,"" and away they go, farming, carving and toturing cute animals to death.  There's combat in this game, but it requires no thought.  Life in sedated management is good.			"

								tl;dr, add this to your watch list and wait for more content.One of few early access game that really 'done right' (Looking at you killing floor 2)Devs pushes content update the game frequently, roughly in 6 week cycle. Many numberous patch/'quick peek' are also updated in weekly basis. The devs publish news update instead of empty words (looking at you Tripwire Interactive).The thing is, right now the game lacks content, once you pass initial stage there's really little you can do. Besides the game is buggy, too. You will be met with some gamebreaking bug in hourly basis.At current state I can't really recommend it. But this game is really shaping up. Looking forward to it.

								This game.  Oh this game.  I must say, i have made countless villages, built empires, even developed farming placement and other charts.  This game drops u with some beginning choices, you have some gold to buy some extra starting items, tools, food, etc.  and then you get to choose your citizens, then gives you the choice on where you want to settle.  You Choose, your there, you quickly start building up your materials, then build some tools for your Hearthlings to use to craft many different items and entities.  i must say, this game fills smooth simplistic graphics, giving the game a relaxing and casual feel while still throwing in some combat to liven things up a bit.  Then and AMAZING sound track to really top it off.  at the time of this review i have about 150 hours on the game, and they are all well spent.  i would give this game 9/10   "

								Let's start with the bad points: - Bugs- Bugs- Bugs- Bugs - ∞ Endless bugs - Workers are too dumb to even build a wall or stairs - Menu sometimes just disappears; pro: funny to see your villagers getting slaughtered because you can't command your Warriors without it- You sit there, Pause the game and try to come up with an epic Building for about 1-2 hours. When you're done and proud of what you have done with 2 hours of your life and tell them nice workers to build it, they go there, look at it, set the first block and never ever ever ever ever ever touch it again. So there you're sitting and trying to get them to build it. But NOPE. They won't do it. Nice... I even played with the thought to report some bugs but... do the guys and girls who make this game, ever play it? - More BUGSSo why did I give a ""Thumbs Up""? - I got the game a long time ago, so when I played it the first time, it was not really buggy and fun to play- I like the idea of the game, to manage a little village with a little minecraft in it- Even if I know that nothing really changes in the game and it gets even more bugs every time I play it, I still play it once in a while for abt 1-2 hours just to rage quit- I don't believe in god, but I still believe that a day will come when this game will have lesser bugs - I like the design, artwork and the style of the game- They said there will be a Multiplayer some day, building epic villages with epic buildings with your epic friends with hopefully no epic bugsSOOOOOOOOO if this game has a -80% off, buy it. If not and you're not a sadist, don't buy it.  "

								I have played this game off and on for about 6 months and can honestly recommend the game. It is still in development, but the developers are extremely engaged and regularly release updates with bug fixes, new content, etc. The core of the game is solid and offers significant room for customization of the buildings within your town. At present, there are bugs, but this is expected. What is promising is that many of the bugs I have observed over the course of the past 6 months, have been taken care of. Do new bugs pop up when new content is released? Of course. However, they are typically resolved within a month, at most, of the new content's release.The game itself is primarily a city builder with random raids of goblins, undead, etc thrown in to keep the game play interesting and varied. The combat system is a bit wonky at present, but has been steadily improving over time which is a good indication of future improvements to come.Resource gathering has become rather staightforward and it is relatively easy to keep your villagers gathering what you want them to. It does require a bit of micromanagement as there is not a way to automate their gathering behavior at present (e.g. mine when copper is below 20 in storage, gather wood when inventory is below 15, etc). Once the resources are gathered, though, the tradesmen can be completely automated to maintain inventory levels of the items you wish to produce (e.g. set the Blacksmith to maintain 5 swords in inventory, etc)In sum, despite the bugs that I have experienced and room for future improvement, I would highly recommend this game. It has vast potential, a very active development team that is engaged with the community, and is generally enjoyable to play.			"

								I've been following this game since it's Kickstarter days and am very pleased with the progress it has made thusfar. Stonehearth is a sandboxish city builder, simulation game with added rpg like elements. Whether you just want to build your dream village, fight off incoming invaders, or dig the deepest mine, this game has it all. Designing buildings has never been easier and allows for many possibilties and custimizations and your hearthlings will automatically build what you design for them. The profession system gives you various choices to decide which directions you want your little town.Radiant Entertainment are some of the most community driven developers I have ever come across. They are constantly livestreaming the game development and intereacting with the community on the forums. As this game  has a tendency of having some (often hilarious) bugs here and there as any Alpha game does, the team is very quick at releasing patch versions to adress these kind of errors.Modding is another core component in this game. Being new to moding myself, it is amazing to see how easy it is to mod the game, even in this early state, and should get much easier as the game develops. There is already a nice variety of community made mods available on the stonehearth forums.All in all I definitly recomend this to anyone who loves city builders, rpgs and sandbox games.  If you are a hardcore Dwarf Fortress gamer, I suggest you give Stonehearth a try. With the progress Radiant has made so far, I am definitly excited to see what they have in store for multiplayer and the other features they want to add to this wonderful game!~Avairian			"

								Early Access Review: (Review might change over updates so be wary)When I first saw this game it's concepts and looks instantly reminded me of the game called Trove (no advertisment induced). The charming graphics and animations alone make this game so good but the real deal comes with building.The start:- You start the game by picking 2 races: The Raya and the Ascendancy. Both races differ a lot.- The Ascendancy starts off with the initial job Carpenter: The man who does miracles with wood. They are also the better farmers to play with.- The Raya start with the initial job potter: the mastermind of clay. But here's the catch. The carpenter can craft the wooden sword right away to promote a settler to a footman so you can fend off enemies early on while the potter cannot. So starting with the raya first is harder for newbies.After you picked your race you have to set the biome. There's one homeland for each race. Choosing the opposite homeland makes no real difference whatsoever. Both have wood and stone to start with. Only the wood/stone/clay ratio is different. Note that you can farm on both grassland and plains.After choosing the biome you get the chance to edit your starting people. You can rename them and reroll the entirety for random stats. Also you can but some starting items from you 150g pool.At the end but not least you only have to set your difficulty: Peaceful, Normal and Hard mode. I think I don't have to explain the differences here do I? ;DFinally you set your starting point on a RGN map you can (gladly) re-roll to get better chances of the ideal settling spot.The gameplay:The gameplay might seem a bit too much at first (and even I did not know anything at the start... like jon snow) and I was confused by a lot but after I experimented a bit around I got the grip of it.NOTE TO RADIANT: We need a tutorial asap! (Now bacvk to the review)The starting goal is simple: Harvest some ressources to build workstations for your carpenter/potter. After that get some crates/boxes/stockpiles to gather the harvested ressources. And now you got everything you need to build your own buildings.The graphics:- Trove and Minecraft had a baby and this is the result: 3D-blockapolypse and I love it.>> I am currently still testing things and such and I am pretty fatigued atm. I gonna update this review over the next days <<My verdict (for now): 7/10 Good game to pass time and cool off from stress.The game is early access but it's worth the money trust me. More worth than No man's sky :'DThe content is small but the creativity is endles (see screenshots and artwork).If you like to play block-games and minecraft and love the trove-artstyle than this game is your game.Sincerely, Khillian R.

								What it has so far is good. Solid core game aspects, and random generated Quests and Map. It still is missing quite a lot of the bulk stuff.What in my opinion they need to do is:Add more jobs.* (like 5-6 more) *note: I did read the roadmap content.Fix the combat system.* UI restrictions - Orders to Guard(and eat while guarding), Patrol routes, Sentry zones.Fix the lighting.* Make it so spans farther on fire braziers and other forms of light.Fix some of the sound skips.*More building material/items to craft.*More drops from mobs.* Also more rare items.Adding a more permanent way to buy/sell goods* Like sending caravans and stuff. Being able to use the gold for something.* Right now I have like 12k gold and nothing to spend it on.I recommend this game to anyone who likes building towns but not for those who build in like Minecraft. I like the sitting back and managing it waiting for the next attack or something to make me hop up from my chair, then overpowering them. I will not rate this game because it is still small compaired to other games. Also I don't very much like Early Access Games, but I still support them because I know how hard it is to build something... Hah, see what I did there?			"

								This game is very addictive. It has the micro-management of a city building sim, but it's not on such a grand scale. However, it's kind of better, you get to know your village/town pretty well and you start to remember the names of who does what job and what they look like. It's great to just expand and grow out and you have the incentive of gaining new villagers through daily reports as you increase your net worth. Increasing the size of your population provokes attacks by increasingly difficult enemies, so you have to manage forces in to bands and promote footmen to knights or bowmen etc. The military system is enjoyable in that it allows the game to merge in to a military sim/strategy genre as well. I'm glad to see this game is doing well and that the developer is supporting it.Note, one warning: Bugs... Although this game is in early access, so I'll cut it some slack. I'm having a few bugs, e.g. soldiers not listening to commands, multiple glitches in custom building system, hearthlings not collecting loot and the inability to remove certain structures half way through building them.

								When this game come out, you should buy it. Just don't get it right now.Now, i have to give credit ware credit is due. the dev's are working hard and this going to be a great game! It's just it's  almost unplayable right now. for two main reasons1. the ai is painful! they don't work together at all. they will un-do then re-do people's work, warriors won't rush over to help people, trappers will be lazy and not pick up meat/fur, if you have more then one farmer they will group up and plow the same spot at the same time. it's a mess2. for a game that's pixel graphics. . . it runs horribly. . . i can play skyrim at max settings. but I'm lucky to get 15fps on this game with the lowest settings.  (forcing in 32 bit just makes it worse)if they fixed the ai and performance. this would be a great game.			"

								I cant really recommend this game since its so far from finished. But i've had so much fun with it i cant give it a ""thumbs down"" either.Its a colony building game in the same vein as Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria. You designate the little people to be farmers or blacksmiths or whatever, designate a building here and a building there and, whenever they get around to it, they'll build it & live in it. Some of the fun details are that while the game has prefab buildings, you dont have to use them, you can opt to design your own instead. And if you come up with a good design you can save it to use again later. Eventually you'll be able to share your designs & others can use them in their colonies, which will be cool, but its not in yet.Theres a lot thats not in yet, if you read the design goals, the devs have a LOT in mind for this game. I'll be amazed if they can do half of it. But they keep working on it very steadily. Ive been following it for a long while now & updates & new features have always come in on a regular basis. The devs are very connected to the player community & it shows. Its certainly not another one of those ""grab the money & run"" fly-by-nights we've seen so many times on early access. These guys are serious about wanting to make a good game.If you like to use early access games to observe the game development process, this is a great game for that right now.  If you want it to, the game is happy to show you the nuts & bolts of exactly whats going wrong inside the AI's little brain when it gets stuck on a lamp post or whatever. And if you post a bug report, the devs will almost certainly have a fix in the next patch.However if youre the type who gets upset when you find yourself beta testing a game you paid for, perhaps skip this one for now... but keep an eye open for it, if/when it goes gold its gonna be really good!

Tom even streams every Tues and Thrusday with the community and listen to your input. Well all of Team Radiant listen to the community.  They have well rounded road map too.PRO- Great city-building/RPG- Fun world- 10x better then most building games (and its EA)- Frequent updates, good developer communication- Easy going graphics (especially on low end machines)- Steady progressionCON- Villager professions not alot of them yet (part of the progress)- A.I. frustrations- Bugs here and there- Playing on story mode (no real story yet) can be difficult- Drains Time :) Little about how the game worksYou start off picking your location. Get a handful of villager (random gen - could get all females/males) with campfire and banner.  Beginning by getting mats (wood and stone) placing your stockpile for them to place. You promote for a Carpentar and hunter to get food going. Need to keep those villagers fed. Then to the Farmer to mass the food production. As your handling this you have your workers building houses, from scatch (or blueprint), placing beds (for them to sleep) and other items of decor. If in story mode, the goblins with attempt to bribe you or get you raided. Here comes your first footman. As time goes and and your life has drained away you will have walls up with footman patrolling keeping those pesky goblins and undead in check. Your village will be growing, your workers mining and working, your craftman crafting and your village having life. Quite a site to see.If your not into building villages, You can always go to peacful mode and build what you want. (I got a mages tower built floating in the air) But you can build almost what you want. As long as the villagers can reach it and build it. Still must keep them fed and have a place to sleep. But not much there but imagination.			"

								An awesome game.  Too bad they've had an unfixed construction bug for over a year that makes it unplayable.  A big part of the game is building structures.  There is a bug in the game that causes your workers to abandon construction if certain events happen - such as an attack on your town that causes you to recall them to safe points.  Afterwards, there is no way to get them to resume construction - and also no way to remove the unfinished structure.  I really like this game, but it just doesn't work.  Searching on the web, I see that this bug has been present for over a year. Alpha or not, it should be fixed by now.			"

								One word: WOW! I love these types of games where you can manage a town/city and watch it grow it from the ground up. This game has limitless posibilities and it is a real time passer. My first two hours of game play was amazing and I was on the edge of my seat. There are a lot of issues that I have run into that I have posting about. One thing I would change about this game is the world size. I think it is too small and would really like to see an option to re-size worlds. I cant wait to see what this game has in store in the future.			"

								I know there are some negative reviews about this game, but I feel people aren't giving this game its due. Please remember it's in Alpaha still. Considering that, it is still amazing. Much of the work has gone into The Ascendancy(SP?). You start with 7 hearthlings in your group to found your new home. To gain more you must meet set amounts in food, morale, and net worth. Each of these can be done easily enough. You generaly meet morale unless you just don't do anythng for your hearthlings, like building beds to sleep in or chairs and tables for them to eat at or growing them at food. Food can be attained right away from berry bushes until you can make a farmer's hoe to promote a hearthling to farmer to grow food yourself. And net worth comes from building things like a shared sleeping quarters, dining hall, roads, or designing your own buildings. On day ten you'll be approached by a royal herald who will give you a quest to become a township. If you complete this quest you get tier 2 building materials.This game has entertained me for almost 200 hours already. My friends and I have to take turns using my PC just to play Stonehearth. At this time No Man's Sky is coming in second place to this game. We enjoy this so much.Many of the featurs of this game are unique. I have never played a game that allows me to manage, but not micro-manage. I give general commanda and the hearthlings live them out. It's a simulation game for a village. You build the village/town, but the hearthlings do it in their own way. You also have footmen/knights/archers/clerics to defend you town. Their are craftsmen of all sorts. It's an intricate system.Please get in on the ground floor and watch this game grow. This game will be huge, and it will be such an amazing release one of these days. Trust me.			"

CURRENTLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR GENERAL GAMING. If you wish to help beta test this game, then I HIGHLY recommend it, because it has an incredible amount of potential and I want it to succeed and prosper. We need to help these devs do this by giving feedback and support.Completed my beta testing sessions on this game. Patience ran out (nothing personal...full time worker here lol). Here is the list of current bugs and frustrations I have run across.1. Excessive random encounters that make everything extremely difficult after around the 10th - 15th day. I just finished a session where, between game day 7 and 14, I was encountered by:-12 wolves-4 thieves-a goblin raiding party-4 zombies/skeletons (While I had 4 goblins raiding, thus citizens started dying left and right)-2 varnus things-a shiteload of those wood/stone gremlin thingsThis was on ""Normal"" mode, and in my opinion, this difficulty curve/cliff is a gamebreaker. It reduces the game from enjoyable cute fun, to frustration where I'm yelling at my screen ""Give me a god damned CHANCE!"" If the game is going to be enjoyable, I suggest deep, dynamic difficulty so players can modify the game to suit how they play. I'm a slow, meticulous gamer when it comes to games like these. I don't have time to ultra-micromanage everything, especially with very clunky unit management and controls. It's too difficult!2. Building anything is a hit-or-miss kind of experience. There are MANY bugs you'll encounter when trying to build anything larger than a small shack. Citizens giving up on buildings at random Not being able to delete walls at will. Only way to do this is the undo button, and that randomly stops working. So, essentially, if you build a wall that you don't like, or it's interfering with something, tough luck if it wasn't the most recent action you did. Frustrating. Not being able to build building parts in any order. Example: If you try to build too much of the interior before building the roof, you basically can't build a roof and your building is screwed. (See the above point) Custom walls seem to have a limited length. Doesn't make sense.3. Clunkiness of UI, and general controls.  A lot of menus, especially crafting menus, pull up tediously, and are delayed.  Moving troops around requires too many actions, which are also clunky. UI randomly disappears and even F5 doesn't bring it back up Too much clicking around!Everything else other than the above listed is going great. This game is one of my favourites ever, despite being incomplete, and I seriously hope the devs don't get lazy with it. That doesn't seem to be the case right now, because I'm constantly seeing bugfixes and updates. Support these guys! And one last request, when the game is released: Full mod support and API, so the community can grow the game, as well.Keep up the good work; I want to see this game surpass Minecraft in playability some day. I mean, imagine that...Going first-person and playing this game like you would minecraft, but you also have a dynamic town that NPCs build. You can go from first-person, to town management mode (Current setup). Isn't that something everyone has always wanted? Keep that one in mind. I'll return to testing at the Alpha 18 opt-in.			"

Early Access Review
								Years ago, I had an enjoyable but brief relationship with Dwarf Fortress.  I really appreciated the randomly generated world, scenarios, and the continuously evolving gameplay, but my small lizard brain couldn't accept the ascii graphics.  I tried some graphical mods, but ultimately, Dwarf Fortress and I went our separate ways.  (I'm sorry Dwarf Fortress, it wasn't the size of your plump helmet that was the problem, it was me.)You're probably like, ""Dude, stop talking about Dwarf Fortress. This is Stonehearth"", and you're right, I shouldn't bring up past relationships, but Stonehearth scratches the same itch that kept me interested in playing Dwarf Fortress, and it looks perfectly adorable on top of it all.  Stonehearth isn't as in depth as Dwarf Fortress, but it is most definitely a Dwarf Fortress-like.  If you're like me, and you enjoyed Dwarf Fortress, but maybe the graphics bothered you or maybe you're looking for Dwarf Fortress Lite, Stonehearth may be worth buying.Keep in mind that this is an early access game, gameplay mechanics could change, things will break, and are broken in the game.  Consider your purchase as an investment in an evolving product, and the dev team! "

								I was a little weary at first buying this game awhile back. While it took be awhile to learn to customize my own building. One of the best little village games I have! I love everything about this game, customizing the parts of your building, and building little workshops for my villagers. The Rayya's Children I played on the latest setting, its really cool with the potter and clay buildings. There are a few bugs in the game, like villagers getting stuck but they eventually get out and are fine. I used to have a bug with the UI disappearing, but it was fixed, so I'm happy about that.I hope they can add more decorations and random AI generated towns you can visit as well as enemy villages, I think that would be cool! Also have more animals, it'd be nice to make stables, pastures and a farm for different farm related animals! :) Other than that, its a great game you will most likely keep coming back to play!!

								Stonehearth is an amazing city-builder, simulation game. It mixes styles of god games, directing your hearthlings with building commands and designs, with RPG, leveling your hearthlings up as you go and even real-time fighting with attacks and defenses based on their weapons.It certainly has a long way to go; bugs abound, and feature-wise the game only lasts for around 30 game days before it's repetitive, but it has tons of potential from here, and based on how far it's come and the staff behind the game, I can say that the game will only be getting better from here.

								Stonehearth is one of those little games that make you feel like you're playing a SNES style RPG but in fact you're building the towns in said RPG and you get to see how the beginning was in said town. The goblin raids that went through your little village when you were nothing but a small team of builders trying to build up their first mess hall and houses for your people. How you were so helpless then and then near you complete your village and are happy with it you are very proud of it. The amount of time you spend and how much love and care you spent with each little villager with the classes and how you can see them work hard on any new structure you build from scratch. The game is beautiful for a voxel game with the cell shading and voxel enviroment. Now the game takes every block from the world. Terraforming is actually pretty pleasing in this game, instead of games in which terraforming is make or break, this game makes it realatively pleasing in which i never saw any ugly in doing so. If you have the money and are interested in buying this game, do so, you'll love it if you're into the micromanaging/ builder genre. I personally bought the game when it was $30 and was on a kickstarter. This was in Alpha 7, it was still buggy but they ironed it out and added much more content in the span of 3 months. Now, the game is still in Alpha, but neither the less I would buy it. It'll easily make you go a good 15 or so hours on your first town. Even if it's in Alpha, you still have a lot to do.			"

								In simple terms, the game is fun and worth it.All things considered, its an early access game, and we all know how those things can go. A quick pros vs. cons:PROS:- Good sound track- Challenging enemies- Easy to learn- Explorable land (treasures, enemy camps and farm animals can be found)- Many cool professions available for the citizens (each is unique and realistic)EXTRA (minor) PROS:- easy to loot- convenient tracker for citizens- fighters can be in their own seperate units (easy to navigate them)- can save and re-use building models (developer made buildings already available)- LADDERS* Can be extremely useful in debugging some builds and getting hearthlings unstuckCONS:- Lack of fighter categories (only 3 kinds + 1 kind of healer)- Several major bugs (Cizitens get stuck, buildings dont finish being built, scaffolding doesnt go away, CPU heavy when in windowed mode - Thankfully, they are not too frequent and are usually fixable with a quick restart)- Story is weak- No sign of actual friendly life visiting towns (besides dialogues)- Little motive to explore (if a friendly town was nearby to set up trade routes, id consider going FAR)With the cons, the game is still a solid 9/10 for how fun it is and for the price its offered at.As for the game itself, it is still being worked on and improved. As for now, the price point makes sense as there is still plenty of material to enjoy. I've played just over 30 hours and can definitely enjoy some more.			"

A Sandbox Strategy That DeliversStonehearth is a sandbox strategy game, set in a (light) fantasy setting, with town building, crafting, and a military campaign.What Is It Like?Take Dwarf Fortress. Tone down some of the rogue-like elements. Replace the esoteric production chains and mood  simulations with more accessible and managable alternatives. Add a charming 3D voxel art style with tons of character. Introduce some truly innovative mechanics, including the way hearthlings simulate building. Voila.Or, for readers that haven't had the privilege of learning how ""losing is fun"", we'll try a more popular game for comparison. Take Minecraft, pull it back to  a strategic level, give yourself hearthlings to manage, add in a bunch of depth with jobs and production chains, and smother it in buckets of charm. Welcome to Stonehearth.What Sets It Apart From Other Sandbox Strategies?Charming and effective 3D voxel art style.Deep production chains that don't dive off the deep end (ie: stocking a hospital in Dwarf Fortress).Promotes mixing form with function through a powerful and versatile building creator/editor.Engaging, visually appealing, and immersive construction simulation.Deep, yet accessible, statistics and job system with fun role-playing elements.Interactive military campaign that allows the player to engage in diplomacy or war.Intelligent user-interface design maintains accessibility even in areas of the game with more complex mechanics.The Bottom LineI am recommending Stonehearth not only because it is already a successful sandbox strategy game in its own right, with truly innovative mechanics and an on-point blend of strategic depth and accessible fun, but because the small team at Radiant Entertainment have proven their exceptionalism. Since backing Stonehearth on Kickstarter I have enjoyed weekly updates, steady content addition that is continuously polished, and interactivity with multiple team members on their community forums. These guys care about making a great game, and it truly shows.Stonehearth is a game that is worth your money and time right now, as of Update 10.x, and one that will only improve in value as those updates continue rolling in.

								This game sorely lacks key features like demolishing buildings which is very frustrating in a game where the genre is ""City building"" granted its more like town building but that is besides the point.I find that, whenever i build something in this game i got to be very careful in what i do, for as i mentioned before i can not demolish. the building or designing process itself is very finnicky, i have encountered times when it would make the blueprint of the building, but the settler or ""Hearthlings"" wont build it at all, sometimes they build everything but the roof, i also cannot build 2 things at the same time, they will abandon the one i started building first and work on the one i just made, never to return to the previous.There was some work around i found on their forum to fix some of this, but it's so stupid that i would even have to resolve to doing 10 things, step by step so i can remove a house, which by the way did not even work.I also frequently get error windows or command windows whichever it is, telling me of errors, duh, this game needs alot of attention to bugs but most of all the building aspect as of right now, cause building things is why i got this.Other things are, that it has a very... cute style, it's very appealing to the eye, eye would say, anda very relaxing soundtrack.I want to love this game, and i do, but not as much as i believe it deserves right now, i recommend this game, but i also recommend you wait with buying it, atleast untill they fix the buildings, unless you are impatient like me.Im gonna keep watching for progress and i believe, that when this game is more developed, it's going to be amazing.Also right quick, i know this is early access, but these are ""KEY"" features, something that needs to be there from the start, preferably. also i do not care to debate on these matters, either you keep it extremely civil, which is a very hard thing for the general internet to do, or swallow your words, use your bile somewhere else.

								After watching the development of this game for some time before it came to steam I decided to splash out and buy it. I love building and simulation games theres just something that appeal to me about creating my own little world and watching it grow.  I love The Settlers, Banished, The Sims and other games like that. This game ticks the boxes for me.Its a great game with lots of potential and while it may look like a minecraft clone it most certainly isn't.  Whilst it still has a lot of bugs, which is to be expected in Alpha, it is still quite playable.  I found the worst bug was when i had too many hearthlings and they all started to just stand there and do nothing although if I shut the game down and restarted it, it fixed it for a while.  A great Dev team is what makes it a gem too. They actually listen to their community and implement updates and bug fixes on a regular basis.I hope that they continue to update and finish the game as so many early access games seem to get abandoned and it would be a shame if that happened to this game.If you want to support a game in early access then I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

								The one thing I must stress for those of you who are interested in this game is this: it is for all intents and purposes in early access. I know many of you have played early access games, and some of which were fully fleshed out games with minor bug fixes needed. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GAMES. As well as the numerous ui, ai and graphical errors there seems to be about 10 hours of expansive entertaining gameplay, after which you are left with a feeling of ""what else can I really do"". Now thats not to say that the devs have abandoned this game, in fact the situation is quite the opposite; there exists online a roadmap layed out of all the updates and new features they wish to add on. However as it currently stands I cannot recommend this game AS A STANDALONE TITLE. It doesn't have enough content to merit the $25 price tag, that doesn't mean you shouldn't purchase it: it means you shouldn't purchase it for what it currently is. If you buy this game it will be a game you have to revist it again and again in hopes that the devs actually deliver. So for right now I say wait, follow this title, add it to your wishlist etc. but don't purchase it yet.			"

Early Access Review
								Very fun to play, almost zen-like.  The hearthlings are entertaining to watch as they go about doing their jobs.  A large part of the game play revolves around constructing facilities for your hearthlings to use, whether it be fields of carrot farms, large apartment complexes, intricate tunnel mines, imposing castle walls or simple homes for a peaceful village.   There are numerous jobs your hearthlings can learn, a basic research-tree allows players to explore new promotions each time you play the game.  It's currently not possible, or at least not easy, to have every job unlocked the first time you play it, so you will inevitably be tempted to start new towns to get the other jobs and try out new urban planning ideas.  It's very easy to get incredibly absorbed into the minutia, and obsess over the aethetics of your town.  Part of the fun is looking at what other people have built and getting inspired to construct your own version of real-world cities and towns.  Anyone who has an interest in architecture and interior design will easily become transfixed as this game has nearly an infinite possibilities that's only limited by your imagination.While your doing all this, the game does follow a very basic script of events that you'll need to prepare yourself for.  Mostly being attacked by goblin raiders and stray wolves that are mostly random, but builds up to a massive and inevitable showdown with Oggo's army of Orcs.  My largest complaint is that the Normal mode doesn't feel balanced because of this inevitable fight with Oggo's Army.The first time it happens, it can be quite a shock, as you've spent 10+ hours being completely consumed by the cute visuals and light-hearted game play, only to see your entire village basically swarmed by a massive army of Orcs who then ruthlessly slaughter all of your hearthlings (beating them to death with clubs).  The game does feature a ""Peaceful"" mode, ensuring a completely violence-free experience, but which also then negates the need to promote hearthings for combat-related jobs (Footman, Archer, Knight, Herbalist, Cleric).  However, it is a nice option to have.I don't just ""like"" this game... I love it.  I find the whole thing very endearing to play and would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.			"

After a while all my citizens stop doing anything.I realize 4 of my people are stuck in the top floor of my new mansion.Realize I didn't add stairs or a way to get down.4 of my people starve to death.Rest of town gets depressed and stop working all togetherGoblin king asks for stuff.

								I want to review StoneHearth not Hearthstone StoneHearth now StoneHearth is a game that looks like Minecraft but plays completely different and is by far one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played, let's start with the pros and move to the cons.Pro'sSo first off one of the best things about this game is the fact that you can sculpt and design your own civilization making this one of the best for role playing games yet one of the best Sim games.One of the coolest features of this game is that you can go ahead and build your own buildings from scratch and you can make your own Warriors and upgrade them using the crafting equipment you use you can fend off goblins and Invaders with your warriors and you can also trade with Traders and buy from Merchants that come to your town day and night.One of my favorite things to watch happen is my town progress and my citizens gain level's. You can even have people come to your town and reward you for killing off goblinsCon'sOne of the major issues with this game is the UI user interface it's extremely hard to work with, sometimes it glitches out and other times just completely shut's down and even makes you force shutdown the game.One of the things that also really irritates me is the constant lag that occurs that is unpreventable no matter how much you Tinker with the options internally and (externally, outside the game) you cannot fix the lag issues I personally have constant issues with completing buildings and helping my citizens survive from goblins invaders, because the lag is so horrendously bad.Now keep in mind this lag is so extremely hard to work around and it only starts when you progress into the game far enough. Errors will occur almost every single play-through and it really makes you wish that they had some sort of patch for people to work with instead they're going update by update.Thing's I want to see happenI wish that they would fix all performance issues and make it so your PC recognizes it as a game instead of a program.I want them to make an online multiplayer addition so you can play with AI or other players.I want them to make a campaign for story. Also add more action to the game so you can be full out assaulted and have to defend for like 5 minutes or longer.I want them to FIX something I did not mention above, which is when you ask a group of people to work on something new you can choose which citizens you wantr to work there so you have a spreadsheet. For example okay I want 3 citizens harvesting wood 7 citizens building a mansion and your guards to patrol in a certain pattern you choose.Also larger worlds, larger threats as you progress so it won't be a breeze to clear out 6 invaders with 1 guard(with a wooden sword)Other than that this game is FREAKING AWESOME. At it's current stage it's fantastic minus all the performance issues. 8.3/10			"

								I'll write this with the caveat that this game isn't finished being made at this time and is still in Alpha. That said, I wholeheartedly reccomend it. As a citybuilder/manegment game Stonehearth shows great promise and while it's a bit thin in its currect state (Alpha, so missing a lot of features/content) it's still pretty competent overall. Oddly, my favorite feature isn't the game itself, but the team behind it; Radiant. Those dudes have some of the best community outreach in the business and they are always putting out dev blog updates, keeping the content comming at a pretty good clip and letting you know what's on the horizon when they can't do that. It's cute, it's chirpy, it's got the foundation for a truly great town manager. I particularly love the ability to build custom buildings with relative ease, though style options are slightly limited, what with still being in development.There are a few Cons though; one, it's a slow game. Incredibly slow. Pace is apparently something on their list to work on, but as it is, I can only bear to play on fast and even then I feel like there should be a faster setting. There also aren't really any options for stockpile flow--the ability to have a particular stockpile pull from others, and it's one of the major things that's keeping Stonehearth from being truly great. This is also impacted by the speed (since your hearthlings have to walk AAAAALLL THE WAY to the stockpile, then ALLLL THE WAY back) which becomes more problematic as your town gets bigger. I imagine some of the problems I have will get resolved as the game works its way through Alpha, and I'll update this review as new things get added, problems arise, and good stuff crops up. If you're hard up for a city builder, I only see this one getting better over time. If you're a bit more skittish, that's fair; but keep at eye on this and I encourage you to give it a shot when it's more complete.			"

Early Access Review
								**As a forewarning, there are minor spoilers. There really isn't much of a storyline, but I go in depth as far as gameplay goes.**So I spent a good few hours on the game, getting a feel and really seeing what it has to offer. The fact that it is in alpha was a little worrysome, given how many games are labeled with early access and seem to die without much improvement or support. This game, so it seems, is different. It's a refreshing change, it's truly quite unique in multiple aspects ranging from gameplay to art and design. This game is most certainly sandbox in nature, but it actually carries a very strong similarity to Dwarf Fortress, and almost seems like a branched-off, reskinned version of it. I can only imagine the vast amount of direction and improvement this game has in store if only the developers remain diligent and active.To start.. As of the current build -524, you have the option of choosing a biome, starting location, and race. I haven't experimented heavily with these options; I've only had the pleasure of one play in which I haven't come all that far. That being said, once you choose your world, you then choose where in said world you will build your camp. Naturally, you'll want to choose an area with plenty of trees, wildlife, and minerals. Upon choosing, you're dumped off without much of a tutorial, which usually seems like an overwhelming experience, however.. This game is fairly straight foreward. After a few minutes, I quickly learned my way around the UI, the different tools, navigation, and issueing commands to my Hearthlings. Before long, the first raid on my settlement had taken progress. I immediately knew the general idea of what to do, click the large, red sword icon, right? It was as simple as that; my Hearthlings ran to a safe position as my assigned soldiers made short work of the beast. As of right now, the game doesn't seem to be too unforgiving. I am expecting that to change as I come further along and mine deeper into the ground.Graphically speaking, this game is very crisp and clean. There are a few annoyances which are more gameplay issues than graphics, but I'll get to those in a bit. The game has a bit of a minecraft appearance, but one with customer shaders and higher quality picture. Textures are almost non existant, but I can do without those, it simply works for this game. All in all, there isn't a whole lot of clutter, which can really turn into a big problem for games like this.In terms of bugs, this game definitely has its share, but it's to be expected. I feel confident that more and more bugs will be fixed as time continues, the support website seems very much alive with devs attempting to help those who experience issues. A few bugs I've personally come across include goblins exploding into sunlight instead of fighting my soldiers, a Hearthling that never wakes up from his sleep, and not being to change to a specific class despite having met all requirements. Obviously two of these can be considered game breaking, however I'm not letting it kill my opinion of this game. Save often is the best fix for most problems.As for one final in-depth review, this game is, as I mentioned, like a replica of Dward Fortress, though with FAR less features. I suspect this game is very heavily influenced by Dwarf Fortress. You have the ability to custom-build structures, or choose from a preset list. You can place said structures where ever they fit. You can alter the environment by taking down trees, creating mines, etc. As you create mines, it really opens up many different possibilities for construction ideas. Perhaps an underground fortress? All in all, in the short amount of time that I've played this game, I'm enjoying it a lot. If they can implement some more features or similarities from DF such as complex contraptions, many more monsters and biomes, etc, I'll be thrilled. Perhaps even a mode to take complete control of a single, hero-like individual to explore the lands, loot, plunder dungeons, and seek bounties, much like DF. I might be going a little far comparing the two, but regardless, the game can (hopefully) only improve from here.			"

								I enjoyed this game because of the peaceful gameplay and relaxation as well as the skeleton and orc attacks. The only problem or dislike I had about the game was the weird bugs that crashed the game and I lost so much progress. But finally it has gotten out of steamgreenlight so I have faith that it will become something much greater, and the bugs will disappear. But for now just remember to turn that auto save on and save every 5 minutes.			"

								One of the most committed teams to devlopment and interaction with the community, radiant have really lived up to their kickstarter pledges and have been making great progress, the potential of this game is tremendous, if you got some spare cash lying about, choose to invest in this team, its going to be a blast!  Alpha development doesnt have a huge amount of playability but each new release gives you an extra couple of hours of testing new additions to the engine, its a cute art style and feels quite rewarding when you accomplish something.

								I really want to like this game.  It's a lot of fun until you reach the point where your hearthlings will not finish building your buildings.  After an exhaustive search of the internet it seems to be a repetitive, long standing issue. It seems to be something that has been unaddressed for about a year.  It is very frustrating.Buy the game on sale or wait until full release.			"

								I have a lot of games in my steam library but this is the one I keep coming back to. This is the kind of game I can lose myself in, starting a play session, getting really focused on building and defending my town, and then I look at my clock and 6 hours have somehow gone by. The latest focus on combat and hardmode have brought a much more intense feeling to the game. Enemies can catch you offguard if you don't think about all angles you need to defend, and the new RPG classes have added a lot of depth to the combat side of the game. As far as developing your town/fort/city-whatever goes I becom a kid again, playing with lego.This is in alpha, so there are still a lot of glitches, missing features, and polish that is getting fixed/added. Building elaborate structures is usually very difficult especially getting the hearthlings to construct them. You can cheat structures in with console commands, but hopefully some day you won't ever need to use commands again and the little guys will be able to make anything you want.One of the best things about this game is it's devs. They are very community focused and they actually stream on twitch coding and art sessions three times a week. They aren't very active on the steam community hub, but on their own website's discourse they are very active.I really recommend this game even in it's current alpha state. Very enjoyable building game with some decent RTS RPG style gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATE AS OF 4/30/2016- This game has progressed quite a bit in the months since I purchased it. I find it easier to play with less bugs. I have looked forward to getting into it. Still see my recommendations below however I have been able to play well past 30 minutes with no bugs or crashes and reasons to restart. Follow this one for sure. This game is going to be awesome. I mean it is awesome now. I enjoyed playing it. I bought this because of reviews and a few videos I watched featuring gameplay and just maybe I received a lil christmas bonus work threw my way so why not I said. All the reviews and videos said that this is an alpha game, expect bugs, blah blah blah. I knew this going in but they talked it up so much I couldn't resist. That being said....This is an Alpha game and I have not been able to play past 30 minutes, so far, without a bug popping up to make me start over. LOL.Nothing that crashes the game but one of my little people with glitch, I placed a building too close to another and they just stop building, etc....All in all I like it, I'll play it some more, even with the bugs but if you didn't get a little holiday bonus money or it's not on sale, or you're just short on cash, I suggest waiting for a sale and whenver you find yourself with some extra $ you want to throw at something you've been following.Follow this game though. I just can't bring myself to thumb down although this is one of those occasions to which I wish they had a neutral thumb, if that's a thing, where I can infer that this game is fun, will be good, but just not developed enough where I'd recommend another buying it....unless you fall in the same category I did...steam sell, christmas bonus, just enough feedback I thought I'd give it a try.Have Fun			"

								First real review I've ever given on Steam so here goes.I've followed this game for more than 2 years now and would definitely recommend buying it if you are considering to do so.The game itself is not yet finished but has a quite a lot of content. The main reason I would recommend it however are the devs behind the game. They do weekly development streams and are very active on their forums. Its fantastic to see the game take shape and even have some ideas you had implemented in the game. Updates on this game are very frequent and I have no doubt that this game will become something great. You can't compare it to the game I first bought 2 years ago.But if you have a problem that it is not a fully finished game yet you might not want to buy it as it is somewhat buggy at times and not all custom made buildings will be build, aswell as some performance issues that arise at 25+ hearthlings.

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth is a brilliant game considering that it is an early alpha. If you've ever play'd a game called 'RimWorld' It's much like that. Stonehearth is like a village management game, you gain a new civ every night [If you reach the days goal E.g. Enough wealth, Happiness & Food] This goal is meant to get harder as the game goes on, but it isn't really that hard to reach.Con's-The building in Stonehearth could use some improvements and I'm sure the developers will make this mechanic better. Once you place a building it cannot be removed.-You are not able to build easily inside E.g. In a cave/ Mountain.-When the goblins start to raid, it seems like they never stop coming night after night. They could use tuning down [Spawning less]Pro's-So far I have experienced very little lag, to fix this all I did was re-load the game.-There're soo many options for the civ's. For example you can appoint them different jobs such as Warrior, Cook, Farmer, Trapper... Each with a new set of uniform & tools.-Very attractive game. Although the graphics are not Arma 3 standard, it doesn't need to be - the games graphics suit the game, the blocks have near enough a plain texture and puts less strain on your PC. -When your village does get attacked, It's not like a few games out there, where you're entire village would get destroyed Age Of Empires, I'm looking at you here.I've stopped playing StoneHearth for now, not because It's a bad game but because I'm waiting for more items to be implemented into the game.

								This is a review for Alpha 16 This game is  REALLY GOOD Pros1- Addictive. This game if you can run it (i have an asus M32bf with a gtx 770 and i can run this at 80/130 frames) is really addictive since you can make a large sprawling city after about 2-3 hours of gameplay OR you can make like a mining civilization that lives in caves.2- Engaging. If you like micromanaging, if you like Donald Trump wall building, This game is for you3- Refreshing. Stonehearth is a game like no other, it combines City-building/Sandbox/Survival genres into this perfect storm of New-game feel.4- A E S T H E T I C, This game has GOOD pixel graphics, and because of this, it makes it very simple to pick up if you are used to Medium-Long learning curves to games.""Cons""Ok this game is in alpha, so what, if you are anything like me, a simple bug or two is not gonna bother me, but if you are annoyed by a villager not doing what you want, then buy this game later when it's a bit more stable.2- Pricey, if you don't have disposable income like me, don't bother yet, try and wait for a steam sale.Guys and Gals, this is who inspired me to buy this. (NOTE) This is hardmode gameplay but there is a normal mode and a peacefull sandbox mode.

Early Access Review
								First Steam review here, so go easy on me please!I had been following Stonehearth since its Kickstarter campaign back in 2013, and I finally bit the bullet back in August.  Since then I have enjoyed (almost) every minute of gameplay.  As many reviewers have noted, this is really a niche game, and if you are into a slow-paced city building sim with some RPG and RTS stuff mixed in, this is the game for you.  For me, I love setting up my little town so that it is self-sustaining, and then sitting back and watching.  Seeing the little Hearthlings running around, farming, shepherding, and cooking, all the while getting hungry and eating, and eventually relaxing by the fire and sleeping, it is really quite pretty to see.  Let me detail some pros and cons as I see it:Pros:+Voxel Based graphical style+Custom Buidling Designer+City Building and strategy combined+Playable! (can't say this for all EA games)+Crafting system+Frequent Updates+Easy to learn+Game CommunityTo explain some of those, lets start with ""playable.""  You can install the game, launch it, and play away.  It works, and you can easily lose a couple of hours right off the bat.  Next, the custom building designer.  Is it perfect: no.  Can you make any building you can imagine: not yet.  But unless you are really trying to build an abstract, strange angled, multi-story building, chances are you can build it.  The crafting system is very nice, particularly the interaction between the crafters.  You start the game with a carpenter.  He/she can make basic furniture, building elements (like doors and windows), and a few other things.  He/she also makes some tools, like a farmers hoe to allow a farmer to be promoted, a mason's chisel for a stoneworker, a weaver's spindle, etc.  Once you promote another Hearthling to a new position, more crafting elements are unlocked.  For example, by him/herself, a carpenter can make a basic bed.  Promote a weaver, spin some thread, and a high leveled carpenter can make a fancy bed, with bonuses for the Hearthlings who sleep in it.The final pro I listed which I want to detail is the game community.  Stonehearth has a fairly active community over on their forums, and everyone there is kind and helpful.  Members on the forum do their best to help each other out, and support is quick.  When I first joined the forum, I was greeted by a moderator after my first post, and recived quick help when I had an issue.  That made me want to spend time there, and as I became more familiar in the game, I started to help people out myself.  The developers are very active on the forums too!  They will help with game issues like crashes, keep you updated on bug fixes, and join in the many discussions about the game and where it should go.  They also stream development sessions 3 times a week, where you get to see work on the game live!Cons:-Bugs, you will encounter bugs!-Crashing can happen-Saves are not always compatible between versions-Game is not feature complete-Can't build everything-Hardware intensiveTo explain the cons: the game has bugs.  If you were not expecting that, I suggest you review what Early Access is.  That being said, the developers are amazingly responsive to fixing them, especially if they are game breaking.  Patches are frequent (sometimes too frequent), and they can break save compatibility.  Fortunately, they have 2 branches of updates on Steam, so if you do not like frequent updates, you can stick to a ""stable"" branch, and not deal with the frequent develop releases.  Crashing can (and likely will at one point) happen.  Many times it is due to driver issues, but also due to anti-virus programs.  As the games AI is based in an embedded chrome browser, programs that add extensions to chrome can cause havoc.Final con, the game is not feature complete.  You cannot build every possible structure, there are many classes/professions that are not availible, and the game is not fully optimized.  I have played games where Stonehearth has used as much as 9 GB of RAM!  While the usage has dropped significantly in the latest patches, it is still not perfect, and honestly higher than I feel it should be.So, should you buy this game?  I will answer with a qualified Maybe.  If citybuilding, simulation, strategy games are your thing, then this is an awesome game.  If you want a say in how the game is developed, than take the plunge.  If you like being a part of an active community that is passionate about the game, then hop aboard.  However, if you want a bug-free, fully optimized, feature complete game, then this is not for you (yet).  The game is in alpha, features are in active development, but it isn't quite there yet.			"

								This has been one of the best games I've seen considering it's early access AND alpha. I play this all the time, and I really look forward to the updates. I highly suggest it to anybody who is bored, semi-bored, or not bored. Anybody. It entertains me from it's awesome combat sytem all the way to it's often hilarious item captions. You can fight goblins, zombies, stone golems, entlings, and more! Also, Stonehearth is heavily moddable. I specifically include that there are so many interesting mods out there to use. And although I've never made a Stonehearth mod, I'm sure with a little bit of understanding that its much easier than making mods for most other games. I recieved this game as a Chistmas gift in 2015 and I was so incredibly excited. I had every right to be. So to anyone reading reviews to determine if they want a cool, epic new game, Stonehearth is perfect.			"

								This is a very cute, carefree and soothing building/managing a town kinda game. Think about it as Banished in casual mode, your whole town won't be wiped out by a deadly plague or cruel nature, just simple attacks from goblins, so if you enjoy more building than surviving through series of rage, I'm sure you'll enjoy this game a lot more. You get to control these villagers called Heathlings, assign them classes, see them working it through and even advancing to other classes. (which are not complete yet since it's still an early access, many classes are still ???) You get to craft many furnitures, design your buildings, decorate it as well. (To add to this, the furnitures are also very cute♥) If you can look over the early access and horrid perfomance issue that they're continuously fixing, (I have to use the word horrid, I have to restart my PC everytime I'm done with this game and it lags like crazy after a few days ingame which is still a common issue atm.) it's a relaxing fun game nontheless.

								Wow! what can i say about this game, or more like what can't I say. I jumped into this game at alpha 2. Not as far back as others, but right around the begining and man have I loved the ride. This game is not a minecraft clone nor is it ""stealing"" hearthstones name. It is a wonderful sandbox city builder with rpg elements to it. The devs are amazing and stream every week allowing the community to be involved and have input into the game. Yes there are lot of bugs right now and yes its fustrating at times, but this is an early access game, this is still in development and its still amazing. My only regret is not finding about it sooner and because of that I didnt get to back the kickstarter, but i have been with the game since. The game is easy to pick up and hard to put down, it lets you be as creative as you can get and challenges you at times. The devs allow mods to be made so if there isn't something in the game you want, you can add it! Over all the game art is cute, the music is beautiful and the game has so much more to give!  IF YOU DO NOT LIKE: bugs, works in progress, unfinished games, more content to be added THEN DON'T GET IT AT THIS TIME!! no one is forcing you to buy it now, wait if you want until more things are in the game. DON'T buy it and then complaine about the bugs and problems... Its EARLY ACCESS for a reason. I love this game and I recomend it to anyone. I also recomend taking a look at the discorse. The community is wonderful, you can get the answers and news you want to know and you can give suggestions that the devs will see and could add into the game.			"

								I like this game a lot, it is a very good game and has some very good elements to it:Things to fix though:-(Not something needing fixed exactly) A way to delete the buildings I saved that I no longer want-Villager's heads sink into/float above their bodies when working and/or walk while sitting down-glitches with villager animation causing them to not be able to lay down while sleeping-Villagers get stuck in town defense mode-Villagers sometimes refuse entire tasks which go undone for many days on end, if ever at all-UI errors from clicking on items which causes game to crash, along with multiple engine errors-Villagers in some games refuse to build structures, but aren't prevented from doing anything else-Clay doors aren't attached to the walls-Gold doesn't stack, so I have a large amount of 2 gold bags-Villagers build unnessecary scafolding after building has been completed-Zombies/skeletons are OP, and goblins are pathetic (i.e. I propose a more equal balance in monster strength)-Craftsmen sometimes refuse tasks (and yes I disabled the build, and in some cases the hauling) Things I'd like to see in game:-Ruined villages-Multiple structures/tasks can be built/done at one time-More maps-More civilizations-More starting equipment options-Dishonesty among villagers (i.e. theft, murder, etc.)-More monsters and monsters that involve changing villagers, like becoming werewolves/vampires-Villagers can be killed by disease/old age-Villagers can marry/have kids-Designated beds-Multiple Roofs on a building (i.e. church with steeple (I've noticed that usually they build one and refuse to build the second)-Multiple roofs on buildings aren't required to have the same settings (i.e. overhang, height, etc)-A villager is stuck alert (i.e. my villager was stuck up on scafolding, it took me awhile to figure it out)-Be allowed to change game mode from sandbox to survival and vice versa-Doors shouldn't open if someone is sleeping near it			"

First and foremost you need to understand that Stonehearth is currently in ALPHA. This means there will be bugs, unoptimized code, and a range of other things that appear in alpha level content.Although Stonehearth isn't a revolutionary game, it is still very enjoyable. Even though I’ve only owned the game since Alpha 9, I have spent enough time in the game to get a good feel for the gameplay, features, and overall value of the game. At this point in development I can recommend the game for those looking for a fun game, but aren’t afraid to test out builds, and find bugs. In the games current state your goal is to not kill all your hearthlings. When starting the game you are given virtually nothing to survive other than a tool to make a carpenter and a trapper. From there your job is to craft tools, give hearthlings jobs, and start to grow a tiny civilization. If you are playing on the Peaceful game mode then you really don’t have anything to worry about beyond keeping your hearthlings well fed. The other game mode at this time is Normal, and includes some nice goblins for you to fight with. The goblins don’t make the game overly difficult at this time and really just add another degree of play. Personally I enjoy playing Normal since it can be somewhat boring playing on peaceful mode. As of Alpha 10 the goblins haven’t been in the game very long. They do a nice job of adding more gameplay options though. With the inclusion of goblins you will need to take defense into consideration while building. They will not attack you immediately upon starting a game, but they do increase in difficulty as you grow stronger. One of the strongest points this game has is the robust building mechanic. You can build whatever structures you can imagine, as long as it’s within the boundaries of tiny blocks. The build mode is very simple to use and really help you personalize it to your taste. When you get a structure created you can even save it to use at any time after that. It’s a really nice feature since you don’t have to worry about designing each building every time you need it. The game also allows you to edit the building before placing it, giving you a chance to personalize each one without the need to recreate it from scratch. The only issue I have found when designing the buildings you can’t add in items like desks, beds, chairs, or other things of that nature without having them created and sitting in your stockpile. Luckily you just need 1 on hand to add them into the building blueprint. At this time the hearthlings don’t really have traits, but they do have stats. The stats are things like speed, courage, diligence, etc. and can affect how well a hearthling does his/her given job. As development continues I am sure we will see more stats, traits, and other features added to the individual hearthlings. That is really just a rundown of the main features the game has at this time. If you are interested in learning more about the game feel free to join us over at the Stonehearth.net forums. We always have some discussion going about the game, and keep up with all the little bugs in need of squashing. You can also find my pros/cons breakdown below.   PROS- Music- Art style- Crafting system- Builing/Blueprint system is awesome- Fun factor-Replayability-Great development teamCONS- Occasional building issues- LUA issues(LUA hits 100% causing game to lag and freeze)- Ocassional errors while playing- Lighting/Shadow issues The only con that I’ve found to really be a hindrance is the LUA problem the game runs into. You can see the game resources in real time while playing via a small bar on the bottom right of the game client. Once the LUA usage hits 100% the game will lag completely out. This is a known issue and will hopefully be addressed soon.			"

tl;dr Alpha 10 review:Cons:Lot's of bugs, minimal content.  Basically, it's a work in progress alpha game.Pros:Excellent dev team, great mod support, fun game with lots of potential.If you want a polished, feature filled, bug free game then stick StoneHearth in your watch list and wait a bit. If this looks like your kind of game, you want to have input into the development, you don't mind playing a game that will crash on you or just break because you clicked a button that causes an error, and you want to support Team Radiant.  Then buy it now.Full Alpha 10 ReviewIntroWhen you buy an early access game you are not just buying the game, because that isn't ready yet.  You are buying a look into the development of the game and the team behind it, and you get to play along as it's made, and then get the finished product at the end of it.  In my opinion the team at Radiant Entertainment are an amazing developer and I would happily buy into another early access game from them in the future based on my experience with them so far.What started out as a 2 man team when they launched their kickstarter has grown steadily over the past couple of years.  They have always interacted with the community with regular updates on their Dev Blog[stonehearth.net], answering questions, and helping on their Forum[discourse.stonehearth.net], and regular (currently multiple times per week) streaming through Twitch[www.twitch.tv] where they listen to and make changes from live feedback in the chat stream, explain the processes they are going through to help modding, and answer any questions people have for them about the game and it's development.I have total faith that this game will see it's completion and continued support afterwards.The Game (so far)You start with a small band of settlers with limited supplies and tools with the aim of building up a small town.  This is acheived harvesting materials, creating jobs, building items and tools, creating buildings (pre made and custom), and defending yourself from enemies.Controlling your town is a a bit of mix at the moment between telling your Hearthlings (the citizens) to go do something and then being able to forget about it (such as farming), and having to heavily micro manage other aspects (such as controlling production of individual items).  The initial concept from the kickstarter was that you wouldn't have to micro manage things in the town, so I would hope that this will be the case as the game matures.The building aspect of the game is developing well, and has had new features added with each new alpha.  You can choose to use a selection of pre-designed houses/buildings from Radiant or go all out and custom design your own.  The custom buildings part of the game is where I personally have experienced the most game breaking bugs, but it is certainaly getting better all the time.  If this is the part you are most looking at this game for I would hold off for a bit.Each Hearthling can be assigned a job/role within the community and will improve as they perform their tasks.  These include farmers, trappers, craftsmen, and guards.  These all work pretty well, although are all work in progress with the higher end skills still to be implemented.  And there are also new professions being added with each update.  Aplha 11 will be bringing us a cook, no more raw food!Enemies currently come in two varieties; undead, which will spawn on random nights and head to your town; and the goblins which are currently being worked on as part of the campaign that runs in game.  You do have the option to play on peacful mode if you want to build in peace and quite without having to worry about defending yourself.ModdingStoneHearth has been built from the ground up to support modding, and already has several great mods available, adding extra content into the game, changing the themes of the game and more projects in the works.  Because the game supports mods at it's core it is as simple as downloading a mod from the forum and dropping into the games mod folder.Final ThoughtsStoneHearth has a great team behind it, and is showing great potential for being an amazing game.  In it's current state you can definitly get several hours of enjoyment from the game, and get a taster of what is to come.  If you decide to purchase now expect to see bugs every game, from the amusing floating helmets, to annoying error messages, and I would recommend using the pre-made building templates until you are familiar with the rest of the game before venturing into more complex custom buildings.

								It's still in Alpha, so it does have its bugs and kinks. However, the developers are honest, communicate well, and work at an amazing speed. In the time I've had this game, it's improved tremendously, and I expect this to continue now that it's on public Early Access. The building tools already allow you to design almost anything, and Hearthlings are getting much smarter at building anything you can imagine. The leveling, RPGesque profession mechanics are truly fun instead of being a gating system. The RTSesque combat is fun to play albeit simplistic, and I think it will only continue to get more fun and complex.			"

								It's a fun little game but over the last week or two I keep finding myself being frustrated and I stop playing. Not because it's not fun but because it doesn't work, all the time. The building process is a mess, often times villagers ignore buildings halfway complete or dont even begin, sometimes the editing feature doesn't work so you cant even put wall on a building you're trying to make, any big projects like mining a large area or placing a big fence stop midway or cant be completed or cancelled. It's ""fun"" doesn't overshadow the bugs and frustration especially when you invest 20 minutes into something and have to start all over again more than once.			"

								I kickstarted Stonehearth and have been playing it since it was very, very simple in nature.  The graphics have remained beautiful (if you like voxels) throughout, each iteration has led to massive improvements in gameplay, and a number of bugs have been fixed - and the game is still in alpha.One of the ""big deals"" about this game is that it takes the dwarf fortress approach to items in the world and materials.  It then layers LUA scripting and html (no joke) for the interface.  Its modding system isn't a modding system so much a content-delivery system.  You want a new race? Describe some things in JSON and boom.This leads to some very, very awesome potential for BETA once all the systems are fleshed out.  The latest update added the second Kingdom, and playing as it evolves into a completely different playstyle.. and as near as I can tell it wasn't much of a code update, just a ""mod"" from the dev's standpoint.This is working out to be the ultimate kingdom builder / simulator.  Like Dwarf Fortress? You're gonna love this.  Like Minecraft but don't like doing all the digging yourself? You'll love it.  Do you like casual games? Yep.			"

			Chris continues to hammer on building bugs and improvements! Presenting: a bunch of community uploaded templates that didn't use to build, but that now do, and major interaction improvements related...		

First off, it is an early release, so bugs will happen, hoewever, I have never seen a team that is so responsive to the community. They can respond with a fix in less than a week!!1!!one!!1! Original Post: [/b]This is my favorite game, hands down, no doubt. Not only is it a great concept, but the execution is spot on. The combination of citizens you care about, and customization are huge selling points for me.Fantasy, city builders, resrouce managers, RPGs, and god sims in one without one over powering the others.Ok, so maybe you're worried about it being an alpha.THIS IS ALPHA DONE RIGHT!!!!The devs are very active, communicate and listen to the community and have fun with it!Every release feels like a leap forward with test builds available too.Honestly, at Alpha 14, this is more playable than a lot of finished games I have seen.Please feel free to contact me with any questions. In a library of over 1000 games, this one stands out in a great way. This is one purchase I've never regretted. "

Early Access Review
								I'm writing my review pretty early despite not having much play time so far. I bought this game during the Seam Summer sale at 20% off after having put it on my wishlist a while back. So far, the game is definitely worth the buy- and has shown itself already to be highly replayable even at its current state. I'm writing my review with the understanding that there will be a few bugs, some improvement suggestions, and in mind that more content will be released. Honestly, with where it's at now, I would love for a Workshop to be added for the community. Alas, it's still in alpha...Graphics: 9/10 being pixel themed. Very cute chibi like, so it appealed to me immediately. They glitch out sometimes for me, but I don't find it too annoying to not play. Gameplay Mechanics: 6/10 (this is definitely subject to change) With the fact that as others have stated there is much need for improvement for AI to properly work. I wish that the tasks they did were in order of your selection on what to build- meaning if you choose to build a cottage and you're currently building one- they will flock to the cottage you just qued instead of continuing to build the current one first. A way better tutorial on how to use the game mechanics at this point is highly needed. I had to google with no help to find out how to place a objects, such as my crafting bench, and had to press ""P"" to finally be able to go to a screen to place objects. After pressing P, I have not needed to do so, and placing objects started working for me. I would have also liked to understand how to use certain classes like the trapper early on. For the first part of your gameplay, you'll probably find yourself very slowly starting to understand how the game works because there is a lack of even a brief tutorial. The only tutorial you get is understanding how the camera options work, which if you play games regularly especially of this type, is pretty self explanotory before you even open the game. Content: 6.5/10* (subject to change) so far there are two playable races and two types of biomes to play in. The races pretty much work best only in their biomes- so if you're wanting to switch it up game play will definitely be harder. Not a bad thing, but I hope to see more races and biomes added for sure in the future which they've shown to be highly likely in the start screen. You are also able to select to be in Sandbox mode, normal, and hard, of course. I hope to definitely see a wider selection of crafting, building types, tasks, enemies, classes, etc. in the future. Once again, it's still in early acess- but even with its options now it's not bad. One complaint I have is that at the beginning of the game, you choose a selection of the map- make sure that the box you pick is not cut off in anyway because that section of the map is the only available area for you to build your village in at least in what I've seen so far. I hope that they change it to where that's just the area of the map that you choose to reside, and still can explore out further. Otherwise, it cuts a huge chunk of game time to me. You can't explore much out of your settlement, and it makes resources limited.Replay Value: 9/10 With the options so far that are available, you still have different scenarios and ways that you can play out in your game. And it's pretty addicting... Reccommend: 10/10 Would reccommend anyone this game at its current state even in early access. Stonehearth has already shown itself to have an extremely promising future. Hope to play with this game as it grows and expands itself. Hope to see DLC and a workshop in the future. :) "

								Stonehearth is a fantastic game!!It's cute little city-builder with some strategy and RPG elementsYou establish your own little town, in a randomly generated world Assign classes you your Hearthlings/Villagers. Like footmen, carpender, weaver, farmer. etcDesign your own buildings, draw out the walls and place furniture. Build bridges, statues, stairs and everything you can think of voxel-by-voxel with the slab tool(But don't go to crazy, the automatic scaffolding system can't handle too complex structures yet)Mine out the mountains for ore, and make your blacksmith create weapons & armor out of them.And you need to protect yourself from Goblins, zombies and wolfs (And there is more to come).Different races are planned, like Three different human clans, Rabbit people, Dwarfs and Orcs (some will be playable and some will not) It's already a fun game and the developer has such plans for this game. This game has so much potensial, and i love it so much. The developers are really connected with the players, both trough the forums and the multiple streams they have weekly. And they are sure to take your thoughts to account.The game is already fun, it just needs more contentI've had a lot of fun with this game and i would absolutely recommend it to everyone.

								I have waited above a year after initially purchasing this game for some simple but vital improvements to the game's building designer / editor, a key part of the game since it feels quite dead ended otherwise. Apart from the addition of a poor staircase generator, there have been no improvements that I can see. The game is still incapable of handling even slightly complex designs. Only a basic square room with a roof seems to work properly. Due to the very, very slow resolution to this issue I think it's only fair I write this one down as a no go. Which is a shame, because it seems to have had a lot of work put into it so far.			"

								Stonehearth has the positives of Dwarf Fortress (DF): a simcity style game that focuses on individual citizens, their lives, attributes, and abilities without the difficult learning curve that makes DF so in-accessible for people. It has beautiful graphics, and has the option for a peaceful setup (for those not interested in fighting).It is by no means complete - but the team has been steadily working on the core functionality - and the improvement shows with each new alpha version. Update:Alpha 17 is quite playable - once you decide to focus on what works rather than what does not  -Lots of content. High quality UI. They have chosen well when they copied Dwarf Fortress (attributes, farming, combat, 3D) and chosen well even, or particularly, when they diverged from it (RPG-type-classes, experience, levels).The game creates interesting decisions - Embark - Race, difficulty level, choice of locationStart - Which classes to focus on, etcWorth buying not just to support but also to play.

								It's generally an alright game.Some Pro's an Con'sPro's:-It has a very unique artstyle.-It's a enjoyable and addicting game.-With the upcoming Alpha 21 you really have the feeling like you're playing with unique hearthlings.-It has a great community:Con's:-It's has some small buggs that could really break you game:  >When you build something hearthlings could get trapped on roofs or inside doorless rooms.  > Hearthlings sometimes don't retrieve items that you've selected they should loot.-Although it's already a fun game, it still isn't near done.. -Can't add mods trough steam workshop.-The building designer doesn't allow you to remove roofs.-Nothing happens when all your hearthlings are dead.I'd give it an 7.2/10It's still in Alpha so the game could be completely different when fully complete, and I'd love to see what it becomes over time. I think it's a fair price overall.. There is great support and if you have a great idea you can always submit it on the forum, maybe your idea will be added into the game!

								Not worth 25. You will get a few hours of play out of this game, but then errors become more and more common. The game is still just TOO damn basic. Crafters quickly run out of use, some are just better then others (Oh boy.... pottery..... Only useful on the sand map, and even then ONLY so you can rush Mason.) Game world is tiny, feeling less like a world and more like and island. Wait until 10-15, or until the game comes further along.			"

								Even with the extra help in the newer updates, I still feel like this game needs some extra work to carry though.  Similar to Minecraft but relying on the villagers to do everything for you, you’d think the ai would work more effectively, but they still struggle from time to time.  Even trying to help prompt them so any ways, they still fail to complete tasks or build buildings.  So buy this game only when it’s on sale, since it is a fun game but not a completed game, so don’t pay full price.			"

 >>ALPHA 1.7 REVIEW<< This game has been very buggy at the beggining (which ofc makes sense this is an alpha) so at that time it would probably be a bad time to buy the game. But now this game has enough content and works well enough that I believe its worth buying it now.Now for the reasons: Worth it?/Not Worth it?Worth it!:1.)The managment aspect of the game is realy nice.{you can control what your little guys do to quite the detailed aspect including great buildings great combat detail}2.)Little details.{There is a TON of little details [Events,Merchants,Attacks,Thiefs,]}3.)Great development speed {This game gets updated quite fast with a lot of details added every time and buggs fixed all the time.}4.)Relaxing game{Nothing to say here.}5.)sense of progression{You got plenty of ways to progress It feels good and meaningfull}Not worth it:1.)Still lacking content.{This game doesnt have much for it but a lot is planned for it, and there was even less content when I bought it.{Disclaimer: Remmber point 3 on why is it worth it}}2.)Slightly buggy{allthough the game lost a lot of its buggs It still has some}3.)Mining system is really bad{The mining system is kinda bad if only because most of the buggs I know are there and the game can be quite broken on that aspect.}4.)Frames for second?{after getting deep enough into the game the high amount of details and things being done at the same time could the games FPS could drop duo to the high amount of lets say ""traffic"" going on in the game.Finale though:When considering if to buy a game or not you should think of the genere your looking at first and then at its weaks and strongs.I just want to remind you all this review was done when the game was on alpha 1.7,I'm sure it will get way better allthough its good enough right now as is.7/10or 8/10Hard for me to decide.~~Sorry for any grammar mistakes I have made and failed to notice~~ "

								I've had the game for a while now. It's great, fun, more responsive now given the updates, but the one thing they have yet to fix is the amount the game stutters (even with normal-high FPS (I run the game at an even 55FPS and my Hearthlings stutter like crazy)) at a certain point. You cannot really build too much or queue too much or else your Hearthlings will look like they're making a stop-go walk to their destination (even during work animations). The game isn't bad by any means and a lot of the construction bugs (I.E: not working anymore even when you have all required materials for a building) are squashed. Despite the cuteness and the fact I am recommending this game, I am not currently recommending it until some more optimization is brought into the mix. However, I don't expect my review to cause anyone to wane in their decision (for better or worse) so if you decide to buy it, then by all means you won't regret it if you can get past my aforementioned gripe.

But the devs are actually pusing updates so it's fine for me.But before you buy, you should check the official site for Q/A and bug reports to make sure you can tolerate those bugs...Here's one bug or two I've encountered:Tried to build a three-decker, then all my workers(not all villagers) stopped building after completing the first floor and just idling around. Okay...fine, let's build something else, how about...a round barn! The workers again, left this one unfinished and the game started to crash ( probably because of the barn, I had to load the previous save to avoid it otherwise the game crashes).So I tried a less complicated building, a beautiful and decent modern dinner ofc, It's finished this time, very happy about it.

You guys have a perfect basically 3D dwarf fortress here and the opportunity to make  game that touches millions if only you properly incentivize people to play. 25$ is just too much for this game in it's unfininished stage as you lose your save EVERY TIME there is an update.

								With the lattest set of patches fixing build pathing, the final grievance with this title is solved. Definitely one of the cuter sandbox colony sims out there, LOTS of potential in this little gem, and very enjoyable.  Easy UI, logical management system, plenty of customization, decent combat consideration and a wide variety of activities and considerations.With the lattest sets of patches, I cant recommend this enough! get it! NOW!			"

								I was lucky enough to be a kickstarter backer of this game and I've been impressed by the sheer competency of the devs. They are brothers, each with 10 years experience in the software industry and it shows. They've taken the time to perfect the underlying tech of the game and to ensure the AI works better than any sandbox-type game I've seen (with graphics that is, Dwarf Fortress is in a class of it's own). The game is fun to play in it's current state and more content is coming with regular updates.Currently, I'd recommend getting this game if you enjoy DF, Gnomoria, or city-building games.Keep your eye on this one, it's going to set the standard a new for sandboxes.

								I'm going to keep it short and express my quick thoughts about the game above.Firstly, I've got to give a shout out to Radiant Entertainment who, in my eyes, portraits as an extremely commited and trustworthy bunch, who you can tell are giving their all for this title, and who are often seen in dialog with its community.Stonehearth itself, I do believe got the potential to become somewhat of a rare gem, especially when they implement multiplayer. But even in its current stage of development it still offers great gameplay. I'm confident that this game, that just dropped as EA on Steam but that has been in development for quite a while now, will continue to update and one day become something fantastic.			"

								TL;DR - Buy it now, You most likely won't be disappointed!A truly excellent game, well worth the money. I've followed the game and development team for 1 1/2 years and they put other Early Access developers to shame. They always keep in contact with us players, and are very transparent (hosting livestreams twice a week - where they show content being developed, and answer questions, and take suggestions/ideas, weekly development blog posts, responding to PMs and threads on the official forums, etc.). When you buy this game expect monthly-ish updates and alongside that pre-release versions to test out. (Very few Early Access games, update this often at all.)The community is also awesome. Check out the official forums where you'll find lots of mods, artwork, animations, Let's Plays,  interesting discussions and very mature and respectable people. I really love this game, and its admirable and impressionable devs. I can tell you right now this is not your typical let-down Early Access game! I can say full-heart'dly to buy this game. It's 100% worth it.Please note though, if you buy this game right now. It's still EARLY ACCESS, and things such as optimization or promised features are not all completed yet. The devs have worked really hard, and I hate seeing people flame the game, while blindly ignoring the fact that it still has a while to go in development. As of now there is plenty of content, and it's fairly replayable. It runs quite smoothly for an Early Access game, too. I say go for it, but if you're picky maybe wait a while! :)[ P.S. - If you buy the game, please watch the weekly livesteams almost every Tuesday and Thursday - and also join the official forums, again really awesome community! :)! ]			"

								Have been playing this game off and on since the first Alpha. I've been through a lot of failed Kickstarter games, Castle Story, StarForge, a lot of disappointments like Planetary Annihilation, War for the Overworld, Shroud of the Avatar.This game I still believe in. They've been making steady progress, they've stuck to what they said they were going to do on the kickstarter and the game has come from a single block with one towns person that picked berries to a playable town management game.If you're looking for a finished product, this isn't it. Add it to your wishlist, come back around Christmas and see where it is. But if you're looking for a game that brings the feeling of Banished, Myth and Minecraft and mixes them all together then I suggest you take a closer look and consider supporting the game early.

								Had this game since the kickstarter and I definitely recommend it. Features are missing and the game has a long way to go before its complete. Radiant has been wonderfully communiative with their fans the game and despite not hitting their kickstarter goals they continue pushing out updates.Stonehearth is a fun little mixture of minecraft, the sims, and town building games. There is enough content to make playing enjoyable but it is still buggy.Despite enjoying the game I'm not sure there is enough content to warrant the $25 dollar price tag. If it goes on sale its worth picking up :D Can't wait for more updates.  "

								Great strategy/city builder. A lot like minecraft except you control the villagers and organize them to keep them a live. If you are thinking of buying this game, keep in mind it is still in alpha. That being said Stonehearth has an amazing dev team who listen to all of your feedback posted on their forums. They work hard to give us the indie we want, and despite all the bugs the game has come really far in the past year. If you do buy the game I recommend opting into the latest developement builds. Typically a new one comes out each week, two weeks at most. If you are like me, itching for new content this is the best way to go. New Alpha builds seems to come out every 3 weeks to a month.			"

								Now I have supported this game since the early days of their Kickstarter. Bias could be heard in my review but I will keep it honest. Stonehearth is phenomenal between the unique building creator to the funny item descriptions it doesn’t bore.  Every game is different you can’t have the same scenario. If you haven’t bought it your missing one of the great gems of the 2010s.			"

								TL:DR Do you have a realistic expectation of alpha/early access games? Are you willing to wait for more features and enjoy the current game in the mean time? Do you like the genre of this game?If you ansered yes, this game is for you.I have been playing this game pre-EA release, and honestly believe it is one of the most satisfying kickstarters I have ever backed and is already quite fun to play. It has a brilliant balance of city building, crafting and RPG elements, and rewards the player with a real feeling of progression. Each citizen has their own stats and skills which you can improve and you are able to get very creative with your architecture already with a little effort.PRO- Developer communication, every week there are numerous posts on their websites dev blog covering their progress and frequent developer streams where you may have direct imput in the creation of the game.- The game is being designed to be ULTRA modder friendly, I myself, someone with NO prior experience making mods have already made a few myself without causing bugs in the game in an alpha state. (Expect workshop support)- Frequent updates, the game is beginning to progress rather quickly and is adding features and busting bugs EVERY patch.- A wonderful art style, it maintains a simple charm while still looking brilliant and handling rather well even on less powerful machines.- Balanced progression, the game in this current state is slow enough to last but fast enough to hold your attention.- A fast forward button, I personally find this extremely important for things such as building or mining, or passing time while not active.CON- This is an alpha, there are occasional bugs, especially following new versions, but far fewer than there have been previously. For an alpha I have seen a relatively low amount and they always seem to get fixed before I can encounter them more times but there will be some bugs and if you go in to an early access game not expecting bugs you will be dissapointed.- Villager progression through classes is currently incomplete, quite a few are implemented so far but it does reduce the games variety.- can be hard at times as death of a skilled citizen can set you back for a while.

								To address people raging about this game so far, I’ll repeat what others have already stated. The game is in development, and it will get better. With that in mind I’ve loved this game so far, and it’s been the easiest timesoak game I’ve had for years.This game, in a word is pleasant. I've played games like Banished (which is probably the nearest comparable) where the biggest problem was keeping people alive, and the only way to do so was to go balls out at it deal with problems decades in advance.This, like I've said is pleasant to the point of a city-building game being relaxing. I personally play games to chill out with, and I've always enoyed games within this genre so getting something I can actually chill out with is wonderful.It's easy to understand, easy to progress through and at the time of writing (04/07/15) there are very few problems with it in terms of bugs that I’ve experienced, but I’ll detail any below. I do also have one or two suggestions but I'll detail those at the bottom. (Again, all in development stage. I don’t expect these to be addressed three weeks ago, chill your beans)On the whole though, I've thouroughly enjoyed what these guys have offered already, and I can't wait to see what comes up in the future. It's a solid game as it stands, and it's far from a regretable purchase. -- For the below, I'm just assuming the devs are watching these things -- Bugs I’ve noticedI was able to place single tables within dining tables after building the wrong tables. I don’t know if this is unique but moving things around to get it straightened out was a ballache.SuggestionsThe daily report – while I fully respect people’s desire to blast through games like this. A play through on peaceful mode (for example) where you play at a fairly slow pace leads to a situation where you can’t keep up with the daily goals. If these goals were changed from what seems to be programmed based on what day you’re on, to a flat ‘Achieve this level of food/happiness/net value to get a new person’ the whole thing would flow a lot better.A priority system, or a worker grouping could be set so sorting to storage can be made more efficient. For instance If I can make Phil gather a set range of materials (or if stores are refined enough, just tie workers to those stores). That or create a 'Runner' class of citizen, where their tasks is simply to move things around. (Teamster to the likes of Tropico)			"

								Stonehearth, Stonehearth, Stonehearth... Where do I even begin? I absolutely adore this game. I have learned about it some time ago and purchased it via Humble Bundle. Since then, I fell in love with it like never before, as this game is my dream game, one I have always been looking for. It is excellent mix of Strategy, Sandbox and City Simulation. This game, as you can probably tell by the screenshots and movies, have it`s own unique feel and it`s as cuddly and cute as it can get. For now, the game is still in early to mid alpha, so there is much content to add, but even now game can be and is fun to play. Why should you buy this game?  Developers of Stonehearth, team Radiant, are the most amazing team of developers I have ever encountered in my gaming career. You wouldn`t probably believe how much they involve us (the community) onto the process of making game. First of all, they stream on http://twitch.tv three times per week, showing us how the game is being made, also taking countless advices from players (you could affect how the monster will look in game, how some mechanics should work or even name characters yourself). They also let us decide on how the game`s development should go from alpha to alpha (using https://trello.com/b/4XvM0SUd/stonehearth-community-roadmap) so we can choose what content should be made next.  The game have an amazing building system, presented in the trailer. Your little Hearthlings will build everything you can imagine voxel by voxel, using scaffoldings. The building system is very intuitive yet complex, and is being updated even more.  Stonehearth is made in a way that allows players to easily add mods to the game. There already some amazing mods made by community members, and we can expect even more of those coming soon.  If you, like me, always want the game to be as filled with content as possible, you can expect some good things from Stonehearth, In the final version there will be alternative planes, additional biomes, extra races to play as, huge campains to play, dozens of enemies and events randomed by computer Game Master. And much more, that`s for sure.  Last but not least, you don`t have to be afraid of this game being abandoned by developers. They seem so excited about this game, and they don`t slow down while making this game in front of our eyes. I believe it`s a privilege being able to take part of making this awesome game.I r8 8/8 m8.			"

								This game is not a bad game. I actually Recommend it. The only bad thing about this game is the Price for the content the game has at this moment in time. Perhaps when the game is finished or when they add multiplayer this game will be worth it but right now it is worth around 10-20 bucks. Depending on how much you love games like these will depend how much you are willing to pay for it. I bought this game just to see if its worth it for the price and for the content it has right now its not exactly worth my money. I definitely will be picking this up on sale though.			"

								I was looking for a game like Dwarf Fortress but with better graphics and easier to get in to.This is it.Obviously it is not as deep as Dwarf Fortress but the basic mechanics are there.You can build a cute little forest town, or a mountain fortress. You can slaughter all of the pesky Kobolds in the world, or you can be a peaceful little farming village.This game is brilliant. My only problem with it so far, is that you will eat through the Campaign/Story within a few hours.Luckily the replay value so far is in creating new towns etc.Hopefully the devleopers keep up their active content updates and patches until well after the game has gone gold.Couldn't recommend this product enough.

								It is very rare that I log in to make a review. By that I mean (and I don't know if others have this issue) when steam connects me to make one it brings me to a new window where I am not logged in. But that is neither here nor there. Let me begin by saying this game has AMAZING POTENTIAL! However currently the villagers' AI is lacking though it is still an alpha build. Even then the game is still playable though you'll have many of your troopers standing around staring off into the sun like idiots.The great pros to the game:Great potential. Good graphics that aren't hard on your computer (I'm on a laptop, furthermore one built for office work and NOT gaming and I still rarely crash).The ability to build ANYTHING! Yes... anything! You can even build a giant hotdog if you wish.A city builder that isn't annoyingly complicated.The bad:Well, the AI sucks as forementioned. That's a work in progress I hope. Goblin attacks happen very early. I only had a carpenter and I was still working on making a guard when the first attack happened. I lost three of my five villagers. So yes, this is a bad thing but this also hasn't happened every game so perhaps it is just bad luck.Villagers don't seem to really want to work but that's probably just the AI again. Also, there needs to be a method to making each villager assigned to a specific home or shop area. I have farmers sleeping in buildings on the opposite side of town to their fields and blacksmiths sleeping outside the town entirely...			"

Your settlement has jobs. You need certain jobs to open up other ones. Create traps and defend your settlement.Play all jobs at once.

Been months and no fix for this issue. Happens to others too because my friend who played has the same problem.Slow bug fixes.Building aspect of it is a mess. You can insert windows and doors etc but you have to force trick it to do it to free-style building by placing blocks behind them to connect it just to get a windows since it doesn't really allow for that. You can just use their walls but they are gigantic. Their huge walls have automatic colums and sometimes there is no color match up leaving you on huge builds with ugly colums in odd colors. Limitted colors to build in. Almost no different textures. Lots of solid colors that are blue, orange, tan or brown or pink hues.Double doors stick out of one side out of the doorway more than another side. Objects just aren't even. Lack of space even when making tons of vaults. Not enough clay without digging a lot compared to all other resources available to you when mining.Not enough building variety.Hearthlings are just too slow. Crafting times are too slow.Town inventory item limit is too low for a game that you can build on and decorate as well.Roofing tool doesn't like to work most times.Changing between colors on a wall means you have to select each wall. You can't just apply it with an option to all walls if you wanted too. Making the game even slower.You can't use the delete erase tool for anything other than slabs when building. Making this far more frustrating when building. You can't use it on doors, windows etc either.I lasted a good while on the game but enough is enough. I don't want to keep starting maps over any more. I can over-look many of these things in early access, however I can not over look their Engine Errors that ruining your hours and hours of maps when you can't no longer build on them due to these annoying errors as it breaks players game save files making it so they can't play or progress further. I played it a lot and re-started countless maps from scratch until finally I got burnt out of starting over. Game is slow paced some what as a result of starting over maps. Will update this once this game functions properly for the better & then re-visit it once bug fixes are made to the engine error issues. Follow it if you want. I can't recommend it in this state until they deliver those fixes. Disapointing to do so much work on it, then you have to be forced to start over again.			"

								Hey!This is my first review, so don't expect too much of it.________________________________________________________________________________(Personal Opinion)I can understand that some people don't like it because of its huge amount of bugs and that it has been in Alpha for an extremely long time. But honestly, if you ignore the countless bugs (which will be fixed) the game is one of the best games I've ever played. This game is a place where you could relax, a place where you can be happy without worries.  It helps me get through hard periods where you feel like life sucks. That's because of the music.The music, made by Raj Mann, here is just amazing (google up Stonehearth OST if you don't believe me, my favorite is 'Sailing into the black clouds & blue skies)  and everything, the animations, world, design style is just incredible to look at.The animals and the hearthlings are soo cute to look at.One of the main reasons why I bought this is because of its amazing soundtracks (Mentioned above)but also because of its simplistic playstyle. The AI is a bit buggy, and there are A LOT of bugs that need to be fixed (Its Alpha) but I do believe that this won't be a game that'll be abandoned, because the progress that has been done is immense and the team is just so amazing. Posting weekly blogs about how the progress is going.The gameplay is nice, and you can do a lot of things in the game.Want a big army with only archers and kill all the orcs that appear in random events, here you go!Want to build a palace? Say no more!You can make a big town with all the possible jobs, fully surounded by walls.Sometimes a big army of orcs will appear, trying to kill every hearthling you got and raze the lovely town you got.Or sometimes nothing will happen, and you can be free of worries.TL;DR====================================================================================+Amazing music                                                      I - Still in Alpha+Relaxing                                                                 I - Some bugs+Nice art style                                                         I - Computer heavy (Slow fps if you progress in the game)+Different playstyles (A lot of choices)                  I - A bit on the expensive side+Easy to understand the mechanics                      I====================================================================================Should you buy it?

								It was either this or rimworld and since rimworld wasnt discounted for the winter sale I went with Stonehearth. I love games like cities skylines and i got a little taste of it with this game. There are some bugs with the scaffolding NOT being removed after building a custom building, which makes for a really ugly building. Other than that I would Recommend this game, but not highly until some of the bugs are resolved.			"

								I am quite a big fan of the genre, and have enjoyed related titles a lot. Stonehearth has everything it needs to fill the  form:- Villagers with names and faces (...and stats and opinions!)- Random maps (...and varying biomes)- Crafting / industry (...and leveling craftsmen)- Resource management (...and storage management)- Trade (...and trade missions/events)- Town defense (...and giant zombies).But it doesn't stop at that, the best thing about this game is that it oozes love. It's being crafted with TONS of love. The devs really care for this product, and it shows. It even inspired me to write them a small letter, to which they kindly replied.That said, Stonehearth still has a long way to go until it's a solid, solid release, but I am extremely optimistic about the outcome and wish both develolpers and early adopters the best of luck.

								For an alpha game this has a ton of promise. I am still very excited that the devs for this game are really behind this and whenever there is an issue its fix ASAP, not something you can get for most other games these days. It is simple to learn and allows you to be very creative in your builds. You control your town and your hearthlings and the outcome of the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves to build and control a town of people. Even if you don't normally like this kind of game or if you get bored with them, this one adds other clans to make it a bit more challenging. Of course if you want a calm game there is a mode for that too! Hell you can even choose what kind of people to start with and have a completely different experience playing all over again. I got this game on the steam sale but even then I would have paid full price for this. A game where the Devs are actually working on the game still AND interacting with the community make this a great game so far and I would buy it again if I had to. Just remember it is still a work in progress, but that does not mean its not worth it as it is right now.			"

								Its got little block peeps!Seriously though, if you have played Timber & Stone and liked that game, you will be sure to like this game! Development is top notch! I've not seen any other indy dev team so focused on progression and community input as Radient!Its alpha, so its buggy, but there are constant updates that try to make each alpha release stable. And alpha releases come at nice intervals.My only issue is that every alpha breaks saved games. So although you can save, you cannot progress in alpha builds if you are hard set on a settlement and don't want to lose it. This may change in the immediate future but as of my last game it has not.TBH, Stonehearth is the only website where I track & post on for indy games. I support alot of indy games but none is as ambitious as this one, with a team so focused and honest.If you do not own this game, you need to buy it! I'd bet my bottem dollar that this is a game that will see final relese, and  will be a game changer across its genre's!			"

Early Access Review
								Alpha 21 Review:I backed this game on kick starter (2012) because it looked like a neat take on dwarf fortress or towns.  The cute little 3d voxel guys with destructable 3d voxel terrain and customizable voxel 3d buildings and forts, I was sold.  I have played the Alpha on and off for years, and I have waited patiently for a working voxel based town simulator that allows me to create neat buildings with little 3d voxels.  So here is my review, because the game should have been finished back in 2014, according to the kick starter page.Is it like Dwarf Fortress?  -No.  You have much more control over your people in SH, and you only get 20 people...Is it like Gnomoria? -No.  Gnomoria is closer to DF, and SH is nowhere near the oh crap feeling of running out of food and everyone dies.Is it like Towns? -Similar, but watered down.  Less jobs, promoting is painfully slow and the level up system is annoying.  SH doesn't have the dungeon diving that Towns has.  SH more or less keeps you on the surface and you are raided just about every day by very annoying enemies.  Dang near have to keep an army on hand to repel attackers, or build a giant wall around your settlement with a simple door...yes, a door, keeps enemies out.  The devs haven't added the ability for AI to bash or bipass doors in..years.Pros: It's cute, stable enough on common alpha builds to play for a time with little to no serious issues, save the occasional CTD, annoying debug error popups, or the dreaded slowing down of the game when you have 20 peasants all moving around.  Though I have a good rig, so it isn't too bad.  The building of towns or forts can be fun, but it's also tedious and frustrating at times.Some things have improved, like AI path finding, which was terrible in early alpha versions, UI / presentation, stability, and overall performance, which used to be terrible but isn't too bad until late game.  However, many other key aspects of the game have actually gotten WORSE over the course of development.  Primarily, the very feature that got me to back it in the first place, designing and building custom buildings.  CONS:This is one of the few titles that has seemed to go one step forward, and two steps back.  What's more, the developer continuously makes excuses and dumps money in useless quests, presentation, and blatantly feminist artwork.  Most every picture features a woman being in the position of authority or strength and the male is subservient, but that's just personal taste, I don't appreciate feminism or cultural marxism in my games, and feel with the times, it's necessary to warn people that do not want to support such things, or support it, your choice.I was furious when one of the Cannon brothers made the comment to me that not everyone agrees that the editor is a key feature, so it isn't a priority, back in 2014.  Yet over the years, I have seen hundreds of people complain about the editor's bugs and features being removed, not fixed, from the game.  Many of the original promised goals have yet to be implemented in the game, which has been in development for over 5 years now.  With each new Alpha build, a few new tweaks are added, but nothing mind boggling, or remotely close to what was promised ever surfaces.  Like multiplayer, seasons, or a building editor that allows you to modify completed structures or delete walls.Funny that you used to be able to disassemble houses, even re-design houses or erase features.  The feature was bugged, like workers get stuck, are unable to get all the blocks, or AI can't pathfind and the project sits idle and is ignored.  Instead of fixing these things, it was just scrapped in order to add cool things (sarcasm) like, leveling up your workers, constantly being wiped out by hordes of annoying goblins on day four, or re-arranging the UI for the 18,000th time. Come to think of it, I still haven't received my kick starter backer pet reward.Overall, this game could have been really really awesome.  But progress has been really slow going.  So I will not recommend this game to friends unless I see significant improvement.			"

								This alpha is more stable than any alpha I've ever seen, most betas i've seen, and some releases i've seen.It's ridiculously fun and addictive, even though it's not feature complete.If you want a synopsis of the gameplay, it's like Minecraft and The Settler's had a baby, and that baby surpasses it's parents in every way.The soundtrack is probably the best thing I've had in my ears in a long time.The price is ridiculous, but in a good way.This is an absolute gem of a game and it's still in alpha.BUY.

								This is a fun little dorflike city builder. As with most of these, you start with 7 people (In this game, they're ""hearthlings"") and from there, you need to set up for food, shelter, resources, and defense. So far so same, right? The two largest twists on this one are how you can set up the housing (completely planning out a building, instead of either a hole in the wall or a prefab structure), and the animation style. I'm trying to find a good descriptor for the animation style, and I keep coming back to ""cute"". It's not the word I'm looking for, but it does indeed match, in my opinion. I feel emotionally vested in these hearthlings in a way I don't really get from the likes of Gnomoria, Towns, or even Dwarf Fortress, and I honestly feel it's the way they're animated. When goblins are charging into your town and you see your farmers scatter from their fields and cower, it makes you want to protect them. The victories feel more visceral when your footman is taking a giant stone hammer to the goblins instead of just getting lines of damage text.That is the best way I can really put it right there. If you're looking to just build a town, then there are hundreds of other games that do the same thing. If you want to take care of your citizens, check this one out.			"

--Playing unstable alpha 18--I have been playing now over 8 hours, that's not much, but I have not encountered any game breaking bugs that some people complaining, only couple minor bugs.The game runs well on my computer, Game play mechanics are good, graphics looks beautiful.I have enjoyed my time with this game and at the moment I think I will play many more hours with this tactical town building/managing game. This IS NOT Minecraft, if want you to search something that this resembles graphically I will say CubeworldWhen you start game first time there will be difficulties to understand what to do if you play this kind of game first time, otherwise just by exploring game and searching what your Heartling's can do will solve many problems. there is no tutorial atm, hopefully we get one somedayAlpha 17 is current stable version, but there is no option to remove building(temporarily suspended).So be careful with that. so do not forget door from you building/house.Minor bugs:1.After Completing building they will start tearing scaffolding's down and sometimes they will forget couple of these in place - solution for this - ""CTRL-C""  to open console, click select scaffolding and write console ""destroy"" and its gone.2.Some times after building they left some hunk of stone or couple block of wood to roof top, this is quite funny, and if you wanna get rid of those, again console, or create ladders to get them.3.Sometimes when you get new heartling she/he will spawn in odd locations and cannot find way to your village. that is annoying, time build ladders again.I have not witnessed it myself, but I have read that when you have complex building you should save game before you start build it, sometimes they dont know how to build it, but this might be out dated warning.After 8hours I will give this game 8/10. (I will updated verdict again when I know  more about this game) I really want to give higher verdict but after 8 hours I cant			"

								This is 3 years late already and is unlikely to ever be released, judging by the progress over the last 4 years it would take about 20 years to finish. The parent company is likely to get bored funding this so it'll bin it as soon as early access income dries up.

If you can look past this issue (and I am sure they will fix it soon), then by all means, enjoy the game.			"

								Even though I recommended this game, I wouldn't get it just yet. It's so buggy that it is absolutely unplayable. The developers update it regularly and I have full expectations that it will be one of the greatest city-building games ever made when it is finished. It's essentially Minecraft mixed with Banished. You assign jobs and tasks that need to be done, and your little hearthlings go do it. You don't controll the hearthlings directly, you simply guide them. They can die from combat and starvation, so careful planning and resource management is very important. It's as much a game of strategy as it is creation. The game is currently somewhat limited in the designs you can create based on the terrible AI of your hearthlings and the bad UI. It will get fixed, and when it does, you'll be able to create things on par with Minecraft. All while playing a sandbox citybuilder. When this game is out of the alpha stage, GET IT GET IT GET IT!!!			"

Early Access Review
								This game could be great. I enjoyed managing my villagers, building mines, collecting resources and defending my tiny village from incoming raiders. But one key element has made me decide to not recommend this game.Designing and building things is a struggle against a ruthless stubborn AI and clunky difficult to use controls.The core of this game is about building things. Houses, towers, mansions, whatever you need to house your hearthlings and keep them happy. Right now this mechanic is broken. The controls are non-intuitive. I'm still unable to find a simple way to edit or delete plans. If I do start construction and finish a house halfway and then realise that I forgot to design a window, door, or anything else, I can't change the plan. Instead I have to delete the plan, dismantle and destroy whatever was actually built and then start over. Trying to destroy partially built homes is another struggle. Hearthlings will destroy the pieces around them leaving no way for them to exit creating floating walls or floors and even after you rescue them they refuse to destroy those floating pieces.Building a city is what this game is supposed to be about. It's an early access game. I understand. But I've been watching this game ever since the kickstarter and the constant complaint has always been about how difficult it is to get custom unique buildings created. It's been a few years and this problem is still around. Before you make a decision on whether or not to purchase ask yourself if it is a problem Radiant even CAN fix. "

								It's hard to evaluate any game that is in Alpha, so please take that into account when reading this:I have played this game for about 20 hours. (kids have put in another 40 and they love it) and I find it it be very well crafted and well thought out.  They really have nailed this so far.  every feature that is currently in the game is well done, and the crafting system, and promotion system is complicated enough to allow for a variety of professions while simple enough to play without spending a long time deciding what your citizens should be doing with their lives.If you think the videos look good, you should for sure try this game out, you won't be dissapointed.My only conern with the game is the roadmap and direction it is going.  What I mean by that is I cant really get a sense from googling this game on the internet or looking though the forums how close this game is to being finished.  In my opinion at ""Alpha 19""  it is only about half done.  there is no multiplayer yet, (although I believe that is coming)  and what this game really needs is some ""dwarf fortress"" or ""minecraf"" machine building capebility, (using physics, and trap doors and drawbridges and leavers and such to really bring your constructions to life.  I assume that is coming in the future, as it really seems like that is what the game is designed to eventually become.  I am enjoying it so far and am looking forward to seeing where the developers take it.			"

								Stonehearth is a fantastic game, and if you enjoy sandbox/city building games then I highly recommend it.I may be a little biased as I was one of the backers when it was still in Kickstarter, but even then I felt that Radiant Entertainment had a great take on the genre, and a great culture in regards to their backers and fans.  In watching the game and the team grow, I have not changed my mind.  They have shown consistent and impressive improvements to the game, regular updates on the game and the team, and an active role in the discussions.A few notes on the game itself.  It is still very much a work in progress.  Features are still being developed and released, each one coming with it's share of bugs and quirks.  As should go without saying with any Early Access game, only purchase if you are interested in seeing the game grow, and want the chance to add your voice to the development.  Radiant has done a very good job of adding polish to the game as they went, but their primary focus has been features, the rest of the polish comes later.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoy this game, even in it's unfinished state.  Radiant has built a good base for their game, and I look forward to seeing what they can do with it.-NB			"

You can build a larger army, you can raise a group of traders, you can role play this game. However there is one downside and the downside that unfortunately all games have. It's called memory leaks, it's called lag, it's called performance, of course this is in alpha, so if you want to get the game be ready for bugs, i sure hope the devs are dedicated to this game forever, i know i will be playing this a lot, but when the game crashes, i need to find something to surpress my emotions after that point, cause it's the only reason i can't play it. Memory stacks up after time, and it causes it to crash in the end, so i reccomend it in it's future, that i HOPE it will be an amazing game.			"

								Best town game I've ever played. You build up a settlement and things attack you. Not to mention you have to keep up with how much food you are producing. (you can do much more, I'm just bad at explaining it.) As any game, its not without faults. Here's a list of bugs Ive encountered while playing (This is still an alpha, however)-Footmen will continue to fight even when they are almost dead and you keep telling them to retreat.-Villagers often will stop constructing a building and never finish it.Most of these bugs force you to restart your village.A lot of the bugs I griped about are now fixed, so GG dev team!Also speaking of buildings, the current building tools are difficult m as you can only make simple structures. The visuals are limited too, as you can only use  one or two material types and colors for each section (Except roads and floors). It's not necessarily user friendly, but some pretty cool stuff can be madeCriticism aside, it's a wonderful game. I do believe it is worth the money			"

								This is a beautiful voxel sandbox sim, inspired by dwarf fortress. In its present state it has a good portion of the core features implemented, but it is far from finished. It is very playable, but like other early access titles it does succumb from bugs and glitches. However the Devs are consistantly finding and squashing bugs. This game is updated regularly and the Devs are very open about where the game is at and what is being worked on for each new update (except for a few suprises here and there). This is a fantastic game with a great concept, and if you don't mind an early access with a bug or two its definately worth checking out.I backed this title on kickstarter and have been following its progress ever since. It has been steadily improving bit by bit and its amazing to see how far its come. The Dev's have been amazing and have provided a real treat with regular twitch streams showing them working on various parts of the game, allowing the community that has grown around them to get a real good look at what goes into making this game and sometimes having a profound impact in the games evolution.

								For all potential buyers:This game is very fun and the art style is really awesome. It's like the best of everything from all the pseudo pixel-graphics titles being released so frequently now. I enjoyed playing this game, for an hour or so. The game has a lot of good concepts, but nothing seems even partially fleshed-out. I understand that it is an early access game, but still. Charging $20 for a a game that you can experience everything in within 4-5 hours of gameplay is criminal, in my opinion. While I was watching some of the video reviews/let's plays, I saw that the characters don't have any sort of customization. They have no outfits, you can't assign them to a bed and decide where each one lives. This is fine with me, but I figured it was a trade-off for a more in-depth crafting system and/or building system. However, I was disappointed to find out that this was NOT the case. The crafting is very surface-level(and extremely annoying to level). The buildings have very little functionality other than to make your villagers do what they already do, better. Overall, the experience was a bit underwhelming. It was too much of a simulator(and not even a good simulator at that) and not enough of an interactive city-builder, like I thought it would be. I actually bought this game because I played Cities: Skylines and felt that too much based on the simulation and less based around fun, but in the end, this game left with a similar feeling.TLDR: Fun game. Cool art. No depth. Very little content. If I could reccomend a couple things to the developers: -Add more character customization. Instead of trying to build more into the ""job tree"", give each person with that profession a separate talent tree that gives each character some identity and gives you a reason to have more than one of them other than just that their job isn't being taken care of. -Add more functionality to buildings.-Increase villager cap and allow for more space to build on and allow towns to be converted into cities. -Add more tutorial information. Almost all of the stuff I had to learn how to do, was learned via videos. The tutorials taught me very little about how to play the game.P.S. I will be keeping an eye on this game with high hopes that it will be improved in future.			"

 Cute City Management Game The game is just cute and relaxing, allowing you to choose from ""Normal"" Or ""Sandbox"" mode, it is sure to fit for casual gamers who just want to craft and enjoy the game or peoples who want a little challenge from random enemy spawns.The game on its state seems to have lot of potential in growing further, but it still offers a wide variety of things to do to keep the game going for hours.Good: Solid Gameplay (Its super easy to learn and get into the game) Cute Long lifetime (Keeps you playing for hours) Relaxing Nice musicBad: Minor unbalance issues (easy to make money by selling items) Error messages/bugsIn all of its glory, the game is really worth the money and when all the bugs gets sorter out and updates have been made, its going to be even better.I can higly recommend it even now on its ""Early Access"" state.

								On its way to becoming a great game, but what game that is exactly remains to be seen.What's in the game now, is playable and fun, but also fairly bare-bones.  A lot of essential features are still missing. Being unable to tear down anything you've built being the big one. But there is a solid foundation and a lot of promise for the future and the devs are great at instilling confidence that they'll get there.Currently the game seems a bit torn between macro and micro management. The devs are constantly struggling with how much they want the game to ""play itself"". You can quickly and easily design custom buildings or plop down existing ones from templates. Farms are plotted out and then self-sufficient. But then you have to go in and tell your carpenter exactly how many beds, doors, chairs, fense posts, etc to make for the buildings you're planning.  Most of the game so far is ""set and forget"" but then you have to keep a close eye on your crafters to keep them producing what you need.  I could do without that part myself. I'd rather be the city planner than micro-manage the supply chain.Combat is very basic right now. You have guards you can make better gear for, and set areas to patrol or attack but you have no direct control over them. It's more about ""were you prepared ahead of time"" than skill or micro-management.  This approach could work I think but there needs to be a lot more to it. Hopefully new additions like ranged combat that are being worked on will do just that.  If not, I think they might do well to have combat be the one area they allow micro management to play a key role in player engagement.One thing is for sure, Team Radiant is handling the game's development very well. Communication is definitely one of their strong points. The community is always in the loop and updates are consistent and substantial. Bugs are common but generally fixed quickly.  I get the impression development has gone substantially slower than they initially anticipated but their commitment to see it through is rock solid.The game seems destined to be good at the very least, so it's an easy recommendation. It just remains to be seen if Radiant has the design chops and polish in them to make it great.			"

								Awesome little city builder with a pretty good system for constructing your own buildingsits one of those games that gives your AI villagers decent autonomy, so you dont really have to micromanage them.the devs are active and as time goes on, ive noticed my little noobs can build more complex structures without bailing half-way through the construction.there are still a few minor issues, but two main ones that ive encountered pretty consistently:- its still difficult, if not impossible, to delete a building design once youve started it, and once youve started the design, its there for good. so if you try to design a building in the middle of town, but mess up on like one of the walls, your better off restarting the game from your most recent save. itll be quicker and actually work, rather than trying to undo what youve done. And sometimes scaffolding will remain forever because your little nubs think theyve completed a building when in fact they have not even come close to it. so the design/construction system def still needs some work.- youll start to run into issues once your little village has a couple dozen citizens. everything will start to slow down simply because of the complexity and demand on your little nooblets. that being said, the devs have been great and every update seems to fix a little bit more. my village can last nearly twice as long without me getting fed up with a stuttering population! so yea, id recommend it but only for like $20 max. wait for a sale, unless you want to support an early access game with active devs ;)10/10 critters stuck on the roof			"

								I don't think people understand the point of early access.If you wan't a complete bug free game don't buy this.Otherwise, If you like town builders... Well come on in, sit down, shut up and enjoy the ride. HOWEVER...I have been with this game since it's first playable release... wait... sorry since it's second playable, you get it.It is charming, and rewarding. You build up each and every buiding as well as Hearthlings (your villagers) for better or for worse. Each Hearthling can be given a job (Blacksmith, Carpenter, Hunter. ect. ect.) and based on some seemingly random stats, they will preform well or just level really slow.  When you have enough food/shelter/wealth - more villagers will start to join you (I swear they just  appear, no idea where they come from) Yes, they level to. They also die as well... which is why it is important to have someone with a sword handy at all times, otherwise the raiding goblins or night creatures... will end the town abruptly. Merchants, mining, farming all that good stuff with many many more features that will be implimented down the road thanks to their successful kickstarter.Now enough fanboying... is this game really worth the purchase? yes. Is it worth it in it's current stat? Sure, and I would recommend buying it LATER if you don't want to deal with small and some major bugs. But if you really understand what the concept of early access means and you aren't a child with mommy and daddy's credit card, then go ahead! Support the devs and then go to their forums to post any bugs you find! Then we can get through this a bit faster to release.BTW to my friend's reading this... get this, there will be co-op and PvP later.			"

								Amazing game, cute characters, nice graphics, bugs everywhere. For being an early access game I say it's great. The devs do a good job updating the game regularly which makes me want to play again and again, sadly I can't keep playing with the same town for long because the game either takes a lot of RAM slowing everything down, or the building system would stop working in the middle of designing a custom building and delete what I've created. Sometimes the farmers won't farm, instead they haul other items letting my crops to rot. I play mostly this game on peaceful because it's relaxing, also there's no monsters jumping at you every minute or so. Enemies should have a spawn area farther away from the settlement because they can appear besides houses or inside the mines which sometimes is annoying. BUT STILL I RECOMMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE ITS FRICKING AWESOME, and cute, really cute.			"

								So, I played the game during 13 hours and ended with 13 hearthlings, 5 sheeps and one pet fox (and a hecking huge amount of everything, especially food). After 13 hours, I started to feel like I did everything. But the game is in EA, and is really good at this point. I highly reccomend it to every city-builder/town-manager fan, but be prepared ! The bug windows will drive you nuts ! At first you'll be softhearted because it's an alpha, it needs time... But those red windows spam so often it quickly becomes unbearable ! I wish there was an option to disable them... We don't understand why they appear anyway...Other bugs to repport : - some scaffoldings stay for ever, same for some ladders- road placing is an easy way to get a red windows party (it's soooo bugged)- some items tend to desapear... - Probably more but minor			"

								The best description I can give for this game is that it is like Minecraft if you controlled an entire town.This is a fun game at first, but I don't recommend it right now because the game is far too content light for the price they are asking. The devs are also slow to add content to the game, so their support for this game is quesionable give how long this game has been in early access. Also, the UI can be clunky in places and your townsfolk while mining can trap themselves and die. The game tries to notify you when they're about to die, but it's usually too late. I think they should be able to build ladders themselves and get out of the mine without having to send one of your other people over to build a ladder to get them out. Also, your townspeople will literally work themselves to death if ask them to carry something back to your town from too far away. It seems like these people could say something like ""I'm not strong enough to that"" to prevent accidental deaths or a UI indicator of how far they can go out to carry stuff back without dying. These kind of things are very annoying but you can get new villagers to replace them fairly quickly at least.You can make buildings for your townsfolk, but I don't see a point to it other than you like to build things. There is no weather cycles or seasons yet and the towns folk have no issue with sleeping in beds outdoors and eating outdoors. Buildings take a long time to build and they don't seem to be worth this investment in survival mode. Walls are okay, but monsters tend to bust down your gates rather quickly. The maps are very wide open in places, so the option to build bigger wall sections would be nice.The classes your villagers can become are cool (there's about 10 or so), but there really isn't a lot they can do and many items are there just for cosmetics. Some classes feel much more fleshed out than others currently. I think this feature will be great once it's finished.Still, the game has a lot of charm and I had fun with it while it lasted, but the game in no way feels finished, so buyer beware, it may be a while before this game is done!

Early Access Review
								What if Age of Empires, The Sims, and Minecraft had a baby? Look no farther for the proverbial answer, my dear reader, this is that game. Stonehearth could be easily dismissed among the ocean of voxel sandbox titles. Upon seeing a few screenshots, I had initially confused it with Cube World, a defunct adventure game that died after its foray into early access alpha a few years ago. Games that employ this simplistic art style are a dime a dozen nowadays... however, Cube World this is not. The premise is as follows: make a village and survive against invaders, mine and collect resources, slay bosses, and construct buildings. You are given a starting set of ""Hearthlings"" (think 'Sims') and can name them, assign them classes based on their strengths, build them homes and view their thoughts through the town journal. Naming them after real people made me feel more invested and attached to them. I'm really excited to see if they'll add more procedural interactivity between Hearthlings in the future because there's a very solid base for a great role playing sim here.From the moment I started making my first village, it was clear that Stonehearth is very different -- for better and for worse. Because there aren't other games quite like this out there, there's somewhat of a learning curve. There are different camera views, zoning tools, a custom building mode, mining/gathering/looting modes, managing classes, placing items... it's all quite confusing and somewhat daunting at first. I think I accidentally skipped the tutorial when changing the game settings to fullscreen (it made me restart the game and the tutorial was nowhere to be found).After becoming mostly aquainted with the systems, I began to appreciate how there are some wicked smart minds working on this game. The custom building tool -- while clearly an alpha product due to general wonkiness and a surprising pechant for not letting you delete misplaced things -- is surprisingly robust. It's pretty clear that their goal is ""If you can imagine it, you can build it."" It isn't as time consuming as Minecraft to make a fully custom house, as you can lay the floorplans and everything can be queued up for you, and soon enough you'll watch your little Hearthlings get to work building your masterpieces. On the fastest speed setting (which can only be enabled in the settings), it feels like watching a time lapse. Very fun to see them work.In my experience, I'm left believing that the AI runs on magic. I have no idea how they managed to program pathing, gathering, build-queuing this good... all while running quite well on my 6 years old system. Your workers will always be productive getting done the chores and tasks you've set up for them to do. Of course, they'll stop and tend to their needs from time to time (which only includes taking a lunch break and sleeping... we don't have room for lazy slaves in this kingdom).The team have laid out their broad goals for 2017, which sounds refinement heavy. I've been impressed with their progress thus-far, and updates are frequent.If you have interest in this game: stop hesitating. Once it gets multiplayer in 2018 (my prediction based on their roadmap), this game is going to get a serious cult following. Very impressive alpha.			"

								Started this game up around 10 PM, ended up playing it all night t'ill 4 AM. This game is very addictive. Think of it as Minecraft, but now you get to control all the miners in the game and set up tasks for them to do. From building hoses to making tunnels it gets very addictive.Only thing I don't like is the progression ladder. To make a blacksmith you need a carpenter, to make a mason hammer to then make a blacksmith hammer at lvl 3. It takes a while to move up the progression ladder and can get a little frustrating setting up the basic professions. Also at this time there are lots of bugs that get your players stuck but there are console commands to move them out when it happens. In the 5 hours I've played I encountered maybe 6-8 bugs/glitches so just a fair warning it is still in alpha, BUT playable. "

								It's a good game that is starting to have enought features to keep the game challenging and fun, as well as replayable. Lots to do in the game with your people management.It has a few things that it needs to work out. There is a strangely sharp dificulty curve when you get to mid-game when the enemies go from trivial to world endingly strong with no middle step. Would be nice to have the game scale better.I would also like to see a dual class system for the people in some fassion.I would also like to see other villages. For example: an enemy village that can be ally, neutral, or eventually and enemy village that are not goblins. I think it would be interesting to have more variety of enemies/difficulties.TLDR?Fun game about building a village and fighting off monsters. More features and ballancing needed, but currently fun and replayable.Cheers			"

								Stonehearth is a (very) cute 3D version of town-building games like Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria, where you must build a thriving settlement whilst fending off invasions and the like. Like Minecraft though, it has the option to play in peaceful mode for those who wish to just focus on the construction side of the game.It should be emphasised that the game IS still in its alpha stages - that means there's only a limited amount of content in it at the moment. To be sure, there's plenty more to come, but this is definitely *early* access. That aside, it's definitely very enjoyable, and the building editor and the like allows for very complex structures to be built already, and a single game can happily last for a few hours before you've reduced the goblins & undead to little more than nuisances.

The dev team is extremely receptive to feedback from players and maintain regular contact with their fanbase as well as transparency. When this game was first released, it was very buggy--as to be expected in alpha. And while bugs still remain, the foundation is becoming quite solid and gamebreaking bugs more and more rare. Stonehearth is beginning to take shape into the epic and memorable game it was designed to be, and the love and dedication of this team of devs really shows.Although it is Early Access, I feel like it's one of the better EA titles out there, and I strongly urge those interested to buy it and show support.

Im looking forward to every update the devs spit out - and the Alpha 11 seems VERY promising! :) I do need some way to control the Heartlings, like ""Go to"" and ""Priority on this job"". Stuff like that. That being said, this game gets a huge thumbs up - and I cant wait for the next updates!			"

								I love stonehearth and got it before even alpha 13! I recommend this game for all but I would like to note one issue for the developers. I can NO LONGER LAUNCH THE GAME. Io pathing error. Though this has said to only be a problem on my end as my friends were able to play, just not me. I would love assistance with this, but neverless, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!			"

								TL;DRA great Village building game with mechanics similar to Minecraft, Banished and Dwarf Fortress. Well worth the money asked. Developers are HEAVILY involved in development and community relations, along with consistant and crisp graphics.The community of Stonehearth show how amazing this game is, and how much potential the developers have.---------Where do I start on this brilliant game? I've been watching this EA game since Alpha 2, and have finally decided to buy it. There are hundreds of pros and minimal cons. It is well worth the money asked for (you could wait until the summer sales heil gabeN) Or you can spend it right now!Pros:- The DevelopersThe developers are heavily community focused, implenting features people think would suit the game, as well as fixing game breaking bugs that are encountered. They do frequent updates (Around one every few weeks) and keep the community informed with ""Desktop Tuesdays"" where they show off new features being implented- Beutiful GraphicsI don't often judge a game by it's graphics. But this is an amazing exception. The graphics are smooth, clear, and crisp, it often reminds me of Minecraft (minus the 16 bit textures) due to its simplicity. The graphics are consistent, and don't randomly change with updates.- The CommunityThe community is very well knit, and are welcoming of new players. You can often find them helping new players settle in to the world of Stonehearth, and help solve problems with bug fixes.Cons- CrashesLike most EA games, there are lots of crashes, there are a few crashes here and there, but if you remembered to save, you're in luck, they've recently added an autosave feature, which is absolutely brilliant, to make up for these crashes. They can be often caused by new features (the 64 bit update) - Steep learning curveLike Banished, it's going to take A LOT of tries to hit the ground running, but after learning why and where you went wrong, it gets a lot easier (my current ""village"" is on 40 hearthlings) and eventually you will end up with a small town.- AIThe AI in this game can be, at times, tedious, often when you mark a place to be deforested, they cut it down, but refuse to transport it to a stockpile (knowing me this will be the problem on my end), but eventually they get around to it.CONCLUSIONI believe that this game has a HUGE potential, and that the developers are prime examples of what should be the norm in the game industry (I'm looking at you EA) The community is one of the huge aspects of this game, there is some mod support, but sadly most are either broken or outdated. This game is well worth the £19 asked, with many features still to come.			"

								Currently in Alpha 11, StoneHearth shows promise. This said, It is in  ALPHA, and there is bound to be glitches. There is a pluthera of content, easy to learn controls, A cute and innocent atmosphere, and other appealing aspects. But, If you are playing the game for around a hour, without pausing and saving, the HUD will dissappear, and you cannot pause and save, making the only move you can make hitting the red X in the top right corner. It is a great game, but an autosave feature would be greatly beneficial.			"

								An awesome game that is coming along nicely. There are still some bugs but the dev team seems to be constantly at it and putting out updates.

								I know this game is still in developement, don't blow a gasket reading this.Most of the bugs I've gotten used to, but HOLY MOTHER OF GOD PLEASE OPTIMIZE your system. I can play GTA IV, V, Skyrim, Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout III & IV on my PC, but this game usually slows down and eventually crashes most times, and I only use the lowest graphics settings.It IS a satisfying game if you can run it, but I would not personally recommend this until its official non-experimental release.

								Add more minerals, that can be crafted into items, and used in trading and equippment, also some differnet types of weapons would be appreciated, like a bow, crafted by the carpenter lvl 3, a long bow, crafted by the carpenter lvl 6, a crossbow, crafted by a blacksmith lvl 5 or 6, maybe add muskets eventually, they could be crafted by a gunsmith, or blacksmith, the gunsmith could also craft turrents that could be placed and manned by some of your people, like catapults, very unaccurate but do moderate damage, and a cannon, very expensive to build and a lot of damge, moderate accuracy, and add some more variety of crops, like cucumbers, potatoes, beans, squash, u know a small variety, and of course bacon/pigs, beef,cows, and maybe you could add hourses, they could be ridden by soldiers, or put to work on a farm, give them a plow and the farmer can seed and plow alot faster. oh and add fishing, with small boats that can float along lakes, that way the rivers are at least useful.

								An entertaining, calming, slow-paced little village manager. I have fun with it when I play it (rare as that may be). However, development has been extremely slow. Gameplay promises from two years ago have still not been fulfilled. It's riddled with game-breaking bugs. Once you start a new game, it's only a matter of time before something goes wrong that you can't just ignore or build around. In its current state, it's nothing more than an expensive time waster. Currently, the game is definitely not worth the price they're asking, so I unfortunately cannot recommend it despite the moderate amount of fun that can be had with it. Grab it if it's on sale for 50% off or more.			"

								I would like to talk about the development cycle of this game being that it is in early access. I backed the game for $30 USD in April 2013 on Kickstarter, while the project timelines of the original crowd funding were not met, the transparency and progress on the game by the developers at Radiant Entertainment have always been thoroughly communicated.Despite original project timelines not being met, the team has continued to grow and be staffed were needed, which in my opinion demonstrates sound management on the part of team. This is not a pick up and run with your money type of project. Updates are provided consistently and feedback is incorporated via the games blog, forum, trello roadmap, and Tom and Tony's tri-weekly twitch development streams.Radiant Entertainment was founded by evo2k (the fighting game tournament) and shoryuken.com, founders Tony and Tom Cannon, who had years of working at vmware before venturing on this project. Tony Cannon also wrote netcode middleware GGPO, which was a turning point for online play in the fighting game genre.  I backed the game because of their history, these two have remained accountable and have earned the FGCs trust having been a cornerstone of the community.To conclude, the development of this game two years after its successful crowdfunding campaign continues to demonstrate a level of accountability and trust that is among the best of early access games.

								I've been playing the alpha since about 4 or 5.In terms of the gameplay and potential....it's great. Basically what I had hoped Castle Story would be.  It has a long way to go, but it's organized and consistently improving. The Devs may not be the fastest, but they're /far/ from the slowest. Best of all, there's been an exponential curve in development and things have been picking up pace without major missteps.  The roadmap has held up and progress makes sense.  Dev isn't as fast as weekly content additions, but I have complete faith in the management of this team and the game seems deep and well-thought out...modding potential should be epic.			"

								Insanely buggy but insanely fun. This game is mostly about building a gigantic city and surviving onslaught of increasingly difficult waves of ennemies.Sadly 90% (not even joking) of the custom buildings I design cannot be built by my hearthlings due to poor AI code, and combat commands are wonky.The rest of the game is still well fleshed out and you can work out the building problem above with the console.This game is going to be solid when it gets out of early access!

								A good rounded game that gets recommendation because of how good it will be when finished. You can easily sink 10 hours into the game before even beginning to reach the point when you'll run out of things to do. Right now the game has very frustrating bugs and gameplay progress issues that stunt long term gameplay. But i still think anyone interested in the game or the genre should buy it now. It is good enough to play and it's fun watching the game progress, with regular alpha updates and close communicastion between the devs and community. If you have any doubts just check out the subreddit r/stonehearth to see the very active community.Considering there are less than 10 devs working on it the project is moving forward very fast to the point you can keep up with almost daily updates and watch the game progress. Join the movement now it is definitely worth it :)			"

								In essence a dumbed down Dwarf Fortress with goals. And, to be fair it does it very well. The progression system in which you have to level up your villagers in order to give them tier 2 jobs keeps you engaged, as does the ability to get goods from traders in order to complete quests.Certainly worth the money but buyer beware! It's early access and alpha. Game is reasonably stable but locking and memory leaks are common. Don't buy unless you're willing to accept these in this unfinished state.Some current bugs are very annoying. Building not getting finish even though you have all the construction elemnets, down in some case 1 single window. Also some quests rely on certain items which you have to buy and traders never have any (or in my case 3 sunflowers when you need 4. And in 15 hours of play no one turns up with the forth!).Overall it'll be a great game when it's out of alpha and patched up.			"

								I have preordered and bought into a variety of different early access games, and Stonehearth is the one of the first few where I feel like I got my money's worth, or at least, will. Though there is currently not much content, I have been quite content (see what I did there) with the game's current state and the direction it is going in. The game has a fantastic community and set of developers that are all intent on making this the best it can be.Now, to the actual game:It is a townbuilding game, like dwarf fortress or towns, with combat elements, random scenarios, specialized workers, mining mechanics, and, of course, housebuilding. I must also say that this game can be very relaxing thanks to its laid back theme and fitting music.Because of it's early state, there are a variety of hilarious but also game breaking bugs. If you are easily frustrated by bugs and do not want to deal with bugs, I would recommend waiting until later to get the game.I must also state that this game opened to steam early access on my birthday, so I am only slightly (completely) biased. Nonetheless, it looks like it will grow into a great game!			"

								I want to love this game. I want to play it forever and build forever, but I am pretty frustrated overall with the quality. It doesn't seem to be getting any better over time and the same annoying flaws keep popping up. Removing a building almost never works if the workers get other order in the meantime. I'm not sure how the workers decide what work to do when, but their whole scheduling mechanism needs a ton of work. Likewise, if a building recievs orders, especially ones that contradict previous orders, the newer orders should take precidence, such that I won't be constantly stuck with half-complete building that I cannot force workers to finish nor remove...Likewise the whole grid-selection mechanism is clunky and hard to use. I'd like more control over the selection, and maybe be able to edit and confirm it before workers start digging a tunnel straight down and getting themselves stuck.			"

								Up's:- Great gameplay. An unusual kind of strategy, but lots of fun.- That cubic look. Graphics and shaders are well done.- Aspiring for early accessDown's:- Gets boring quick-ish. It content-caps after a while. (personal opinion - there's a large creative aspect of the game)- Combat + Turrets. While combat looks nice, managing your soldiers could use some love. Turret caps is a nice feature, but could do without. (might change - gameplay feature)- Increasingly processing intensive. When you play for a while, and start getting a few villagers, it laggs more. (might get tweaked - not for low end pc's)- Pathfinding is edgy (will probably get tweaked)- AI could do with some love (will probably get tweaked)- Lots of bugs (will most likely get tweaked)Overall: Nice work for early access - Definitely wort the money, or it will be.

								TL;DR1. Open and honest Dev team2. Game is genuinly fun3. Endless possibilities for its finished potential4. Mod support is a thingI have been a supporter of this game since the kickstarter campaign. It has gone through some very rough, very unpolished builds (seeing as this is currently in alpha 11), but the progress is constant. Each update comes in a timely manner and each one is noteworthy. The devs are open and honest about who is doing what and when things are likely to happen. If there is a setback they will tell you. This in of itself is a massive selling point for this game, just look at the mess that is Godus for a comparison. Regarding the game itself, its what I always wanted in a voxel style game; the freedom to create a city/kingdom from the ground up with my own unique band of citizens.Building is fun; you can follow a few set blueprints or make your own from scratch. As the game develops you will eventually be able to make massive castles, but for the current version as of june 2015 multi-story buildings are the new thing.Combat and resource gathering are about what you would expect, but agian this game is in its early stages and will become deeper as builds go on. Some of the stretch goals filled include elemental enemies and several magic using classes of hearthling. It is still in its early stages, but with the team behind it I am confident the potential will be realised. Another commendation to the dev team behind this game is that from the outset they have encouraged modding. In the future I would not be surprised if the modding community embraced this game like they do bethesda games. In closing, its a great game with a great team behind it and its only going to get better as it develops. Grab it now and become part of the community and help the devs out, because you will be hearing about this game in the future, and you will want it then anyway. Happy hearthing.			"

								=HEADS UP=Early Access Review. The game is not finished yet but still worth the price.=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=1. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]=REVIEW=First i just have to say how happy i am that this game finally hits Steam. It was on Greenlight for a while and now finally it is on Steam. I have gotten the game before over kickstarter and i am just going to say that i usually dont get things over kickstarter. For me kickstarter was always a big risk and i never wanted to take that risk. But with this game it was completly different. The cute style and the idea behind it made it to something i just wanted to have.The game overall is a normal little Building/Survival Sim. You have a certain amount of Settlers when you begin and start with nothing but a fire and a Townsflag. Over the time you build up your village and go up the steps towards a city. Mining, Smithing, Farming and even Fighting is already included in this and makes the whole experience already alot better than it looks on the pictures, even though they look quite good. (<3)I cannot say how much i love this litte piece of art. This is one of those games where the devs really sit behind their game. And i am not saying this just like that. First before buying the game i had a chat with one of the Devs and i gotta say that i enjoyed it. After buying it i found a bug to submit and it got rid of right away with the next patch that came a few days after the report.This game has a big future. Please whoever reads this: Be part of this future because i am sure that you will love it!			"

								The game in it's current state is pretty glitchy but it has a dedicated and EXTREMELY involved staff. It's important to take into account this is an ALPHA version of the game which means they've been trying to get an MVP (minimum viable product) before they can take the time to apply all that finished-feeling polish. I'm extremely happy with where the game is at now and even more excited to see where it is going.Just a small tidbit--I have the first version they ever released on my computer which was really just a glitchy demo that you could only sit and look at--it infact only opened up on one out of three computers. So amazing to see the product release by release! I recommend this game but only if you can look to the future :) Happy Stonehearthing			"

								""Great game!"" - 4/5This is a great game and I love playing it! Though as the towns get larger and you start getting more people a memory leak starts to occur and the game slowly becomes unplayable. Its not as though the game is laggy at all its more like as you play through the game you notice that some of the npc's dont do their job at all. You think that's werid... Normally I would restart my client and it would fix it for around 5 minutes but after that it would start to happen again. I feel like if you could fix that I would love to make a series on this game showing the expansion of a mighty kingdom!If you are looking to get this game I do recommend it as you can get some really good fun out of it!Thanks! ~Creative			"

								okay starting off with i ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. but there are some things in it that are so annoyingly painful i straight up quit due to lack of control. i understand the ai needs its own personality and the npc's need to do their own thing, but when i have to keep my hearthlings in my base with the alarm because whenever i take it off they want to run out into a goblin camp and loot that log of wood, even though i cancled tasks in that area, i dont get a choice in their decision, so 1 by 1 they run out to loot something random even with haul, mine, job, off they refuse to listen, and because they go out to loot, my 2 footmen with 1/4 health decided to back him up and they all drop dead. would really enjoy a ""no enter"" zone for your characters to avoid (or even better a no civ zone and a no anyone zone) i like where this game is heading, but the ai is to off on its own to make it a game worth playing anymore. i still recommend this game to people because i can see how good the potential is in it. hopefully things get sorted out. good luck			"

								This game is amazing. I usually don't spend a lot of time on town managment games, but I was surprised at how addictive this game is. the vox style really gives the game some charm, every charecter is important in some way or form, and it's really noticable. doing simple things like building doors or making improvments to buildings feels really accomplishing, and the game, even in it's dull moments, still keeps my eye.the onyl cons are: it runs on lua script, so once things start to get hectic, expect the game too go through some hiccups. there are a lot of bugs (early access, duh.) so don't expect the best user stability ever. the game also doesn't hold your hand, so you may have to go through some guides or figure out how things work on your own.this game has a lot of promise, and I would love to see it's full form.

								I actually wrote this, hoping to try and get some sort of suggestion out.. The game itself.. Is pretty nice, however.. You've got to admit that it has loads of flaws in it.. And one of them starts to shine through best when you try and play in hard mode. Makes it (almost) impossible to get off to a good start in that game mode, and will really start to have you wondering exactly how stupid your hearthlings are...Anyways.. the game needs some sort of way to prioritze things.. No.. I'm not meaning the little switches that say ""This person should do farm, while this person builds."" I'm meaning ""Hey you stupid piece of meat, go pick up that herb. RIGHT NOW so that I can make an Herbalist or a potion."" Without a way to give some sort of priority to what your hearthlings will gather.. Those who like to setup their villages to have a lot to do, won't usually have very much fun in hard mode.. If you try to plan too far ahead, the game will punish you greatly. As there doesn't seem to be a way to instruct your hearthlings to even drop all of their current queued projects.. And that is probably the most simple way to fix the issue.. It would suck to have to command your hearthlings to get back at it.. But It's better than having all of your starting hearthlings die, because you instructed them to build a house and they don't want to stop building that house to go get a herb until they're dead...For crying out loud.. I told them to go gather some wild herbs, and had a farmer working on growing some herbs, and he ALMOST finished growing the herbs by the time my gatherers brought the herb into town... But to my surprise, they STILL WOULDN'T GATHER IT!Either the AI need improved to recognize that a lack of items is bad, and make it so that getting items that are currently set at 0 is more important than carrying back the wood that you have 500 of or there needs to be a way to prioritize certain tasks.. Like by holding shift and telling them to gather this item.. They know that is more important to do than anything else.. Or even a way to over-ride it and say ""This needs to be done first."" Alternatively.. Like I said.. a way to tell your hearthlings to stop EVERYTHING. could work as well.Maybe some of this is already in the game and I'm just not seeing it.. But before a hard mode can really be explored too much, little simple things like this really need to be fixed.. Even if there is a way to clear all commands.. A priority system would go leagues and bounds beyond it.. and make the game feel more professional as well.			"

								Stonehearth is a fun micromanage city building game. While you are trying to grow there are raiders that while gradually grow in size. I have only been playing for a small amount of time but to me the game is extremelly entiretaning. I have only had a few problems with the game likeAfter being raided i could not pick up the wood or other items that they had picked up after i had killed themAfter mining for a while for some reason i could not gather any of the ore that i mined so now i just have a giant pile of iron ore that i can not even touch.There are some more problems but none are coming to my head. I do recomend to anybody who likes micrmanage city building game			"

								--- Recently suspended any updates due to saves being corrupted out of nothing. No saves = no testing, no gameplay --- Like I said before: I would seriously recommend this. I WOULD. True potential, amazing animations and stuff, but we gotta look a little deeper. Now I say it's a 4/10. !!!!! BEFORE YOU BUY IT !!!!! Be warned the game is in TOTAL ALPHA testing stage. You will certainly rage about many things over and over and over, so AVOID this if you have no patience to test stuff and bugs many times to report. PROS: - Graphics are simple yet very enjoyable.- Nice AI + villager-villager interactions.- Mobs and NPCs' behavior are nice. - Fluid animations add game depth.- Simple UI.- Editor saves your designs and store your last underway building (so you may build things at your pace and finish whenever you like).- Game currency and trading well balanced, to the moment.- NPCs kinda well balanced, to the moment. CONS: - Game needed specs are way too high for a game that simple, due to tech problems involving RAM usage and data processing. Some players reported a 4 Gb+ RAM usage plus game slowdowns even on high end PCs.- Villagers will most times ignore their priorities to do something else, socialize or being idle, even if they're satisfied. In some cases you can't reverse it.- Buildings may be abandoned with no given cause or solution. Also, they may get stuck under construction if you move something into the building site... Plus, if you move eg. a bed (previously placed outside somewhere) 4 times inside that site, it adds 4 ""ghosts"" of that item into the project.- Poor editor, to the moment. You can't edit a building or update it except for it's furniture (when they finish building it, if you don't wanna bug the whole thing) anytime in the future and it kinda kills the feeling of customizing everything the way you want, when you want.- The simplest HUD possible taking too long to load. CRITICAL: - RAM usage needs some SERIOUS optimization. Easily going above 2.5 Gb RAM usage and I capped 18 villagers, got 4 really small buildings, a empty tunnel project and containers instead of zones.- As well as RAM usage, rendering and in-game elements need some optimization. Got the lowest settings possible, no heavy-weight background processes simultaneously running, yet it's taking less than 45 min to go up to 2.5 Gb.- Minimizing and restoring the game on fullscreen settings may cause flickering/visual glitches.- UI more likely to crash if the RAM usage goes above 2 Gb. Got this issue 2 times in a row, had to force close it. It does not recover ou rerun after crashing.- Stonehearth.exe process is strongly persistent and task manager will sometimes take a while to kill it if you force closed before.**NEW** - UI may bug and won't load for ♥♥♥♥ if you try to load a game saved while using slice or x-ray. Tried to load another game without slicing and it's working; went right back to the previous sliced one and it's still stuck. **NEW** - Saves w/ tunnels corrupting without a reason, even when saving out of slicing or x-ray. SUGGESTIONS / PROBLEM SOLVING / ASAP PLS: - Update that ugly chroma box we use to call world by replacing base grass/ground textures. There's no need to actually add global grass as it may drop performance, but just add markings or updated base textures. Worlds seems kinda dead right know... It hurts.**ASAP** - Maybe an option to preload the UI or customizing it, I don't know. It feels heavy and non-responsive af. Now crashing on loaded games and it won't recover.- Black mask + dynamic fog of war. Takes away the eternal sight we got on explored grounds and gives a greater need to explore, a feel that you gotta scout villagers to ensure safe looting, and more.- Random player spawning site, at least at Normal and Hard modes. Throwing the player into the unknown may solve initial high RAM usage while greatly increasing game depth.- Add some options to the editor, such as: i. remove items from a building project (specially furniture); ii. update a building's structure anytime, as no building is perpectual.- Direct single villager command. There's no better feeling than issuing an order and watching things being done properly when the AI gets too lazy. ""Do something there"" instead of ""move there"", tho.- More frequent mob nests. Well, maybe specific spawning sites for mob nests (none that I have clearly noticed) and the ability for the wild AI to expand their territory as players do.- Foreign cities, ruins, dungeons. Bigger optimized maps full o' things to do. A MUST!!- Range preview when issuing a villager to move an item somewhere. I got the feel that certain items are too heavy to be moved long distances at a time (eg. large crates 32/32) and that's great, but maybe showing us the limits would make things even better.-----Gotta play some more to confirm other game needs. Reporting and updating anytime soon.Glad to help if devs need it. =D [[ Hints on ""smooth"" running settings ]] Vertical Sync OFF // Windowed +- 1280x768 // Antialias OFF // Shadow Detail JUST A TOUCH (I'm keeping OFF) // Max Shadows 2 (I'm keeping OFF) // Max Lights 20 // Draw Distance 560 // Max Citizens 24 // Game Speed 3 OFF // Rayyas Children OFF (unless you wanna play with them) // Debug Tools OFF (I'm keeping ON.

								The dev team for this game are very good - the best ive seen for this genre of game. Development is promising, and the game itself is continually growing. I love this kind of game, however, in its current state, stonehearth is probably worth between $5 and $10.The game is very easy - I've so far been able to repel every attack, destroy every enemy base etc with two soldiers (I might have been overdoing it adding the second soldier, too!). Building is very bugged - I've had to cancel innumerable buildings as my villagers couldnt construct certain things or have gotten themselves stuck whilst trying. Being able to watch individual pieces on your building be placed by your citizens is cool but has lead to so many issues when actually performing this key functionality.Progression is basic and unfulfilling - you are a fully self-sustaining within 1-3 days of in-game time. Sure, this might not be a problem, as the game may intend to focus on thriving rather than surviving. However, thriving is impossible as the game cannot seem to handle having >12 citizens (at such numbers, you will see a lot of idling, and citizens with professions flat refusing to do their allocated job whilst there are other things to do - and no, the citizen management screen does not resolve these issues).Keep it on your watchlist, but unless you are looking for a very surface-level experience, steer clear until further down the development cycle.

								Stonehearth is a management sim where the goal is to create a thriving settlement. While it's a little feature-bare in it's current, in-development state, it's got a smart, minecrafty voxel system that lets you completely customize all elements of your settlement. The game also has decent performance and seems to be developed by a competent dev team. Which is, y'know, rare for a kickstartered early access game.It's also built to support modding! That's always good.			"

								If you are into city buidling games, farming,  creating your own army, job management, etc, this game does a very well job presenting the genre of city builders.  The art style has a very cartoonish feel, at the same time giving the game its own charm; style that cannont be replicated by any other city building games out on the market right now. There is a lot of flexibility on how you want to manage your new village/town/city/empire and however you want to play it. With the plethora amount of new villagers coming into your town, you will find that there are many jobs that you can assign each Hearlthing. Build your own army to fight off hordes of Goblins and other such monsters. Loot from your enemies after you slay them and use the resources to help further expand your empire. There are also a variety of landscapes and even races of humans you can choose from; even more hours to explore how you want to play. While the idea of all this sounds great on paper, Stonehearth manages to crumble all those dreams.  Yes you will have fun playing this game and yes you will enjoy the many hours playing this game. However, the one thing this game suffers greatly is the amount of bugs and gamebreaking bugs this game has. It gives Early Acess the perfect meaning of unfinished game, but somehow manages to make it even sound worse. The major bugs I have encounter mostly revolves around trying to build houses. More specifically customized buildings you try to build are very much broken and have been since the start of this game. Builders will continue to remove and build ladders to reach higher areas of the buidling, and be in an infinite loops doing this. Sometimes they will continue doing this until the building is destroyed or if you somehow make the AI build other buildings instead. Also you cannot destroy certain buildings, it doesn't even explain why it cannot be destroyed. It could also be because the way customizing your own building could be broken as hell.One of the most essential mechanic of this game is broken and that's where I draw the line. A game that focus primarily on creating buildings is broken. Instead of the developers trying to fix this, they release more updates on combat and focusing so much into that. It is quite sad actually, made me not want to play this game for a while. I even contacted the developers about this bug, and they know it exists, they just dont want to do anything about it for now. Many other players also complain about this same exact bug. The only answer they gave me is to use console and to type in commands to instant build and instant destroy. Using a game's console to play a game, to even enjoy it is quite appalling to even hear, but that is the ONLY way to play this game without ripping your hair out of your head.I've had a few problems with combat, but it mostly had to do with the Battle music playing in an infinite loop. Other than that the combat is fine and I have no problem with that. Farming, Smithing, Crafting, Etc. are all fine as well No problems there. StoneHearth is a great idea, I really really really really want to say this game is a Great game. I wish, but this game is not great, this game sucks, this game is garbage. this game needs hate rather than love to show the developers they need to change and fix their game. I always look at this game every week to see if there is an update, JUST MAYBE SOMEDAY THIS GAME WILL WORK PERFECT. Don't buy this game until the bugs are fixed, don't even recommend or even mention this game to anyone. This game has the potential being the New way of playing city builders. The Next grounbreaking sim city game, it has that potential, THE DEVELOPERS NEED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS GAME. I know this game has the potential to have a large following, just fix the game.			"

								First off let me say this: I DO recommend this game, because it's proof of consept is so grand, and it promises everything I have always wanted in a base-building game. That being said the price of $25 is a little steep for a game that is barely playable. I have put about 20 hours into it off steam, and will surely put more. If you are  reading this i am sure you understand the game is in ALPHA and is pretty buggy, however the devs are great at talking to their community and are squashing bugs constantly,There are several Game breaking bugs within the main mechanics that make it unplayable.The building UI is a great idea, however the coding isn't right on it yet, Walls not being build, crashing when creating a big building, hearthlings not building a roof for your house for virtualy no reason. there are ways to make buildings with multiple walls, but most of them are tedious, requiring manual wall building, planning and erasing to get the building to work right, that is if you game doesnt crash on wall building or just make it so that you can not plan buildings anymore without save scumming. Other than the bugs, there are features that are not present (some that they plan to add) that i belive are needed to round out the game and make it playable. I will list them here in hopes of Dev eyes and to establish discorse :D-Stairs (they have already said its on its way, but without them it is hard to make multiple floors, ladders are visualy unappealing and dont support multiple hearthling travel)-Manual Job Prioities (I wish that hauling wasn't a top prioities unless i set it as such)-Underground Walls and rooms (Though possible, it is tedious, anothering on their to-do list)-Better Mining Interface (Wish i could change all three tunnle dimentions)Those are some basic things that i am sure they will add, but without them currently it makes this more of a proof of concept than a game. Here is a list of some otherthings that i belive will make up for the lack of depth-Hearthling Personalities (Other than 3 stats, there is nothing that seperates one hearthling from another, making the game a bit shallow)-Diffrent Starting Zones/Biomes/Varity (These are already on the To-Do list, right now there is almost no varity in starting zones.)Really i had intentions for making this a long review and listing out everything i want to happen in this game in hopes of others seeing it and influencing the game, however it is just to soon to tell, they have so many good things planned for this including Multiplayer i only wish i didnt hear about this until it came out of early access, i yearn to play it everyday in its complete state. So should you buy it? Yes.... Support these great devs.			"

								If you like the idea of Dwarf Fortress, but could not get past the interface, this is the game for you. It's like a god game where you boss around a group of Minecraft players. You don't control your hearthlings individually, you simply direct them on what to do and they go and do it. The most control you have is in putting down a banner to tell a group of footmen to fight in a particular area (useful for invasions). Of course, you also tell them exactly where to mine, what trees to chop down, and what to build, you just don't control your workers to do this directly. Do well, and more hearthlings will join your mighty settlement. Do poorly, and your hearthlings will die by the crude sword of a goblin or die of starvation. It's a fully 3D voxel game in a randomly generated world where you mine, harvest, build, and conquer. The crafting system is still a work in progress, but there is a lot of stuff you can build, lots of upgrades for your workers and soldiers, and you can pretty much do whatever you like in the sandbox setting. Just look out for campaign events sent your way by the Game Master system (right now there's one campaign in three parts, but many, many more campaigns are coming). In addition to the campaigns are visits by travelers and traveling merchants you can deal with. These will give you some opportunities for trade that may benefit your settlement. Oh, and did I mention the game is extremely moddable? Oh yes, this is an indie game company that recognizes the value of their community, and wants to put the same tools in your hands that they use themselves to create content.Right now Stonehearth is in alpha, Alpha 10.5 as I type this. Please don't buy this game yet in Early Access if you can't handle some bugs, even game-breaking bugs. Don't get too attached to your settlements, either; your save game won't be compatible with the next alpha, and new alphas come fairly quickly. Radiant Entertainment is a fantastic company and they've been great about keeping players informed about what's going on, and fixing bugs pretty fast, but some of you may find the game unplayable at various times. If you're willing to help them test and submit useful bug reports, great. If you're coming here expecting a fully playable game hold off and wait for Stonehearth to get into beta, at least. You'll have a lot more fun then.According to their roadmap, about 90% of their custom core engine and technology is built. They're still about 70% on world generation, 60% on building tools, 50% on classes, 30% on the Game Master, and 20% on monsters and denizens. Multiplayer is coming too, but that's a long ways off. It's also worth noting that Mac and Linux versions are coming too, once they've got the core game finished.That said, Stonehearth has come a very long way in a short period of time.There are now 8 classes in the game in addition to the regular worker type class you get as the base. These include the Carpenter, Farmer, Weaver, Footman, Trapper, Shepherd, Mason, and Blacksmith. These provide the raw materials, and food your settlement needs, as well as the various tiers of crafted goods that allow you to advance up the tech tree of the game. Workers wearing a fancy set of clothes move quicker. Footmen with upgraded weaponry and armor are a lot better equipped to handle invasions of zombies, goblins, and wolves. And, of course, unless you want your hearthlings to live in a hole in the ground and sleep on the cold hard dirt, you'll want your carpenter building doors and windows for your houses, and your weaver can build nice curtains and make the cloth for your upgraded furniture like comfy beds. The mason will build stone walls and gates to keep invaders out or your shepherd's sheep in. Your crafters will of course build the tools necessary to upgrade your workers to advanced classes, as well. You can't have farmers without a carpenter to build wooden hoes. The interactions of these systems, combined with the need to manage your limited workforce, make the game complex and strategic. A lot of farmers means lots of food to attract new settlers to join your community, but not as many workers digging out tunnels to mine for valuable ores and increase the wealth your community has, wealth being another requirement for attracting new settlers.In terms of the rest of the game, the building and harvesting tools have come along very well since the earliest alphas. At this point you can actually play the game, and get pretty far, doing pretty much what you want. Want to build a gigantic fort with a moat? Yep, that's possible. Want to build a deep lair in a mountain, with the entrance looking like some kind of huge voxel head with flaming eyes at night? Yep, that's doable! Just carve away into that mountain. There is, as I mentioned, only one Game Master campaign at the moment, so each play-through will feel a bit repetitive, but they are still building the systems behind such things. Once these systems are in place, they will add a lot more Game Master content (and modders will be able to add their own campaigns as well).What I like best about this game is that you can really just play it however you like. The settlement I keep building each new alpha is very different from the settlements I see other people building. Technically the game is a sort of RPG/RTS/Roguelike, but at its core it's a sandbox game. It's a very fun sandbox to play in. While I would recommend this game to everyone, I wouldn't recommend you play this yet if you'll be bothered by pop-up error logs or if your game suddenly stops working and that settlement you spent hours building suddenly can't be played with anymore. These problems do happen. They've gotten a lot rarer since Alpha 1, but this is still an Early Access game in alpha, and you should only buy this now if you have a tolerance for bugs.			"

								Remeber this is in early access and is subject to changeI have been following this game for quite sometime, and what I have noticed is that the game devlopers really have a passion for the game and will listen to the community and then respond with positive feedback. The game is updated regularly and will hopefully by the end of the year make it into its beta state.For the gameplay it is in an alpha state where anything could change, but it will at the moment give you a few hours of gameplay, and if you super creative; it will give you countless hours. I would also recommend this game for people that enjoy strategy because the game is coming to a spot where what you choose to do at certain stages will effect your outcome of the game later on. Overall this is an amazing game for where it is at.I have really high hopes for the games and am looking forward to seeing what is to come of it8-9/10 for the regular updates and gameplay :)			"

								Stonehearth is a game that has a lot of sources of inspiration, most noticeably Dwarf Fortress, but also old RPGs like Final-Fantasy-Tactics. Stonehearth wears its inspirations on its sleeve but has its own unique charm and play style.Stonehearth is, as is described by its creators, ""a game about exploration and survival in an epic fantasy setting where your job is to help a small group of settlers survive and carve out a place for themselves in a hostile land"". In other words, your goal is to help a group of settlers (or ""hearthlings"" as they are called) to create a colony. You are the mind beyond the operation, you do not control your hearthling directly, you lay out the general plan (mine, build, etc) and your hearthlings commit your plans by themselves. There are also a few RPG elements in the game, like a job three, levels, stats and percs.Two things that i really like about the game are the art style and the emphasis on modding. The devs of the game have built their own game engine with emphasis on modding, which can only increase the lifespan of the game. The game has a really easy to use, and nice looking GUI. the animations are cute and i really like the character design. there is a lot of small things that makes the style of the game charming. The last thing i would like to mention is the awesome community that as been created around the game. since the kickstarter days the game has come a long way, the devs are active in the forums and are actively engaging with the community, they even stream the game development 3 days a week on twitch! All in all the game is very promising, and even though it is missing features it's very fun in is current state. it has a long way to go but I'm really hopeful for its future. if you like what you see give it a try!

								Stonehearth seems (even after about a year) very much still in the concept stage.  There's not much game here yet, but you can tell the devs are seriously devoted to making Stonehearth the best they can make it.  Even in this early stage you can tell it's the most charming, enjoyable 'concept' of a game out there (check my hours, and that's just through Steam).The devs work closely with the community every step of the way and are immediately responsive to most all bug reports and suggestions.The only caveat I can think of, is that it has been a long, long time getting to even where it is now, and it still has a long long way to go.  I do think it will get there and I have the utmost faith in the devs, but don't expect it in a mere few months.Your money invested here is not to have a fleshed out playable game today or tomorrow, but to help ensure the devs can make Stonehearth all it can be.  You won't have a game you can play day in and day out... just yet.. but it will happen and it will be wonderful.Edit:  I've changed my recommendation to NO for the time being.  There's just too little game here for the high price they're charging.  That high price was fine for kickstarter where you were investing, but now they're selling it on Steam and there just isn't much of a game here for that kind of money.  I also have concerns about how long development is taking.  Don't forget, this game has been in development for two years before it hit Steam early access. Over two years now and frankly, not much has happened for such a long dev cycle.  I honestly think the devs have gotten in over their heads and don't quite know how to dig themselves out of this hole.I'll happily change to Recommended when I see this game kick into high gear, but for now, it's 'wait and see'.Update:  I have to say after ANOTHER YEAR, the devs continue to dig themselve into a hole over their overly complicated approach to hearthling building process - to the detriment of the rest of the game.  The devs seem not to know they are fighting a loosing battle with the manual building process they've tried to implement.  A process so inherently complicated NASA couldn't figure it out.  But still they persist.I'm afraid the game will go nowhere now.  All the 'positive' reviews are based on just a few hours play time and ignore the deep-seated issue of a building process in the game that doesn't work.We could have had the nice rolling hills we were promised early on instead of the 'cliff' design we have now because it was easier.  If all the dev time was applied to landscape rather than this sink hole they've gotten themselves into with building, we'd have a glorious game by now.  And a finsished one.			"

								This game is on the road to success. I have been following this game since it was announced on Kickstarter and am very happy with where this game is going. The Developers are very committed to going the distance and listen to their fans 24/7,Now for the gameplay currently it has enough for you to get a basic Idea of what the game is. You will be able to design your own town however you want by gathering resources and deal with goblins, zombies, and Skeletons invading during the night. You will promote your workers (hearthlings) to gain more food or build certain items. Now I know that doesnt sound like much but getting to play with all the different types of layouts, buildings, and designs is enough fun to make you play for hours. Of course this game is not complete so you will find bugs which many of us players have been reporting in.We the players also have the important job of reporting bugs and telling the Developers what we would like to see next. We would love to have you join our community on the Stonehearth discourse website and hear what you would want to see or problems that you are having that should be fixed. The developers are working hard so the game will have big updates every 4-8 weeks which gives you a reason to keep coming back for more.			"

								I've been playing StoneHearth since the first alpha release, it's come a long way since then and with more core parts of the game being done it's coming even further even faster. Don't get me wrong, it's still lacking on a few fronts, content, performance and so on, but each alpha release is improving on that. If you're not here to support a game in an Early Access state, click the Follow button instead of Add To Cart. Wait a little longer then check back.At the moment it shows a hell of a lot of promise, moving forward it's going to get even better! and THAT is what i'm looking forward to.			"

								So Far I Love this Game. Dont Listen to others saying steep price for little content i dissagree completly anyone remember TITAN FALL, paid 60 for it and played the beta was hyped for it thinking great beta didnt realize that was the actual full game. Anyway this game is well done and being updated at a steady pace. For those who say it crashes there computer i dont know what they are running but mine is a amd build old build Phenom 955 3.2 Quad with a Nvidia GTX 560 ti 2gb DDR5 and 16gb DDR3 at 800mhz none of my build is overclocked and it runs the game on perfect settings. Yes bugs appear as you can see with any alpha game has not crashed yet though. I stream this game to Twitch and Put the Videos on Youtube so while streaming and uploading if it has not crashed my game yet then i say good work to them better than most triple AAA titles anymore. For a ALPHA GAME its fun and well worth the investment. Pick it up and Support the 3rd party DEVS that put their heart and soles into these titles.			"

								Thought I would buy this game and play it for 2 hours get bored a refund but instead i played it got hooked on it and cant stop playing it. Right now this game is like a 7/10 because yiou can play it for like 6 hours on one city before it gets boring  but in the future they are working on mulitiplayer and loads of other content so later i think it will be 10/10 no questions asked. But my advise would be buy it now so when more updates come out potentially increasing price you already have the game and dont need to pay more. This is an Idea of what they are working on: http://stonehearth.net/roadmap/ And this is the community suggestion page THAT THEY ACTUALY LISTEN TO unlike other games: https://trello.com/b/4XvM0SUd/stonehearth-community-roadmap "

								Oooooookay!!! Here is my review, I'm very torn over this game and its for this reason. BUGS. The game isn't ""broken"", even in pre-alpha. It is a very playable and fun game IF you can make it long enough without a UI or engine crash, Bear with me as this is kind of long, but very worth the read if you want an HONEST review of the product youre buying Pros:*SUPER FUN- Ive played many RPG's, RTS's, etc. but this game is one of the most mind numbingly addicting games I have ever played.*Complete Sandbox- Like Minecraft, but better.*Ranking Systems- Hearthlings rank up in their profession, giving them cool perks.*Versatility- Plotting out farmland, building houses around designated land, etc. You build YOUR town how YOU want. To a point at this stage in the game.*GEAR- I love love love the armor and weapon progression for your soldiers*Custom building- You arent stuck to templates, although they are provided. Cons:*BUGGY AF- Remember, it's still in alpha. However, nothing is more frustrating than getting so far into a game then recieving a pop-up ""UI Crash"" report. Seems to happen every hour. Villagers glitch into walls, they wander off miles just to collect random sh*t on the ground, usually dying in the process. They sit and DIE when being attacked. Guards don't wake up from sleep to respond to threats.... this is a big deal when invaders come at NIGHT only and all of your guards are sleeping. Needless to say, the bugs make the game frustrating as hell at times. Once, my entire village got stuck in defense mode, starving to death looking out for enemies that weren't there. *LACK OF EDITING- after or during building process. This is probably the single handedly most frustrating aspect of this game. If you design a massive, beautiful building, spend the time and resources to build it, then realize you fuzzed up, youre SOL. You have to tear down adn rebuild the entire thing, which can take the better half of an hour.  *Villagers forget/refuse to do assignments. Sometimes it is simply because they have a long checklist before they get to that particular assignment. However, many times, they will just stop building walls, digging caves, or collecting resources. And no matter how many times you remind them, they will sit there and do nothing instead.*Mining is sloppy. There is no realistic ability to build UP inside caverns, you have to always dig down.... which is annoying to say the least. *Lack of defensive features...This broke my heart. Sure you can build a mkaeshift stone wall. Sure you can build a really tall building and call it a guard tower, but in a game where you are attacked by zombies and skeletons every night, this game NEEDS operational wartime structures. Maybe a tower your guards actually post themselves in, or a palisade where an archer <--also much needed--> can be stationed. Especially when you go to war with the goblin chieftans, they attack, steal, and raid you every chance they get. It would be nice to see more organized troop and defense structures, as well as a more convienent way to get up to different floors of buildings. Overall, I still think this game is amazing. Please don't be turned off from my review. I refuse to sugar coat it for you. The price tag is too high to lie to you. HOWEVER, I stand by my opinion that this game is beautiful, the soundtrack is wonderful and overall this piece has some fantastic potential. I will continue to play this game, and I STRONGLY urge you to support the development of this game and buy it. The devs care, releasing updates and bug fixes periodically, Buggy? yes. Lacking? Barely, but yes. But its still in alpha!  My rating comes to an 8/10 in its current state! I think this can and will quickly be a game to watch though, as long as the community continues to support it.			"

								Early Access city building game that has all the main features: mining, harvesting and building. But you also have classes and the ability to create your own buildings and customise them and your town with extras.It was pretty buggy at first as you would expect and I didn't play it for quite a while, but now new features (desert biome, more classes, monsters) have been added and bugs are being busted in every update. This has made the game really enjoyable to play now. The art style is really great too. "

Early Access Review
								A very engaging city building title, Stonehearth offers many hours of fun. Being an early access title does mean that there will be issues, don't buy the game if this is a problem for you. If your are interested, but unsure just follow its development. That said the game is very fun. From my very first play through I played for 15 hours because I was so captivated by this game, bugs and all. The development team has done a very good job of weeding out said bugs. After my initial play, I too set the game aside with the intentions of returning once more progress was made with performance and gameplay. Well the devs came through! Many of the frustrating bugs I was dealing with have been fixed and on top of this many optimizations and features added. I am playing the current unstable branch (Alpah 14) at the time of writing this review. Irregardless, I was very happy to see that the team behind the game is very active unlike other titles I have bought. The game is very simple: manage and provide for your hearthlings and watch them and the villiage grow. This simplicity is nice, but there is more depth to be found if you just look. Town building is very fun and very customizable. There is a set pallete of default building schematics at the start, but with a little imagination and creativity there is much you can do with the tool to design your own buildings. Also modding is being actively encouraged for the game by the devs.Many of the negatives in some of the reviews have been addressed, atleast in the ""unstable branch,"" though that is not to stay new ones won't pop up. Again this is early access and with that in mind buyer beware. If you choose to buy this product look into it before doing so. In my short time so far with the game I have been impressed with the pace of development and the game itself. The forums for the game are active and the devs stream weekly on twitch, just check out their site. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to he future of the game because it does look very bright. If you're on the fence, do your research, watch lets plays and see if this is really something for you. If you enjoy city building this game is very fun and relaxing, just give yourself time to get acquainted.			"

Early Access Review
								If you like the idea of Dwarf Fortress, but could not get past the interface, this is the game for you. It's like a god game where you boss around a group of Minecraft players. You don't control your hearthlings individually, you simply direct them on what to do and they go and do it. The most control you have is in putting down a banner to tell a group of footmen to fight in a particular area (useful for invasions). Of course, you also tell them exactly where to mine, what trees to chop down, and what to build, you just don't control your workers to do this directly. Do well, and more hearthlings will join your mighty settlement. Do poorly, and your hearthlings will die by the crude sword of a goblin or die of starvation. It's a fully 3D voxel game in a randomly generated world where you mine, harvest, build, and conquer. The crafting system is still a work in progress, but there is a lot of stuff you can build, lots of upgrades for your workers and soldiers, and you can pretty much do whatever you like in the sandbox setting. Just look out for campaign events sent your way by the Game Master system (right now there's one campaign in three parts, but many, many more campaigns are coming). In addition to the campaigns are visits by travelers and traveling merchants you can deal with. These will give you some opportunities for trade that may benefit your settlement. Oh, and did I mention the game is extremely moddable? Oh yes, this is an indie game company that recognizes the value of their community, and wants to put the same tools in your hands that they use themselves to create content.Right now Stonehearth is in alpha, Alpha 10.5 as I type this. Please don't buy this game yet in Early Access if you can't handle some bugs, even game-breaking bugs. Don't get too attached to your settlements, either; your save game won't be compatible with the next alpha, and new alphas come fairly quickly. Radiant Entertainment is a fantastic company and they've been great about keeping players informed about what's going on, and fixing bugs pretty fast, but some of you may find the game unplayable at various times. If you're willing to help them test and submit useful bug reports, great. If you're coming here expecting a fully playable game hold off and wait for Stonehearth to get into beta, at least. You'll have a lot more fun then.According to their roadmap, about 90% of their custom core engine and technology is built. They're still about 70% on world generation, 60% on building tools, 50% on classes, 30% on the Game Master, and 20% on monsters and denizens. Multiplayer is coming too, but that's a long ways off. It's also worth noting that Mac and Linux versions are coming too, once they've got the core game finished.That said, Stonehearth has come a very long way in a short period of time.There are now 8 classes in the game in addition to the regular worker type class you get as the base. These include the Carpenter, Farmer, Weaver, Footman, Trapper, Shepherd, Mason, and Blacksmith. These provide the raw materials, and food your settlement needs, as well as the various tiers of crafted goods that allow you to advance up the tech tree of the game. Workers wearing a fancy set of clothes move quicker. Footmen with upgraded weaponry and armor are a lot better equipped to handle invasions of zombies, goblins, and wolves. And, of course, unless you want your hearthlings to live in a hole in the ground and sleep on the cold hard dirt, you'll want your carpenter building doors and windows for your houses, and your weaver can build nice curtains and make the cloth for your upgraded furniture like comfy beds. The mason will build stone walls and gates to keep invaders out or your shepherd's sheep in. Your crafters will of course build the tools necessary to upgrade your workers to advanced classes, as well. You can't have farmers without a carpenter to build wooden hoes. The interactions of these systems, combined with the need to manage your limited workforce, make the game complex and strategic. A lot of farmers means lots of food to attract new settlers to join your community, but not as many workers digging out tunnels to mine for valuable ores and increase the wealth your community has, wealth being another requirement for attracting new settlers.In terms of the rest of the game, the building and harvesting tools have come along very well since the earliest alphas. At this point you can actually play the game, and get pretty far, doing pretty much what you want. Want to build a gigantic fort with a moat? Yep, that's possible. Want to build a deep lair in a mountain, with the entrance looking like some kind of huge voxel head with flaming eyes at night? Yep, that's doable! Just carve away into that mountain. There is, as I mentioned, only one Game Master campaign at the moment, so each play-through will feel a bit repetitive, but they are still building the systems behind such things. Once these systems are in place, they will add a lot more Game Master content (and modders will be able to add their own campaigns as well).What I like best about this game is that you can really just play it however you like. The settlement I keep building each new alpha is very different from the settlements I see other people building. Technically the game is a sort of RPG/RTS/Roguelike, but at its core it's a sandbox game. It's a very fun sandbox to play in. While I would recommend this game to everyone, I wouldn't recommend you play this yet if you'll be bothered by pop-up error logs or if your game suddenly stops working and that settlement you spent hours building suddenly can't be played with anymore. These problems do happen. They've gotten a lot rarer since Alpha 1, but this is still an Early Access game in alpha, and you should only buy this now if you have a tolerance for bugs.			"

								Stonehearth is a great game, I have been playing since Pre-early access and have been astounded by the progress made by the developers and their level of community involvment, streams weekly, dev logs, weekly, roadmaps, quick responses on forums etc. Usually I'd steer clear of an Early Access game by a newer or less well known company. However Radiant have proved to be extrememly reliable and dedicated to their game. I would recommend this game, however it is in early access so bugs and a lack of features are to be expected (this is a direct attack of those posting negative reviews stating how is feature lacking - IT IS EARLY ACCESS!). If you are uncertain of whether or not you want to buy it, check out their streams look at some recent gameplay videos.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a highly enjoyable, in development, town building game. I have spent many hours building towns, learning the game, and enjoying the new game aspects they are adding from patch to patch as well as the bug fixes.With all of the good things however, there are a few bad.- The map generation takes quite a while per map roll (time consuming when looking for specific setups)- Save files are not compatible with updates, meaning you will need to restart each time there's an updateThese two things are not game breaking major, and they are wanting to implement the backward compatibility with save files, to prevent the need to constantly restart with updates, so it should no longer be a problem when they implement it.This game offers unique textures and means to build your town as well as prevents the need to have them always be building whatever is placed, which helps prevent accidents. This lets you build roads, houses, and other structures the way you want it. Do you want a flat area? Doable, do you want a roof-less house? Doable. Multi-structured mansion? Doable. Throw your guys in a hole and never able to get out? This can also be done, and those who are fans of the Tycoon games, such as Rollercoaster Tycoon, you will be familiar with the ability to trap your visitors where they cannot leave, or killing them with rides. Make this your own experience with the city and enjoy yourself as you do so.I will modify and go into more detail with this review as time goes on and as the game develops.Update 11/27/2015:This game has received quite a few updates since the original review. They have added the ability to create multi-tiered structures in the game, however this feature is a bit wonky and not 100% working in my opinion, as the settlers will often fail to build the bottom half of the house before the upper half or not build the building at all. They have also improved the errors that may happen in the game - if something were to bug out, it is no longer in a nasty developer box, but rather something a bit more user friendly to understand and depending on what fails, offers instructions on fixing the issue.There are some present AI issues in the game that can make it a bit frustrating to have a large amount of tasks, I've been able to circumvent this issue in the developer versions of Alpha 13 - which is said to fix the AI issues in regards to building, etc, but may not be 100% done yet - by removing the request and redoing it or suspending/pausing the task then resuming it. Assuming there isnt still a ton of things already requested for them to do, they often figure out that it still needs to be completed. The game is still very much in a playable state and I still highly enjoy it and my original review still stands at this point in time. They are making progres toward finishing the game and adding features. Please note that at the time of this update, that saves are still not backward/forward compatible. And my original con of the map generation taking a lot of time still stands as well, but it feels a bit faster than it once was.A few other major things they've added are a new style of settler and a new map biome type - the desert and raya's children. I've been able to play around with them in the developer build and its a very interesting change of pace to the normal gameplay that I had grown to love. This in combination with new professions and crafting systems in place permit for a more diverse and intricate creation system, making it feel like the crafters actually rely on each other to make the final product rather than it being a one man army. They have also vastly improved the game experience with making it run faster on my machine, and offering various options to help with slower/older machines as well as bug fixes. I haven't had massive bugs in regards to the UI or other pop-ups outside of one where I was clicking on buttons rapidly.So let me mark off my cons at this point in time in regards to Alpha 12/Dev Alpha 13:- Some AI issues in regards to tasks where they fail to complete (see above for my solution and some info)- Map generation still takes too much time- Save files are still not backward/forward compatibleThis said, let me list some pros of this game thus far- Multi-tiered structures- Intricate crafting system- Ability to trap your settlers- Aggressive (normal surviving) & Peaceful mode (for building)- Various travelling merchantsThere's a lot more as well that I would list off but this review would end up to be too long.

								Great game for alpha. yes bugs, yes some people have crashes, thats all expected. But i'm afraid for myself personally, that after night 10-15 I've run out of anything to do. You build houses, and then........ um..... well thats it. Even on the ""survival mode"" you can get by the entire survival mode with 1-2 warriors. Or just build a wall or a fence and you've outsmarted the game.Only thing i've found lately to make it a bit more challenging, is to increase the number of goblins or undead attacking me to keep it difficult. After about day 15 or so the workers kind of stop caring as much about getting things done, they also seem to get confused with where their food is even when theres a stockpile next door to them. I'm personally having a hard time with the food concept of the game, and NO I dont want it to be a sim. But why do I need 18 acres full of food to get one more person? No one eats much but for some reason I need SO MUCH FOOD. I feel like this game doesnt have any point after you made your first couple cute houses and made room for all the food you will need to get more people so you can...... so you can have more people to.... to build more houses.. well you get the picture. Can't reccomend in current state or for that price. Look forward to see what's on the horizon for this game. I hope it doesnt end up like Castle Story.			"

								I love watching this game be developed. This game surfaced around the same time as the infamous cube world, which, wound up being a flop. This game, however, has been highly persistent in updating and working on the game. Also, this is a FUN game, and when it is complete, it will be the best in the genre.			"

								I was fortunate enough to discover and back this game on Kickstarter during the original campaign and I've been hooked ever since. It is worth noting that I'm writing this review during alppha 10 and so many features are missing still. However, Stonehearth has evolved from being a very basic townbuilder game into a rich environment with many, many features (and many more planned). Some of my personal favorites are the richness of buildings that can be made and the burgeoning job system.It's also worth noting that the developers are very keen to support modders. They have made the game from the ground up with an extensible framework intended for modders and is how they are adding some of their own content as well.Finally, the developers are very active with their community, doing multiple streams per week as well as religiously posting blog entries on at least a weekly basis. They're very friendly on their forums and are regularly interacting with their supporters. I 100% recommend this game, even with the missing features.			"

								I think this game is very deserving of a review, and heres why...IT'S FUN!Plain and simple thats all you need to know. Its fun. This game is amazing. I love the mechanics, the music (Oh lawdy the music) and now there are TWO people to play from which provides a wonderful challange to the game. This game a come a long way from when i first started playing it. My only gripes are the combat system. Peasants are suicidal. They run head first screaming ""MY LIFE FOR AIUR"" and then get ♥♥♥♥♥slapped by a skeleton. Aside from that, buy this game if you loved Warcraft and Minecraft, because thats what it is!			"

								Too many bugs to play a file reliably. You build a pathway, some times it bugs out and can't be removed. You try and build under ground to reach the tunnels/dungeons, the camera can't turn the proper angle to create proper tunnels. Constant bug notifications pop up on your screen, some times crashing the file itself. Buildings still don't function properly. The soilders bug out in the middle of the fights if they try to haul. If your civilians all have 'mine' set on, they'll get stuck in a hole forever. Miners can't reach directly above their heads, causing them to get stuck forever if you don't click in a methodical order. If you don't do clean mining strips then you'll have messy blocks sticking/floating out and there's no way to fix it. Sometimes you civilians stop building, mining or doing a task with no reason.The most annoying thing by far is that these games always fall for the same issue because the developers balance this game by being ""arm chair scientists"" rather than playing their game legitimately (without cheats/commands). This is a problem in every single game like this I've played, whether it's Banished or anything else I've unistalled. This problem amplfies the longer you have a file, and the more you develop a file. Your units need to eat, and sometimes while they're half way in to completing a task or walking to location. The result is an endless loop of them trying to complete/reach the location before ending up getting hungry and cancelling it to walk back to the designated 'eat spot'. This is a completely fatal issue, there's no way to combat this until the developers add in proper inventories so your peoples can hold some food in their bags. Assuming you manage to dodge the bug fest and end up creating a big town, the civs will get hungry just by travelling from one side of the town, let alone exploring tunnels or hunting mobs on the map.Stoneheart is the only game from this genre that I enjoy and look foward to seeing developed. It's zelda-like elements and potential make it endlessly replayable once the content rolls in. However once the developers start ACTUALLY playing their game and realise their are some fatal bugs/issues like the 'Food Loop' they completely give up and open up the mod workshops *cough* Banished *cough*. So lets hope it doesn't go down like that. However, this game is pure Alpha, or even closer to Beta. Don't buy it.			"

								Fantastic game thus far, continues to improve with each patch. Excellent example of an early access game and a company that has great rapport with it's players. Strongly recommend to those who like them some city building with rpg elements and storytelling mixed in. Keep in mind that the game is still in early access and thus is still in the improvement stage. Bugs happen and features are constantly being tweaked and improved.Personally looking forward to seeing some of the more fantastical classes come out for the hearthlings, as well as the winter faction and whatever else may come.

								I just played the latest update (alpha 12) and as far as i can tell not much has changed, a few new items here, lots of bugs and here, ui problems there.I like the game and it seems like it's progressing, the learning curve isn't steep. but it's in early alpha so there isn't much content and also bugs are to be expected.Alpha 13: with rayya's child comes new set of villagers and the desert/savannah biome, trees are more scarce, silk are also scarce and new adjustments with jobs, items, etc. This is like the major update of this phase.I think it's better to wait until the game is done to get the full value(or buy Early Access to support devs but don't complain if it has game breaking bugs just post the bugs on the designated forum).

								Alright, I've played this game far longer than steam is showing, because I played it hours before I had it on steam at all.Also, I've been following this game for around two years now, and I think you can call me a fanboy. So is this review going to be neutral? No, definitely not! I love this game, and I probably oversee a lot of bugs. But at least it has a reason why I'm calling myself a fanboy.Two years ago, I think summer 2013, I've noticed a game called Stonehearth. A german video game magazine called ""gamestar"" reviewed it. A sandbox town building game in a voxel based world? Call me childish, but I loved to build huge lego forts so this game was bought instantly using the humble store for a much higher price than it's here on Early Access. I do not regret a single penny. Back then, the game was nearly unplayable. You enjoyed the concept for 15 minutes, but no longer. But, and this is at least for me one of the only criterion of an Early Access game, the developers were active. They posted news frequently and from time to time a new update was released. Not that often like - let's say Space Engineers - but frequent and huge updates.Now we have come to the point where I can honestly say that you can play it for some hours - if you are aware of some gamebreaking bugs. For example: Your workers need to eat, but sometimes the AI is stuck so they don't go eating and then they starve to death. Also if you have some more workers in your town the performance is getting really worse.And there is not that much of content, but you are busy for some hours. And don't forget: You buy an Early Access game to support the developers, to get an idea of what the game is going to be and to have a nice game for a cheap price when it's released!Now to the game itself:Imagine you play Minecraft. But not as a player, but as a god. And you can command your players to build stuff, to gather resources and to fight. Combine that with some RPG-mechanics (your workers, fighters, farmers, etc. can level up to be more efficient) and you have a nice combination of Minecraft, The Sims and SimCity in an medieval fantasy setting.The thing I love the most about the game is the great atmosphere. When it is getting dark, your workers will put wooden logs in a fire pit, they will light it and then they will sit around it warming up. Then they go to bed. After waking up, they go back to work. There is a living day/night cycle.Also there is a living world. At least a little bit. Don't expect too much right now, Early Access, remember? At night, skeletons and zombies are trying to kill you and at daytime, armed goblins try to take your stuff. You can defeat them and raid their outposts. Not that hard, not that satisfying, but the developers are on a good way.The last sentence could say all about the current state of the game. You will experience bugs, you will experience gamebreaking bugs and you will have to restart a lot.But Stonehearth is a lovely made game. The atmosphere is great. The gameplay is great. It is going to be awesome.			"

Early Access Review
								Long way to go, but even if i looked at this game in its current state, only consider all the bugs that it has polished, i would give it thumbs up. So since there are regular updates and fixes i have no reason not to recommend this game. Not all is great but i believe that it will be polished on the way.Digging up and down is badly done, needs re-thinking. The whole way how to look thru the ground in various heights is pretty badly made making it very difficult sometimes to see what you need to see when you ve been digging quite a bit.There is no way how to place dirt blocks back, they make no drop, no resource, so if you accidentally dig away something, you can only ""build"" a piece of stone back, but in x-ray view you will always see it there. There is no way how to make the your folk stop picking certain stuff up. So if your warrior dies in a gnome camp, your minions will keep running there to pick up the sword after the dead body, dying one by one. Sometimes they appear to die for no reason just like that, since the game doesnt tell you what happened you are just left wondering. I only played two games but there seems to be some sort of randomisation in various jobs position in the job tree, sometimes its the potter that is below the mason in the tree and sometimes its viceversa, this left me quite confused. The building system as a whole is a bit strange, i managed to design my stone tower, placed it on the ground and ordered start of construction, but nobody did anything and i didnt know why. There isnt enough of information about things, sorta ingame wiki. What does affect the sattisfaction of shelter? Food? Which food is the most sattisfactory? Optimization is another issue which surprised me. When you town is population 15+ the game will start somewhat lagging. Sometimes re-loading the game helps, sometimes it just stops on its own, its weird. But on my high-end PC its defo not a HW issue.There is a whole lot of things id like to see improved and i have no doubt that they will get improved. It already is very pleasant to play, has nice music, nice graphics, nice gameplay. Its very similar to game called Gnomoria, only with nicer graphics and heading in a little bit differend direction, direction that i like more. "

Early Access Review
								The short: A fun, cute, and refreshing civilization builder in the essence of its age-old predecessor: Dwarf Fortress.The long: As a avid fan of civilization sims and a old school fan of Dwarf Fortress 2, I bought Stonehearth on a hunch that it might be a aptly port to the 3D plane. In return, I was award with a different experience all together. Normally, I am a hard skeptic when it comes to Early Access titles and new wave Indie games. I am proud to say that this is a, currently, diamond in the rough.One of the first things I found with this game is the adorable graphics and artwork, which really appeal to its style. Everything looks nice and has a charming nature, even in the enemy designs. Gameplay-wise, Stonehearth serves really well as a civilization sim. Everything seems to mesh well together and controls are extremely easy to use. While earlier I ran into problems with the building controls, the recent alpha stage has fixed most of these problems and makes building and designing an awesome experience. Progression is very straightforward and aptly spaced parallel to your own speed. Combat, while simplistic, is easy to follow and pushes you to focus your troops into more diverse roles as your settlement grows. All in all, a very entertaining experience that makes me hopeful for a quality game the more it develops.While the current stage has not as much content as some would hope for, the team working on this has been effective at maintaining an open discussion with its playerbase. They have also been very well timed in releasing updates on development as well as new alpha builds, which is something I hope to see with any Early Access game. As with games of this nature, the time old expression of ""What do I do?"" comes to mind for those who aren't well versed with games such as Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria. However, the game is very easy to follow and figuring out your way is not as hard as such games mentioned.Basically, if you enjoy games in the nature of Dwarf Fortress, but aren't ready for the complexity of such a title, Stonehearth is the game to play. Adorable, addictive, and a fresh take on civilization sim.			"

								I have been following Stonehearth since Alpha 10 and after 17 hours of game I feel confortable enough to share my opinion with you guys. I'm going to do a list of Pro and Con, I hope you enjoy it.Ps:. Remember this game is in ALPHA stage so I can't avaliate everything, because it is constantly changing.Pros:- Game is constantly updated (weekly);- You can follow the game's development in Stonehearth's Website, Twitch Tv or in their Youtube Channel;- The team is always helpful and you can contact them in their own Forum or in Steam's Forum;- The game has an original cube style which is kind of criative and cool;- Stonehearth is pretty complete for an Alpha version;- The game has gorgeous graphics for an Alpha state;- The animations are pretty good;- We have nice bosses and monsters;- Building mechanics are good and you can basically create everything you want;- You have a lot of crafting options ( Carpenter, Blacksmith, Herbalist....etc). Therefore you need to update them;- The furniture of the game is just amazing;- You have three different difficult modes (Peaceful, Normal, Hardcore);- The game is always challenging although you play in normal mode; < Disregarding the Peaceful mode.- Hardcore mode is really amazing and challenging; < ( my favorite part )- You have a nice story although it's kind of silly;- The combat in the game is really nice. You have 4 different classes in combat ( Tank, Ranger, Cleric, DPS );- You have 2 biomes to play ( Desert, Florest ) and they are creating more + season system;- You have at now 2 different ""races"" to play;- The game's community is active.Con:- The game still having some bugs(Buildings/Combat), but it's in Alpha stage. It will change with the time;- The music is nice, but after a while it feels monotonus. I hope they put more soundtracks soon;- The combat's system is really great, but their auto-attack make it harder to play. I hope it's just a question of time to their change it;- The ""races"" seems predetermined for each biome which is a pity. Maybe they can change that;- The citizens also delay a lot to build something;- By the way, the game is not really optimized which means more work for your hardware(>> RAM <<);- Water bugs <<< It's really annoying but I bet it will change with the time.It's everything that I could see about this game. The game is fantastic, I personaly love it. I would recomend it for almost everybody. But remember, this game is Alpha Stage which means that you will find bugs. I recommend this game for people that have patience and understand that this current stage is going to be improved slowly. Ps:. Before you buy this game give a look at their website and on their development map. So you can catch up what they are working in.My Opinion:The game have a great potential for turn the best sandbox construction game after Dwarf Fortress. I personally had a great time playing Stonehearth. Building your own castles, Keeps, collecting resorcess, constructing a solid economy and defending your town against strong Trolls and goblings is pretty nice and cool guys! I had played other games before Stonehearth such as Towns, Craft the World, Terraria, Timberstone and Dwarf Fortress. I can assure you guys that no game is like Stonehearth. No game mix RPG + RTS + SANDBOX so well as this game and this is because I love it!Ps:. Remember this review was wrote in Alpha 17. So, the game can be better or worse after some updates.Ps2:. The game is on development I can't review it completely for that.			"

								I was an original Kickstarter backer back in mid 2013.The development of this game has long passed estimated release times. It still gets updates but they don't add much. Save games aren't stable between versions. Mod support has still yet to surface. OSX/Linux versions are on the backburner and may never come yet they were one of the first stretch goals. According to their own Trello board on their website both are ""to be done in the far future.""The game itself is hardly what I would call playable. Here's a list of the many things that go wrong:* Construction of buildings stalls. This means they never complete a building, which is a pretty important aspect.* Villagers consistently fail on their tasks meaning you have to re-task them. Again, and again, and again.* At random points the AI just stops doing things. It's probably the same issue with the former mentioned construction issue.Anyone comparing this to Minecraft are the people that think all Voxel games are the same.I do not recommend the game as early access. One day if it gets a full release then maybe I would recommend it. It has potential but the developers don't seem to prioritize work on the game.			"

								Written on 16 Nov 2015:Well when the game works it's a fun game to play, but if you are a Windows 10 user, you might want to pass on this game for now.  It took me an hour to get the game going in the compatibility section of Windows and editing the ""user_settings.json"" file.  Even after I had the game running, it crashes every 30 to 60 minutes.  There is also a User Interface problem that keeps showing up that prevents you from clicking on GUI buttons and makes the game unplayable and prevents you from saving the game.This game is early access, but for $25 dollars I feel it should be more playable.  If it was selling for $10 these issues would be more forgivable, but not at this price range.From what I see on the forums non-Windows 10 machines have much better luck running this.  I would recommend Windows 10 users waiting three months or more and then checking the forums to see if these issues have been resolved.  It really is a nice game, but it's not stable enough right now.			"

								Stonehearth, is a stoned survival and exploration game in a epic fantasy world, where you settle a town of hearthlings while defending agens invaders.The games layout, animations and sounds are really great, specially the way we can build the houses and duplicate our buildings on the ground, for each pieace. We can design everything from: Window, floor, door, roof, flags, fire, beds, and more. On the path while playing the game, people will visit your town and you can sell / buy upgrades. The atmosphere of the game is really nice, and you getting hooked really quickly.Be aware! They need some fixes aswell. Please keep in mind that this is Early access, and it's not finished. Check out my and others suggestions here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/253250/discussions/0/594821545179359856/Don't be a fool and think it's not worth it because of the missing features or sometime crashes with 5.273 error messages.If you search a relaxing and interesting stone, exploration and survival game in a fantasy world with invaders either in creative or survival mode, then this game is for you.Here is some old gameplay footage from june:

								*July 2, 2016* I love this game and can't wait for the core mechanic to work.Simply put, you cannot build houses. Builds often stop halfway. On top of that, you can't scrap the failed build. OCD nightmare.Googled it and... the same problem has been around for 2 years. Whoever is on top of this is not on top of this. So it would seem.If it's not fixed now... it's possible it'll be fixed by tomorrow (x_x)*October 2, 2016* It's been 3 months since my post above. I figured another go at this game was due. But after spending hours collecting resources to build a simple castle-like wall, well...It's disappointing and hilarious how bad this game still is. First off, everything but the actual walls were built. lmfao, I know right :sThen when I clicked on the structure to shamefully have to use insta-build, I couldn't.It said the build was finished. I realized it was hopeless after playing around with it.Maybe next year...			"

								I love how the game combined two game genre; Survival as well as an RTS. You gotta foresee ahead on how your Hearthlings will fare when certain scenarios arises. The game is somewhat glitchy but tolerable. You'd soon forget about it and eventually get hook with the pace of your village.			"

								I've been following this game since its Kickstarter debut. I have to say I am super impressed with the teams commitment to listening to the community and including us in the process. Every week there are multiple updates on the forum regarding the new alpha releases or other changes.This is definitely a game still in development. If you purchase do not get too attached to any build because upon the next alpha release you will be starting over again and systems may change. Things crash and odd bugs will happen - but that's the definition of an alpha.This game has huge potential and even though its only an alpha there is enough content to keep me procrastinating for hours on building my town. I just love it - for me its the next best thing since minecraft - or it will be!			"

Early Access Review
								For months I looked at this game on Steam and thought to myself, ""Hey, that looks kind of neat, seems kind of fun, and I think I'd like to try it sometime, but there's probably other stuff that I'd rather play first, so I'll just wishlist this and maybe get back to it when it goes on sale again someday.""Well, after maybe six months of that attitude, I finally broke down and bought Stonehearth. And played it. And played it. And still play it. And I love it. Now my attitude is more like, ""What in the heck was I thinking when I decided to wait so long? This game is cool!""If you like the 8-bit type them to games, and love the simplistic visual style of old '80s and early '90s games, then you will love this game. It might LOOK simple and basic, but it's actually a VERY engrossing game! But be warned: if you have a life and responsibilities, such as a job, children, spouse or friends, this game is going to start competing with their time. It's THAT fun.I love it. I shouldn't have waited. Would definitely get re-addicted again. Just one more block. Just one more block. Just one more block...9/10 "

								I've been excited for Stonehearth since the Kickstarter which I happily contributed to. I saw a team of people who were passionate about delivering the product they envisioned instead of a watered down version.Two years later I'm happy to see that I wasn't wrong. The development team is very transparent, honest, and are not willing to give up on their vision like so many other games have. Unfortunately, that means that some things take longer to do and have more bugs because the implementations are more complex. I've watched and played the alphas, though, and I've seen fantastic and surprisingly rapid growth so I'm optimistic about where this game will be when it's finally complete.Worth the price, but please remember this is alpha-quality software so there may be some frustrations. Alpha 10 is pretty stable but if you'd like to avoid some of the game-breaking issues that can sometimes pop up I would wait a few more versions or even until Beta when the real bug fixing kicks in.

Early Access Review
								This is a very satisfying game with a rather cute artstyle that scratches all the itches that towns left me with.Essentially, you indirectly command a small village of settlers to build up a town, attract new residents, and defend your town from raids by wolves, zombies, goblins, kobolds, and all sorts of similarly nasty monsters.The game, unfortunately, can be quite straining on your computer when you have a lot of villagers, but since I've started playing, the game's performance and optimisation have both improved dramatically. When I started playing, the game would get completely bogged down at around 20 villagers and they would stand around doing nothing until they starved, now I can have 30 villagers comfortably and the game only gets a little clogged after playing for several (8+) hours with that number of villagers.The developers are also very communicative and active and chat with the community regularly to take suggestions and feedback. If you enjoy citybuilding and sandboxy games then I really can't recommend this game enough.			"

								A very enjoyable sandbox game. Want to lay back in your chair, tell the hearthlings to build templates, grow large farms and just enjoy watching them... This game is for you... Later when Oggo's army comes, you can see it burn down. :)Are you a stratigic mastermind looking for a challenge, wanting to build large cities and castles and fight off evil, and well, build an invicible empire... This game is for you.... And don't you worry, Oggo's army will test how invincible you just think you are. ;)Personally, I don't like it... I love it! You build a city, maybe an economic or a military powerhouse, while a simple but very enjoyable script of events undergoes, and how to tackle them is up to you. Of coursen there are also random events or raids that happen during all of this so you get a little disparity between games.But every game has it flaws, for this game, it's mostly bugs like: During the event of the Goblin chieftain, when you say you're gonna pay him tribute but wait it out and he's asking you for the last time before attacking, you can just press esc and it will go back to the notification bar, until you say ""I have changed my mind"" or pay the tribute. And the blacksmith leveling process, yeah, I get it's very late game but to mine up and let him smelt literally 500+ ores, just to get him to lvl 4 so you can finally get the engineer and do it all over but with cogwheels... The process gets a bit to  grindy.And for Oggo's army, you need atleast 2 decked out knights (and a max lvl healer), which again requiers a lvl 3 - 6 smith.Now if you should buy this? For me, the price is right, it's a well made (alpha) game and if it will be multiplayer later on.... It's very much worth it.If you should buy this now during early access or later is up to you, if you don't mind restaring worlds that you have built on, then yes. Otherwise wait.I have been playing this since alpha 2,5 came out, and I think it has been a blast watching the game unfold, becoming bigger and more complex for every uppdate and test new things out, so if you want to help the developers and ge tthis feeling, buy it.For you who'll wait until the full release... 1v1 me later when/if multiplayer comes! ;)			"

Even with the bugs in it right now, you can quickly find yourself playing for hours, and any suggestions you have for the game can end up becoming things pushed into the next Alpha! As of right now, you should only purchase this game so long as you're ok with dealing with a couple of bugs. If you are, then start throwing money at your screen.			"

								Holy crap, there's an actual game here! After ages of being pretty boring, buggy and unplayable, I was able to play for about 6 hours straight the other day with no hiccups, crashes or incomplete buildings. I was rewarded with a rich town builder that, while still missing some key features, is surprisingly deep. As a Kickstarter backer, this is a huge relief: most Early Access projects don't get nearly this far, especially in the town builder/management genre (example: Gnomoria).Furthermore, the team responsible for the game, Radiant, was recently acquired by Riot (makers of League of Legends). The team here is dead set on getting this project right from day one. Even though development has been slow, updates have been solid and have steadily built on themselves to create a game that is finally beginning to take definitive shape as a fun and unique take on the Dwarf Fortress genre. Keep an eye on this one, DF fans. It's going places.			"

								What a brilliant game, its cute, fun and very immersive.

The Dovelopment team are just out of this world, You can see the comitment in their work when you watch their live streams and in each update. I only see this game only getting better. Keep up with the hard work Team Radiant.One thing I wish to say to the new community before I finish, Dont wine and beg for the Multiplayer PLEASE. Let the game run its development path. If you really want something to be in the next update, go to https://trello.com/b/4XvM0SUd/stonehearth-community-roadmap and vote for the next feature in the next update.Also head to http://stonehearth.net/category/development/ for the latest update news and development.10/10			"

								This is a really good game but i really can't recommend it.I have put only a few hours into the game so far but i have struggled to build the simplest of houses because the hearthlings will not build the roof or they wont put the beds into the houses. Sometimes during the struggle, the engine even fails to complete the task and slowly begins to break down to the point where you cant even finish desgining the building or even get the pause menu up.Right now there is too many bugs which is obviously going to be in the game due to it being an EA game. Once it is out of EA then i will recommend getting it. At this moment, I cant recommend.			"

								I first played Stonehearth back in alpha, and thought that it wasn't as much of a deal back then, but was largely intrigued by the well-rounded corners the developers mainly got around to. It was appealing and affectionate; something the current game libraries didn't offer a lot of. Granted, I took the jump into the warm water and it was mainly filled with bugs. Like a LOT of bugs. Thankfully, many patches and versions later, we get to play this much more toned, much more carved game that really resonated with me in a lot of ways. This game has the appealing factor of Minecraft, the RTS-feel of Tropico meets Banished and forms a bond that revolves around both styles really well. You could say it's like an RTS/RPG but that is also missing the mark. Granted, it is still in alpha, but damn do I love this game. After getting back in a month later, many problems were fixed, while there were problems lingering. Still, this game is fantastically crafted and makes you feel as if while creating your little village, that you're connected with your Hearthlings, a.k.a your units/villagers. What's interesting is that there is an objective, and not mindless building nor reacting to an enemy assault from orcs. This game makes you feel as if you're working together with your Hearthlings, and it is damn awesome. The soundtrack is fantastic, there are a TON to do and TONS MORE coming! This game has potential, and also if there are known bugs DO let the developers know. Let's make this gem of a game shine. Congrats to Team Radiant! This is one hell of a fantastic game!			"

Early Access Review
								I have a few things to say about this game. It has become one of my favorite pc games ever. No joke. It has unique gameplay and a very nice plot. It even has story progression for once you get to about the second in-game month, goblin camps start appearing. The game itself looks very well made and polished but even for this game, it has got PLENTY of cons.First off it is highly buggy and mainly when designing or building a house. Sometimes building the second story wall makes it two layer and overlap leaving it unable to undo or do anything otherwise without restarting the game. The AI could also use incredible amounts of work. They don't build under bridges of any kind and they need to be specifically ordered to do so or they will never get anything done. There is a feature that needs to be added single-handedly and that is making it to where the AI always run back to headquarters. Everytime there are mobs coming out and chasing after my Hearthlings, do they go towards the footmen who could kick some goblin ♥♥♥? Nope. They run out to the woods to dig their own harty graves. That's not all for I have had to start my game over far to many times due to the poorly-made engine failing from doing simple tasks.But the reason why you see this thumbs up on this review is that this game overall has massive potential. And since I adore early-access games so much, I have gotten used to these bugs. But, then again, when the developers ditch the game to run off with the thousands and millions they make, then it is a big thumbs down for me. But greatly enough, they are still updating it. Maybe a bit slow at times, but they are still producing the game towards better recreational fun. I do reccomend this game and it is worth every penny you buy it for.			"

Stonehearth is a very promising village/town builder! I'm very glad to have helped kickstart it. The developers push out updates and improvents frequently.Anyone who is a fan of Dwarf Fortress and DF-lite games (Gnomoria, Spacebase DF-9) will enjoy Stonehearth.Sure, as of this post, it has its share of issues:  Bugs (with the occasional crash to desktop) Waning performance (CPU and AI decision-making) over time (needing the occasional save-then-reload to refresh) Some not-yet-implemented UI functionality and UX flow that can make building clunky and unforgiving That said, Stonehearth not only shows improvement after every update, but it's also already quite fun to play!

								I want to play this game but have spent more time trying to get it to run correctly than actually watching it crash on me.I would verify that your drivers are up to date, that you have above minimum requirements, and that your computer is malware free. After this point I've read on the forums it is a possibility that is a gamble for x64 users and AMD users since we happen to be the ones getting most of the issues.The game runs for me for about 5 minutes and then It freezes. Not during the same actions or anything either.I also tried reinstalling and running on x32 with no luck.I'll wait until the next update to reinstall and try this game out... hopefully.			"

								Honestly, it's not worth the exorbitant price they're asking for right now. The game isn't close to being finished, and 25$ is just too much for such a  buggy game with only 5 hours of content within one playthrough. Good potential, you just won't get a lot of hours out of it in its current state, and half of the hours you do spend will be filled with frustration over your ""Hearthlings"" or citizens lacking the brain compacity to build a fuctional two story building. I would probably have trouble thinking too, if my head sank into my chest, but i think you get the picture; this is a game to wait on.			"

								The price of this game shouldn't be $27.99 right now. To me, i'd played at least 2 other early access games that should have been 27.99 at start but instead was at least half of their selling price. The game is still fun and simple in a way it is a replica to minecraft and terraria, just not in first person or third person mode and is in a creators point of view ( not an author either since there is no story or plot involved) which made the game unique yet full of potential to upcoming changes. Basically, you can not move your units like you would when you play starcraft. They have their own sort of ai intelligence but you you can control em by commanding the things they can do like harvesting, building and etc. This is the reason why the game got soo positive beside cartooony artwork. The art and the design iteself is amazing but is definitly lacking way too much content in the meantime and has alot of bugs that become annoying to bypass after playing for 9 hours. The bugs arn't too serious but there's way to bypass them where you have to think outside the box in order to make the game playable as much as possible until when i wanted to load back my game, everything froze. The game is running fine including the music but everything that once full of life just stopped as if i had paused the game, which i didn't. There is alot of potential in this game, the game is only worth reviewing once more when it is fully out since they going to add multiplayer in and other features but if it gets to the point where it is not going to be those pay to win games. Only then i would see this game is still worth buying at $27.99-$49.99. The gameplay is very slow. SO if you're a type of person whose into simulation where not alot of things are going on, you will enjoy playing this game alot. It's like sims but you get to control the lives of the community than one person/ family. Most importantly, they should add more features if they arn't ready for contents like horses , archers, traps for enemies and etc vs. social interaction between the npcs (more advanced) instead of villagers being a coward  when they see any monsters cause eevryone is different. More customization for your character and npcs, like names, clothes, and etc. Their background story randomly generated would be awesome as well. It's worth watching people playing based on their creativity in making towns, kingdoms, cityscapes in a sandbox but it is defnitly not worth buying if you're those people who love intense, fast-paced environment.

								Aslong as the Devs keep updating it and don't leave it for the great Early Access Graveyard, Stonehearth has ALOT of Potential, and hope to see it progress.Pros:--  Its a nice game visually, Despite being voxel.-  You can make your own buildings (needs more options than just Wood and Stone though, like making the floor out of linen and having it any colour you want)- Plenty to keep you entertained for a good amount of hours in its current state- I'll say it again, this game has so much potential in the long run.- Like Banished, another great title, but more forgiving, and no teen pregnancy.Cons:-- Occasionally, the Hearthlings can be moronic- Combat is a little lacking, Most of the time 1 Footman equipped with a Boneclub can scare away a group of 4 Goblins- No way to remove ghost furniture when dumb Hearthlings don't Place the item thereOverall I've really enjoyed what Stoneheart has to offer so far, and hope the Devs keep working on such a fun little title, I hope to see the Magma Smith and Geomancer and Bunny-Human pictures from the Loading screens ingame one day.

								An awesome game but I feel it can be frustrating for people who have just bought it as it has its fair share of crashes but nothing (for me at least) that cannot be resolved by the devs' fixes found in the forums. I love the customization aspect of it which I feel games like Folk Tales were really lacking. It has a slight lack of features but pay this no mind to this as the game is in early access. Now on to the reviewShort ReviewPretty run of the mill soundtrack/sound effects 7/10Graphics are in a plain yet charming style 8.5/10Gameplay lacks in features but considering its early acces state a 9/10Overall 8.5/10[EDIT]Do NOT buy this game if you have an AMD PC just look at the forums and all the people that are having problems right now (I am having this problem myself) I repeat DO NOT BUY IT UNTIL THEY FIX  THESE CRASHES (I absolutely love the game but it's really f***ing annoying)			"

								I do recommend this game for those who like fort/citybuilding games. The building mechanics are very creative, and the AI is very good, you never control a villager and they follow your orders pretty well.Yet I have to say I don't recommend playing it at this stage. In only a couple hours the game gets unplayable; the villagers freeze, lag a lot and get stuck and then many engine errors occur.It's a very promising game and I really like it, but I couldn't play it for a long time before it breaks. Considering this, the price is quite high for the current development stage.			"

The game was slow at first but after a bit of research I caught on to the mechanics fairly quickly and build a nice little town with a booming amount of resources. The ability to create your own buildings and really design your city is much different than many other city builders.TLDR: Easy, Simple  yet very intuitive city builder that keeps you busy!			"

Early Access Review
								Great game. I recommend this game to anyone who likes creative sandbox games and even the casual RTS gamer. Its alpha, so obviously there are bugs being worked out. None of the bugs are game breaking and most can be fixed by simply saving and reloading. They also make console commands available as a work around for some bugs. Its great for releasing your inner creativity. Think of building something in Minecraft or Terraria, except not having to place each individual piece yourself. You design the building in a design mode and when you are finished editing you hit the build button and then your people do all the work. This makes building larger more complex structures much less time consuming. There is a building template saving feature so that your creations can be saved for other games. If you make a massive structure simply save it and you can copy paste it to another world, all you need is the materials. The combat is fun as well, but can be turned off if you wish to play in the sandbox mode. Being able to assign units to gaurd (footmen) roles and creating/finding better gear for them to use. The game gets progressively harder to a point then seems to level out and nothing can defeat your footmen. But again its alpha and the combat was only just released so its basically there to be tested and tuned.Multiplayer has not been implemented yet but it is planned in the future and I believe that this game has some great potential at some fun multiplayer gameplay.

								Stonehearth is a sandbox-rpg town builder with a lot of heart. I’ve been playing the game since Alpha 3 and it’s the only early development game i’ve had zero regrets about purchasing. Community And Developers:The Stonehearth Discourse is full of awesome and helpful people. It’s a very good grouping of gamers really trying to help each other out. Friendliest discourse on the net.The developers at Stonehearth truly are one of a kind. They continue to be very open about what is happening with the game and participate in discussion on the discourse. They REALLY do listen to feedback, i've seen it happen multiple times where the community will spotlight a great idea and it makes it into the game.But the main thing is… they stream THREE times a week on Twitch, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Two design live streams and one coding stream. Tony and Tom answer questions accept feedback with the best of them.On top of this, they do a development blog once a week, sometimes twice.Alphas get pumped out one every 6-8 weeks on average. In between that, they update the unstable branch that allows you to play test the upcoming features, and those come pretty quickly after main Alpha releases.Gameplay:The game plays great You set up the tasks and then can kick back and watch as your Hearthlings go to work. Farmers need to direction as they constantly plant, harvest, and replant food. The trapper will automatically head to the trapping zones you set up, survey the lands, and place out traps to catch small game. And one of my favorites... footman will patrol along your roads and stockpiles, wary for danger.With the Dungeon Master Ai system, it spawns events and campaigns (I won't spoil what) that come to mess with your village. In some cases, you are given multiple options on how to handle it.Overall:I think the Devs said it best""It’s important to understand that Stonehearth isn’t finished yet. Not by a long shot. But Stonehearth, as it stands now, is a game with fun, robust gameplay and plenty to do and explore.""Pros:Community ++Developers ++Development Speed +Developer Openness and Communication ++Plays smoothJust good Fun!Oozes Character and cutenessDungeon Master System AICons:Buggy! (it’s alpha)Price is in the mid-high range for EA, but seems right for the final game.Game Still has a long ways to go to be fully featured			"

								Stonehearth (Alpha 10) can be best described as a pretty, easy to use, and lightweight Dwarf Fortress for the masses. None of what I just said should be taken negatively. It's a great concept. I absolutely can't wait for final release, because I'm convinced the devs are going to make it happen and hit a home run in the process.As the game stands, it wasn't until the latest Alpha release (alpha 10) a couple of weeks ago that Stonehearth actually started to feel like a game. So giving a fair review is hard to do. Let's just jump to whether or not you should buy in to the game as it is now. If you are an indie supporter who likes to see a game evolve and support a project early on, then yes, it's a great buy. Also if you are content with what amounts to a sandbox that is still very much a trial run of the features in the design doc but are OK with may features still outstanding, then certainly dive in while the water is relatively clean. The game is being made by great team that stays heavily connected to the community.If you are looking for a game that is near feature complete with only minor bugs, then perhaps it's worth waiting. If I had to guess, Stonehearth is at least a year away from being ready for final release; so if you don't have the patience to wait until the features you want are in the game, then you may want to wait. Perhaps the Early Access money from Steam will afford a larger team and speed up the development...In the end, be sure and check out the games website and watch some YouTube videos to help with your decision.

								This is one of those original games that you know can really go so far with the right amount of love and development. And for the few months I had this game before it hit steam early acess the devs have really proven that they are dedicated and willing to release frequent updates, and as important: fix bugs! Sure the game isn't complete and they are still adding more features, but already this is an awesome and open world, a city-sim with the micromanegement that an rts player would love. Another thing that really strikes me as impressive, and eleviates most of my concerns regarding the fact that it lacks content in some areas is their openess to the community. These guys are really awesome and open about their plans, have frequent dev streams and will tell you exactly what they are working on. In my opinion this is truly early access done right, and thats why this game is much more than some buggy early access scam. Definitely recommended.			"

When the game is complete, then combined with the talented user modded content the sky is the limit for your Hearthlings and long term game play for you.

								ive been playing this game for a while now ( since aplpha 6 first came out), and it keeps bringing me back for more. i would reccomend it for anyone, it is at a very reasonable price for what it has to offer. it is fun to see your city grow and constantly find new things too do. when i start to think it has nothing more to offer,i get sad, and then about 5 minutes later ill be at war with a goblin tribe, and while the combat isnt the best, it is pretty good. the construction doesnt have too many custom options but it still allows for some pretty massive and beautiful structures. This game is frequently updated and i have never had to worry about a bug for longer than a week. my only complaint, is that somtimes i will have to repeatedly remind my people to build stuff.			"

								This game is in early alpha. As such, temper your expectations. Bugs, Weird gameplay quirks, and some problematic AI script errors tend to make the game a sort of ""How long can you play before you need to save and restart the program"" thing. But dont take what I say as a negative review. This game is lovable and unique, and every moment I have spent playing it has been more or less a blast. And difficult, to boot. With Enemy zombies and goblins constantly reducing my villager count by 1 or so every night, it becomes far more difficult to maintain the city with each passing death.Good game, Still early alpha release, can't wait to see how it improves.

								I sit here in my desk chair, 3am on a cold Scottish morn. Listening to the gentle hum of my PC as I watch my little hillside hamlet of Edoras expand, 4 houses, a public feasting building, a guard barracks, a blacksmith and a completly filled food storehouse. Every little hearther is happy, at peace and happy in life as we press further into the hillside, ever expanding, handing out food to passing merchants - we have plenty- in exchange for fancy chairs and rustic fire pits for the long houses. We gather to eat and jest, then sleep in simple beds with roaring fires to keep us warm.This is simple. Peaceful. This is Edoras.Ok, I'll be truthful, i was expecting a quick hour or so to get into it, set up farms, housing... basic stuff then just steam roll it for a half hour then refund it cause i wasn't enjoying it.But no, Stonehearth has this... charm to it that i just can't pinpoint. Maybe it's the building system - you have a few preset designs and the rest you can build using a fairly simple but effective system of drag selections and semi voxel based building -, maybe it's the constant strive to better your town and lure more hearthers (little voxelly pixelly villagers) into your town for workers.Maybe you just enjoy the sense of wonder of seeing your town flourish by your hand.Stonehearth is probably already worthy of a release, i don't even begrudge them £18.99 because the game is truly extremely fun. BUT One problem is... The AI... the hearthers are a little... single minded, monkey see, monkey do sort of thing. Like place desings for a house... they start building. Good. Place designs for another hosue and a... idk, a storehouse, and sometimes theyll  all flock to build the storehouse and begin construction. So that house you placed first unless you reinstate the build order, will become last priority. Not bad as such, just a little... irritating seeing half built buildings (storehouse and blacksmith in my village) being used and slept in with no roof, half a wall missing, and no door.. :pPersonal peeve and i'm sure others will feel the same way...

Early Access Review
								Only five hours in but I'm having a TON of fun, and it's only in alpha.THE QUICK VERSION: Do you like Gnomoria (or Dwarf Fortress)? Do you like Minecraft? If you answered ""yes"" to either of these, you'll most likely enjoy this game. If you answered ""yes"" to both, you'll DEFINITELY enjoy this game.THINGS TO LIKE:+ The building system is the most robust of any citybuilder I've seen to date. You not only get to lay out buildings for your Hearthlings to construct (very intuitively, in my experience!) but you get to place furniture within and without at your whim. There's already a great deal of different types of furniture and decor your Hearthings can craft.+ The music is excellent. It's rich and well composed, and it gives the game a very quaint feel.+ Game generation is simple but fun and really makes you feel like you're having an impact on your game before it even starts. You roll a set of Hearthlings, each with their own stats, and can even name them. You also get an amount of gold to spend on a selection of items to start yourself off with. You select your options in storybook form when the game asks you to pick between two types of Hearthlings (one medieval-ish group and one nomadic, desert-like group), two types of biomes (temperate or desert), and two types of game (either you can be raided by enemies or you can't). Then your map is generated and you select where on that map you want to settle. Each region has access to different resources.+ Trade events. Just about every day, a trader will come by offering different deals. You can buy or sell certain goods from some, some will ask you to make them x number of items then come back after a set amount of time to trade you something agreed upon for them... It keeps things fresh and gives you new ways to get resources you maybe don't have access to based on where you settled.+ Hearthling jobs. There are several different jobs in the game and they all feel useful. Every Hearthling starts off as a basic laborer, who can only gather resources, haul them, or build. With items (most of which are constructed by the various crafting jobs), you can promote a hearthling to any number of other jobs such as Farmer, Carpenter, Tailor or Trapper. Every job has levels that increase as your Hearthling performs that job and gains experience. At each tier, a new ability is unlocked. These range from increased speed to the ability to randomly create high-quality furniture that takes on a finer appearance than the base item being crafted. Many jobs are also laid out in a tree wherein you must have a Hearthling of level x in one job to promote to another. For example, Cook requires Farmer at level 3.+ The ability to save your building designs for easy placement later.THINGS THAT NEED WORK:- Currently it's very difficult (possible though!) to build a second floor that functions. I'm sure this will be ironed out as the game plods along in development, though.- A few of the job abilities aren't implemented yet, but this will definitely be remedied later just on nature of the status being ""not implemented"".- You get occasional errors when trying to do things, pretty much always in regards to building. They haven't crashed the game for me, it's basically just the game telling me the engine didn't understand what I was trying to do.- Sometimes the building bugs a bit, but all that generally means is that you have to cancel building and start designing from the start again. Bit of a pain, but with trial and error, you'll get where you're going, and this is sure to be ironed out in the long term.FINAL VERDICT:It's already an incredibly addictive game for me. In its current state, I'd rate the game a solid 7.5/10. It has the potential to be at LEAST a 9. If for whatever reason you trust my opinion, I'd tell you this game is worth the buy right now. It's one of the sharpest alpha states I've ever seen for a game and there's already so much to enjoy and lose hours in. Five hours in, I've only scratched the surface of jobs and the like and I'm still going strong. I can see myself easily logging over 100 hours in this thing.			"

								Pretty good overall for an early iteration. Lacking some significant fleshing out of features, and suffers from some pretty serious optimization issues and slow downs. With a little love it could be a beautiful dwarf fortress clone.The job system is more interesting than DF and DF clones, and with some more work could become worth the depth it shows in concept, however as it stands it seems more like a lazy content gate. Hopefully it will be the method they use to set themselves apart from the previous games of this genre.			"

								This is a good game for the first 2-3 hours. When you start making building that aren't already built in can be extremely frustrating. If you want to upgrade a piece of furniture in your house you have to destroy it and rebuild it from what i can tell. If you want to make a vertical mineshaft you can wish some of your hearthlings dead. Sometimes random items get in places you can't get. This game has good potental. It could be a great game if the building management was much easier.			"

								I, ehrm, ""test drove"" this game prior to Alpha 18 and saw it's potential, but hesitated to purchase it due to some lofty bugs and general lack of late-game content & optimization.I was very pleased to discover how much progress was made with A17 & 18.  These two patches alone convinced me it was time to support the devs by purchasing and recommending the game to others.  I wasn't sure you guys could/would pull it off, but this game now feels great to play for being in such an early stage.  Keep up the hard work - this is a gem awating it's final, glorious cut & polish!!!10/10 would stone my hearth again.			"

								What can I say? This game is just a ton of fun. I soaked up 4 hours playing this when I first bought it. If you like town/city builders, and like to manage colonies and the like, then this game is right up your alley. I thought that the art style would bug me at first, but to be honest, it is kinda nice. You don't get caught up in the graphic nature being a big point in the game, even though you can make some nice loking buildings and stuff anyway.Stonehearth looks like Minecraft, but plays very differently. It is in a top down-ish format, so you aren't controlling a single character, but rather managing what the colonists will work on. I won't go too much into the mechanics of such a game, as it isn't the first to do such a thing, but it is worth noting that you don't have IMMEDIATE control over what the colonists do, unless they are doing nothing at the time.This is an amazing game. I can only assume it will get even better, and it looks as though the devs intend to stick with it, fixing some annoying bugs already. If you are on the fence, I'd say just buy it, give it the 2 hours to decide, and if you don't find yourself completely wowed by it, Steam will give you a refund. You really can't go wrong here.			"

								I've been following Stonehearth for years, and finally picked it up on Steam.  It's a very fun game for passing the time.  You have partial control over your hearthlings by giving them tasks and telling them to walk to certain areas.  The rest is handled by the AI.  But once you have 20 hearthlings doing their thing you have plenty to do.  There are multiple job paths and little mini quests along the way.  Buildings can be custom designed as well or you can use some of the pre created cookie cutter models.The game is still in alpha but its looking very good and is very playable as it is.Another massive pro is their support!  I had one issue and they immediately replied and had several team members assisting me.  After some other recent Alpha flops I can't tell you how reassuring that is!!!  Very much appreciated.I hope this game only gets better and better!			"

								EDIT: I'm rewriting a review because I love this game a lot and want people to really understand whats going on. This game has so much potential. The devs really care and want it to be a good game. It's playable in the current state but at the same time it isn't. You will face several gamebreaking bugs during your play. I frequently try to play this game and see how it's going. HUD breaks, hearthlings don't do what you ask. Devs post weekly (most of the time on tuesday) about the upcomming updates, and i really like how much they communicate with the backers/supporters (i backed this game on kickstarter awhile back) overall I believe it would be better to add this to your wishlist/watch list and check back every once and awhile. If you buy it now you might find a few bugs and get frustrated. I'll edit this more in the future. -original short really bad review- (im sorry)I have been playing this game since the first alpha and let me tell you The devs listen, they care, and they want to make this game the best for us. I know $25 is a bit much (i bought it for $30 on their site) but it will be reduced to $15 on release. Either pick it up now, or wait. Either way this game is excelent and I love it.			"

								The devs put their heart and souls into this game, and it shows! They're always adding in new and intersesting features and complete a new alpha release every month or so. It's nice to have a game where you can build whatever you want while defending it from the various and expanding array of monsters. I love the RPG elements of needing a previous class in order to advance further. Or a different class is needed to craft the necessary tool to level up a hearthling. Alpha games have lots of bugs you say? Fear not! Many of the game-breaking bugs or annoying bugs that I experienced when I first bought this game are all gone or at least are being addressed and steps are being made toward fixing it.			"

								At the time of this review (7-16-2016), I would say the game is already worth the purchase price. There are so many games that charge far more while delivering far less. And this game is only in the alpha stage. As many have already commented, if you like sim games (SimCity, Civilization) and other open-world, crafting type games then this is worth a look. With any sim/crafting game there is a learning curve and there is one here, but it hasn't felt particularly harsh. One thing that really struck me was the quality of the music--it's fantastic. Like, Howard Shore cinematic quality. Well done, sir.			"

								as buggy as it is right now this little game is somewhat addictive. Dev's are releasing constant updates so there's usually something new every week or two. it'll be hard not to burn many hours on this builder... even with all its bugs...EDIT: the devs are committed to this one, I genuinely believe this will be one of few early access games to be seen through to completion. If you enjoyed any form of base builder game, you'll like this. if titles like dungeon keeper, cultures, settlers (and many more) make you feel a little nostalgic then one day this game will too. Only thing to consider if you're thinking about buying, dont be dissapointed if you get bugs - everyone does at the moment. be prepared to search the forums for console commands or common problems. it is still alpha so its not without its unexpected complications			"

								Rewrote this Review due to new updates, current Stable: Alpha 17, but Alpha 18 is playable and looking good too. Previous Review had 4 of 7 Helpful votes.Short Version: It's still a Dwarf Fortress/Gnomoria style game, but less focused on deep digging and more on exploration, crafting, and building. Class System is simple but interesting and more unique than simply assigning jobs, and much more user friendly than most. Don't let the simplicity fool you though, you can pour some fair time into this if you like these kinds of games.Since my previous review, it's still in Alpha, but has resolved or at least lessened alot of the Optimization issues, with more tweaks focused on that to come - judging by the dev blog and their videos, they genuinely care about fixing this, and they should since 2d Dwarf Fort lags up pretty bad once you have a big enough population going, imagine how bad it's going to be in a 3d game like this. Smart focus on their part, one of the rare devs that learns from others' issues, unlike every MMO dev out there.The AI is much better now, though still a little prone to bad decision-making. You can somewhat ""control"" their pathfinding by building Roads, as it favors those almost exclusively unless no road exists to follow nearby. The Building issues I had before seem resolved for the most part, though I'll still find a ladder or scaffolding stuck floating and undestroyable without using the Console.Combat has advanced by leaps and great bounds since my previous review - many more weapon/armor options, as well as 3 new classes: the Knight, with heavier armor and 1h/shield focus, bonus defense/stats and buff auras for his allies, as well as Taunt skills to protect the squishies - the Archer, your standard ranged attacker who can either slow or burn enemies based on their Arrow Quiver equipped(and double-shot at max lvl) - and most importanly, the Cleric, a Healer Monk who can do melee dmg and defend himself but puts their first priority as healing any nearby units with damage, both directly and through a passive aura. I make 2 groups of 1 of each class and it protects my bases pretty well + deals with the Story armies nicely.The Mining system is a little more controllable now but still not as fine-tuned as I would like to see, and usually see in other games of this kind - there's no Ramps or Stairs to be dug, and manually digging them up doesn't usually work because the AI prefers to build and use Ladders instead of stepping up/down 1 block steps.Overall they're making nice strides in the right direction, and I'm eager to see more.Bonus: There's already a decent-sized Mod community, and they make some pretty good mods so far, from whole new classes and items to entire Biomes(The Archipelago one is awesome)			"

Leaving you with a half finished house that you can't delete.After an hour of playing, the shine really wore off.Update december 24th 2016: Sonehearth was on sale for 20 bucks so I decided to give it another try, and sweet mother of baby Jesus this game still has the same exact bugs as the last time I played it! Scaffolding everywhere. unfinished buildinGs. Settlers just standing around. I really wanted to like Stonehearth I really did, but bought the game twice and requested a refund twice. You would think that a game where you build buildings the building portion would be a ♥♥♥♥ing priority, BUT I GUESS NOT!

								Good game if the only thing you care about is crafting a cute little town. The strategy tag should not be attached to this game. I really liked this game at first, but once I had a basic town set up, there was nothing else to do. The game has minimal story that can be beaten with only a few hours of effort. Yes, the game is randomized and its technically replayable an endless amount of times, but with the lack of content, I don't see myself replaying this game at all and I don't see this game really improving a whole lot in the future.

								Stonehearth. Not to be confused with the card game Hearthstone nor the novel Stone Heart by Charlie Fletcher.It's a medieval town building game where you control what your settlers, also known as Hearthlings, do, somewhat.It has a Sims-esque overhead view where you can position the camera to watch settlers eat, sleep, mourn over the fact they ate a turnip raw, or plant the camera into a nearby mountain and see how fast you can scroll out of the mountain.Enough about the camera, what about the gameplay?It does have strong points, the Hearthlings can farm, mine, deforest an ecosystem for a chair, or be threatened by goblins about 1/3 of their height. Hearthlings don't fight back when attacked by monsters. Oh, sorry, they do. They just have to have another Hearthling be killed in order to do 1/4 a heart of damage. Sort of a human shield metaphor going on.The only ones who will fight back before wimping out because they were attacked are footmen, knights, archers, and walking bandages- whoops. I meant clerics. I thought this supposed to be a town building game, not a DnD set up.Before I continue, I'd just like to point out that the ""hearts"" I speak of serve as a HP bar, rather than, let's say, their health.The combat is interesting, albeit unforgiving if you are outnumbered. Enemies will group up if Hearthlings don't kill them fast enough and they will chop at their health like a chef to a carrot.Speaking of carrots, there's farming. It is quite smart to have a rot system on raw ingredients, but from what I know, cooking the food will eliminate rotting and make it an MRE, essentially. But before your Hearthlings can have a nice serving of cold soup, you must have a cook because it seems like the Hearthlings were spoonfed and never learned how to roast a carrot over the campfire you are given from the very start. Oh yeah, there are levels for jobs as well, still leaning to the DnD metaphor, since the Hearthlings get buffs and skills from leveling up. Extra damage, more recipes, being able to herd sheep you pulled from your bum.""Ok, it looks like I need an archer and a knight since these footmen are getting destroyed by a sentient stump.""""Hold on there! Your footmen are only level 2! They need to be level 3 before you can promote them!

The Hearthlings level up their job by, er, doing their job. Farmers farm, Blacksmiths smith, Soldiers stare at dirt.Some Hearthlings level up faster than others because of their special buffs. There are 3, but based on value, the only ones worth having are Body and Mind. Body (health) is pretty straight forward. Mind makes your Hearthlings level faster and create better versions of items.I didn't really understand that. How does a carpenter take the materials to make 1 chair and create 2, while one chair is of higher quality?The higher quality furniture doesn't have any other use other than having a nicer look and a higher gold value. Trading in this game is similar to other games; Vender sells item at a fixed price, you can sell the same item for half. Sometimes you can get specialty deals from wandering traders.

I'd recommend it only to people with beefy computers.What did you mean ""control the Hearthlings somewhat?"" Hearthlings act like they are their own AI, they run to get a log of wood that is guarded heavily by wolves. They destroy ladders from construction of a building while a Hearthling or 2 are still on the roof. Which, in return, they die from lack of food and things to do.What's a good starting point? Stay in the forests and on ledges, you can dig a trench and monsters won't attack your town (it actually does work based on it's pathfinding).			"

								Stonehearth is a great game by Radiant. This is one of the best purcheses I have made on steam. It's a nice city building game unlike any other! Monsters will attack your colony of hearthlings, but if you're not into the stuff, you can turn them off. The UI is great and it's fun to watch your colony grow to a threiving city. Another really cool thing is that I feel more conected with my hearthlings in Stonehearth then I do my villagers in Banaished or workers in Rise of Nation. They have names, there own look, and you only start off with a handfull so you get to know them very well. Remmeber that the gam is still in alpha, so there will be bugs and lack of content.Good:-City building (I like sandbox city building games)-Can turn enemies on and off-Kid freindly-Nice UI-Can design buildings-If your not gooding at building your own houses, you can use pre-made ones.-Even there it is still alpha, it's not an aboundend Early Access Game like banished and other uncompleted games that are on steam-The devs will sometimes stream them working on the games so they can get live feedback with the fans and can add what the fans want while the fan talks about it.Bad:-It's early access, there are bugs and a lack of content, but they are still coming out with updates to add the contenct. They even have a multiplayer mode planed.-Lack of tutorial so it can be hard for new players, but the games is only in alpha and there most likely will add that later.			"

								Reminds me a lot of dwarf fortress. I can only hope that the game gets that depth and complexity that dwarf fortress has. Excited to see where it goes. Definitely a fun few hours if you like city building type games.For the devs the only thing I wish is turning off the shadows of the clouds. Love the look but right now it slows down the image even through my i4-4790@3.6ghz doesn't get above 50% nor does my memory 16gb ddr3, Radeon R9 200 series. The only thing I can think of is that the shadows/lights isn't making use of all the resources and that causes some slow graphics.very dwarf fortress and when a game tries to do that (in 3d voxels no less) you're gonna run into some funk.

Also, once your guards upgrade, you'll have gear to sell, but save some for the next recruit!!- Blueprints are pretty cool! I made a simple 1 story empty shop for the different shops. I'm about to make a blueprint for each craft. :)- I started at the 2nd level of ground from a lake, 1 story up is stone, so I get the whole shibang.- I'm still trying to get my blacksmith to level 6 so I can craft a gold chest that can hold 256 items. Nice number btw.- I went without a carpenter for a while to have a couple of workers at least- When creating a new game; get the farmer, weaver, and guard items (hoe, spindle, and wooden practice sword)- I haven't noticed any speed increase in having paths, so I use them as asthetics. You'll need the weaver to make a bunch of winter outfits (I'm still in Spring and my workers wear the Winter gear for the speed increase)- QuestionsQ: I haven't hit winter yet; should I expect to have a warm environment built, outside and in?A: My hope: Yes, you're screwed.Q: How long are the seasons? A: 30 days. Just hit dewmon (2nd) :)My theory: 90 days per season, give or take a fewQ: Why do I like this game so much?A: It exceeded my expectations and continues to ensure playabilityOverall (tl;dr), I will give this game an 8.33/10 in its current state and would recommend this to anyone.

								Stonehearth. Not to be confused with the card game Hearthstone nor the novel Stone Heart by Charlie Fletcher.It's a medieval town building game where you control what your settlers, also known as Hearthlings, do, somewhat.It has a Sims-esque overhead view where you can position the camera to watch settlers eat, sleep, mourn over the fact they ate a turnip raw, or plant the camera into a nearby mountain and see how fast you can scroll out of the mountain.Enough about the camera, what about the gameplay?It does have strong points, the Hearthlings can farm, mine, deforest an ecosystem for a chair, or be threatened by goblins about 1/3 of their height. Hearthlings don't fight back when attacked by monsters. Oh, sorry, they do. They just have to have another Hearthling be killed in order to do 1/4 a heart of damage. Sort of a human shield metaphor going on.The only ones who will fight back before wimping out because they were attacked are footmen, knights, archers, and walking bandages- whoops. I meant clerics. I thought this supposed to be a town building game, not a DnD set up.Before I continue, I'd just like to point out that the ""hearts"" I speak of serve as a HP bar, rather than, let's say, their health.The combat is interesting, albeit unforgiving if you are outnumbered. Enemies will group up if Hearthlings don't kill them fast enough and they will chop at their health like a chef to a carrot.Speaking of carrots, there's farming. It is quite smart to have a rot system on raw ingredients, but from what I know, cooking the food will eliminate rotting and make it an MRE, essentially. But before your Hearthlings can have a nice serving of cold soup, you must have a cook because it seems like the Hearthlings were spoonfed and never learned how to roast a carrot over the campfire you are given from the very start. Oh yeah, there are levels for jobs as well, still leaning to the DnD metaphor, since the Hearthlings get buffs and skills from leveling up. Extra damage, more recipes, being able to herd sheep you pulled from your bum.""Ok, it looks like I need an archer and a knight since these footmen are getting destroyed by a sentient stump.""""Hold on there! Your footmen are only level 2! They need to be level 3 before you can promote them! Just have them walk in circles around that small farm plot for 4 hours!""""That seems easy, 4 hours ingame isn't that long, it's 4 minutes.""""No, I meant 4 hours in real time.""So I may have exaggerated there about leveling up.

Review: Alpha 10TL;DR:Do you like games like: Cultures The Settlers 1-4 (Before the serie was butchered) Castle Story City/Town Management games Designing thingsThen this is for you.More about the game:This is a sweet little gem of a game. The play-style is very much as a Cultures-like game, where you give your citizens a profession, which they get better at/more experience with. And then they can learn the next step of the profession tree. As an example Trapper(Hunter), who get's the bright idea that, ""Hey, i can just have animals in a pen, don't have to run around setting traps"". Much like how it works in Cultures, but you do not have any direct control over your citizens besides assigning them jobs. Some jobs, needs a workbench placed (Click on the citizen you have assigned a job to set a workbench), from there you can order items that the worker will make over time. The more they make, the more they can learn to make, some items can also be ""Fine"" which looks nicer.Any citizen that dosen't have anything to do, will help build buildings, mine, gather items and cut trees if given the general order (You select areas to mine/cut trees, which then whoever got time for it goes to do it). The games building system is pretty smart, tho still needs some slight work. Easy to build, place the floor. Auto-snap walls, auto-snap roofs, manually placed windows and doors. But the game also offers building templates, so just click and drop more or less(Works well if you don't want to use time building fancy buildings).There are currently two game modes, one which has enemies (Normal) and one without any dangers (Peaceful). The game is not very challenging just yet. Tho it might be a good idea to try out peaceful, just to get the general hang of things before heading into normal.The game itself looks great, very aesthetically pleasing, the characters look charming, smooth animations, pretty great character variety, trees have different ages and sizes. Terrain looks nice, eventho slightly plain right now. Will be looking forward to a bit more variation.Currently the game is in need of optimization, but that is something that will come along, especially since this is still in a early alpha. Alpha is all about adding new features and stuff for you to do. Optimization mostly comes from the beta. If you get a low framerate, i highly recommend turning down shadows if you have some performance problems.Conclusion:Personaly i really love it, it is a solid city-builder/managing, with some added rpg and combat. I know city-building isen't for everyone, but this is a great entry into the genre.Worth buying, if unsure, take a look at some gameplays!			"

However if you are put off by this: I strongly recommend keeping an eye on it up to it's final release; that will include a multitude of new features.			"

								I'm going to give a cautious thumbs up to this game. It is still very much in Early Access and it shows. There are bugs, unfinished features, very little documentation...pretty much everything you'd expect for a game still in active development.For all that, the devs are very active and quite open about where they are in the process and what they are working on. Much more than most other developers I've followed. It's reassuring to see things go up on their list and bits check checked off as features are added in.And what it does have already is quite fun and I find it rather addictive. Despite a few crashes and failed villages due to bugs, I keep coming back for more. There is just something so engrossing and relaxing about this game, I can't seem to make myself give it up!Personally I'm quite excited to see where it is going, and I think it is going to just get better and better.

								Sadly rare when a Kickstarter game lives up to expectations, but when it does happen they usually knock it out of the park. Stonehearth is one of those rare long-term Kickstarters which I've never regretted for a moment. The dev team is always responsive, the game is constantly evolving, and the community isn't as vile as a lot of toher builder games. It's an easy recommendation for a more casual building-focused DF-like. It's going to be a long haul for these guys as they get everything in this game that they envision, but it's worth every build!			"

								What to say about this game. First, it has a lot of potential. I believe it takes the best parts of games like Minecraft and Timber and Stone and meshes them together to make a charming little building/simulation game.For now, I'll do 5 Pros and 5 Cons.PROS:-Designing buildings is quite intuitive and easy to use-RPG-ish ""leveling system"" of jobs for your hearthlings to improve them-Can move your hearthlings similar to an RTS by putting them into parties-Relaxing and charming sound track-Active and determined dev crew that listens to player issuesCONS:-Sometimes hearthlings don't tend to certain tasks and will sit idle (can be bypassed in a few different ways)-Designing multi-level buildings requires finesse and sometimes doesn't want to work the way you hoped-Combat needs a little tweaking. If enemies run away, even if you hit them, they take no damage.-Currently there are various errors and cpu-usage spikes.-All in all, this game is only going to get better and is a perfect fit for anyone who likes to build, create, and/or manage towns and people.

Also, once your guards upgrade, you'll have gear to sell, but save some for the next recruit!!- Blueprints are pretty cool! I made a simple 1 story empty shop for the different shops. I'm about to make a blueprint for each craft. :)- I started at the 2nd level of ground from a lake, 1 story up is stone, so I get the whole shibang.- I'm still trying to get my blacksmith to level 6 so I can craft a gold chest that can hold 256 items. Nice number btw.- I went without a carpenter for a while to have a couple of workers at least- When creating a new game; get the farmer, weaver, and guard items (hoe, spindle, and wooden practice sword)- I haven't noticed any speed increase in having paths, so I use them as asthetics. You'll need the weaver to make a bunch of winter outfits (I'm still in Spring and my workers wear the Winter gear for the speed increase)- QuestionsQ: I haven't hit winter yet; should I expect to have a warm environment built, outside and in?A: My hope: Yes, you're screwed.Q: How long are the seasons? A: 30 days. Just hit dewmon (2nd) :)My theory: 90 days per season, give or take a fewQ: Why do I like this game so much?A: It exceeded my expectations and continues to ensure playabilityOverall (tl;dr), I will give this game an 8.33/10 in its current state and would recommend this to anyone. In fact, I'm about to send it to a friend.			"

Early Access Review
								I want to love this game sooo much. It has so much going for it. There are just a few flaws in logistics that are keeping it from being perfect.The AI is terrible - My workers are currently all standing around ""idle"" while I have crap everywhere that needs to be collected (ores, wood, wool, farm goods). There is no way to direct them to do what they are supposed to be doing.  I end up having to use the cancel option to permanently delete the items even though some are super rare. Amazing when i tell the workers to delete the item they are all over it....There is no way to edit the land once you have mined it. If you make a mistake...oh well...i hope you are not OCD like me. I currently have the grass layer near my village floating in the sky because either i made a mistake or my workers did not do as they were told.Finally, once food starts going bad in your storage it is a nightmare. Your workers do not remove this rotten food on their own accord. You must manually delete each basket of rotten food. Im at the point now where I literally spend a quarter of my day scoping out the food storage to remove these rotten baskets.This game is definitley on the right track but I would still wait until release to see if these kinks will be worked out. If they are this would likely become one of my favorite games in this genre on steam.TL:DR- AI needs work- Need an option to turn off rotting food or make workers remove it on their own- Need a few more land editing options in case you make a mistake (or your workers)This is a great title and I hope they continue to improve these imperfections. Giving it a thumbs up for encouragement to the Devs!			"

								Stonehearth is a great game by Radiant. This is one of the best purcheses I have made on steam. It's a nice city building game unlike any other! Monsters will attack your colony of hearthlings, but if you're not into the stuff, you can turn them off. The UI is great and it's fun to watch your colony grow to a threiving city. Another really cool thing is that I feel more conected with my hearthlings in Stonehearth then I do my villagers in Banaished or workers in Rise of Nation. They have names, there own look, and you only start off with a handfull so you get to know them very well. Remmeber that the gam is still in alpha, so there will be bugs and lack of content.Good:-City building (I like sandbox city building games)-Can turn enemies on and off-Kid freindly-Nice UI-Can design buildings-If your not gooding at building your own houses, you can use pre-made ones.-Even there it is still alpha, it's not an aboundend Early Access Game like banished and other uncompleted games that are on steam-The devs will sometimes stream them working on the games so they can get live feedback with the fans and can add what the fans want while the fan talks about it.Bad:-It's early access, there are bugs and a lack of content, but they are still coming out with updates to add the contenct. They even have a multiplayer mode planed.-Lack of tutorial so it can be hard for new players, but the games is only in alpha and there most likely will add that later.			"

								So... Stonehearth.It's Early Access, and noticably so. Bugs, the fps drops lower the further you progress, your Hearthlings don't respond to commands, yada yada. Still, these bugs don't ruin the experience. Lower your expectations, it's not a fully completed game.The -in my opinion- biggest problem with this game, is the lack of difficulty scaling. Normal mode starts slightly difficult, but it gets too easy very quickly. There is a hard mode, but it suffers the same fate, except that it starts out very difficult.Once you've set up your farms and hunting grounds, your walls, your houses, there's not much that can hurt you anymore.Monsters don't destroy structures, which is both good and bad.Good, because given how clunky and weird the building system is, having walls get holes in them would be annoying to repair, unless hearthlings do it automatically, and then it becomes pointless. Bad, because they don't destroy anything. Put up some picket fences around a goblin camp without them attacking? Good job, they can't do anything to you now.With having said all this, the blue thumbs up might look strange, since all I've said are the negatives.But now that they're out of the way, I've got to say, this game is fantastic.The things that work, work really well.Having multiple combat squads, for example. Easy to assign, easy to control, incredibly satisfying to attack monsters from multiple angles, with seperate squads. Mining is easy, and the slice system is a godsend (and a necessity) for making multi-layer mines. The x-ray mode (it's not for finding ores easily, don't worry) is also fantastic. Being able to see your structures without all the other stuff in the way, it's great.And there is so much more good to be said about this game.Hearthling (they're the settlers, for clarification) professions are nice, and really allows for a personal story. Have a Trapper who has been there, doing the same work, for al the days he's been in the village? Let him retire, by making him a Shepherd (not saying all shepherds have easy lives, just that the hearthling ones seem to be in no rush, as they slowly walk through your village)!Maybe your farmer has farmed for so long that they've inevitably gotten exquisite knowledge about what they're doing?Promote them to a cook, and let them fill the metaphorical stomachs of your hearthlings!So, do I recommend this game?Obviously. But I also recommend patience when playing it. Everything won't go 100% perfectly, but if you work past the bugs, you'll have a fantastic time.			"

								This game has more in it than one would expect from an Alpha game. There is such a huge amount of fun to be had during your first play through, if you don't die that is, while unlocking the new jobs you can assign to your citizens. The game is cute and also quite the management simulator making decisions on what products you need vs how fast or what order you should do them in in order to keep your troops geared and healed to keep protecting your town etc. Overall this game is gonna get 4 big stars from me. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 is tha the combat is just a bit bland. There are the healers, archers, and melee units. There is no differences between healers and archers they all work the same there is just a slight difference in melee units. All melee you will face only damage 1 of your guys at a time and just have a smack battle to see who dies first the only melee that is different are the giant ogres which have an aoe. So the combat is very cool looking and you have a lot of control as to what your individual fights do but the actual mechanic variety in the enemies is low to non but hey its Alpha theres alot of potential to be had.

								Amazing game. Having a ton of fun on it so far. However, I've had to completely ditch a few of my well-built worlds because of bugs. Sometimes I have to restart my world because it bugs out and my hearthlings won't build a building I've requested them to build.Also, I wish there was a way to make seperate rooms in a building. I mean, you can with freestanding walls, but the freestanding walls have ugly columns and if you connect it to a corner, then it makes these ugly columns. If you could hide the columns on the freestanding walls it'd be good.Other than the massive amount of bugs (only because the game is in early access right now), the game is amazing and I enjoy it a ton.

They are excellent people, work on every bug they can, are very transparent and posts constant updates in their blogs. If you're afraid of buying it because it is in EA, then you shouldn't be afraid anymore. Just hit their website www.stonehearth.net and take a look at their roadmap and devblog updates.			"

Early Access Review
								OK, Where to start.Well the game doesnt have an autosave so my first 3 hours are no longer exsistant. So SAVE REGULARLY. Other than a few engine bugs and trapped citizens the game performs well. By trapped citizens, i had to start 3 different saves as the citizens would spawn in some tress and be trapped up there. Engine bugs tend to happen when i place items into the chests.Its fun to an extent, once you have a knight, invaders are kind pointless as they dont really get stronger, just the same enemies in a bigger group. When you get a cleric it becomes stupidly easier to fend off invasions as they seem to heal only the knight and the knight likes to tank everything in the vicinity allowing for quick easier kills on everything else with archers or footmen.DO NOT BUILD TOWERS IN A HOUSE OR CITIZENS WILL KILL THEM SELVES BY BUILDING THE WALLS AROUND THEMSELVES.Farmers seem to be a bit slow a tending crops as well as having a short attention span, would be nice if you could assign a farmer to a specific group of plot.Altogether, Great game. Would recomend if you like being god.  Just dont build into the mountain side like i did, hard to grow crops under 40ft of stone.EDIT: There is an auto save, im just a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot.			"

Would highly recommend this game to anybody,Now for the down side: You only get 20 citizens through the game play so doing the combat quests can be a little hard if you dont strategize, also sometime the path will break when placing an object and an error message will pop up.

This game is definitely worth your money, it's a great combination of RPG and City building and has many planned features that are currently being added or will be added eventually. Another great thing this game has is its active developers, who have consistently provided updates on the games progress and listened to the communities feedback, so you always know what's going down and will never leave the community out of loop wondering where the games is *Cough* Cube World *Cough*. If you want to see for yourself simply go to stonehearth.net and visit the Dev Blog.So if you're into city builders, RPG's and active developers this game is for you.			"

								I really do love the concept of this game.  The game has settlers left in the wilds to fend for themselves.  They slowly start to learn the basics to create their own city and a home for themeslves.At this point, though, the game is not ready.  The bugs are hard to get over and the game has not been updated to handle 'end of game' content or what happens when you level.  I build a place for everyone to sleep, to eat and then I'm pretty much done.  I have everyone collect resources, but really this only happens sometimes.  My blacksmith or Mason level up to create new things for my settlement, but I'm unable to impliment them, I don't see a reason to use them, and I can't make my own due to glitches.  Now I don't want you to stray from the basic game.  Despite this all, as I frist stated, the game is headed in the right direction and I hope it continues that way.  If the developer can pull this all together I think we'll have a huge hit on our hands a game I won't be able to stop playing.I do think the game is worth a try!  Watch out for the goblins!			"

								I've always been big on strategy games (since mid-late 90s) where you build your base, army, and go off killing those who try to kill me, such as command & conquer series, age of empires series, stronghold series and more.  I saw this game, ""Stonehearth"", on Kickstarter and just loved the whole concept.  they even had a great goals display to show you what their plans are.  Now I was skeptical to even put my money down because I was afraid they will just stop eventually and disappear like a great game that had potential, (The Stomping Land).I must say I’m very happy to have put my money in and then support them.  I played it since the beginning, even though I only have a total of about 15hrs, I just fell in love.  I stopped playing so that it can come up with better fixes, changes like any newly forming games.  I played it recently within few months and my goodness, it's even better!  they even have a dev map and objectives! I love it!Honestly, I highly consider this game to anyone that likes this whole minecraftish, base building, survival sandbox.  you can wait to buy it later or buy now, still great.  the dev's constantly work on this, they don't quit, they find more issues and fix them. they show videos on what they are working on, their issues they've encountered and so on.  I’m glad I put my money into this game.  i know in few months, this will become better than it is now with the speed and dedication all these workers put in. "

								StoneHearth has a very ""cutesy"" and ""family friendly"" look to it, and has a good and wide range of genres mixed together. its a great game for kids and adults alike.now the game is not ""feature complete"" or anything like that, it still has a lot of content to be added, but dont worry the devs wont give up, and most certaintly will finish the game.word of warning, the game is still very buggy. but then again that is the entire point of an alpha, squash the bugs and add awesome content. if you dont like the idea of playing a game that has lots of bugs and potential to crash, then this game is not for you. however if you love being right up front helping the devs hunt down and squash those bugs, then i recomend this game.Edit: it's been over a year since i reviewed this game, and i gotta say, Stonehearth has come a looonng way since my original review. the game has a ton of new features: new playable race, new monsters and campaigns, bunch of new classes, perfomrance improvements. and a bunch of other good stuff. and yes, there are still bugs and some crahses, but they'tend to be less frequent as before.so even after a year, i'd still recomend this game to anyone who likes town/city builders, early acces games, finding/reporting bugs, and being part of a great and friendly comunity.

								Stonehearth; the strategy survival game that isn't to be confused with Hearthstone. Now this is a great game and although it still lies within the grasps of ""EARLY ACCESS"" it has much potential that i can see it achieving in the future. With a very proud company stood behind it (Radiant) it is always improving, updating and upgrading your experience. However there are downsides to this game still being in early access. One being that the game still has many bugs which torment you throughout gameplay. One of my examples is the building bugs, now to begin i must say when i first saw this game i invisioned in my mind a huge expanding town with tall walls and a vast amount of buildings. Needless to say when i started designing and trying to create my own buildings i came up with one of the greatest problems. Buildings are at this point (alpha 16) really difficult to design without your heathlings (Settlers) just simply giving up mid-way. Now this is an issue that the company is working hard to address and you can see they are via their YouTube channel but still makes me suffer when trying to play this game how i want to play it. With other minor bugs that still annoy me throughout playing i still really enjoy this game and i love the abilities it has right now and is still improving! This game has so much to it and just to summarise:- Lots of different skills and professions- Tons of dynamic and varying enemies - Beautiful unique graphics- A world to explore and settle within - Over 100 items and resources to useI only have about 20 hours of gameplay (as of writing this review) but hope to get many more out of new alpha releases and maybe one day we will see this game be complete after its polished as this game could be great but falls short due to bugs and problems. Maybe consider supporting the creators to keep working on the game and give it a try.Would recommend! :)			"

								When I first saw the trailer for Stonehearth, I was immediately attracted to its style, town management and building mechanics. It reminded me of Banished, a game that I also enjoyed, so I decided to buy it. After the dozen or so hours I put into it, I was found quickly bored and frustrated because of three mainly reasons:1. Population GrowthThe rate at which I was gaining citizens was painfully slow, as in the game, you to have a certain amount of wealth to attract the next villager into your town. This is what I also find annoying about having to start new saves as it was a set back to my previously impressive kingdom that I grinded in another save file.2. A.I. PathfindingI cannot count the amount of times I would have my villagers refuse to build ladders for a newly dug mine. This might seem obscure to a person who has never played this game, but when three of your citizens in your already small town (because of poor population growth) are stuck doing nothing in a mine, the town's productivity is gone and the game grinds to a halt, and it's frustrating! I then have to try and speculate to why they were not building the ladder that would get them out of the mine, so I reloading the save, deleted the ladder's blueprints and then adding them again and it starts to make me feel like a moron who thinks turning their computer on and off will remove a virus!3. Creating buildingsAnother aspect that I thought would be fun was the building mechanics of the game. I was quickly shown otherwise as I was swiftly discouraged from using their complex and bizarre building system. Its hard to describe, but think of trying to build a house in the Sims, but with no clear formatting of what should go where and having to place every single block at a time. Maybe I such at building, I don't know /:However, for the time I did play, it was fun. I enjoyed the art style of the cuboid people, living in a cubic world and eating cubic food. I also found great pleasure when mining. Finding that first gold ore was overwhelmingly satisfying.I do believe that these problems that I have issues with will be fixed in patches that will better polish the game's flaws. But so far, the biggest problem that stands is that THERE'S NOTHING TO DO! You can grow your town, but for what purpose. The newly joined villagers will be turned merely into food workers and with nothing the military can fight or do, besides monsters that almost three shot your workers, there's no overarching goal like finding new and interesting technologies/problem solving situation or anything of that matter. If you are not a scrub at the game like I am, comment on what you can do in game please.I truly hope I haven't offended any veteran of the game, but I'm just hoping to inform problems that a newbie like ""I"" have faced.

								I've always been big on strategy games (since mid-late 90s) where you build your base, army, and go off killing those who try to kill me, such as command & conquer series, age of empires series, stronghold series and more.  I saw this game, ""Stonehearth"", on Kickstarter and just loved the whole concept.  they even had a great goals display to show you what their plans are.  Now I was skeptical to even put my money down because I was afraid they will just stop eventually and disappear like a great game that had potential, (The Stomping Land).I must say I’m very happy to have put my money in and then support them.  I played it since the beginning, even though I only have a total of about 15hrs, I just fell in love.  I stopped playing so that it can come up with better fixes, changes like any newly forming games.  I played it recently within few months and my goodness, it's even better!  they even have a dev map and objectives! I love it!Honestly, I highly consider this game to anyone that likes this whole minecraftish, base building, survival sandbox.  you can wait to buy it later or buy now, still great.  the dev's constantly work on this, they don't quit, they find more issues and fix them. they show videos on what they are working on, their issues they've encountered and so on.  I’m glad I put my money into this game.  i know in few months, this will become better than it is now with the speed and dedication all these workers put in. "

								I really do love the concept of this game.  The game has settlers left in the wilds to fend for themselves.  They slowly start to learn the basics to create their own city and a home for themeslves.At this point, though, the game is not ready.  The bugs are hard to get over and the game has not been updated to handle 'end of game' content or what happens when you level.  I build a place for everyone to sleep, to eat and then I'm pretty much done.  I have everyone collect resources, but really this only happens sometimes.  My blacksmith or Mason level up to create new things for my settlement, but I'm unable to impliment them, I don't see a reason to use them, and I can't make my own due to glitches.  Now I don't want you to stray from the basic game.  Despite this all, as I frist stated, the game is headed in the right direction and I hope it continues that way.  If the developer can pull this all together I think we'll have a huge hit on our hands a game I won't be able to stop playing.I do think the game is worth a try!  Watch out for the goblins!			"

								I love this game, it'll keep you entertained for hours as you build up your town and train your men. Lots of crafting and expansion to be achieved in here. Weither you're building houses or carving your base into a mountain, or just building walls and defenses or training a small army to be undefeatable, you will not get bored here. Would highly recommend this game to anybody,Now for the down side: You only get 20 citizens through the game play so doing the combat quests can be a little hard if you dont strategize, also sometime the path will break when placing an object and an error message will pop up. But that's honestly all I have to say bad about it.			"

								While I may not have that many hours for this game on steam, I have played more than 20+ hours outside of Steam and have been following it since it first appeared on Kickstarter. This game is definitely worth your money, it's a great combination of RPG and City building and has many planned features that are currently being added or will be added eventually. Another great thing this game has is its active developers, who have consistently provided updates on the games progress and listened to the communities feedback, so you always know what's going down and will never leave the community out of loop wondering where the games is *Cough* Cube World *Cough*. If you want to see for yourself simply go to stonehearth.net and visit the Dev Blog.So if you're into city builders, RPG's and active developers this game is for you.			"

								Stonehearth... Seems like a rips off from Trove and the name like a rip off from Hearyhstone but, it is far from a rip off. It is indeed similar to Gnomoria from what I've seen but it differs greatly. This game has great potential if only few more things were to be added. Right now it isn't worth £18,99, I would say a tad less but at the same time I understand that a game like this is expensive to make and constantly add things to it as well as making a profit. I have quite a few hours on this game and if I was to say that I don't like this I would be lying because it's greatly enjoyable if you're into these sort of games. At the start of the game you choose whom you wish to be and where you will start but either way you are thrown into the deep end of the pool if you don't chose your map to which favours you're gameplay etc. Normal in this game can be rather at the begining so I would recommend starting at peaceful before being use to it. Anyway the game is still in early access so not much can be said but the fact that if you know that you will enjoy the game then buy it but bare in mind it's still not 100% finished and it may take a while before it is but I enjoyed it, I still play it and I would most defenitly recommend this game even though it is a tad bit expensive.

								I kickstarted this game when it first showed up on kickstarter back in 2013.  It looked like a game with a lot of heart, and I believe it shows even in the early access stage.This game reminds me of Minecraft due to its graphical style and its voxel based world.  It however runs with the idea of building a civilization out of a small group of starting ""hearthlings"" as they are called.  You start with just a group of ""hearthlings"" and some supplies and then are tasked with creating a thriving kingdom from that.There are also a decent amount of mods available that add objects or campaigns to the game and they are worth checking out once you have some experience with the vanilla game.While there is not a lot of content in the game right now it is a fun little game that you can mess around with.  The updates seem to be more frequent now that the games development has hit the add content/fix bugs stage.			"

								I had fun playing this game. I really love to see this game to get optimized and be able to play without worrying about the performance. So far, the game starts to lag or slows down after a long session of this game. Hence, you have no other choice but to abandone the current game and start a new game. This cycle keeps going until you get annoyed since all your hardwork were for nothing since you have to abandone them just to avoid the lag. I really want to still play the game but knowing that I wont be able to get far on this game, I just give up on playing altogether.I hope they fix whatever is causing these lags/performance drops asap. For now, I would avoid buying this game yet on it's current state (Alpha 21).			"

								TL;DR - If you like sim/survival games à la Gnomoria, Craft the World, etc... This game VERY worth it.This is one of the best Dwarf Fortress clone on the market at the moment. It beats games like Gnomoria out of the water mainly because of slick UI and easy to navigate Z axis for depth mining.There are bugs. But nothing extremely game breaking at the moment, the devs seem to be doing a good job of cleaning up their code.As some people mentioned, VERY CPU intensive. I've noticed that it seems the game has a memory leak problem, it'll run smooth for a few hours, but after 3-4 hours straight in one settlement, it starts to frame lag. Closing the program, waiting, and restarting fixes this. So at least it's not something permanent even if you have 30+ settles and a lot of business on the screen.I love the Tech tree idea, I hope it will come with a lots more jobs and advacements.Building design is HARD! If you're new, don't bother with it, take the default buildings and run with that. After a few games you can start banging your head on the design thing. It's not intuitive, that's the biggest problem, but once you get the functions, it DOES get  quite easy.Pros- FUN! The game might not be feature complete, but it's a hell of a lof of fun- Slick UI and non-confusing X,Y,Z in 3D environment nagivation (not easy to do imho)-Crafting! Gosh I love crafting, and this has already quite a few recipes.

								TL;DR - If you like sim/survival games à la Gnomoria, Craft the World, etc... This game VERY worth it.This is one of the best Dwarf Fortress clone on the market at the moment. It beats games like Gnomoria out of the water mainly because of slick UI and easy to navigate Z axis for depth mining.There are bugs. But nothing extremely game breaking at the moment, the devs seem to be doing a good job of cleaning up their code.As some people mentioned, VERY CPU intensive. I've noticed that it seems the game has a memory leak problem, it'll run smooth for a few hours, but after 3-4 hours straight in one settlement, it starts to frame lag. Closing the program, waiting, and restarting fixes this. So at least it's not something permanent even if you have 30+ settles and a lot of business on the screen.I love the Tech tree idea, I hope it will come with a lots more jobs and advacements.Building design is HARD! If you're new, don't bother with it, take the default buildings and run with that. After a few games you can start banging your head on the design thing. It's not intuitive, that's the biggest problem, but once you get the functions, it DOES get  quite easy.Pros- FUN! The game might not be feature complete, but it's a hell of a lof of fun- Slick UI and non-confusing X,Y,Z in 3D environment nagivation (not easy to do imho)-Crafting! Gosh I love crafting, and this has already quite a few recipes. Could have a lot more, hope it gets more, but already very satisfactory- Sound and music: bravo- The two different tribes and map types give interesting variation in gameplay. - Some jobs are retro compatible, e.g. cook will keep faming.

								Im sorry this game is so amazing, theres just too many glitches to make it worth 24.00. The game is very well made with its mechanics and gameplal, just atleast every 5 minuets I run into a game breaking glitch. The most popular one ive found so far is when workers just stop doing there tasks, for examample one time I spent a good 10 minuits planning a new HUGE portion of one of my villages, clicked ""start building"", everything was going fine, then all my workers decided to sit down and have lunch. Once they were done they just stood. No matter what tried I couldnt fix it and had to restart. I found this glitch happens 70% of the time whenever you build anything, weatheer its a small 1 person cottage to half your village this glitch will happen. I really really want to give this game a big thumbs up but I cant do that until the developers fix these game breaking bugs and glitches. "

								I've been on the fence about if this game is good or not, but this small little bug pushed me over. One of my Guards who were on duty spoted an enemy and attacked. Good as usual, until I noticed the enemy was away some ways, then when the guard started to loose (he had the smallest amount of health left) he ran away. Which is good, unless after taking 3 steps away he ran back and died. 1 of my Hearthlings died, because the game didn't let him run away and heal. My Hearthlings also nearly died when they got trapped in a mine and the other Hearthlings on the surface (who where generic workers) wouldn't build a ladder down to save them, so I had to demote a farmer and that worked. But cmon! Stop adding things until these bugs are fixed! Soon enough my town will die out because there's no food though there are 7 plot fulls of food sitting infront of there eyes!			"

								Disclosure: I backed this game on kickstarterHonestly, I think this is the most gameplay-filled and most stable ""Alpha"" I've ever played.  There are some bugs and glitches here and there (Your villagers are REALLY dumb, keep an eye on them or they'll get themselves trapped somewhere and starve to death) but it is absolutely playable and very fun.I would call this game, as it is right now, a very casual version of the Dwarf Fortress/Gnomoria genre.  While it is not nearly as in depth or complicated as those games (yet), it has a great style and good UI that is more approachable than those games.The in game tutorial is brief but really good for easing you into this genre.The building system is also head and shoulders above other games in the genre allowing you to create unique and interesting buildings for your villagers very easily.The two factions campaigns are very short, unfortunately, and after the 30ish hours I've put in I feel I've seen most of what this current build has to offer in terms of prescripted events and variety of activities.  I look forward to more things being added later, but certainly feel I've gotten my money's worth already.			"

								Just spent three hours trying to create a house. Did not work. Game engine produced weird errors even when I just tried to design a square room. Two-level buildings are almost impossible to create due to the lack of stairs. Buildings cant be edited after initial design and even while drawing the blueprint it is obviously not possible to remove a wall. Nah, sorry, I know this is alpha and as such it looks great. But at the moment, you cant really do anything else than use predesigned buildings which kind of takes away the whole idea of minecraft-style block building. So I will bury this for now and hope the devs hurry to continue implementing the basics instead of inventing new factions and terrains.			"

								Before you play even though the reviews are very positive, make sure there is a sale before spending $25 or so.The game somewhat acts alot like Rimworld and Minecraft except you cant manually control your civilians.Bugs Ive encountered: missing heads, or head is where the torso of the character is, Stop building and working, no tutorial even though it takes around a hour to figure out how things work. For me after and hour of playing, didnt even save the game yet, a UI error appeared and the game broke, it was somewhat playable but i couldnt open my building tabs or job menus.... this was truly a waste of $25... ive read the reviews and watched gameplay... i reccomend you buy this when it is fully developed or when they lower the prive because this is more of a $10 game than it is $25... But hey add some things and it might even be worth $14.99 but not $25, even if everything is fixed and done it wont be worth $25, thats just a ripoff.			"

								TL;DRToo exensive for so little content.In itself the game has a lot of potential. Basically it is a RTS Minecraft more or less. You decide what your villagers build, what furniture or weapons they craft etc etc.Sadly, the content so far is very limited. And it does not feel like there is any progress in this regard.After the first few nights it feels like there is nothing left to do. You have accomodation, a few farms and traps and a small military squad to fend off invaders.From that point onward it is literally just wathing your villagers eat and sleep.If the devs would add more content this would definitely be a recommendation. But in its current state the game is way too expensive.			"

								TL;DR= Wait to get it- give it a few more updates or wait until it's on sale, and then try it. It's going to be a super-fun game when it's finished. :)------I really, really want to love this game, and there's SOOOO MUCH POTENTIAL! Especially if they fill in the ""talent/job trees"" and optimize the graphics a bit.""Why I'm downvoting"": I'm usually really comfortable with games with lots of bugs in it- I can generally find a run-around and it's not a big deal.However in the case of Stonehearth, several of the bugs are completely game breaking (Not finishing building construction, villagers idling without reason, crafting tables not working (GUI reloads not working), etc..) and due to one reason or another I've found I've had to start a new game every 2-3 hours or so.  Which is frustrating when the game is pretty much all about resource gathering and village progression/development.When it's finished/optimized, I will absolutely re-throw my money at the developers wholeheartedly.

								I enjoy this game for the first 30 or so minutes but you can tell it's still a work in progress. One major issue I have problems with is after about 30 minutes of game time it slows down and starts lagging. I'm not sure of the reason for this, I assume it's because it's loading more of the map into RAM as I explore. So i find that the more of the map I explore the slower the game becomes until it's basically unplayable. Once this issue with lag and RAM hogging is resolved it would be a great game and I will recommend the game.			"

								I have been monitoring this game since the early days of donations. Since then it has become one of my most favorite games. It combines indepth building with town management gamplay aswell as nice graphics that give it a unique feel. if you can overlook a few minor bugs this game is a must have for your collection.			"

								After a few hours of play i think this game is very promising but has bugs which has caused me to quit towns multiple times. main game breaking bug is when the workers stop building a building leaving scaffolding and a half made building in your city with no way of deleting the half done building. Once these have been fixed and further content is added i see myself spending hours designing cities and defenses.			"

								It has the potential to become something great, but i feel the game is a little disorganized in gameplay.  Theres some micromanagement needed to produce goods, and I feel the hearthlings needs better AI to collect reasources and items that are just lying on the ground. Not only that I have trouble crafting because i don't have an instant idea of what reasources i already have and and what i need to craft new items and even build buildings. I guess what I think the game really needs right now is for the hearthlings to become more intilligent and autnomous so that they're always doing something productive other than restocking the stockpile when i'm not giving orders.These are all things i think should be dealt with as the game updates. Quite frankly i'm impressed that the game is set to continue running depsite all the erros and bugs that pop up which is of course a clear indication that the game still needs some polishing. But I am sure that once this game is eventually completed it should become something very fun.			"

								Been playing stonehearth for some time now. Devs are great people and listen to their audience. They are fast paced at fixing issues and listen when you give advice. The game itself is amazing, even in early stages like this. With each new alpha the game grows phenomenally, and gives you so many additional things to do. It has it's bugs yes, but its early access and people need to remember that. If you bug out, read into it, find out if its common, and talk about it. We have the opportunity to form this game and make it what it is that we all want to play. Give the devs your ideas, but remember. They are gamers just like us, and want to help end our boredom and give us something great!			"

								This game has potential but as of right now I think they are asking for a bit much when it seems they don't have that much yet. The game is super laggy just a couple of minutes in to gameplay even on a monster gaming pc. And the gameplay engine seems very un-optimized when it comes to queing orders of building or crafting. For some reason they just refuse to make stuff for the longest of times and blacksmiths focus more on building than cfrating what you ordered and so on. Doesnt seem to be other players as of yet even ai is only limited too some random single or up to five unit squads attacking, but no bases or ai players to attack or loot. Very small map too. Still I am going to put this as a positive review because of the potential and what this game could be. Please dear developer, don't screw your fans over. You have asked a high price and received it, please live up to the expectations that come with it.But no updates in a long time and to many bus for me to recommend.			"

I have had so much fun exploring each map and seed and building new building and designing cave homes and designing mines and everything i could think of the bugs are so minimul if present at all. I reall suggest this game for anyone who likes/liked Bansihed or games along those lines. The only bad point for me is thatfor me the maps you chose and settle in the area is a little small for me.

								I've had this game for about six months now. Enjoyed it a lot ! This game is brilliant and is kind of  defining a new game ""genre"" with it's unsual mix. Minecraft, Final Fantasy Tactics, real-time strategy with complex economy and yet... a significant touch of RPG. You really have to try it in order to understand the thin line on which the devs are refining the new concept. One of the best thing is probably it's adaptability. The game let you choose without asking or inteferring if you want to focus on building peacefully or on the adventure and the fighting... or both. You don't have to developp and max every job tree available, yet you can try and face a really interesting challenge.BUT... I'm beginning to be bored. Maybe it's the fact that the game developped so fast during the first months... now the last 2 alphas we're about the building system. But everytime I come back and try and lunch a new game to see if the bugs in the building system got rid of... I just face the same fact : those scaffolding are driving me mad ! It's still impossible to build a decent 10x14 blocs, 2 floors house without having those staying on the stairs inside or on the walls or on the cliffs or...whatever... Are the devs going to clear this bug definitely one day ?			"

								I have been playing Stonehearth since very early access (Alpha 2 roughly). It has been a true joy to watch this game grow from the core mechanics into what it is now.I will not say that the game is complete or necessarily good. There is a lot of content still to implement, features to add and polish to be put in, but as it stands, Stonehearth is playable and offers several hours worth of gameplay in its current state. Given the price of almost $30, I would not recommend buying it unless you want into the early access system. The game does not, currently, have $30 worth of content.In spite of that, I do strongly recommend this game, both now and most likely when it leaves early access. The team is dedicated and communication is open and transparent. The game's modability is very good and new content rolls out every few weeks, showing that development is definitely active and lively.			"

								Stonehearth is a rather charming village builder. You start out with a handfull of ""Hearthlings"" to start out your village. By making buildings, gathering food, getting wealth, and keeping moral you can grow your population. I have been playing this on and off for the past year or so and have seen some great improvements from the devs and can't wait to see what is coming in the future. You kind of have to be in the right mood to play this game; sort of in a relaxed, animated fantasy sort of mood. But I suppose you kind of have to be in the right mood to play any game. Today, I'm going to break the mold and start with cons:-It's still in alpha. There are some bugs yet and I have found some in various parts of the game. -There isn't much of an end game. (That I know of)-the bugs that are fixed cometimes create new bugs. Pros:-The building aspect offers some cusomization with custom floor plan, building material, and a bit on roof design.-Depending on which job you give your Hearthling, they will progress in levels and you can promote them to an advanced job or let them increase their level at the current job and be more productive.-You have hard mode which offers a big challenge to your management with planning and managing. -The devs are very active and take in feedback and bug reports and fix them within a few weeks. -The devs also keep regular updates in blogs every other (or every) Tuesday about what's going on and near future plans. -I enjoy the cartoony art style. The Hearthlings are cute and the monsters are kind of ugly but in a cartoon, funny kind of way. -There is a job tree with various different jobs to give your villagers which is still in progress but improving with every alpha release. Hope this helps.			"

								One of the backers, here. Game is still in early alpha, but, by this point, has a fair amount to offer. Multiple-story buildings, combat, raids and counter-raids, and some nasties that come say hi at night. Great town simulation game with fun RPG elements.At the moment it's still short of what it wants to be, but with the progress the devs have made in the transparency in their progression, I doubt it will be long before you can play with your buddies and experience the other classes and goodies the game will offer.It's a game I've had fun coming back to nearly every update, and one that I eagerly await release of.

								As a big fan of games like Minecraft and Civilization I decided to buy Stonehearth even though it is only an Alpha. I am very impressed from playing so far (Alpha v11), yes there are bugs which can be game breaking and there is so much more that needs to be added, but this really has the beginnings of a good game. I've done a couple of play throughs and am getting the hang of managing the little town and it is very addictive. At the moment there is a bit of a lack of things to do at the later stages of the game, mining for minerals has only recently been added and beyond upgrading gear doesn't seem to have much purpose, but I'm sure more will be added.Of course, it is still in Alpha so there are many issues that can be annoying, the AI of your workers can be poor at times and they can just get stuck doing nothing. I think it would really benefit this game to allow some control over individual workers, or at least allow some prioritization of tasks because at the moment it is a bit frustrating when for example you want a worker to pick something up that he's stood next to but he just doesn't do it.These bugs aside the game is very promising and I will certainly be following its development closely. If bugs annoy you then I would wait for the retail version. If, like me, you like the look of the game and can't wait, then I don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

								Read the reviews. Don't buy the game unless you are interested in its development. Game has some game breaking issues and bugs. Biggest issue for me at the moment is that buildings CANNOT be destroyed or deconstructed, without using console commands. -Graphics are perfect for this type of game.-UI feels more like a browser game UI. Game its self is great and has some potential.-Some advice if you do want to buy and play it, is to save often so if your building bugs out and doesn't get completed or you don't like how it turned out you can just load a previous save.

								Fun in concept but garbage in reality, the AI is crap and often abandons jobs or mining sites for no reason and you gotta struggle trying to figure out a way to get them to clear that piece of land or finish building a certain building. And often they will refuse to remove the structures no matter how many times you command them to remove it. Only hope at that point is to start a new game or have a village that looks half abandoned.So it's all inconvenientWhen the game actually works, it works well, but until it's updated futher it's not really something I'd reccomend, the games description and screenshots hype it up a lot more than it needs to be, as do the reviews. The game will be fixed in a matter of decades, early access games have a habbit of not being completed or living up to the real potential or hype, like most kickstarter campaigns.tldr; gay game			"

								Despite being in Alpha, this game has already come a long way.I've been playing Stonehearth for quite a long time now and it has never ceased to please me. The game's developers are active and it gets updated frequently, which is always great to see. Many things inside the game are customisable, such as the design of your buildings.My ONLY grudge are the bugs and errors that sometimes occur, but being in Alpha this is fully understandable, and the devs really seem to pay attention to their community and knuckle down those pesky things. They have a great concept and I can only see it getting better from here. If you're a fan of the town-building/defense genre with money to spend, look no further than Stonehearth.  "

								I might change this with further updates but as of now i wouldn't reccomend getting this.When i bought this i thought it would be a bit like a minecrafty version of Rimworld but its not really.It's like rimworld but 1. the ai storyteller isn't trying to actively kill you ( a plus ) and 2. the building is realy realy horrible.Everything and i mean everything is made using that new building button, so you end up with roads counting as a building.Don't even get me started at making 2 floors or more.. i can't figure out how to make stairs at all, even though you think it would just be block on block right? not in this game.So what i do is i go into the mountain and make cave dwellings. this works rather well. Untill the lack of optimalisation kicks you in the teeth.All in all it looks nice and it's fun to play but until they do some major optimising and some work on the building aspect i say go play Rimworld instead. It's not threedee and looks a lot like prison architect ( and last time i checked also still in alpha ) but at least the reason why your settlement dies out is because the game actively kills you not because your computer is getting strangled.

								Today I will review Stonehearth.This is an excellent Early Access Game that never fails to deliver every month it has a new alpha with many new features that change the game in a big way i think this game has alot of promise and the devs are always responding to feedback to make it better.Stonehearth is a survival town building game with monsters and goblins constantly invading your town. It has solid building mechanics where you can build what ever you want with constant improvement although the bigger you go the more bugs you will encounter.Secondly Stonehearth requires you to raise animals farms hunting cooking and mining in order to get the resources you need to help your town grow with many thing to craft cook and farm. The graphics are also very calm and pleasent with its voxelated worldAs of its new update there is a new playable kingdom biomes and LESS BUGS YAY!The Bad:Combat is far too easy sometimes i would like to see reival factions and kingdomsMore classes and things to craft... Never can have enoughBUGS BUGS BUGS GRRRR!Thats it for bad things...I cannot stress enoough on how good this game is it is simpily wonderful and is constantly getting better i would highly recommend you go and buy it now go go go!EDIT: I last reviewed this game back in Alpha 11, and now that Alpha 17 is out i would like to go over the things that they have changed to make it better.The combat with the new difficulty is exciting and keeps me on the edge of my seat all of the time. The previous gripe i had with Stonehearth was the fact that combat was boring, easy and dull. However, that is no longer the case with 4 new combat orintated classes which helps with your towns defence. Also there are now better enemies such as the Red Kiln.They have also worked very hard to update the bugs of there game and Alpha 17 has seen many building improvements such as stairs and lots of glitches fixed.Overall i think the devs are very active and i can seee this game being finished and an mazing product.

								I got this game months ago, since I wanted something relaxing and sandbox-ish, and this game's charm and city-building/adventure mechanics looked really great. Back then, I had a bit of fun trying to build a village, but found things quickly messed up with buginess, especially with the building editor. Fair enough, I thought. I'll come back to it later.It's been months, and the devs still haven't fixed up the building editor. You can't even undo or delete structures. If you make a mistake, it's permanent. This game has been on the market for almost 3 years, as of writing. Building is a central mechanic. It needs to be playable in this regard before the developers even think about adding other content.Keep an eye on it if this is the kind of game you enjoy, but I'd advise against spending your money on it as of writing.

								Still very broken at some points. Truly a fun game but has many issues that can break the game and force you to restart. They just added a new feture where you hearthlings will be knocked out instead of dying so you can try to save them. I was not far into the game and had 3 troops while playing on normal. Out of no where can this enemy that was really tough but they game through more enemies right away and all my troops were knocked out. My hearthlings couldnt do anything. With this new update it seems like hearthlings, even troops run away more. they get hit when they run away and then im left with 20 hearthling knocked out and unable to do anything. Also any enemies that survive the battle just linger around so if i get a new hearthling, it will get butt ♥♥♥♥♥ by the enemy in a second. Great game, just too many issues that break the game, like the difficulty not making any sense, hearthlings not working anymore, too many powerful enemies attacking too early. One game it was day 2 and a really powerful giant came and wrecked my village. they need to really just take a step back and look at the game and fix the bugs.			"

								I've waited years to play this since it's announcement solely because I didn't want to be playing a game that isn't fully developed. I was immediately captivated by it's concept because I love voxel-sandbox style gameplay but 4 years later...Fact of the matter is, at this point, anybody playing this game is technically paying the developers to test their game for them. What a way to save money, Every player pays you $25 to do the majority of your QA. Villagers randomly stop performing their tasks, the game progressively gets laggier, large majority of tasks don't have keyboard shortcuts (namely combat), you have to jump through hoops to drink a damn potion, etc.Normally that wouldn't be a problem. But 4 years...? Don't buy games in any testing phase kids.It also means you're risking your money because there is always that chance the game doesn't release.P.S.

								So far I can gauge this game being a ""Minecraft/DF town sim blend done right"". Things that are in the game work well and good (until you meet bugs), and the whole process of managing your town is quite smooth and nice, easily the best or near-best of that I've seen in similar games.So, why it's ""not recommended""?At the moment, there isn't much to do there. The amount of content that you can try is extremely low, vertical progression is basically nonexistent - you can unlock all the things that are currently implemented in the game in 2 to 3 game days (that's 1-1.5 hours of playtime at most), and afterwards there's nothing left to do apart from ""build more stuff because you can and it's the only thing you can"".Additonal grain of salt is the building editor - customizable buildings is one of the defining points of the game (that is, one of the defining points that is actually implemented right now), but the editor is rather clunky and hard to use in cases other than traditional 1-story building (multiple stories aren't implemented at the moment) with simple inner structure and minimal amount of walls. Try to do complex multi-room irregurarly-shaped buildings, however, and you will be fighting the UI much more than actually planning.And finally, the pacing of development is nothing to write home about. The initial plans (from Kickstarter campaign) were to release the game towards the end of 2014, you know. Now it's the end of 2015, and we recently had an alpha version where devs were mostly fixing internals, such as pathfinding. Going by this, it is extremely unlikely that we'll see any reasonably-sized chunk of gameplay - that is, content and actual mechanics - available until the end of 2016, and beta/release stages may follow even later. And that's only if the development won't stop abruptly at some point.To summarize, it's a game that promises really great things, but currently allows you to plant turnips, design and build simple small buildings, dig through mountains, and hit randomly-appearing enemies such as goblins with some swords (archery is not implemented yet). That's all.			"

								Very Addictive game!!Basically Minecraft meets SimsI am very addicted to this game and feel like it will be great once it is finished. However, only 13 hours into the game with only 19 villagers and my game suffers HUGE lag spikes and FPS drops especially at night. I run a decent PC core i5 with 8GB of RAM but the SIM lag drops to almost unplayable levels. I am very glad i purchased this game simply to support the developers and look forward to when it is finished.Ideas for developers:- Promoting Shepards to war animal trainers (wolves, bears, lions that turn on you if not fed)- Promoting basic foot soldiers soldiers to generals and bowman- Refrigerators or ice boxes to keep food from spoiling so fast- Tougher enemy progressions			"

								Thumbs up for the game. Style is great, idea is great and gameplay is good. Bug squishing is pretty good (with interim updates for bug fixes between major updates)Progress?Their own progress graph and trello board claims that most of the single player stuff is about 70 - 90% complete? I hope that isn't the case.Having owned this since  the second day of the Kickstarter back in early 2013 I'm pretty underwhelmed at the content in the game. The Legos style building is nice, much better than it was a few Alphas ago, but the gameplay itself is still very under developed.Very few professions, not much threat, not much in the way of resource or tools to manage them.Even on hard level this game shows you everything in a few hours.As of Alpha 18, (September 2016) playing all this game has to offer currently, and seeing all there is to see -  will take you half a day at most. Taking the two ""races"" and exploring the 2 available biomes is a very similar experience after the opening 20 minutes of play, that might turn half a days entertainment into a day? Ok I was hoping for a well realised Dwarf Fortress with a decent voxel art set and a good UI. Not the full depth of DF of course, but at least on a par with what one man teams did with games like Gnomoria and Towns. At least that much depth given the backing and the much larger team involved.Sadly this isn't the way Stonehearth is panning out.It's more of a kids game. Very simplified. The complexity comes with designing your own buildings, and that is a great feature, but serves no gameplay purpose at all. It's like""Here's an abstract building game like DF, Prison Architect, Clockwork Empires Gnomoria, Towns etc.And here's a architectural Lego gameLet's put them together and errm? Well you can build big buildings on the map - and then imagine that their is a reason to do so - because in reality there is none.""Then you are left with a virtual lego set. Which is nice and all, somewhere to express your imagination.But big buildings that have no purpose other than to exist? That's not really a game -  and I'd rather do that with a real lego set than in here.			"

								Cute, funny and interesting little game, with a dedicated, wonderful developer team.It's pretty addictive to play, just make sure you save every now and then.(especially before you're about to attack the enemy AI, if you are unsure) - because you might lose interest if you even lose one citizen, i've experienced many times. Also save alot if you keep using the experimental max speed, it could crash the game eventually.Sometimes it's a big unforgiving, but this game's kind of challenge doesn't want you to quit permanently, at least.It's always fun to see the game waiting to be updating in the download tab of steam, and I'm really curious on where this game is going. I had hoped for snow here in december :'(			"

								This game is fun and over al a great game. Here's a list of the pros and cons. Remember  It is still in alpha Pros: + Fun gameplay+ Easy but still interesting+Awesome artstyle+Over all a great gameCons:-Buggy (remember it is in alpha)-No tutorial (But it is easy to figure out what to do)This is just my opinion, But I also think you should probably watch someone on youtube or something play this, to get a closer feel and to really know what it's like. I could've made a longer list for both the pros and cons, but i just decided to hit the basic points.9/10, Really fun but it's still in alpha and could use a little work.			"

								It is fun, I won't deny it. But the vast amount of bugs get in the way of that. From villagers not building things to them getting stuck in walls or tables (sometimes a save and reload just does not work), to not explaining what you can actually do. I designed an amazing house for instance, clicked ""build"". Nothing. Nothing at all. Nobody doing anything. The worst part is that i still dont know what was the cause. There is nothing to tell me what im doing wrong if I am doing something wrong at all.It is early access and so far the gameplay is fine, but with the large amount of bugs and the high price, I just cant reccomend it in the current condition. But I will be keeping my eye on it.			"

								A cautious recommendation. Buy only if you are keen to support the title during development.it shows a lot of promise, but needs more devtime to add content, bug fixing and polish. Had some bugs, such as buildings not completing, villagers not doing what is expected... very much a work in progress with what I can only assume is very little QA performed before build releases ( Which is somewhat expected in Early Access, which is still stupid )I started to have performance issues around the 18 Villager mark.

								I wouldn't call this game fun. It's a bit satisfying to build your town, defend it and upgrade everything, yes. Fun? Not really.I've run across a couple of consistent problems, however, across the patches.1- Strongest problem I came across was a bug that kept the game going, but removed all controls but the camera. Couldn't press ESC, couldn't issue orders, couldn't interact with anything.This prevented me from saving / loading the game. I had to force quit.2- A BIG nuisance was that builders kept taking furniture from completed custom buildings in order to build other buildings. Effectively making my town with 11 buildings to have a grand total of 6 beds.3- A functional nuisance I had is that there is no way to influence what workers will do. I kept trying to expand up a mountainside, jut to have all my workers occupied elsewhere and none dedicated to mining.--As of late, I have noticed that most of the workers will pick an item, pick another, then drop the first one, then drop the second one on the spot. They do this over and over and then forget about the issue, setting off to do something else.4- As of the latest couple of patches, farmers will tile about half the farmland area I set, then ignore it and do something completely different and not farming-related.The game becomes generally unstable when the goblin invasions become ""upgraded"".The game is simple and a bit cathartic, but I can't in good conscience recommend it at this point. A lot of bugs need to be solved, and with the current early access trend, I'm on the fence about this game being abandoned before it's finished.			"

								Hello everybody! I have been with Stonehearth since alpha sixteen, I believe. This game is amazing, BUT definitely get it on sale if you can. I think it may be a little expensive right now, considering that it has no multiplayer and still in alpha and all that. So, here I will make a pros and cons of this game.Let's begin with the PROS:- Unique building system- Minecraft-like creativity- Recent updates allow for more complex structures to be made- Combat- Updated frequently. (Weekly updates/Bug fix updates, new alpha versions about every month or two)Now for the cons...:- Pricey- Buggy because it's still in alpha- Enemies are overpowered on harder difficulties- The game has the basic idea for turret defense but for the price it's virtually useless- NO MULTIPLAYER, something the devs said would be in the game in about 6-8 months, and about a year later it still isn't here.- No memes. (This one is just a joke don't get you panties in a bundle :D)What I want to see as a player?- MULTIPLAYER- Lower pricethats about it :D Keep going devs your doing great.would recommend if you can get it on sale for >$20 :)			"

								To put simply this game is Age of Empires meets Minecraft. It is still in Alpha, so obviously there are still bugs, however the game is completely playable right now. The only issue that interfers gameplay wise as far as I can tell is building, if you design complex and large structures sometimes your hearthlings (citizens/people) will have trouble completeing it and handling objects. Keeping this in mind you can simply use the command console to instant build the building or just build it in easier to manage chunks, and if there is scaffolding or ladders left up just use the destroy command in the command console to remove them. Furthermore, if you see that your hearthlings have yet to place an item there is a good chance you simply put it ontop of a block above the path they can take, in this case just build a ladder and take it down after the item is placed. I know you may be thinking, I shouldn't have to do this extra junk to play the game, but again it's in alpha still and the ""extra work"" is like an extra click. All-and-all this is a very fun game that gets even funner as they add new stuff and c'mon if an Alpha version is already fun and awesome then the completed will be even better.			"

								I once did a review of this game around when it came out explaining how the game was a little glitchy. But since then it has been updated a bunch. Im normally not a town builder type game fan but I really love this game. You have to use your people wisely and give them correct jobs. Such as a footman who protects the others if the footman's spirit is not very high they will run away or get scared in battle, if their body is high they are most likely to not take much damage. Once my footman took down 3 wolves without getting hurt because she had high body. Also there are specific tools, if you gave everyone a job and you want to mine some ore you wont be able to because only workers (people with no jobs) can use pickaxes. Although I agree that the price for this game isnt cheap I still highly recommend buying it.			"

								Game is good. Dont get me wrong its like a way easier dwarf fortress and Gnomoria thing. But heres the trouble, Its been in early access for quite some time and it still has an absolutely massive memory leak issue. After a while of game play usually around 30 mins to an hour, it starts to feel like you are clicking through mud. You'll click something and it wont happen for ten seconds or so. They really need to fix the leak, Gnomoria has this going on too but after much longer in game. I dont know what it is about this style of engine but it lends itself far too easily to this leak issue. If its a known issue which all of the forum posts about it makes it apparent that it is, then it should have either been addressed or fixed long ago. Im wondering if they even plan to.

								Hello everybody! I have been with Stonehearth since alpha sixteen, I believe. This game is amazing, BUT definitely get it on sale if you can. I think it may be a little expensive right now, considering that it has no multiplayer and still in alpha and all that. So, here I will make a pros and cons of this game.Let's begin with the PROS:- Unique building system- Minecraft-like creativity- Recent updates allow for more complex structures to be made- Combat- Updated frequently. (Weekly updates/Bug fix updates, new alpha versions about every month or two)Now for the cons...:- Pricey- Buggy because it's still in alpha- Enemies are overpowered on harder difficulties- The game has the basic idea for turret defense but for the price it's virtually useless- NO MULTIPLAYER, something the devs said would be in the game in about 6-8 months, and about a year later it still isn't here.- No memes. (This one is just a joke don't get you panties in a bundle :D)What I want to see as a player?- MULTIPLAYER- Lower pricethats about it :D Keep going devs your doing great.would recommend if you can get it on sale for >$20 :)			"

								After 10 hours I can't said more than : ""stay away until the dev fixed the main problems"".  This a pre-alpha ... which is not closed to be playable. The building editor contains tons of bugs, multi stories buildings are never built, settlers management is terrible (they can stay doing nothing even if a building stay unfinished in front of them), remove a building is never working, edit an existing building is not possible, external walls can't be manually built, ...

								I never write reviews. But when a game has so much potential, I feel as though people should know. Obviously, it's in Early Access and not everything is perfect. But what is there is something to be proud of. Even for a small game, everything feels warm and happy and I feel this game will most certainly grow to something larger than it already is. I seriously recommend this game even if the price is a bit high. It's totally worth it.			"

								It is fun, I won't deny it. But the vast amount of bugs get in the way of that. From villagers not building things to them getting stuck in walls or tables (sometimes a save and reload just does not work), to not explaining what you can actually do. I designed an amazing house for instance, clicked ""build"". Nothing. Nothing at all. Nobody doing anything. The worst part is that i still dont know what was the cause. There is nothing to tell me what im doing wrong if I am doing something wrong at all.It is early access and so far the gameplay is fine, but with the large amount of bugs and the high price, I just cant reccomend it in the current condition. But I will be keeping my eye on it.			"

								This is a very fun management sim game. I'm not sure what was changed last patch that made it so unplayable but it's practically unplayable. I've lost my entire village 3 times in a row compared to pre-patch I never lost the whole village. I have fences up, plenty of soldiers and still get overwhelmeed. For one thing, with the new rangers in game the fighters get low on health and run around with their arms up and DESERVE TO DIE.  The rangers just sit in one spot and kill them.

								I once did a review of this game around when it came out explaining how the game was a little glitchy. But since then it has been updated a bunch. Im normally not a town builder type game fan but I really love this game. You have to use your people wisely and give them correct jobs. Such as a footman who protects the others if the footman's spirit is not very high they will run away or get scared in battle, if their body is high they are most likely to not take much damage. Once my footman took down 3 wolves without getting hurt because she had high body. Also there are specific tools, if you gave everyone a job and you want to mine some ore you wont be able to because only workers (people with no jobs) can use pickaxes. Although I agree that the price for this game isnt cheap I still highly recommend buying it.			"

								Purchased Stoneheart about half a year ago when it was still in an earlier phase of developement.Team Radiant is doing good work, the updates are coming steady and the Forums got an active community.The game itself is... from my POV a mix out of minecraft and dungeon kepper.Where you pile up the blocks in minecraft yourself, here you assign a silly crowd of beings to a schedule to terraform the world in a way you want it to be.Design your own Buildings from the very scratch. Or dig. DIG! and build the dwarven settlement you always imagined.Personally, only played in Peaceful mode so far. Reminds of Settlers in the Free Settlement Mode.Hopefully, as its displayed on Stonehearths website, there is a multiplayer support to come. PS: This game is very RAM intensive, and even made a 16gb RAM machine crash once, from lacking memory.			"

Some toons get stucked (randomly). lua errors (when im trying to build some kind of roof, or setting groups for patroling,,,), aaaand sometimes they dont do stuff that I ordered (dunno why). And enemies needs to get stronger But it has good things too: Best UI that ive seen on a city builder game, intuitive and easy to use. Design style is really good. Music. and lovely citizens.Is it worth buying it for 23€? hell yes. Still with its bugs, its awesome to play. And the price its gonna be the same once its released, so it doesnt really matter when u are gonna buy it, now u can help the devs to improve it			"

								Alright, so first things first.  This game is Early Access.  Meaning that you will experience bugs.  It is unfinished.  You don't buy this game for what it is, you buy it for what it can be.  That is why I paid into the crowdfunding.  I believe in the game idea and the creators of the game.  If you want an interesting game with a lot of potential and a solid base, then I would say look into this one.  The dev team is really straight forward and keeps the community informed on the current state of the game.  What they do, why they are working on what they are currently working on.  The pace at which they work is steady and with care and attention.I feel that they have a good idea on priorities with development.			"

								Great Game, absolutely love everything about it... except the fact that 9/10 times when building a structure my workers will just stop in the middle of building and nothing I do will make them resume. I'll build a wall and they'll leave the scaffolding up and the enemies will just climb right over it. I'd really love to give this game a positive rating but until this problem (earliest reports going back all the way to 2015!) is fixed I can't make myself give it a positive rating. I've been forced to stop playing because I simply can't get anything done with this bug around.			"

								I wholeheartedly reccomend this game. It's in Alpha right now, and it's fantastic. If it continues like this, the finished product will be a gem among god-like resource management games.Pros:1. Citizens (Hearthlings) that actually ""think"" for themselves. Feed themselves, clothe themselves, the whole shebang. Just assign them to a job and watch them go. They even run away from monsters, which I really appreciate. Unless you manage to strand them on top of a mountain, they're going to be fine.2. A really nice crafting system. Easy to manage, as precise as you want it to be. Personally, I like to set things up so my cook always has food on the table, but I let my blacksmith run wild between mining trips. Again, the Hearthlings do everything on their own.3. Building Construction. What I really like about this is the scaffolding the hearthlings construct around the building, consuming wood but giving it back after the building is complete. It's a really nice touch, in my opinion. The buildings are easy to design and look great when they're done. I would like a little tweak to one thing, but I'll talk about that later.4. Challenging Enemies. Basically, if you get into some deep trouble, all of your hearthlings are dead. I sacrificed one of my first footmen to a Varanus (the smaller variety) and it proceded to slaughter the reast of the town. The things that attack you in this game are genuinely terrifying, unless you watch seeing tiny litle people who depend on you for survival die.5. Actually a sort of story line. I won't go into too much detail, but there is some interesting stuff going on in the world around you. Goblin Warlords, Ogres, Necromancers, and something called Squirrel People? (They probably won't appreciate me eating their brethren) There's a prophecy and everything. I, for one, am fascinated.Cons/suggestions:1. Performance issues and low framerates. This is probably just my computer. It's pretty out of date. Beware people like me: this game does not run at even 30 FPS on older machines. Probably an issue that will be lessened as developement continues.2. Minor glitches regarding construction/buildings. The hearthlings will occasionally stop building things that are only half complete. As far as I can tell, this is an issue that occurs when loading a saved game. It doesn't happen very often now that Alpha 18 is in place. Also, game devs, I would like a tool to move up and down the floors of buildings while constructing them. So that if I have two floors, I can make the 2nd one invisible and just look at the first. It would make placeing things on the walls a whole lot easier. Please and thank you.This game is totally worth your money.(Oh, and whatever you do, don't place that decorative scout gong too soon. Trust me)			"

								While still very much in the fledgling stages of the development, Stonehearth is still an amazing game that offers a voxel-themed sandbox/city-building experience that gives you plenty of direction with what to ""do"" next without being constricting about it.About the biggest concern I have about this game is the lack of micromanaging. If you're a fan of games like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, or even Towns (or what you had hoped Towns would become), Stonehearth may leave you wanting for a bit more control over your individials and their priorities, or just the allotment of work between citizens.I hope to see Stonehearth grow bigger and stronger, particularly with things like Seasons, expanded climates and map varieties, and some additional aesthetic content, but that's no reason to not pick up a copy and try it out for yourself. Stonehearth has got a solid foundation, a history of active and attentive devs, and a bright future ahead.			"

								while i cant really recommend it as a fun and good game, devs are constantly updating it so i cant give it a thumbs down.I can say for certain this game won't be in Early Access hell and will, eventually, be erleased as a full game.In what the industry has became, this is something to applaude.

								I adore this game.Im a long-time fan of Dwarf Fortress and this immediately appealed to me.  Now, its not as...  baroque as DF, but it shows much potential thus far.  It's regularly updated, has appealing graphics and the custom structure building is pretty great once you get the hang of it.The only con I could see is the price, that and being early-access may not appeal to the more instant-gratification seeking consumer.  It can be a little rough around the edges, but the devs are pretty diligent in stamping out bugs as they come.In conclusion- get it if you want to play a work in progress that already delivers a pretty great experience.  Perhaps wait til its on sale if the price bothers you?			"

								Hey guys! This is my review of the game as a newbie to it. This Is a honest and non bias review. Ok. So. When first starting out you may be like what the hell but as you start to figure out what there is to do and the system it gets amazingly good! At first I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth $20 (steam summer sale) but within 30 minutes of playing I loved the game. It's fresh, intuitive, creative, and seems to be VERY OPTIMIZED for all of you who don't have the $ for high end pc's. I truly believe this game is worth the money and is definite worth a shot! Especially if your into games that involve build your own community, exploring, surviving, and taking care of your little towns people! The only downside I found to this game was that there was really no clear instructions on how to start or even controls, the controls feel kinda weird but as you progress you start to like them since they make building amazingly easier. Also that the game has a full base building system and resource system, caves digging ext. I am very picky when it comes to these types of games but this one was just to good to let go. Definitely recommend it! Worth your time for sure!!!			"

								This game is hella cute and could totally be fun if it weren't for the game breaking bugs and lag issues. I bought it with high hopes, which is my fault since it is still early access after all, and was vastly dissappointed. In its current state, I would not recommend it until bugs and lag issues are fixed, especially for the cost of the game. Currently, I refunded my money so I could play other games I'm interested in, but I can see this game being something really awesome in the future. At a later date, when things seem to be fixed, I would consider purchasing the game again.			"

								Current level of recommend?Strong Follow!If your interested in the game I'd give it a follow and check back in a couple months. Game is still very early alpha and most of the updates are focused on making the game more stable while adding in one thing at a time. In its current state for its price, your looking at maybe a weekend or a couple sessions worth of game time. Updates are a bit slow but are pretty steady in frequency. Been playing stonehearth on and off since alpha 5 and the game does have quite a bit of potential (devs are also active on their forums which is a plus)If you do choose to pick it up just remember the early access tag means early access. In its current state you be able to play around with the basics but will likely run into bugs/glitches your village grows. Also, its a good idea to save before you start a new building that way you can reload your save should you run into any bugs/issues.			"

								Stonehearth will likely become a great game once it's finishd; however, it is hard to recommend it in its current state. Its utter lack of features leads to boring gameplay, which makes its price of  $25  completely unjustifiable.

								Sadly I dont think the makers can get this game right, the mechanics work for some thing and not for others, this game needs one awesome computer to run it aswell for high population villages, I find once I go over 12 people the game stuggles to play smoothly (Quadcore, 32G RAM@2400, Geforce gtx 970 4gb ect.) when I did get luck a few times (no bugs) I found all my hard work would always be lost at some point from a massive glitch, which has totaly killed the game for me personaly.My advice to the makers would be ""Try alot harder"" My advice to anyone wanting to buy this game, dont, buy some gaming making software, make your own game and sell it before it is finshed, you might get luck like the dayZ boys and rake in millions for an Alpha release of your game, minimum work, maximum money.

								The game isn't very deep, and a lot of the time your work orders get ignored.  A least half of the buildings I told them to construct are still unfinished despite having well over enough resources available.  You can't edit a building once it's told to be constructed, unless you want to remove it entirely, and even that task gets ignored by workers.I would only recommend this game after the developer fixes a lot of the core issues with building.

								I have played stonehearth every now and again for a long time.If you asked me when I first got the game I would have said no, but the game has come a long way!This is in the core exactly what you'd want from a settlement city builder.You choose how you want to play, do you want to be creative? or create a strong military and fight monsters?The gameplay is great, and the building tools have improved a lot! There are still ocacional bugs and script errors, but it is way better than it used to be. Though I still hope for more optimization in the future. My computer is a decent pc, but since I have had a lot of problems with it because of age I'm not sure if this is true for other people. But around 20 villagers I start to get a fair bit of lag. I am sure a better computer would allow atleast 30 or 35. But don't go hoping for a massive village of 100 people with tons of activity.This is a slow paced relaxing game, that can be either challanging or creative, depending on how you play.			"

The Hearthlings sometimes get stuck on an object when picking something up next to another object, itd be awesome if stairs were added or ladders could be put inside buildings, and more attacks by enemies would make it a lot more fun. More decorations and building objects would be nice as well as finishing the job list. Overall, the game is very good and im hoping it gets even better with updates. 10/10 would play lol.

I have to pull up a seperate tab that blocks the craft button!There's not a lot of job options (yet)The villagers tend to forget what they're doing if they go too far away from homeThe Ui is kinda sticky with no way to quickly check on villagersSuggestions:Race options, a village with just humans can be boring. why not throw in some other races with new benefits?have two story housesa tutorial would be nicehave morale specific things, I don't really know how to raise morale other than with food and bedsmake mining more precise. when selecting what to mine it looks like i'm mining the ground when I should be mining the wall!more enemies!Overall, I'm enjoying this game.

								I bought this game looking for a good city/town builder type of game with crafting and rpg elements. So far I've really enjoyed it. I think it really has the potential to become a very good game as development continues.The game looks great, has good replayability, and looks to be frequently updated. I love that there's a building designer! The crafting is good so far as well. The downside is that it's early access which means there are a lot of bugs, some of which require you to start a new game due to their severity (but the game is so replayable that it's not that big of a deal right now) and there are features that are not finished or not implemented yet. The UI is also a little clunky and there are some quality of life features I would desperately like to see rolled out soon. I would definitely recommend if you don't mind early access and bugs!  "

								Sure it's a good game, and it's early access, but once you get past your first 10 nights or so, you begin to question the goal of the game. There aren't a lot of features in it's current state (again, I know it's early access) and this caused me to get very bored with the game almost instantly.I can't imagine the devs adding something that makes the gameplay interesting enough to warrant the $25 pricetag. They would have to add a whole new game element or something.6/10 at most, it got very very boring rather quickly. If I put more hours in and change my mind, I might update this review.			"

TLDR:Game I thought I wouldn't like because I've never played Minecraft, but ended up falling in love with it. This game is really amazing and it's still in alpha/early access. 8/10 and worth the price even in Early Access.My Impression:My first impression of Stonehearth after watching their presentation video was that I didn't think I would enjoy playing it. Although I have never played Minecraft, the graphics reminded me of it. I never really got into Minecraft because I prefer single-player games and because of the graphics. I paid $19.99 for the game during the Steam Winter Sale, and I thought I was probably going to refund it due to the game not being worth the price. I decided I would buy it during the sale and if I didn't like it I would refund it. I was wrong, I love the game. DansGaming also had the same feeling as me. He thought it was going to be a mediocre game and was only going to stream it for a bit. He ended up falling in love with it as well.Positive:+ City builder but with a mix of RPG elements and character classes+ Unique party system to manage your civilians easiers+ Multiple races and scenarios to play with+ Crafting and building system are near perfection, well done+ Fun quests and random encounters+ Different modes if you want to just build or battle enemies while you build+ Relaxing gameplay+ Great soundtrack+ UI is aesthetically pleasing  + Overall extremely well polished for an Early Access titleNegatives:- Optimization could be a bit better, depending on how high your citizen setting is at (I found my sweet spot at 22 citizens), performance can be slowed down. Fire effects also slow the game down.- Using the house builder at the moment is very unintuitive and not easily done- Could use more built in premade buildings- Bugs, things you would expect in an early access title- No steam workshop for building blueprints- No cloud saves- Added some suggestions to the developers at ( https://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/suggestions-after-playing-about-15-hours/27403 )Very Good Game: 8/10I have refunded many games on Steam before. I am often very skeptical of the prices developers list their games at, but I can say that this game is worth it's price even in Early Access.			"

								Sure it's a good game, and it's early access, but once you get past your first 10 nights or so, you begin to question the goal of the game. There aren't a lot of features in it's current state (again, I know it's early access) and this caused me to get very bored with the game almost instantly.I can't imagine the devs adding something that makes the gameplay interesting enough to warrant the $25 pricetag. They would have to add a whole new game element or something.6/10 at most, it got very very boring rather quickly. If I put more hours in and change my mind, I might update this review.			"

								I have played stonehearth every now and again for a long time.If you asked me when I first got the game I would have said no, but the game has come a long way!This is in the core exactly what you'd want from a settlement city builder.You choose how you want to play, do you want to be creative? or create a strong military and fight monsters?The gameplay is great, and the building tools have improved a lot! There are still ocacional bugs and script errors, but it is way better than it used to be. Though I still hope for more optimization in the future. My computer is a decent pc, but since I have had a lot of problems with it because of age I'm not sure if this is true for other people. But around 20 villagers I start to get a fair bit of lag. I am sure a better computer would allow atleast 30 or 35. But don't go hoping for a massive village of 100 people with tons of activity.This is a slow paced relaxing game, that can be either challanging or creative, depending on how you play.			"

								I played this a bunch last night, and plan to play a bunch more in the future. This is a fantastic little game. I can tell it still needs some work, but so far, pretty fun. Things I wish were better:-The camera is a little awkward, and I wish I could get on a lower perspective to the ground sometimes, since the animations and art are so damned cute, it would be nice to be a little closer to the inhabitants.----It would almost be worth it to have a 'walk around' mode, where you can 'be' one of the characters-When you have a blueprint for a building, and don't build exactly the required item for your specified blueprint there is no way of knowing, and the workers will not override one door for another, and if you decided to manually place items into the build, the ghosty blueprint remains-Items like fences don't 'auto complete' the way I wish they would, and leave gaps-I wish you could follow around a specific character, and their overlay wouldn't cover up the entire screen.Anyway...that is what I noticed so far....I will be building adorable little towns soon...and I am sure I will find little irksome quirks. But, that won't stop me from playing.UPDATE: just picked it up again...still really fun. It seems like some kinks were ironed out. I really like this game.			"

								A couple notes on playing the game; Have at least 1-2 Farmers. Once you make one of them a cook, they help harvest, but you still need them to plow the fields. Workers are VERY much so necessary. Although the carpenter, potter, mason and other occupations do help build/haul, you're going to want to keep the people with low-ranks down on the worker size (1, 1 and 2 for the body/mind/spirit; Keep them a worker) Fighters and such need to be the most populace unit category (Archers, Knights and Footmen); At least have one of each with an herbalist. (For the three, high Body and Mind. Mostly so they don't run like cowards) Herbalist and Cleric; Have one of each. One heals while the villagers sleep/get into beds, one heals just by walking around/in combat. (High spirit for these guys is necessary) All ""Worker-class"" occupations need mind and spirit. All three are much so needed for the farmers than anything. ALWAYS. ALWAYS remember there's a pause button that lets you keep playing. Helps you plan things. Town watch; Love it, use it, learn it, remember to turn it off after everyone is done fighting. Always go after goblin camps/""stray monsters"" after the next invasion summon (Ents/Golems/Etc), that way your villagers aren't defenseless.			"

								ALPHA REVIEWJust don't get this.  There's potential for days, but the UI and AI are both infuriatingly bad, which is made worse by the design decisions made for the game.  Wait until release so they can fix it up.  Right now, it's exactly what you should expect from an alpha build, and nothing you should expect from Early Access.  Wait a while, and this will probably be an excellent game.  The music - all nine minutes of it - is really good.  The art is charming.  The game is terrible.I backed this on Kickstarter and have been playing it off and on for months, hoping with each new alpha release that it will become enjoyable.  It never does.			"

								This is currently my favorite game. Really this game is amazing, the character models are amazing, the music is amazing, and the gameplay is FANTASTIC!!!! The one thing I wish they would add to this game is a way to click one of the amazingly designed citizens and enter some kind of first person mode to see what the town is like in thier eyes.			"
