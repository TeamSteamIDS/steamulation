												Having played for just over an hour now here's what I have to say about the game. If you ever played Port of Call, Transocean - The Shipping Company is a modern version of that. Everything from the time progression to ""status"" or ""reputation"" to unlock more ships.  There are some nice features of the sim that are handy to use such as the financial statements & diagrams, also the ability to take out loans is great as well. I didn't bother playing the campaign, just went right into the free play. After about 20-30 minutes of contracting out my small feed ship i unlocked all the ports of europe, thereafter I unlocked the entire world. I gained enough capital to purchase some bigger pre-panamax ships and began trading the lucrative routes.  Graphics wise the sim is pleasing to the eyes, beautiful colors, non-cluttered interface, lots to look at without getting bombarded with useless information. There isn't a real challenging component to free play that I observed, eventually your larger vessels experience massive profit margins. If you complete a contract for 30 million euros, your fuel costs will only be about 5% of that, which is fine I guess, but I have a feeling that real shippers experience much more turbulent expenses. I'm not complaining, just, thinking out loud. Anyways, this sim is shouting for tankers & drybulker vessels, stock market simulation, buyouts, further player interaction with other AI shipping companies (or even other players!) I hope Deck13 doesn't simply abandon this just yet. Oh and wait, there is more.Many of you know the embarressing and disasterous repuation that German devs/publishing firms have for releasing unfinished products then abandoning them, i must say within the hour of playing, I didnt crash once, experience a bug or anything like that. It was flawless. Congrats! Anyways I'll swing a 8/10 would play again. Thanks.			"

												Everybody look at me 'cause I'm sailin' on a boat!After two hours of play, I have to say that I'm impressed.  After just a couple tutorial missions (each and all skippable in turn), I was turned loose to make or break my company.  After a few lucrative ore contracts, I found myself smuggling contraband on the Mediterranian.  And got busted.  And my cargo seized.  And fined.  And my ship impounded for a week.  A time-based contract I still had in the hold expired, so there were penalties there.  And harbor masters didn't care to allow convicted smuggers in their ports, so harbor fees went up.  All that in two hours and not a moment that felt repeatative.A few features that I liked:  Your home port determines what bonuses your company gets.  I picked Lisbon for +5% on ore contracts and -10% to fuel.  The trick is, the smaller the port, the larger the bonuses.  So you have a reason to keep smaller ports and the ships that can service them.There is some ship customization.  The Feeder I started with had three levels of Hull and Engine upgrades, which increased range and speed respectively.  There was also a license upgrade that would allow me to carrry what appeared to be hazardous waste.  Unfortunately, there does not appear to be options for custom paint or appearance (other than your ship name emblazoned upon the stern and bow).I remember reading a comment somewhere saying that the music was repeatative and annoying.  To me, it sounded like every port had it's own song.  And each port felt VERY unique.  I'm already developing favorites and least favorites.The only meh item I encountered dealt with other ship traffic.  Large ships move fast and looked intimidating at first, but it turns out they can stop on a dime and give the player right-of-way.  I would have liked to have seen navigation lights and right-of-way implemented (and fines for failure to obey maritime traffic laws).Anyway, back to my ship.  I'm saving up for a fleet.  And I'm naming all my vessels after internet porn sites.			"

												Sadly this game appears to be no longer supported. Please visit the forums for latest details.  The game has many bugs and features missing which according to the developers are to be addressed in a version due out in 2016.  If you don't mind spending a bit of cash it is an interesting, challenging game which will amuse for a number of hours, especially over a wet holiday weekend. This game ideally should be heavily discounted from now on and free upgrades offered to those who purchased before the new version TO2 was announced earlier this week.			"

With a few more Improvements, I believe this game could actually move into the Sim World, as a School Training Tool too.Imagine that, having fun, and learning about the ""Real World TOO!""Wanna make a bet it'll never be picked up as such?REAL School is supposed to be boring so you want to Grad and leave!

												This is a cool game and all but it has its negatives that quickly spoil the experience.First, docking and undocking is tedious as hell and gets very old very quickly. Unfortunately you're essentially required to do it every time, since using a tugboat is $100K a pop -- so docking and undocking at any given port if you don't want to deal with this tedious docking mechanic is $200k. When you're starting out and your profit margins are very thin this isn't feasible.Second, in the campaign your investor is essentially the villain. Every quarter she takes what seems like half of your cash and when you finally scrape up enough to rank up to the next size ship she saddles you with an impossible contract which requires you to ship an insane amount of goods to a specific port (including things that you can't even ship yet without ship upgrades that you can't buy) or lose $10M. Guess when this automatically kicks off? When you hit $10M in cash. Oh the best part? You have around a month to deliver everything. Twice. Twice I hit this point and this impossible burden combined with the investor taking her quarterly cut left me bankrupt. I would keep trying but the aforementioned docking mechanic saps my will to start over.Third, the sailing mechanic isn't very deep. When your ships are sailing you'll get popups like ""there's a storm a comin"" and it asks you if you want to sail around it or sail through. I can't tell the difference between the two aside from the fact that sailing through practically destroys your ship. This is fine, but if a game is going to abstract this sort of thing but then require you to micromanage things like docking it seems a little schizophrenic.Take these three things and it turns out to be a game that is profoundly unfun which is a shame because it's the first thing that really ruins it. Slashing towing fees would go a long way to making the game better.			"

												I am not much of a game player, but have always been interested in the shipping business and business simulation. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed playing this game. Some people will enjoy the docking of the vessels in the various harbors. As you gain experience you will be able to get to and from the dock faster. Some ports are extremely easy (Lisbon), and others, quite challenging (get one of the larger boats in and out of Vancouver). So people looking for a game that builds your skills handling various ships you will likely enjoy this.There may be some small issues with the underlying rules. For example, was surprised I could pickup cargo from NY for Havana. Suspect that isn't a realistic route.--more likely such goods travel to an intermediate port first (like Halifax). Also, not totally sure the rules follow the Jones Act. But one can really spend time figuring out how to keep the vessels as loaded as possible, and efficiently moving the most TEUs for the most money. I didn't like it when my ships had less than 50% of the capacity in use at any one time. I found this more challenging then moving the boats around, and therefore I would sometimes just let the game dock the ship to save time even though it negatively affected my reputation.Again, not a gamer, but surprised how much time  I have spent playing and enjoying this game. If you like simulations, you'll probably find this entertaining, if not informative. "

I love Ports Of Call, played it a lot on the Amiga, but I know that this game isnt for all.Its repetetive, its ""just one more year"", its ""oh, this again"", its ""havent I already done this?"", but its fun for a lot of us.Have you played ports Of Call on pc or the amiga and liked it? Then this game is for you!Now, just one more year...			"

												Recommended, but ONLY if, like me, you played Ports of Call on a dodgy DOS computer and couldn't get enough of expanding your fleet. As that is not likely to be the majority, I am not recommending it.This game IS Ports of Call, there are a few additions and subtractions but the core of it is simple: Get the most out of your fleet. However, where PoC offered depth and complexity, in this it isn't difficult to achieve what you want to achieve, it is a fun(ish) time-waster for a few hours before you realise it is severely hampered by lack of depth. It is PoC but done half-hearted at points where it matters. I've just sent two ships off from New York to Algiers, loaded with medicine, to finish a contract off. Both ships for some mysterious reason left without their loads. In PoC I would turn them round and ignore the bug, here you can't: You cast-off, that is it.In PoC part of the minigames was that you would manoeuver the ship in tricky situations, ice, reefs, castaways. Here you either damage your ship or have to wait for an unknown time. I am fine with the minigame element being gone, but now I haven't got a clue what determines how long you wait, it doesn't tell you (unlike PoC), but having a ship sail ""round a reef"" just of the Galician coast and it taking 12 days... It could have been in the Antarctic by that time. Some of these aspects feel like they've just been put in to slow down the player for no apparent reason. The game is a lot easier. The upgrades to ships are a potentially nice addition, but instead are a sure-fire way to rolling in cash in no time. Once you unlock radioactive goods and weapons, you rake in the cash. I feel there is a massive missed opportunity here. They've introduced a reputation system, why not link it to that? Other goods are already linked to it, also - gaining rep should be A LOT harder, now it is linked to being on time a lot, which is the easiest thing to achieve, it should be linked to the state of your ships, quality of your crew-training, quality and quantity of subsidiaries, average cost per TEU. Reputation in turn should determine the quality of the contracts you can achieve, you begin hauling fish from Iceland to Germany for a few years, after demonstrating you can do that and keep your ship in good condition, you might get the opportunity to bid for another contract and so on. This game COULD have been a brilliant and legit successor to the PoC throne, what it should have done was offer MORE depth, not less. The new additions really don't help and the fact that management of the fleet is now so simplified reduces its value even more. Instead of putting different goods-types central it should have gone down the route of: Container-ships/Bulk-carriers and contract-work only, you know, like the real world? It should have an AI, also bidding on contracts. Real life margins in this business are cut-throat, yet after playing a few hours in the sandbox on medium difficulty I have 15 top of the range ships and billions of dollars to instantly expand my fleet - but there is no reason to. All I do now is send ships from one radio-active port to another and rake in the cash.  Real shame as it is a huge missed opportunity. Sims become great when they have more depth, not less. Look at Paradox games for an example of how to get that right.			"

												OK, this review is primarily for the campaign game as I still am in the progress of completing it.THE GOOD:If you remember Ports Of Call, this game has a very familiar feel to it.  So much so that I would consider it the spiritual successor to that fine game.  The ship docking is nearly identical, smaller feeder ships are more difficult to dock than the larger post panamax & larger ships that have side streamer jets that will allow much better maneuverability than the tiny ships.  Many varied ports are available worldwide to sail into and each port has very unique feel to it.  Hamburg & Santos are especially technical and can be quite challenging and fun to sail into at full speed.  They have an option to pay a tug to skip the manual docking for a fee based on your ship size.  The fee can be quite a hit to the profitability of the runs... Which leads me to the Bad...THE BAD:Profitability:  I have noticed that the smaller ships, while they carry much less cargo, and in some cases are significantly slower, are FAR more profitable than the larger ships.  Cargoes are 3 to 5 times more profitable per container than the larger ships.  THIS IS A COLOSSAL FLAW IMO, and a huge reason that my fleet of over 200 post panamax ships is starting to bog down my computer.  I refuse to make runs where the cargo value for my huge UCLV ship is equal to a post panamax ship 3 size classes smaller.I have found that there are ways to crock the game model by leaving feeder ships in the company contract ports to generate hordes of tiny highly profitable contracts meant for feeder ships, but this exploit should not be needed.  The value of the cargo should remain similar through all the ship classes to motivate players to want to get the giant ships (which are a blast to drive) because they are big money as well as big fun.  Instead I am forced to slog through thousands of port tug fees to remain profitable.  Which leads me to the UGLY...THE UGLY:  The worst part of the campaign is the outright thievery of the investor.  The first several status upgrades come along at reasonable intervals and have logical milestones to nudge the player to create a shipping empire.  Once the player hits the Magnate level though, the game bogs down into mindnumbing repetition.  The game becomes a treadmill of completing company contract after company contract.  The fun ""quests"" of filling a whole slew of varied contracts to a specific city are no more.  The ""driving quests"" where you are tasked with parking several of each ship are gone.Tycoon level is the worst though.  Your only goal is to gather enough money to buy out this thief, who wants roughly triple the value of your empire when you hit Tycoon.  That wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't spent the entirety of the game building up a world spanning empire.  The main problem is that the thief/investor comes in every 3 months and steals 25% of your cash!  This game mechanic alone is almost enough to stop even the most diehard players in their tracks.  I have found that after a point, it becomes nigh impossible to break through this crock of a game mechanic and actually succeed and ""win"" the game.All in all I would give a thumbs up to the game as a whole, but not the campaign.  While the campaign starts out great, it ends like the Hindenburg explosion...  OH THE HUMANITY of repetition!  I have read the previews for Transocean 2, and multiplayer mode sounds like great fun. For now though, I have to agree with may other reviewers.  Grab the game on sale, and enjoy it.  Very likely it will be cheaper per hour of entertainment  than a movie, and when you create your own conditions for victory, the non-campaign could be quite enjoyable indeed.			"

												This is the first game I purchased via the Steam recommendations.  I am certainly not disappointed.  So far, I have 10 hours in the game, and I feel addicted.  This is a fairly simple simulator/logistics game.  The game has a tutorial, and I'm playing through it.  However, if you played similar games, such as Cities in Motion or Railroad Tycoon, then you can probably figure this out.  You buy a ship, get a contract, and then deliver the goods.  You have investors, you can take out a loan, and your ship will need fuel and maintenance.  From that standpoint, it is very easy.  As you get more ships, you gain more capacity but lose some capability.  Eventually, you can create company specific contracts that require delivery of a certain good to a certain location; at this point the complexity starts to become apparent.  To keep it interesting, you also have to deal with storms, pirates, and fires at sea.While the game is fun to play, it still needs some polish.  I've had a few popup notifications remain on the screen.  I can play through them and sometimes get them to disappear, but its a bug.  While there are hazards, like storms and pirates, they purely random rather location specific, thus avoidable.  For example, I had a piracy near the Canaries, and I hit a storm with one vessel while another vessel sailed through the same area at the same time without the storm.  Personally, I find these oddities to be minor imperfections and potential room for growth in the development.  Overall the game is very solid platform and is good enough for this early release.A larger area for growth is the games focus on cargo container shipping.  I commented about this in relation to US ports on the forums.  I was happy to see the game designer respond within hours of my comments.  While my request won't go fulfilled for now, I'm satisfied knowing that they understand the issue.I'm definitely getting my money's worth from the game.  I think the game is playable for most ages.  If you are into sims like this, you'll love it.  If you prefer FPS games, then you'll probably hate this game as it is not meant for you.  I recommend this to all the simmers out there.			"

												The game gets very old, very fast.  It's incredibly easy to make a huge amount of money, and for a supposed business game, many things (like staff wages, stock market, competition) are absent.The graphics are quite pretty, and it's neat that each port is ""unique"", but you probably won't get to see most of them.  Not only is the port view extremely restricted, but very quickly you'll tire of manually docking and lauching the ships - there's not enough complexity in the ""mini-game"" to keep it interesting.  By the end of the first year, you'll most likely be auto-docking all your ships.  If not, you'd be docking HUNDREDS of times PER YEAR.Since there are no difficulty levels in the game, there's really no reason to replay the game once you've completed the career.  Freeplay is available, but it makes an easy game even easier.  The ships basically can't lose money (example: I'll often get a single delivery contract worth $25M.  The fuel costs for this trip are less than $1M.  Each ship can do this 2-3 times a month, so when you have multiple ships, well... unlimited money, if you have the patience to grind it). Ship upgrades are so cheap I just fully upgrade every new ship I buy (rendering the whole system kind of useless).Interesting concept, but they really needed to flesh out their game design in order to make it more fun to play.

												A lot of people thus far keep comparing the game to ports of call, and there are a ton of similarities between TransOcean and POC, you can choose to play the game more like the old DOS game Ocean Trader.  The game is fun to bring your ships into port and try to meet deadlines on contracts with your fleet of ships, however as the game progesses having to dock every single ship gets old fast.  However, if you like piloting ships into and out of port, then this game is for you.  I've gotten far enough into the game that I have ended up playing it more like Ocean Trader and using tugs when my ships have to dock.  I still enjoy relaxing and just racking up cash and expanding my fleet.Either way you play it, the game is quite the feat and well worth the money, especially if it's bought on sale.			"

												As a big fan of transport simulator games like Transport Tycoon I jumped on this one. The game is fun, for the first 5 hours or so. Unfortunately it suffers from repetitive gameplay and the tedious management of your ships. When you start to have more than a handful of ships to control the game becomes overwhelming. Your life becomes docking ships, reloading them, and setting them to be repaired. Manually docking is also enjoyable at first but something you'll soon be more than willing to pay a premium to avoid. On top of this, the banker and her loan will be with you for a long long time. In 10 hours of game play I was still not close to being able to pay her off due to the requirements.It feels like there is potential here for the game to be better than it currently is. Right now it too quickly becomes a micro-management simulator. Even with the problems I'd still recommend the game as I feel like I got my money's worth out of it; just know what you're getting into before hand and only pick it up during a sale.			"

												If you never encountered the 90s classic Ports of Call Amiga game then this Tycoon merchant marine simulation game may open your mind to how oddly addictive and geeky this kind of game can be.It kind of appears to be another version of the Ports of Call game brought forward into the 21st Century though some of the features such as a few entertaining, sometimes nailbiting minigames are sadly missing which kinda like takes a bit of the soul away from what made the classic so popular many years ago. Despite a few shortfalls it is a nice translation of the old Amiga Classic where your family give you weird looks as you blurt the odd expletive trying to park a 400m long heavily laden ship moving at speed into what would probably be the shipping equivalent of a ""tight parking space"".I hope this game has some sort of expansion planned in the future to include more types of specialised transport ships and more minigames to broaden the experience and truly bring the game properly forward from its ancestral past.I found iceburg avoidance amongst other things a nice quirky addition that is sadly missing in TOTSCo.  Where I would have expected the sucsessor to PoC go would be to expand on these minigames for getting through storms, pirates, customs inspections and so on and so forth.  Despite this the campaign adds some ""depth"" into the simulation though I'm not too sure if it has the same charm as PoC.I do wonder what is up with the optmisation of the graphics.  I expected some exceptional water physics and ship modelling, sadly its not quite anywhere near 2010 graphic standards let alone 2014.  Maybe more to follow in future patches and updates?I'll happily wait for the hard working Devs to throw us a bone now and then.  In the meantime I'll continue to bemuse my family at playing a game of pure Geekdom! and yet again make another attempt to park this 400m long monster of a ship and beat my best time without a nick in the paintwork!...I hope. ^^			"

												I missed seeing this game when it came out, or I would have gotten it sooner, It is a simple cargo ship company tycoon game, very much like the classic 1986 Ports Of Call, with lovely 3D graphics and overall a nicer art style. For those interested, Ports Of Call XXL is in development (www.portsofcall.de), and you can get versions of the classic game as well. http://www.metallicat95.com/?p=388 -- my review pageTransOcean has all the nice elements for a trading game — transport cargo from port to port, trying to make the most money and boost your reputations in order to improve your shipping company. Travel to more ports, play the ship driving minigame to get in and out of the docks for more status (and to save money and see the nice scenery), buy more ships, complete company contracts, and get rich. Or go bankrupt if you fail, but the game is overall fairly easy to play.This is a single player game, with a sequel with multiplayer and more features coming out in May 2016, As such, my recommendation is to get this one on sale, unless you can’t wait to get your ship captain fix now. The polish of this game is a good sign for the future of its replacement, and I expect that you won’t get exactly the same sort of challenges and game play features in the sequel.  This original game does, though, contain the background story and missions which set up the campaign mode of its sequel, and may be a little easier to play (in single player).There are two basic game modes, the campaign — a mission-driven game with an investor who gives you orders and wants to be paid back, with the ultimate goal to become a tycoon and take control of the company — and the free game, where you just run the shipping company however you want. The campaign can be a challenge to win, but also provides a nice tutorial on how to play.Much of the joy of the game is making smart choices and watching your company and bank balance grow. You will spend most of your time watching your ships sail around the world, and making decisions when they reach ports. Refuel now, or wait for a cheaper location? Select cargos for the best pay, but take into account the chances of getting new valuable jobs at each destination. Repair or upgrade your ship as needed. Some cargos require upgrades in order to legally carry them — take them without and you risk customs inspections and fines. Time spent sitting in port costs money, so that is another hard choice.Some jobs have time deadlines. They pay better, increase your status if you are one time, but penalize you if you fail. The company contracts you can take give you a mission to deliver a specific kind of cargo from one specific port to another, with a time limit as well. They add another piece of depth, trading guaranteed work with a good payoff at the end (and more status) for a commitment which makes you miss out on valuable high-paying loads to other locations — or taking them, and risk failing the contract.All the ships in this game are container cargo ships, and can carry multiple cargo loads as long as they fit on the ship. Sometimes you have enough to fill the ship and go to one destination, but often you must it several destinations in order to travel fully loaded. Each port docked at takes time and money.Early in the game, you will dock manually and play a simple ship driving game to get into or out of the harbor. It isn’t hard to do being slow and patient, but most of us don’t want to wait too long, and so you take chances and risk damaging your ship. Succeeding boosts your status. Being Famous means you’ll get better deals and cargos than a small, Unknown company and captain.Later in the game, especially once you’ve seen all the ports in 3D, you’ll just pay the tug costs and skip this part of the game, as long as you have the money in the bank.There are dangers which can affect your ship’s travel — storms at sea, fires, sickness, reefs, pirates, rescue missions — plus the risk of customs delays if your ship isn’t running legally. Taking the risky illegal goods (counterfeit and questionable merchandise) pays very well, but has much higher fines and delays if you are caught. Plus the illegal goods are confiscated, unlike loads where you aren’t compliant with regulations.Most trips, though, are uneventful for legal, properly maintained ships. You’ll spend your time making good choices each time a ship hits port, and when you cast off to send it to its next destination. The game proceeds in simulated real time (you can accelerate the clock, and will do so often in the early game). With more ships in play, you will have a lot on your mind, as you try to figure out the best way to make money and complete your missions.The sequel adds competition -- AI and human multiplayer -- and expands a lot on this game.  But the basic elements seem similar enough, with, I hope, enough improvements to make it a really great game to enjoy with friends.			"

												Decent game. Its very polished and plays well. The game offers exactly what its intended, a tycoon simulation trading on the seven seas.The love they have put into views is lost with the camera being fixed behind your ship, which is where the game tries to be different. It does not do it justice imo.Overall the game is good, but not worth its current price tag. if you wish to splurg and love tycoon simulations this game will entertain you for maybe a week max, a day if your experienced player.

												My review is from single player only. I work for a container shipping company, so this game caught my eye a while ago. I expected something like the classic Railroad Tycoon series, but with ships. What I got was something different, but in a bad way. The game itself isn't horrid, but more something that is vastly inefficient. The mini-game of docking the ships manually when they call ports is tedious and just isn't worth it at almost any point in the game. The whole thing is pointless. The business element is very lacking, and I was disappointed that the one of only ways they could think to make the game challenging was to vary the same starting scenario. The only thing that changes is the insane interest rate the player is required to pay to the angel investor, along with her ability to sign annoying shipping contracts with huge penalties without your consent. Starting capital should be something the player is in conrol of, or at least given some options. I haven't beaten the game yet, but so far the only risk is getting caught without proper liscense to carry goods and varying interest rates. All of the systematic risks associated with shipping, storms, fire, whatever are all completely random and don't even affect other ships on the same rotues. There is no political risk, market risk, exchange rate risk, or purchasing power risk. The game is supposed to be global, but has nothing global about the simulated economy nor is it dynamic in supply/demand. Last, and probably the biggest deal breaker, I don't enjoy the micro management required in this game. Having to approve every single ship when you call port is annoying, and it seems almost impossible to set up a static voyage using supply and demand or contracts. Every port you have to pick new goods based on what is available and then decide where the ship is to go next, and because goods cant be transferred at ports for a hub and spoke strategy, the only way to play is by having direct routes for every ship. In late game, you have so many shipts they are calling ports every 4 seconds so the gameplay never feels like it is going anywhere. Youre costantly being inturruped by having to agree to pay the docking fee, load more goods, and then choose the next port. The only way to keep ships in specific areas is to basically micromanage contracts, and have them sit in port waiting for a contract that keeps them from having to go from the EU to Asia, or float them completely empty to another port, which is again heavy micromanagement when you consider how many ships you have to track in late game, and not realistic at all.These business simulators still have things to learn, and it makes you truely appreciate games which are very well done like the Railroad Tycoon seres. They are still amazing. The next installment of Transcean is out this summer, I hope it is a little better.			"

												TransOcean - the new Ports of Call!If you liked PoC back in the day, you'll like this one too.It is basically the same, just with better graphics and features.If you are looking for a deep, mutitasking ""managing-a-company"" game, this is not the one for you.Hope for a big DLC sometime in the future to expand the type of vessels, i.e. tankers and others to transport other kinds of goods.

												Simply put its a great game, if you are interested in a game that is all about managing a network of ships, ensuring you can afford the ships, fuel, repairs and any fines you incure all the while needing to keep enough money in the bank to pay your greedy investor then this may be the game for you.The graphics are exactly what you would expect from a game that is essentialy a map and a bunch of finance screens, simple clean and easy to understand. The docking part of the game is quite fun but when you have 10+ ships can become very tedious to dock every ship. The advantage of actually docking yourself is you save the moring fee's and when it come to the most expensive ship in the game thats a lot of money especialy if you dock the ship and leave the port. So it comes in handy throughout the game and while you dont need to use it ever it can be useful (especialy if your ships is empty and you need to move to a different port and want to save some money), its also quite fun and challenging as some of the docks are very oddly shapped and possitioned. The graphics for the docking are nice clean and I expect will stand the test of time nicely.Every aspect of the game is fun, if a bit repetative, however with the docking mini game you can vary it up and keep the fun alive. It does become very repetative nearing the end of the game as you are simply trying to buy out your investor and the money you need is huge and can take a little too long to reach, which is the only real downside to this entire game. I wold have liked to have seen a few other elements like competiton with other companies and the such but alas not in this game. If the game starts to feel repetative try taking on a contract that is restrictive or try and get a chain of contracts, there are many ways to keep your interest, you just need to look for them.The tutorial is very good and is perfectly integrated into the main game so no need to stop and start. You follow the instructions and you start making money. My personal recomendayion is to always but the ship with the highest top speed and bigest hold, the distance it can travel is imaterial, especialy when you reach level 3 and 4 ships.Pro'sGraphics are simple and clean and will not feel dated in the years to comeA number of different challenges throughout the game.Piloting the ships are fun and challenging, the latter ships with thrusters, makes piloting a dream.Finding the best routes to make money is a lot of fun.Con'sCan be repetative, especialy later on.You will hate how much the investor takes from you and can be annoying when you simply want to finish the game.Becomes a little to easy in the late game.When you have 15 + ships it still takes forever to buy out the investorConclusion, this is a fun game that will keep you occupied for many hours, however its not for everyone and you need to be a tycoon fan to get the most out of this game, and even then trying to end the game will annoy you.

												I would totally love to recommend this game, but I just cant because of a few issues:1. You start the campaign with little money (how suprising) and to maximize the profits of your contracts you are forced to manually dock into the harbors. This is okay for a few times but will soon get boring. The automatic tug-in feature costs additional money depending on the ship class. Therefore you have to dock manually to get faster to better ships. With those you can easily pay the additional fee, but at the start you cant afford that and have to do the docking by yourself for the first 1.5-2h of the game.2. After you reached the 2nd ship class the world map opens and you can take contracts to cross the oceans. Your advisor tells you, that the starting ship class (the ""Feeder""-class) is not able to carry enough to make such trips profitable.You may think ""Okay, then I use the Feeders to only ship goods within a continent."" .. Yes, but no. The number of contracts which lets you do this is very limited when the world map opens up. Most contracts are intercontinental from now on.This makes the ""Feeder"" quite useless. He cant carry much weight, is very slow and cant deliver all goods because he cant be upgraded to do so. Compared to the bigger ships, the ""Feeder"" is a deadweight to your company. But only the ""Feeder"" is able to dock at small harbors like Reykjavik or Anchorage which leads to the most concerning point:3. After a while the stakeholder of your company signs contracts for you. If you dont manage to fulfill these you have to pay a penalty fee. I am okay with this but some contracts require you to use ""Feeders"" since you have to sail to the smaller harbors. So.. the game tells you that ""Feeders"" are useless in the later stages, but forces you to keep them. At some point you get a contract where you are told, that if you dont fulfill it, the stakeholder closes your company. And guess what: You need ""Feeders"" to reach the smaller harbors.Additionally to this illogical design.. why would a stakeholder close a company which is highly profitable and granted him like 2000% interests of the initial investment?This was the point at which I stoped playing.I would really like to recommend this (I love Port Royal, Patrician and Rise of Venice), but these issues just ruined the whole experience for me.

												I rarely buy games this expensive and at full price, but something urged me to get this after the first major update of bug fixes was released. There seems to be a wealth of official and unofficial game remakes recently and I definately feel we are encountering another golden age of PC gaming. This game is unofficially similar to the old DOS game ""Ports of Call"". Even though I did find the storyline a bit weak, and the gameplay slightly tedious towards the end I still really enjoyed this game which I completed in under 20 hours in Normal mode. I may well attempt the game at hard level or try playing it with an erection at some point. I am hoping that perhaps add ons or a follow up game will be released to improve the game, but if you have fond memories of POC I am sure you will enjoy this.			"

												I was quite surprised at how much I liked this game. I had only ever played one ship sim and gave up after 42 minutes. I was burned out on fps and horror/survival and just wanted to sit and play a game that did not drain me and this was just the ticket. It is really easy to learn the basics in the begining but gets quite challenging as you get into the economics of the game. I have played the campaign 3 times. The first I lost my companyto the investor. She means it when she says she will shut you down. Then once one normal and once on hard and I may play it again. I feel I more than got my moneys worth with this game.			"

												This game reminds me of Ports of Call a game made in the 80s. But it's in 3d. It also plays similar to port royale but doesnt take as long to rank up in the game. I really like this kind of game. This one has good graphics too. I bought it after having it on my wishlist for a while and saw it was down in price so I bought it. This game is easily worth full price. I'm glad I purchased it. If you really like games for trading and making profit this game is a good game. And it takes less time to complete the game than port royale which i still like. I give it a 9/10 game cause i really glad I bought it but it seems to have one bug I found so far. There's a bug that has to do with weather you use tugs or not and it leaves a box for it on right side of screen.  You can remove these box(es) by saving and reloading the save.			"

												The idea of game is not bad, but requires additional motivation to the player for spending more time and reaches some targets. It starts boring to move the vessels in/out of ports many times, while the idea is a managing of Shipping Company. With a fleet size more than 100 ships the gameplay turns to a long-long row of mouth clicks. The player has to spend several hours to complete on month of game time. Another big issue, what to do with money?  My account grows to 10 billion and I have no idea where to invest.  Hoping the Developers will read the comments of fans and apply the improvements to gaming process. "

												One dimensional and tedious.  There needs to be a higher level of automation; setting up shipping routes, preferences of goods, ports to sail to and from automatically, refueling, etc. so you can focus on MANAGEMENT.  One person doesn't make every day-to-day decision in a business with billions of revenue, especially ones as mundane as ""should we refuel the ship?"".  After a certain point it just becomes a button pressing simulator, there's barely any thought involved.Would really love to see some features like hiring mid-level managers after a certain rank, give them some traits like willing to accept risk, playing it safe, cares about your reputation, or cares about speed, etc.  It would give this game a whole new dynamic that is much more about management at the top level.I am giving it a thumbs up because it is a great START to a game that could be extremely fun, and it did keep me occupied for over 10 hours for the pennies I paid for it.  If you find this heavily discounted it's worth trying if you're into this type of thing.			"

This game also does not do anything new or revolutionary in any way shape or form and lacks any depth of any kind!!!!That being said, now that you know what you are getting is it still worth it?             For me yes. If you like economic sims and are looking for a timer killer this is pretty good to fill that spot and focusing on shipping only is a unique aspect. Would i cough up $20 for it? no.. wait till it goes on sale.Its a point and click adventure and the learning curve is not all that steep. Click boat A and find the most profitable route... pretty much the entirety of the game right there.They touted how they accurately modeled the ports.... wish they had spent that time on making a better game but meh...

												If you're looking for a challenging management game, keep looking. I don't understand why there's a boat parking simulator in this game either, but this could be personal.I'd like this game when i'm in a certain mood but then again when i have a few ships in one port, the game laggs like crazy.The easiest way (in theory) to handle contracts is having enough ships in port A and stocking/sailing/docking em all in one go. Doing this laggs your game out to an unplayable state. it looks to me like this could be easily resolved. Also the possibility to make a fleet (or smth similar) should be added. by this i mean just having a bunch of ships connected to each other and then sharing cargo and, more importantly, player input. going through every ship individually is a pain, that i don't want to go through.This game is heavily flawed but has so much potential. It could really be a good and enjoyable game :/It doesn't look like the devs care to change it at this point, sadly.It's a waste of money now.			"

												If you're interested in an navel-merchant game, then the Patrician series is a better option (and much cheaper).

												I fired this game up on a whim because I don't have full use of my left hand at the moment and can't play keyboard-heavy games, and I found out that this is a fun game that scratched a logistics simulation itch I didn't know I had. However, there is little challenge besides the contracts (especially the mandatory one at the end of the campaign). I also suffered intense slowdown browsing through contracts while there were multiple ships in port and the docking and launching minigame was tedious (though thankfully skippable if you pay for a tugboat).I'd cautiously recommend it for anybody who enjoys casual games involving economics and planning.

												One of my favorite games growing up was ""Ports of Call by Rolf ""Dieter"" Klein"", and playing this brings back some great memories.  I love the whole gameplay, however it did lose a bit of it's polished feel when you get the really big ships and can trade internationally.However - there are still bugs.  Upgrading the smaller ships to carry medical supplies, and bring still unable to properly transport them until you have the bigger ships that have the same capability, just with refridgeration was frustrating and not so intuitive.  But this only happens on the primary ship, and not on your other ships.  Recently I was unable to fuel the ship after loading with cargo which was odd.  Still a ways to go to getting it stable, but it is early access so you get that.This is a genuine ""holy heck, it's 2am"" game, and a lot of fun.  Looking forward to the finished product.			"

												At first, seems like a decent management game. You can manage your shipping  company, it has a lot of products to ship, different ships, you can expend to the whole world, build subsidiaries in other ports, different types of ports cannot host all ships, there is a loan system, overall it seems pretty good and deep enough.But, this game suffers from 2 great problems : the lack of automation options, which makes it repetitive as hell after some time, and just end-up being over and over the same click and send process (which is very annoying as you progress through the game). The second big problem is clarity, there isn't any option to track and establish routes, to easily see ongoing contracts (and they have a deadline), in the end it becomes really annoying to have to send manually each ship while having to remember all contracts deadline, which makes it feel really clumsy.Pros : -Decent management game.-Lots of Different ships.-Loan system.-contract system.-Rank system giving something to achieve.Cons :-Clumsy management.-Terrible lack of Clarity.-Terrible lack of automatic feature.-Not very intuitive interface.

												I must have picked this up in a Humble Bundle at some point since I don't remember buying it.Anyway, the game is very plodding and methodical. 90% of your time will be spent playing a boat maneuvering minigame to dock and undock, unless you pay an in game fee to skip it. It really takes quite a while to pick up, but, honestly that's what I look for in a ""Stay up all night by accident"" simulation game. There are enough decisions to be made that it feels like if you were careless you could genuinely bankrupt yourself, which is good, it would be no fun if it were too easy. It even takes quite a while to unlock the ability to send ships outside of the immediate European/Mediterranean area.Strictly speaking, it is a boring game. But sometimes that's what I'm into. It is what it is. And what it is doesn't seem to be worth $20. (Like, the art assets aren't anything incredibly fancy, I genuinely wonder what the production budget was for this) Pick it up for $5 or less, if you know this is the kind of game you like.			"

												Very Great Game !!! . If you like/love games like PoC , Der Reeder , Hanse , Patrizier or Port Royal you might find a game which you would like either.You should give it also a try if you like games like Industriegigant, Transport Tycoon, OpenTTD a.s.o.The only thing which is missing, is a multiplayer mode (hotseat would be fully satisfying)  which all of the above include.

												everything was fine with the game the two things that killed it for me was the poor map view and boat graphics, just look like thin cigarettes moving around & the manual docking mode is sooooo incredibility tedious, unrealistic, rudimentary and boring. They even have the &%$#! to force you to dock the biggest and hardest boats for a story line mission! I hate it. Otherwise pretty fun game. "

												Not a really difficult game, some nice logistics. What's it about:In the campaign you begin in Europe and from there you spread to the world, obviously ships will get bigger and you will make a lot of money in the campaign but you have to keep in mind you have to buy your company back from the investor. I have bought the company back, took me slightly over 60 hours of only campaign game-play. I have not had any game-breaking bugs so far, so no severe ones that I encountered. Theres only the loss of frames when moving the view in docks when multiple ships are in the same dock, though I almost never do that. Further more.. you can manually dock and cast off your ships (press spacebar when manually taking control it is fun) which will not cost you any money.. it will when you auto do it.Free play?Yes there is that option, have not reached that point yet.Recommend it?Yes, but I read they are making TransOcean 2. So it is up to you to buy this one or wait for the new one.			"

												Keep your eyes on this oneWhere this game goes will be dependent on how the development team patches the game.  As of now I have 4 hours of time played, and financially there seemed to be no difficulty even paying for tugs from the very start.  Right now the difficulty lies in manually docking, and not getting in over your head in taking on company contracts.TransOcean does hold potential to evolve into a great game, so long as the devs have programmed it so it can be adjusted.The game features pop up events akin to the old game from the 90's called Ocean Trader.  In  Ocean Trader you would buy goods at a port, and then deliver them someplace else to sell them at a profit.  In TransOcean everything is contract based, so there's no risk in buying a bunch of goods you might get stuck with selling at a loss.I have been unable to get the game to run in Nvidia 3D vision which is a disappointment.This game has a simplistic and relaxing feel similar to Farming Simulator, for that I would recommend it.  Be warned, there is not much difficulty in the game yet, and if you are someone who needs to be pushed to excel, might want to wait this one out to see where the patches take it.			"

												I dont know why people are complaining about this game, its not easy and the money is not easy to get!Actually, this is a game that you might stay for hours playing it, not because your in love with the story. No, but because your ambition is telling you ""i want more!"", and no matter how much you feed it, there is still more to do! For god's sake i spent 27 hours already, but there is a lot more to do!! And Thats why i recommend this game. Sure its easy to get a million, but million is nothing these days (and this game) because everything costs a lot more! if you buy something too soon you might get yourself into debt. And its a lot harder to get into debt than to get out (Depending on how smart you are) and this is where the fun begins!So i totally recommend this game, i am a fan of the patrician series. And have been hoping for another trading game for years. This game is fun. And gives you an idea of how trading is done these days, so you actually learn something by playing it!Seriously, whats with the 0.8 hrs bad reviews...			"

												It's a solid thing-management game. The progress is satisfying, the trade contracts you get offered are just random enough that you have to think about which ones to get each time rather than mindlessly repeating a decision you arrived at much earlier (looking at you, Master of Orion 2 and Holy Potatoes), and the game automatically pauses in most of the places where I'd want it to.Its greatest flaw is that the load times for the ship-parking minigame are so incredibly long I stopped bothering with it entirely fairly quickly.

												Among the German-style simulation game genre, this one is a gem with tons of polish. There are still minor bugs, but I haven't run into anything game-breaking or that couldn't be resolved without a quick restart.The docking/undocking minigame is a fun diversion that lets you see the beautiful port cities. As some have mentioned the camera angle is somewhat limited denying you a full panorama, but it's not too terrible. You can zoom out further once you unlock bigger ships, but the camera is locked between about 45 degrees and straight top-down.The rest of the game is pretty well balanced. There are some random events that provide enough risk/reward to gamble on transporting illegal goods for example, or good you don't own a license for. Sometimes you can get away with it and sometimes customs will seize your haul and hit you with a big fine.It still remains profitable to keep your starter ships as well. Your $/ton scales depending on the size ship you have. Smaller ships have the highest $/ton while the largest have the smallest, making up for it in sheer bulk.The campaign puts a progression track in while putting a wrench in the gears every so often to keep things interesting. You will get contracts you were forced to agree to from time to time that have a tight deadline and require a great deal of coordination to pull off.Overall, a very polished experience in this genre, and I would highly recommend it if you're a fan of the genre already. If you are a new player, give it a try. If you don't find your zen playing this type of repetitive game, this genre may not be for you, and that's ok!			"

												I'm a big fan of Ports of call and I think this is a highly polished revisit of that hit late 90s Amiga game. All aspects of the original wre preserved, enhanced for modern standards with a few additions here and there. Having played the game for over 10 hours, I like it but there are a few things that I don't like. The UI is REALLY REALLY bad:- Even in 2560x1440, you can't fit more than 8 ships in your ship list window- The ship list is utterly useless. It doesnt even summarize the container upgrades that were applied to each ship, which makes it a PAIN for you to know which should take care of what contracts (ie: food vs electronics) - Ship list also doesnt tell you which are being repaired/upgraded, how long it will take, even when you expand the list items.  Designers, please take a look at how Endless space or Endless legend  manages the list of cities/planets and do the same!- Even in large resolutions, you can't fit all your notifications in the viewport. Whetever doesnt fit goes away at the same pace and you miss out a lot of important info- The evelope icon is a useless decoration. I wish it at least brought back recent notificationsBasic gameplay- Whenever you go back to world map, it unpauses the game. HAAARgh - Persistent notifications (ie: ""become a tycoon"", or ""shipping line boss"" stay on screen but they don't tell you the requirements for attaining them- There isn't a coundtoun for when that greedy b$#&ch investor will come get her millions. - Ports of call allowed you to take control mid-trip, to avoid a collision course, steer through a reef, etc, not only when docking in/out. Why take that out? - There isnt a notification for ""some of your ships are idle"" and the funky auto pausing/unpausing system will make you lose track of which ships are bein repaired, which are just waiting for better contracts, etc etc. It's hard to keep track of 12 ships, I can hardly imagine when I have 20+Plateau- The early game is awesome, but I'm experiencing a painful plateau to get the post panamax ships (shipping line)- I can only buy level two ships and yet I maxed out my reputation. I think it's a bit unrealisting and not engaging.- No AI competitors! - Encounters and mishaps are VERY repetitive. There should me more types, more ways to deal with them and more outcomes. - The economy never seems to fluctuate (apart from fuel prices and loan rates). - I'm currently stuck and can't advance to the lext level because the game says I need to build a subsidiary, yet when I try to do so (I already have one in south america) the game says I have no remaining subsidiaries. I like the game but for this price point I expect WAY more content, ships and variety. And I won't pay 10 bucks for a DLC that includes helpful UI, features and content that should be in a 30 USD game in the 1st place.  UI and gameplay problems make you feel like you're working in a inefficient company. But yeah, I still recommend the game because the original concept's timelessness. I think the developpers could've paid a tiny bit of praise to Rolf-Dieter Klein and Martin Ulrich on their website because it's clear that the core qualities come from the original 1986 release.  It's preetier though and the ports look great.  "

												This game starts really well, and in the first few hours I was having a great time.  However VERY quickly, it completely runs out of steam and there is simply nothing to do.  Mid to End game content is non-existent and you'll soon find yourself in an endless loop of the same few UI screens that are cumbersome and essentually pointless.  In free play mode, you can unlock and largest ship (at which point there's nothing else to do) and have over 1B dollars in a few hours.The docking mini-game is interesting but gets old quickly and because it takes so long, you'll just end up skipping it.  As such it's just looking at a world map collecting money.  With no ability to automate routes etc you must endlesslessly select a cargo, refuel and cast off, urgh.This game really needs more content because there's a lot of potential, but until there's AI players, a dynamic economy, the ability to schedule route automatically, natural and economic disasters, and diffuculty options (like cargo pays 75% less money) this is too easy and gets old too quickly.  What a pity.			"

I feel like it's a feature there to humour us. 0-5kts in 1 second is what you're looking at. The planning part of the game is actually really good as you've got deadlines to meet, possible pirate attacks, fire at sea, castaways to pick up, reefs and storms to circumvent so even the best laid plans can go wrong. It's not overly regular though which I like so it's not ""oh. look. my boat's on fire again.""Should you buy it if you're interested in the strategy aspect? YesFor actual boating? No.			"

												Holy Crap! Someone invented time travel!!! I have been thinking about buying this for the last several months. When I saw TransOcean on sale, I went ahead and picked it up. I started playing it, bought a few ships, filled some contracts, started to REALLY HATE the shrew of an investor... (my apologies to any actual shrews offended by that comment)and then, I think it was about the point where I had 6 ships, I TIME TRAVELLED! No. Really. I time travelled. That is the only explanation I can think of. I looked at the clock and it was 10:00... a few minutes later, it was 11:30... THEN IT WAS 2:00!!! Somehow, I now had 10 ships and nearly $200 million... I must experiment with this more, but so far, it seems that the time travel only goes forward, not backward...			"

												This is not a simple management game, you actualy have to think about your routes, your ships, and the upgrades your gonna use, not to mention balance your income, since int eh the campagine 20% of your quarterly statement goes to the investor, which makes it interesting and not untainable.the graphics are great, and for those that liek to skim out of haven to pay for a tug boat that auto-parks your ships, you can drive them your self, no port is so small for a ship so big to be parked, i managed to get a class 4 ship into a tiny port, though it took like 15mins, and that was cause i was curious to see if i could.at the start, focus on the main ports to get multi shipments tot he same place and if you can also stops at ports inbetween, this allows you to gain tiny amounts of $$$ to get through to your second ship, after that you start to delve into a constant state of awerness of whats going on, though if you dont focus on upgrades (which i didn't) it can lead to fires, busted by the customs officers, and a few other nice little things that pop up time to time, priates will steal your ship and demand all your $$$ still have yet to find out how to counter them.other then that this game is pretty good, though a few UI issues noticed that would help streamline the game a bit but other then that its pretty good.8/10			"

												Well, I like this game because of nostalgic reasons mostly but it's still enjoyable. Basically the game is a shipping company simulator/tycoon, you can buy ships and carry goods all accross the world. At the beginning you will have a few money and can only operate in he Mediterran region but when your company grows up, you can reach all of the world. At first sight the game reminded me the original Ports of Call, the berth&sailing parts are the same. On the other hand, PoC was more arcade-ish than TO. Once the game starts, your first task will be to select your home port. Be wise with your selection because each port has its own advantages and disadvantages. After then, raise your company and conquer the seas. In general, I like the game. The controls and gameplay is smooth, graphics and the music are good but at some point it becomes repetitive. An another issue is that, if you buy a lot of ships the game slows down. Don't expect a perfect tycoon game, but still it has some positive value.			"

												A great management company simulation, hindered by some design and depth issues.At it's core, you manage a fleet of ships for a budding company and an insane investor (maybe they're like this in real life too).It lacks a lot of automation and tracking, and a lot of ship info is kind of hidden away, so you'll have to find some guides to make your life easier, but if you work at it, it's a pretty enjoyable experience. The base gameplay is good, the implementation could use a bit (okay, a lot) more polish.For example, there's no way to tell what port your ships originally bought goods from in-game (write it down), you can't ""assign"" ships to a mission, you manually tell em where to go each time and what goods to buy (rename your ships each time for 100k LOL, or write it down), and contraband is illegal and smacks you for like 20-60% of your net worth, but you won't find out till you get caught (random, almost never worth it after a while).On sale, for a bit of fun, yes, I would recommend this or just grabbing Factorio lol.

												TransOcean is a great management game with surprisingly addictive gameplay, trying to manage each ship as it sails across the globe is fun and being able to dock manually both breaks up the monotony and serves as an interesting gameplay mechanic (free docking) the game does have it's flaws though. While each port is beautifully rendered, they are poorly designed, often forcing ships to take odd routes, without a tug or bow/stern thrusters your ships are sometimes forced to take extra long routes or to take damage while docking or undocking; they also often have inconveniently placed obstacles like islands and landmarks, which wouldn't be so bad if the ships felt right. The ships feel like they slide around far to much, it's almost like they're turning from a point far forward of the actual rudder of the ship, additionally the top speed is 10 knots, less than 20 miles per hour, but looks to be about 100 miles per hour. All in all they just feel wrong and if they were tweaked a little would feel much better.These facts are by no means dealbreakers, and the game is fantastic even with them. If I was to suggest some changes; in addition to fixing up the ship handling (turning should be tighter, speed should feel lower and all ships should have thrusters) and the port design; I would find a way to spice up the map view a bit, it's quite dull at the moment. I would also prefer some adjustments to how the map works, clicking ports in Europe can sometimes be a challenge once the full map opens up since the game never remembers your zoom level and the ports in Europe are so close. The map outside of Europe also feels quite empty, with very limited options in North and South America.Hopefully this review doesn't sound too negative, but I find that negative points are often more useful in deciding if I want something or not. I recommend this game fully as a solid entry into any managment game fan's library.			"

												A good management sim, especially if you're bored with the city building variety. Fair warning though, the ship docking minigame gets pretty tedious. Paying to skip it is relatively affordable though, considering how expensive repairs & towing can be. Also the game doesn't differentiate between Capex & Opex when it comes to financial performance, so for a while your accountant will give you a nagging every time you buy a new ship.			"

(I came accross two customs agents in the entire game.)-I didnt feel that at any time I was at financial risk, the only time being early on when I had 1 ship.

												TransOcean is ok at best. Its difficult to get going and start earning money to buy another ship. You can make good money from smuggling but chances are you loose your shirt when customs bust you. The share holders demand their cut of your money as well. Plus repairing your ship and sitting in the habour waiting for repairs is costly. Theres not alot to this game. There are no other tycoon options for this game such as stock/share take over. Only one corp logo and nothing that will hold your interest after 1 hour of game play. If you enjoy sitting for hours trying to grind a few pennies to buy a ship without loosing your shirt ...go for it.			"

Because it is. You don't really have to worry about most of the details. To be honest, I just grab the highest speed ships and upgrade everything I can. Then I pick highest value trades at each port and move on at full speed. I haven't docked or left docks manually a single time, I haven't worried about fuel price or consumption once. I also haven't had a bad profit trip either. The only thing I worry about is not picking two different destinations with deadlines if I can't reach both in time. In other words, this is a chilling game. Just like watching a fireplace. Not challenging, but soothing.			"

												Yes, I would recommend......to fans of turn-based empire managment simulations that also have an interest in sea-borne commerce and merchant marine.>|< Quantatitive Rating = 7 out of 10 >|<______________________________Observations and other musings...This game is a lot like any management game, like space empire building without the conflict of war. In this case your focus is on fleet building and freight management. They have put in a lot of antagonist elements that take the place of conflict-based issues of other games, like an investor that you have to buy out eventually, otherwise the ♥♥♥♥♥ keeps saddling you with difficult contracts (missions) that set you back. Also, her quarterly dividend is 10% of your company's holdings: So when I as at nearly a billion $ in the bank and many ships in my fleet, she came along and was taking nearly $200 million every quarter. The game is primarily a management game at the strategic map level. There is a 3D mini-game where you can pilot your ships in and out of the ~60 ports, each rendered on actual ports. You don’t have to do the mini game, but it costs you harbour pilot fees to dock and undock, so I usualy pilot the big ships myself and let the harbour pilot do the smaller ones, because the fees for the big shps are crazy! They could do so much more with this game though: The only online element is that the price of commodities you ship is driven by what all the other players are doing in their games (if you want true online multiplayer you need to buy TOSC: Rivals), otherwise it is a private single player experience; They could have also had a design and build your own ship element (currently you can only buy new or used predefined ship classes); They also could have had far more ports with greater variation in freight and range of commodities; I would have also like to see a 3D first person on the bridge feature to reallt challenge you in the mini-game.I have to admit that I am enjoying the management side of it as well as the gamification aspect of the quests/challenges/missions. However, I can see how after a while it will seem pointless and get boring. Maybe it would be different on a more diffilcut level, but the introductory 'easy' level is too easy, but that’s where the excelent tutorial and assistance feature sits, so that what I started with.I also have to admit that I am using Excel to help track things: I have a 4-sheet .xlsx that tracks the ports, freight, ships, routes, contracts, challenges, etc., becasue the in-game lists and tracking are not as effective at getting at ithout closing existing screens. It could have done the interface a lot better.			"

												Pros:+ Zero bugs that I encountered, this isn't a sim game you're going to have to worry about crashing.+ Simple interface.+ Easy to learn after a brief tutorial.Cons:- Mind-numbingly simple. In the 1.5hr I played, I felt like I'd topped any concept of a ""challenge"" all that was left was a grind, I was raking in millions, had a massive fleet. - No competition, once you get rolling cash wise, there's no competitors or anything else to stop your progress.Overall:I can't say I DON'T recommend this game, as the developers did an excellent job of polishing it, and while the game is simple, it's everything the developer promised. I don't feel it's worth what I paid, but hopefully decent sales will encourage the developer to be a bit more ambitious in the future - they're clearly good at releasing a bug free product.			"

												So. Terrible graphics in the harbor menu, poorly optimized (doesn't look good and slogs down to 20 fps) and horrible floaty controls. And if you don't want to do the pointless docking minigame every time one of your ships enters a harbour you have to pay some of your revenue. And you want to skip it because it is completely unnecessary.The Tutorial is alright, though the boss lady takes lots of your revenue all the time, and hands you contracts that you simply can not fulfill in time because you can't afford the necessary ships yet. Probably I'm doing something wrong but playing on easy that seemed a bit unfair that I would've needed to buy ships that cost 60 million when I only just could afford a ship that cost 20.And then there are these long-time contracts. They seem like they're supposed to bring in a slow but steady stream of revenue, but why can't I just simply automate my ships to do those for me?Overall a bit meh.			"

												This is the kind of game that you play when you want to just lay back and relax. If you like transportation or city building games, then this is for you. I've been playing TransOcean for quite a bit of time now, and I still have lots more left to do and explore. I've still got about a third of all the ports left to explore. For some people, this game can get boring quick, but for others (like me), it's fun for ages.The game is a bit simple, and that is what makes it more of a relaxed type of game. I think that there is still quite a bit to add (maybe nighttime ;) since this game has just been released recently, and I hope that they go the right direction with it. I recommend it for anyone who likes simulation or transport games.			"

												A really well made clone of ""Ports of Call"". Easy to get into, not too complex, just a fun trading sim. I kinda miss the more complex details that the old PoC had, like deeper statistics (revenue per ship!) and the ability to split contracts to carry them with multiple ships.

												Surprisingly fun! If you remember the ancient classic Ports of Call or if the world of cargo ships holds any appeal, give it a shot. The main problem is that at a certain point gameplay becomes repetitive without introducing any new elements. Still, juggling multiple ships and optimizing routes remains challenging. This isn't for everyone but if it is for you, you'll know when you read this review :)			"

The investor woman in the game is still nagging me every once in a while and my business is going nowhere.So I restarted to transport whatever I feel like, whenever I feel like and in a vessel that *I* decide to be suitable for the transportation.

												This game does not scale nicely into the endgame. When you have a few ships in the beginning, it's managable. But tedium of managing them ramps up. You cannot set up trade routers, you need to manually attend every ship arriving or departing from every port. EVERY SHIP arraving or departing. EACH TIME.Due to that I was not able to finish the game as after quite a few hours doing the same thing over and over again I lost patience. Contracts feel like they were cupposed to add variaty, but in fact they make the whole thing worse, because now you are bound to shuttle beween two ports specified in the contract many times and this gives you even less creative choise than without. I have a feeling that this game could have been much better.We all hoped that the next installment improves it. but apparently this has not happened, which is a shame.			"

												I've been starving for a decent business simulation for a while. This is NOT a game where your savvy and cunning help you to outwit your competitors. This is a game where you find the most lucrative contracts and send your ship. Early on you have to endure parallel parking on steroids by docking and berthing your ships out of port.There's no challenge.I've put a decent amount of time in this game hoping that I could possibly face AI or have spheres of influence, market repurcussions for repeatedly shipping the same item to a port and oversaturating a market. Things like this don't come into play. It doesn't matter that Canada has a lucrative logging industry Halifax will still pay a competitive price for raw lumber.There's no automation of any kind, no monopoly building; many mechanics that could have tweaked this game from ""meh"" to enjoyable.It's a hollow experience. Knowing what I know now I'd like my money and almost 20 hours of my life back.			"

												Sorry i cant give a thumbs up on this.Too easy and i see everybody saying casual (but even casual should at least try to test your whits) but as soon as you have a big fleet, which you will in a very short time, the only thing you do is clicking and clicking on your mouse. You are so many times in ports that the only thing you do is go from screen to screen for loading, sailing, loading sailing and so on. If you have a lot of vessels this gets annoying since even if you have accepted a contract where you need to sail from one port to another to get the TUE there on time there is nothing you can get automated.Going in and out of port has nothing to do with ships, i can know i have sailed for over 15 years in real life, and has no challenge in it. As soon as you have money, again this is very fast, you pay a little bit for a ""pilot"" or ""tug"" or whatever since you make millions on cargoes only. If you can buy it for maybe a buck or two go for it but dont expect a challenge of any sort! Defenitely not worth 20 euros.			"

												If you are old enough to remember Port of Call then this game will be very familiar to you.Transocean is an updated version of the same game mechanic: you sail your ship moving cargo from port to port and you can directly maneuver the ships in and out of the ports in a mini-game.You only carry containers and the ships and unit of measure are the ones used in the real world.  The port mini-game become old real quickly and paradoxically is harder to steer a small ship then a gigantic New Panamax.The management part is easy to master and can also become repetitive over time, but there is some gambling involved that could keep that interesting. The campaign last for about 15 hours, and the final part is a bit of a grind.I'm not sure that the game is worth is full price and i got my copy in a bundle so I'm more then satisfied.			"

												Short review: I loved Ports of Call - and i played this for 7 hours straight.Long review: Nice modernised version of PoC. Not one single hickup in 7 hours, thats nice coding. And i have not visited the forums for any help whatsoever - the game is quite intuitive and you pick things up fast.At first i thought ""Hey, its only a map of Europe"", but after you visit each port in the Free game mode, the entire world unlocks. Like with Ports of call, there aren't enough things to buy for your money. The game designers have gone with the ""Euro Truck Simulator 2"" moneysink - Buildings in each town that do... errm...well, they make you feel good about yourself.Like with PoC you can command your own ships, i have done this a billion times in PoC on the Amiga and on the PC version and skipped that totally. Automatic docking fees may seem a bit high at first, but when you see how much money you make per trip it becomes small change.I really liked the ability to upgrade and somewhat specialise your ships (Cooling unit for chemicals or Anti-shake for electronics), but it would be nice to have some sort of template thing for this so you do not have to upgrade a billion ships every time you buy em. And you can take as much cargo as the ship can hold, which makes going from port to port to pick up additional cargo more essential to maximise your profits, at least early on before you get 20 mil for shipping some antique cargo containers in your Panamax ships.For a PoC clone, some things are missing - there are no icebergs and you do not save sailors for status points, this subracts from the whole ""ship simulation"" feel. The music is well done and the graphics are.. sufficient. Overall, this is a good game, even if you missed out on PoC you may end up playing this ship business simulator for days.			"

												Aside from a small number of issues or crashes, this game turned out to be exactly the game I wanted.  I have played through several 4x titles, although I had not gotten my hands on many company development or trading sims, per se, so I wasn't sure what to anticipate.  I got it as part of a bundle, not daring to hope that it would be worthwhile... but this is a completely developed game.  It is not a 60GB monster with 100 cutscenes and a VR expansion...but it is a fun game!I generally like Steam achievements, as well. 8)Pros:It is pretty; it is not clunky; the UI is quaintly graceful and not difficult to master; the options are usable and useful; the script writing and characters are humorous and likable; and the gameplay itself is enjoyable.  It is cute.  It's a cute game in which I may control thousands upon thousands in tonnage of freight in a variety of ways. 8)There is a glossary, which could be better fleshed out, but it is good to have available.I can see myself 25 years ago getting through my homework early each day so that I might play this as a reward.Cons:I've discovered at least one crash which seems to occur with some consistency, and it takes place when, steering in a harbor, I crash one of my ships too hard into something, reducing its overall condition by 7% or more.The only other thing that has stood out at all to me as a negative is the fact that once I have bought a ship, although it is easy for me to understand what category it fits into, I have not found a way to see again what *type* of ship it is.  (When I am buying the ship I can see this information, but if decide that I really do or do not want to buy another ship of that model, then I must rely on my memory alone in order to purchase or avoid that given model of ship.)If you are looking for a game in which decisions count for a lot, and in which you can enjoy a great deal of freedom to decide how you want to play it, then this might be a very good game for you.  As a company simulator, it has pleased me and I will continue to play.  TransOcean: TSC is...hobby-like.  I have put about 25 hours into the game and I have not yet touched the playmode which is not the campaign (""Challenge Mode,"" I think), yet I shall recommend it.  I was excited to see today that half a year ago a sequel was released.  Cool!			"

												I wanted to love it, but it just didn't quite work.It's a nice little game, but only a brief diversion with little replayability.  Its general mechanic of buying ships and sending them out, optimizing routes, cargoes, and fuel use to make a profit, is fun.  But it has some flaws that kill the experience.Every time you dock, you have a choice - pay a high tug fee, or dock manually. The docking mini-game is a waste of 2-3 minutes, with terrible frame rate for its looks, and people who want to play the shipping strategy don't want to play ship simulator every 30 seconds. So you generally just eat the tug costs once you can afford them.Customizing ships for certain cargoes - refrigeration for food and medicine, for instance - means almost nothing. There's no penalty for not doing it except if you get caught by customs, and that's a super rare event.There's little difficulty.  It's very, very hard, if not impossible, to lose at the game. I never even had to take out loans and contracts were super easy to complete.There's little replayability.  Once you unlock the largest ships, all you're doing is running the same routes over and over, just watching your account balance spiraling into the multiple billions.  There's nothing to achieve, and it quickly gets boring.This could be a fun game with a little more depth, a little more difficulty, and either no mini-game, or more and better ones - sort of a Sid Meier's Pirates! with cargo vessels.  As it is... it's not terrible, just a little lacklustre.			"

If you just want to play it as a econ sim then you can skip it for a very small fee- Reputation system is a useless addition- Can be grindyConclusion (tl;dr)A truely excellent economic simulation game, may be boring to those not interested in simulation games (if you found rct and the older simcities compelling, you will like this game)8.5/10			"

And as well, if anyone likes to know, I love the realism and stuff, plus the ships getting unlocked with ranks. That docking manually is very realistic, so realistic, in fact, that I have trouble without thrusters at ports with a single wharf designed as such that you have to slide your ship in. And those ships that can get in the way, my goodness, that is something! As well, why not make an update with new ship models? I mean, not the current ones, but new ships that can fill in big gaps between 1,000s of twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs? And, why not make something new to add, like the day-night cycle, where 1 half of the globe is in night, and the other is in daylight? Also, why not make a new series of video games: TransAir: The Air Shipping Co.?			"

												I've only played about 10 hours, but so far I like this game.  Just a few things for TO2 or if they are still fixing this game:Zooming in on the Contract List menu map would be helpful.Leave the zoom level where I set it on every map.The world map scrolls with the mouse wheel when the Fuel Price list is open, it gets really annoying.It would be cool to be able to see the status of repair for ships in the List of Ships menu, maybe with a mouseover.Have the cities highlight on the World Map when you mouse over their names in the Fuel List.Other than that, I plan to keep playing.  Thanks for a fun game!			"

												First Impressions:I was initially worried that this game would take a while to figure out, but I was pleased to discover the contrary in that this game is extremely easy to learn and play.  Within minutes I was on my way, accepting contracts and traveling to ports to cash them in.  This cycle, along with manually docking can get repetitive, but it's also very calming and stress-free (for right now, anyway).  I can't speak for the mid/late game as I'm not there yet.  Overall, I'm enjoying my experience and am looking forward to getting back to it to see what new ports and ships I can unlock.

												I'm not the type who post reviews but I felt the urge to do so because I had better expectations for this game. TransOcean is becoming quite old after a couple of hours. Don't get me wrong, I am the type of gamer that can grind for hours on end, but there are so few gameplay elements within this game that it started to feel quite boring after a while. Still, this does not explain my urge to post a review for this, so why then? Because there are couple of things that, in my opinion, they should have been a must!The first and the most important missing feature is that you cannot order a custom ship. You are only able to buy pre-defined ships from the shipyard. I truly believe that it wouldn't have take that much developing time to add a couple of new menu pages + the code behind them and the result it would have definitely improve the strategy factor for the gameplay. Also the only ""type"" of ship is container one. Where are the oil tankers or the passenger ships? I mean, even the ore is transported in container ships? From my knowledge it is not the case. And the last major thing that bugs me is the fact that you can only take transport contracts. No possibility to purchase something that the port produces and sell it somewhere else, just transport contracts.Other nice feature addition, would have been to have ships or cargo insurance, and having some kind of simulated stock exchange. Also, some AI competition during the campaign would have been nice.About the game, decent graphics, and the ports have their own identity and you can zoom out to see the landmarks in the port, which is cool. Still, you will ""park"" your boat during the first transport missions as you really are low on cash, but after a while you will find yourself just using the auto-doc regardless of the costs, as you will have more than enough money to afford the cost. I also encountered some bugs, even though I did not made any effort in looking for them. One would be that while manually docking in England's port (can't remember the name now), the FPS drops quite badly if there is any ship in the port. Also it seems that there are some broken mechanics in the company contracts, after loading a save, you will get contracts that are 20+ mil in rewards, but after half an hour of gameplay, even bigger contracts rarely have rewards that pass the 6 mil barrier.All in all, I completed the campaign, I doubt I'll try the free play in the near feature, considering that I experienced a better similar game, this title will probably get lost in my library. If by any chance any developer will read this, please take an hour or so and play a 1997 game called Ocean Trader. It is a DOS game, and you will then probably understand why I cannot recommend this title.			"

												I put in a couple of hours into it. I like the concept, but after you get the best ship, there's no point to go on (unless you're just into making fake millions). I got it on sale so it was worth the price for a couple hours of fun. It's a well made game, but it has no lasting value. I would hit the ""neutral"" button if there was one in Steam review. TO 2 will come out soon so I'll look forward to it.			"

												Although it's, off the bat, a really great game- minimal bugs, solid gameplay and stringent factors which vary the gameplay, it's not my cup of tea- As much as I'd love to get right into it, ship products all around the globe, captain and maneuver vessels whilst at the same time managing my company... the gameplay becomes repetitive and tedious. Don't get me wrong, the concept is awesome, the game is great (complete, minimal bugs, finished project e.t.c)- however it's just due to the repetitiveness- after playing just over 30mins, I kinda got borded of it. Needless to say, I'm definitely going to have a look into Transocean 2- a more refined and in-depth version of the game, due for release in 2016. Needless to say, the game is good, there are many aspects to it and are sure to keep the right person entertained. However, I just feel it's not for me- it's too repetitive and tedious for my liking.			"

												Ok.  So my advice to the developers... figure out what kind of game you are making.  Also, if you are going to try to mix two genres (which I'm a fan of) make them compatible!    I really looked forward to this game and the strategy of shipping, managing economics, etc.   Thats there.   However, you MUST dock and undock at every port you get to.   You spend a huge majority of your time playing a glorified flappy bird.   Do you really think the people who want to play a strategic global ecomonic simulator want to flap wings off their cargo ships at every port?Who was the target audience?   40 year old fathers with their 9 year old kid on their lap taking turns controlling the game?   Or someone with multiple personality disorder?Meh.   Looked great.   It sucked.			"

												A great little tycoon style game.TransOcean is not a simulator; it doesn't go into much detail. The game basically just consists of loading crates on your ships and sending them from A to B. There is also a ""minigame"" where you can sail your own ships as they dock or leave the port.The sailing minigame will not keep you entertained for hours, but it is fun to play now and again when you buy a new ship, and it will save you some in-game money when you play it, as well as grant you some achievements.There are 5 classes of ships, all of which can have various upgrades installed, like better engines, water canons to fight back pirate attacks, or a license which allows you to transport juicy nuclear waste.The rest of the game just consists of carefully choosing contracts of what merchandise to transport where, and it's up to you to find the route planning that will be the most lucrative. You can also transport drugs or contraband for extra cash, but risk losing all if inspected by coast guards.There are also company contracts, which grant you substantial bonuses if you guarantee you will transport X amount of merchandise on a designated route in X amount of months. Fail to fulfil it and you will have to pay a big penalty.One of the most fun I have found in this game is deliberately accepting a ludicrous amount of company contracts and then having fun struggling to complete everything in time!In addition, as you level up, your antipathetic investor will throw some ridiculous contracts at you that you cannot refuse. These moments are the big highlights of the campaign.Once you have fully leveled up, there is not much end-game, so TransOcean won't keep you entertained for ever, but all in all the campaign has a good 25 hours in it.Technically it's well built, the interface is designed okay and I encountered very few bugs. The game comes with a set of elevator music tracks which I recommend you switch off from the beginnnig; then it just plays relaxing seaside soundsDefinitely one of the best tycoon style games out there.

												Anyone who played old Amiga classic Ports of Call and enjoyed it should consider this game. Ports of Call was great to be played with friends when I was 14, but looking back I find the game quite shallow. Game lost its appeal because simple economy model made buying and selling ships actually best way to make money. TransOcean is much better game - inspired by PoC, but doing everything better. I hope that future version of TransOcean will borrow inspiration not only by PoC, but also Der Reeder - this was another Amiga shipping game, with more depth in it. Anyway, I do recommend TransOcean - enjoyable, and there are no many shipping games on market.			"

												Well ... Yeah ... Ports of Call ... after so many years ... finally! (2h later) What a disappointment. The docking / departing mini games are fun ... the first and maybe the second time in each harbor. However tug fees are so low there is no point in doing it yourself. Just call a tug because even the smallest damage to your ship is far more expensive than the tug.Beside that there is basically nothing to do in this game. Just pick the the most lucrative cargo from the list and that's it. Upgrade your ship so it is legal to transport weapons, etc. and you don't have any trouble at all. After that it is micro management everywhere.The ""story"" in the campaign is ""told"" by pictures and text - no cutscenes or voiceplay anywhere.			"

												The business aspect of the game are superficial at best - There's no competition, no global fluctuations in the market, and all you can do is carry project cargo with container ships. Seriously, you can't establish liners services or anything; you're picking up one or two cargoes at best and essentially tramping. It's really not very complex, and the campaign is just a grind. The price of tug service doesn't make sense (It's about 50 to 1000 more than they cost in real life, seriously), and neither do the ship improvements - I have to stop a ship for two days to get a license to carry dangerous goods? Not only is firefighting gear an option, it's only available on the largest ships?If you're looking for a remotely realistic simulation of the shipping business, give it a pass.The ship simulation aspect is similarly basic... No transverse thrust on the propeller, only the larger ships have bow and stern thrusters, there's no wind or current and the ships don't have inertia. Seriously, the best way to make a dock perpendicular to the direction you started with is to speed up, then turn at the last minute and slide sideways into it, Dukes of Hazard style. Give it a pass, and be very careful when considering the new version.			"

												I didn't expect much from this game when I first started then I started getting into it and next thing I know I was just getting started as parts of the game started to unlock. At first the game doesnt seem like it has much to offer but then it slowly gets more and more complex which is really nice all while you are being forced to save money to progress without going bankrupt.One thing that I was really surprised about is when I started the game I half expected a overview management company of a huge fleet of ships that you just control on a map but you can directly control one ship and bring it into and out of port manually or auto if you dont want to spend the time doing it. The only real complaint I had about the game was the boats steering and while I understand it's trying to be realistic I felt like it had way to much drift.That being said I don't drive massive boats for a living so what do I know maybe thats how they really handle just took a bit of a learning curve after that I just got better and faster at docking and right about the time I started to get tired of doing it I was making enough money to just auto dock which was a really nice. The game seems really balanced and it doesnt force your hand in progression so you can progress at the speed you want. This means you can save up loads of money before you move on which is what I did the only real worry I have about the game is when you start getting massive amounts of ships under your control I can see it becoming VERY hard to control everything.While the did think this out so when you directly select a ship it gives you only that ships information the issue is you can set it to think for itself in a matter of speaking so every time a ship leaves or comes into a dock it will freeze your game and force you to deal with it. While that doesnt seem like a huge deal if you have twenty or thirty ships that are all bouncing around you will be dealing with ships docking every few seconds so 10 minutes of gameplay could result in only 10 or 15 seconds of ingame time because of all the pausing.Even with all that being said I think the game is totally worth playing even more so if you can pick it up on sale for cheap. Great time killer and easy to figure out once you get going.			"

												At the time of this review I've logged just over 20 hours in this game. At its current selling price that works out to about a dollar per hour of entertainment - pretty low cost entertainment if you ask me. The biggest downside to this game in my opinion: I can't image I'll ever need to replay the campaign. There simply isn't enough variation to make me want to do it all over again. Still, 7/10 in my book.			"

												Unless you want something really really really easy to play, this isn't the game for you. It's very easy and I don't know why people are complaining about it been hard to dock the ships. I'm already bored after 45 minutes as the money is coming in far to easily and quickly, the developer will need to make this a bit more of a challenge to keep me entertained. If this was combined with Ship Simulator then it would make for an interesting game where you can actually do something other than click half a dozen times and be finished with a mission.			"

												If someone is willing to spend several hours, or days, working through the various levels of achievement this game has--then see it all taken away in the space of 10 to 15 seconds--and for no apparent reason--this is the game for you!  Otherwise, STAY AWAY!This game is divided into difficulties of play:  ""easy,"" ""normal,"" ""hard,"" etc.  When playing above the ""easy"" level this game can be very frustrating to play.  The experience is similiar to one playing a ""rigged"" game in the very few casinos that have them.  This game has three main characters:  the ""investor;"" the ""assistant,"" and the ""old captain.""  The assistant is, basically, a tutorial device.  The information the ""assistant"" provides is useful.  The ""old captain"" will tell you if you did something wrong in docking at a port or sailing out of one.  The ""old captain"" also provides advice on how to maintain your ships.  The ""investor"" is a very sneeky and greedy individual.  The contract you are forced to sign with her (if playing in ""normal"" status or above) is so unfair that, in real life, an American court would probably rule such a contract to be void.  Without warning this ""investor"" is allowed to demand that you ship a list of goods to a port she has selected.  If you are unable to comply with this demand this ""investor"" can throw you out of the game.  Sometimes, however, this investor will let you off with a warning.The ""normal,"" and higher, categories of this game are sub-divided into various titles--""Consignor,"" ""Ship Boss,"" etc.  The player reaches these titles after completing certain tasks.  These tasks can take up to 3 to 4 hours of playing time for each title.  The BIGGEST problem with this game is the secrecy and lack of information the developers have, either, intentionally built into the game, or, the developers have no desire to make corrections to make the game rules clearer and fairer to the player.  You can be kicked-out of this game for no apparent reason.  The worse part is this game is, obviously, designed to kick you out only after several hours of play.  You may have progressed (as I did) to the third title; have 8 to 10 ships; and have a balance of 130 million Euros.  Then, for no understandable reason, the calendar starts spinning wildly (and NOT responding to the ""pause game"" or ""slow down"" keys) and your balance, likewise, starts wildly dropping.  After about 10 to 15 seconds you get a message that your company is bankrupt--thus, you've been thrown out of the game.  Of course, you always have the option to start a new game--with no credit or assets from the game you just got thrown out of!			"

												The game had great potential, but the developer failed to execute it. It's sad, cause it is a damn good game. I am not blaming the developer making a new title, but they could have done a lot more to this game. I thought they would have brought more features into this game, like stocks and other fancy stuff,  but boy I was dissapointed. I cannot recommend a game that just abandon a game that fast. Great game - suffers from lack of new content and updates. Really sad.   "

												After 2 hours of game play:I've discovered that manual docking/undock is just♥♥♥♥♥♥ your basically just up against a clock, the fact you cut up 2 other ships to do it doesn't matter! but don't worry you can just use auto-docking!Also it appears you can't lose money unless your really incompetent! and there's no automation when it comes to management of the ships:- No auto re-fuel at each stop (an option to auto re-fuel when price in port is below a set amount would be nice)- You have to choose EVERY SINGLE load, I'm already dreading what that will be like with more than a few ships, surely when you accept a long-term contract you should be able to assign ships to it and leave them go? ultimately I would want to take on multiple long-term contracts and assign some ships to them in a loop so the ships always have loads on them.- It asks you how you want to dock EVERY TIME ANY SHIP ARRIVES AT A PORT!!! seriously? I'm tempted to say they should do away with the manual docking completely and spent the time saved expanding the rest of the 'game'After 4 hours:I can confirm there is absolutely no need to manually dock/undock, there is no gain by doing so, on the starter ships it will cost you 100,000 to auto-dock, which is affordable on all but a couple of jobs.I've discovered that you can lose money, reefs will randomly appear where there wasn't one before (because that happens!!!), they appear to be the only way so far that I can lose money... except of course the investor taking her money at seemly random times.So anyway, I got bored after the first 2 hours, but stuck at it and I can tell you that the game doesn't change, all that happens is you get bigger ships, and bigger distances to move things! I've just brought my second panamax ship, I've not even left the starting area (Europe & med) and I'm bored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I consider the game complete because I feel like I already know exactly what I'm going to be doing for the next few hours till I can buy out the investor which I assume is the end game.Summary:I have been looking forward to this game for ages, but I'm glad I listened to reviews and held off till it was on offer because it is a £5 game, The developers are working on a Transocean 2, which I have high hopes for, time will tell!

												the game was fun the first few hours, after getting a high rank and have a large fleet you will barly go through a week in the game cuz if u get 15 ships you have to dock, get a contract, cast off, and you need to do it to every ship every time, and it gets really annoying docking these ships, wish if there was an option to hire a manager to a number of ships u select and foucus on completing long-term contracts and let the other ships do its thing. I know some people won't agree with me but i like to watch the cash flow.oh and the manual ducking sucks.			"

												Meh... this game kinda sucks. Buy ships, ship stuff.. make money to buy more ships to ship more stuff.  There's a mini game throughout that lets you dock or depart from harbors but it gets super tedious and you'll just dock with tug boats in the end otherwise this game would last forever. You can get contracts which give you a certain amount of money when you finish them, but it's usually a hasle to re-route all your ships to these docks.  Plus sometimes these docks are too small for your ships so onlly your smaller ♥♥♥♥♥ier ships can go which get f'ing annoying and take forever. Then there are the big contracts whenever you rank up, you'll get 2 or 3 and you can fail them and it doesn't matter. Then on the 3rd or 4th you'll get a mandatory one.  If you don't fulfill that one it's game over which I was getting bored with this game and I didn't read this fact.  So game over... I don't understand this mechanic... It should of been quite clear with a secondary warning if this kind of thing is implemented. I won't be going back to this game, nor will I be recommending it to anyone.  It's really basic, The mini game of docking is not fun and is very repetitive.   I got 15 hrs out of it... good enough I guess but I was expecting more depth to this game.  "

I am struggling to remember much from this game as after I beat it I uninstalled it and waited a few months hoping for some sort of patch or anything to add content.  I was thinking that this can't be all there is to the game but apparently that is all there is.  There are no competing companies, the top of the line ""end game"" ships are actually in many cases worse than the ships a tier lower.  There's no reason really at all to build additional headquarters at other locations.  The minigames are extremely annoying and while skippable (provided you pay in game money) later on during a game mission you are required to perform them 5 times in a set time period.  This game couldve been a lot better but at it's rather large price tag for what it is now it simply is not worth the money.			"

												ClickMenu: The Repetitive CompanyI really tried to like this game.I mean, I really did. The game seems to be inspired on the original Airline Tycoon - at least the ship / cargo parts - but it sadly can't be enjoyed. After the first few minutes the game shows how it really is: a boring, repetitive task of 1) refull / repair 2) accept contract 3) select contract 4) sail. And you repeat this a lot. And I mean, A LOT.For every time your ship gets into a port, there is this repetitive, mindless, 15 clicks you will have to do, with no challenge, no fun or changes. You can't make fix routes, or define ships by cargo or anything basically. You are struck with those 15 clicks for everytime your boat arrives at a destination.And what is even more dissappointing besides the fact you can't ""automatize"" anything to make the game more enjoyable is that, the game actually becomes even worse the better yoiu get at it. Because the more ships you have the more time you will be clicking 15 times for each boat. Taking ages just to even a month gets by because of the amount of times you have to repeat that task that can't be dealt with any other way.Sadly, even though the idea is interesting, and that mini-game added of manually taking your ship to and off the port - which then it's impossible, since, for example, I automated that process over 800 times in my few hours, I can't even think of doing it manually - the game feels like a chor.Unless you are really, and I mean REALLY into the idea of having a fleet of trading ships, I would skip this game. Even then, I would still reconsider getting it if you see some gameplay of it since you will notice the issue of the ""repetititve 15 clicks"" I'm talking about.Ps.: Just look for another Tycoon game instead.

												""Great game"", it's that simple. You start your adventure with a feeder, and every minutes you are planning in your mind which trade route to choose and where to stem your bunker with most economical price. Now you are getting more and more money, and expanding your fleet with regional traders, and eventually going up to those beatiful ladies - PPMX, NPMX and Ultra-Large Container Vessel. Oh! Now you are ready for a round-the-world service. Further to ocean trading, you can always berth / unberth the vessel on your own, and I would say this is the most interesting element of this game. The difficulties...well, I guess it's hard to name your ships. With the fleet getting ever larger, I decide to simply pick a real world Liner Operator and name all my ships as per their's. As I said, it's a great game. But there are always ways to further enhance the gaming experience:-1. Canal passage. It would be great if I have to pay my canal due for passage,  sail my ship through the Suez, or may be have to anchor my ship off Cristobal a day or two due to canal congestion.2. Larger scale of map when docking/undocking my ship. It's quite often I find it difficult to expect where will I berth my lady until I see it. And if possible, it would be great to have a ""longer"" sailing option before berthing/after unberthing.3. Some more ""small contracts"" - I find it hard to believe I am shipping some thousands TEU of Radioactive Materials to Hong Kong, or loads of weapons ex. US/Canada to Cuba...4. More realistic color of the Equipments (i.e. containers) - The Equipments are just too sharp and colorful.5. Players can draw the company logo in-game, and decide where to put the Operator's Color on the ship's hull.6. More real world events - e.g.: Pay for ice-breaker when approaching Gulf of St. Lawrence, stowaways sneaked onboard at West/South African countries, economic changes that affect the global bunker price SERIOUSLY...etc.The trading mode is realistic only if the game is for General Cargo Carriers. For Container vessels, it appears more ""real world"" if we are to plan and maintain service routes across the globe...well may be it's just me thinking of this only.If you like ships, go for it. If you like trading game, go for it. If you want to sail a vessel, go for it. There's no much choice where you can sail vessels from a 480TEU feeder to a ULCV with bow/stern thrusters.			"

												Pretty craptastic.Not many ships to choose from. No real customization.Gameplay consists of navigating your ship in and out of port. Once you're out of the port, it is automated until you get to the next port. Then you get to navigate out of port again. Whee.You get to select a contract to take, but it really isn't very involved at all. Will it fit on your ship, and can you make it to the port in time? If so, take it. Otherwise, don't.That's the game. Wish there was more to tell you.			"

												I recommend this game if you like boats, economic sims and need a time sink. However, there are some caveats to the recipe, the biggest one being that Deck13 seems to have wanted to do something extraordinary here, but after the release, realized that the current platform and tech cannot allow that. So they went back to the drawing board and stopped working on TO1, in order to bring out TO2 (ETA 2016) from scratch.This is all fine, though, as the current version is *very* playable and addictive, and if you snatch it at 50% discount, like I did, it's worth every penny. But bear in mind that for this version, there will potentially be no other content update and no bugfixing (there are a few tiny bugs which are slightly annoying).			"

												Awfull mess.Unoptimized, get oftes stuck in fast forward and not pausing even for events!Economy is rubberbanded so hard you will feel no pleasure from it...Whats more think rubberbanding will make game choke when you put more than one ship in same port and game tries to generate contracts that are ""suited"" for each shipIf you have pc stolen from nasa and dont mind this game not being economy game at all give it a try, Otherwise avoid...

												""Great game"", it's that simple. You start your adventure with a feeder, and every minutes you are planning in your mind which trade route to choose and where to stem your bunker with most economical price. Now you are getting more and more money, and expanding your fleet with regional traders, and eventually going up to those beatiful ladies - PPMX, NPMX and Ultra-Large Container Vessel. Oh! Now you are ready for a round-the-world service. Further to ocean trading, you can always berth / unberth the vessel on your own, and I would say this is the most interesting element of this game. The difficulties...well, I guess it's hard to name your ships. With the fleet getting ever larger, I decide to simply pick a real world Liner Operator and name all my ships as per their's. As I said, it's a great game. But there are always ways to further enhance the gaming experience:-1. Canal passage. It would be great if I have to pay my canal due for passage,  sail my ship through the Suez, or may be have to anchor my ship off Cristobal a day or two due to canal congestion.2. Larger scale of map when docking/undocking my ship. It's quite often I find it difficult to expect where will I berth my lady until I see it. And if possible, it would be great to have a ""longer"" sailing option before berthing/after unberthing.3. Some more ""small contracts"" - I find it hard to believe I am shipping some thousands TEU of Radioactive Materials to Hong Kong, or loads of weapons ex. US/Canada to Cuba...4. More realistic color of the Equipments (i.e. containers) - The Equipments are just too sharp and colorful.5. Players can draw the company logo in-game, and decide where to put the Operator's Color on the ship's hull.6. More real world events - e.g.: Pay for ice-breaker when approaching Gulf of St. Lawrence, stowaways sneaked onboard at West/South African countries, economic changes that affect the global bunker price SERIOUSLY...etc.The trading mode is realistic only if the game is for General Cargo Carriers. For Container vessels, it appears more ""real world"" if we are to plan and maintain service routes across the globe...well may be it's just me thinking of this only.If you like ships, go for it. If you like trading game, go for it. If you want to sail a vessel, go for it. There's no much choice where you can sail vessels from a 480TEU feeder to a ULCV with bow/stern thrusters.			"

												I was introdused to the game by squirrel.I love the game, but it is unfortunately not the type of game for me.I will recommend this game for anyone interested in these kinds of games.Somethings i would have liked to see in the future is to add more mini games, preferably in the wildcards. Maneuvering thru a storm, or rescue passengers for reduced times or a small benefit for the player.			"

												Pretty craptastic.Not many ships to choose from. No real customization.Gameplay consists of navigating your ship in and out of port. Once you're out of the port, it is automated until you get to the next port. Then you get to navigate out of port again. Whee.You get to select a contract to take, but it really isn't very involved at all. Will it fit on your ship, and can you make it to the port in time? If so, take it. Otherwise, don't.That's the game. Wish there was more to tell you.			"

												I must be missing something because I found the game required way too much hands on time.  Needs the option to hire someone to handle all contracts for each ship, someone to handle company contracts, and you get the idea.  Should be allowed to set that tugs will handle all ships at all ports and all ships go to port.  Those screens get to be a real pain after about two turns.  I admire the effort but if you're going to create a game, there' so much you could do with running a shipping company.  This shoud have an age 6 limit since anyone older will quit after no more then 10 turns.  If you build a good game (think railroad tycoon), people will buy it but I won't waste any money on '2' because I already wasted it on '1'.			"

												Decent game but not sure as to what age group this game is aimed at. It is educational in terms of geograhical content and mathamatical content, ie working out how much cargo can be carried vs distance and speed restrictions but it also has some childish elements, ie fogging effects of ports and other ships trying to  race your ship or trying to block your ship from docking, also ships do not seem to do realistic speeds or have realistic stopping distances. It would be more appropriate to do away with the childish elements and make this into a good game by adding elements such as wind and tide effects when docking, weather conditions (calm, windy or rainy), night time docking conditions and proper shipping lanes with rules, ie speed limits, also  more realistic loading and unloading times along with a greater number of ports and types of ships which would enhance the game.

												Was a fun game I guess but NOT worth the $30 price. What you are paying for here is worth half that, I would say $10.Well, let's just say Euro Truck Simulator did the act of transporting (driving/shipping) right and this game did it wrong. It absolutely sucks. Imagine there is a pencil resting on some ice and you have to move it to another chosen destination by blowing on it. Yeah, it's that awful/painful. Thankfully you can choose to dock/undock your ship automatically for a small, mostly irrelevent fee (later in to the game at least). You are required to dock 10 total times to upgrade your status later in to the game which is really painful to do though.Although I will say the merchanting part of the game was really fun. Pretty simple; go to port, pick up most expensive contract, ship to somewhere else, and watch your net worth grow. You begin to get faster ships with more cargo space that can travel further on the map and as you upgrade your rank, soon enough you have a fleet of ships making money for you.Again, would not recommend for the $30 price tag.

												Port of Call players rejoice as a modern version of your game have come out, Definatly much easier to play than POC as well. The basis of this game is simple, run a shipping company profitably and level up in a style very simliar to that of Patrician IV as in you need to fill certain prerequisties such as x amount of money, ships, locations visted, offices etc.The game is good fun and has a casual gaming feel to it and as such not too serious. The biggest downside I can say about this game though is it dosent have multiplayer ability which is something POC did have and was great as you could compete with other players then to reach certain goals.Overall its good fun :D, So give it a shot.

												I like Tycoon games a lot, they're my single favourite genre, so when I saw a game allowing me to be a shipping magnate I was pretty interested. Reviews were mixed but it was on sale for only a few pounds so I took a gamble.To keep this short, the game is relatively fun but quickly becomes repetitive and my patience has worn thin long before completing a single play through of the campaign mode. You start the game, buy a ship at your home port and select one of the available contracts to ship goods across the globe. You watch a little graphic of your ship go from port to port and when you dock at the other end you earn your money (or not as the case may be), sound fun? Well I hope so because you're going to do that thousands and thousands of times. You buy more ships and bigger ships and upgrade ships to carry different cargo but it all boils down to selecting contracts, sending your ship to sea and watching the moeny roll in.I've sunk enough hours in to this that I've got my moneys worth (less than a pound per hours gameplay at time of writing) and whilst I certainly don't feel ripped off I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but the most die hard management/tycoon fan.Overall not bad but not interesting either.

												TransOcean is a game that is out for a very select type of people. It is not going to be fun for everyone because the gameplay is very limited. Control of the ships themselves is actually considered to be a minigame and for a small price can be bypassed. At first bypassing is too expensive, but your larger ships can afford the cost.  After the minigame all there is to do is to take out loans, and manage contracts for a fleet of ships that you can somewhat custimize. I also experienced a bug which prevents me from naming new ships. Even after all of my problems the game was beautiful. After a hard day of trucking I relaxed to a easy game that was one of the most beautiful looking games that is not from a AAA company. I wished there were more features, more ship types, more ports from the world, more of everything. But for now I can play this game, but this game will not be for those who are looking for a challenge or a shipping update from older games close to this genre. TransOcean is what it is, a simple beautiful game with limited options. I love how it relaxes me, you may not like it.Also the online portion of it is just you in sandbox mode and prices go up and down online. It actually makes it easier has some prices skyrocket up.

												I don't normally post  reviews, but I felt this title worth a mention.  There have been a lot of half-hearted continental simulations released recently and this definately doesn't fall in to that category!Ok, graphically, the ""driving sim"" aspect of this title could be better... It's a little 2D feeling and has a tendancy to stutter when you go for maximum speed, but it's passable most of the time.Having said that, this is, in my option, a solid micro-management sim.  You have good control over the day-to-day running of your shipping company, but can also comfortably out-source many of the more mundane tasks (albeit at a sigificant cost).Personally, I'm ok with that... I think it should be a significant expense in the early days to outsource any substantial portion of your management role in these kind of titles.After 6 and a half hours (or so) of play I can tell you the following:POSITIVES:* Storyline is ok, driven by solid tutorials... They are progressive and detailed enough to point you in the right direction without being condecending.* Graphics are better than anything else I have come across in this specific genre.* Controls are pretty instictive and as expected - camera controlled from mouse and helful auto-centering.* Sound - I've seen some negative postings, but, in general, I've been pretty impressed.  Music gets a little repetative in the world view as you spend a lot of time there, but each port is individualised and, overall, it's a pretty calming, uninvasive soundtrack.* Overall gameplay is going to keep genre fans entertained for some time... There's certainly enough variables to grab attention, but cost and development route are inevitable and welcome challenges!NEGATIVES:* It seemed to take an excessive amount of time to pass the first few story objectives. I imagine this is because this is many designed to be a ""sandbox"" title, but I'm hoping greater structure will be added in time.* On the subject of additions, the are many noteworthy european shipping ports which are currently missing... Let's hope this is remedied in any future updates!!!All in all, a worthwhile spend... Enjoy!!!!!!			"

												Ports of Call was released in 1987, almost 30 years ago. This game is a copycat of it. It is way worse than the original. Big problem: No multiplayer on the same computer. So you cannot play together with your friends. On the other hand,this might not be so big of a problem, as this game is extremely monotone and gets hectic, but not fun, when your fleet exceeds a handful of ships. So who would play it for longer sessions anyways.I would definitely stay away and get the old game, if you like such games.			"

Plays well i found it easy to understand and to get started i now own two low class ships in the short time i had played it . worth the money even if its only a single player game driving the ships into and out of the ports is not that hard at all . I can understand why you cant sail all the way with them as it would limit the amount of ships you would be able to own im no superman and i cant sail 5 ships at the same time ..  would like to see this as a multiplayer for that reason as you would only see other people as you leave and or pull into a port ( voice system would be needed though as two people pulling out at the same time could get a bit of a bang crash thing going ) . fuel and damage is easy to manage and dosnt cost the earth ( top points for that well done  as most games thats a killer ) all in all this is the only game that i have felt like giving a review on and i have about 60 odd games in my list so far more in my wishlist ..... i know i have only played the game for what i call a short time but i would still give it a 10/10 in my books for what the game is i just couldnt stop ...so if you like you sim/tycoon sort of games this is a top buy ,,,,			"

												Much like the good old ""Ports of Call"" though it seems a bit easier to make profit. Nice and fine docking and undocking procedures - speed of the ships is not very realistic. Hey, we are talking about a few 100,000 tons, not about a formula one car. User Interface is decent but not brilliant (several things are more complicated than they would need to be, and I have not yet seen special task ships), there is room for improvement with a patch. I'd love an early start option somewhere in the 50ies or 60ies, but up to now you can only start in 2014. There are no other players unless in the so called online game which is a bad joke. It's nothing but the usual game with some notifications thrown in regarding that all the others send their ships to X oder Y - so please expect bad freight rates there: For all I know this could be just a programmer hoax. Nevertheless, I loved ""Ports of Call"" and I'm generally not very much into online gaming. And so I like ""TransOcean"", too. Some patches or add-ons may improve the depth, but just so I recommend it to those who were ""Ports of Call"" fans like I was ...			"

												I love a good business sim and I love all things maritime, so this should be perfect for me right? Wrong, You either have to play this annoying mini game every time your dock and leave port or make no money on your contracts. As a result you cant actually seem to make money with paying tugging fees of $400,000 (clearly I need to go into the tug boat business) Waste of money 4/10			"

												This games looks a lot like ""ports of call"" which was really the reason I bought it, from what I have been able to play it really seems like an upgraded version of the old Amiga game, which was exactly what I was looking for.Unfortunately, the game is simply unplayable, it literally crashes every time I attempt a manual docking (which is big part of the fun) and very often will only allow me to dock once in 10 or so restarts.  I've upgraded all drivers, checked memory usage, etc. and no matter what I do (even on minimum settings) the game simply crashes, and crashes, and crashes.  I honestly feel that this game has been released to early and there are  still some major bugs to be sorted out.  For now I simply cannot recommend this since I have had zero money's worth in terms of gameplay.			"

												It is a fun little 'web type' game (you know what I mean, simple), the type of game you play on facebook). It is not really challenging at all. It has no real depth to it at all. Gameplay is very simplistic, same with steering the ships. Is it worth to buy it? well if you have a spare $20. But not for the full price.I only purchased this yesterday and am already bored with it.*Pros*Fun simple gameShips, I like ships.Easy to learn.*Cons*Very simple game, no real business or tycoon element to it.Buy a ship, click to accept a contract, click to leave port, either drive ship manually, using up down left right, or click (auto) out of the port. (That is it). No more game to it, rinse and repeat 100 times.This is TransOcean. "

												Docking Simulator 2014.The mechanics are sketchy and the premise is a little thin. Apart from looking at the screen with all your little boats automatically sailing themselves, you only actually get to control the ships at docking or casting off, which is about 5 minutes at most.For those with infinite patience and little taste in GAMING, this game is good. It's more of a simulator than an actual game. A boring one.For those with a desire to be thrilled....? Dont get it.			"

												I'm a little suprised at how much I like this game. If you like Tycoon games - especially the Railroad Tycoon series, or any of the Space Trader kinds of games - you'll probably like this. It does get a little hectic with the more ships you own, and the UI could be a bit more user friendly, but overall I'm really happy with the value - especially on sale. You only really control your ship going into and out of port (and you've got the option to use a tug instead, which makes life a little easier when you're not always struggling for cash). The rest of the time you're picking ports and speeds, allowing you to be economical or speedy as needed. You've got more ships to select from than I expected, and they've all got their little quirks. If you like games about systems and appreciate learning about the actual trade part of international trade, give this game a shot. Even at full price I'd recommend it.			"

												**Contains game details to make points, so beware spoilers.**Game was interesting and had a lot of good bits, but was too shallow overall. There's no real company progress, just meet a few requirements and you unlock the next bigger ship; rinse and repeat. They did a job creating an investor that you'll grow a seething hatred for as she continues to leech your funds ever quarter whilst creating contracts that you can't complete without breaking the law [get product X from city Y; this city only allows the tiniest ships to dock at it, and you need an upgrade to lawfully carry product X - an upgrade that the tiniest ship cannot get]. The end game requires building up a very large amount of spare cash to free yourself from the investor; the amount is 2x the company's late-game value, so if you're punished if you like to have some spare cash on hand. Building a large fleet - which is required to buy out the company - generates a ton of busywork, as there's no sort of automation available. I really enjoy sim-management games, but this one punishes you unless you grind towards great profits; mainly, trying to keep your head above water as Ms. BS gouges you for 10% of your value every quarter [her name is Ms. Blythe-Smith, but maybe the initials were chosen intentionally]. I think I would have enjoyed TransOcean much more if it focused on managing the company rather than managing the minutia.The ability to manually dock and cast off is fun, but it gets tedious considering how many shipping runs you must make; I think if you did every maneuver manually it'd about triple the amount of time played, and eventually feels a bit like busy work [the game forces you to do some maneuvers later game in order to progress, which may help some discover this bit they've been missing out on, but it also feels forced for those that want to focus on the management aspect].It looks like a TO2 is in progress, and I'll probably check it out based on how it looks and the price. TO isn't a bad game, and I was on the fence about giving a 'No' recommendation. I'd probably give it a 7/10 overall - there are just many better games in genre to spend time on, especially ones that have better replay value.			"

												I bought it in a holiday offer for almost nothing and it represents fairlly well the world of shipping companies etc since it's a management and simulation game. It had a real potential if the devs had enhanced it with more things and decisions made from the player. After the first 10-15 hours the game looses it's momentum and becomes a little boring .... (For example it could had the feature of making negotiations and  bargain yrself with the ports and harbormasters for the fee in every port, with the shipping yards for the new boats you wanna build depending on the tonnage etc , with the people that you have hired in each ship -captains and mechanics that provide the advantage of exp or not, or the gunmen to protect the ship from pirates etc, the contracts should be in some kind of reminder from each ship or captain seperatelly, it could had a lot more ports, and a lot more commoditites to carry, and to go to more hardcore reality, even to have the choise of smuggling guns to nations between war, drugs , fuels, and all the other beatiful and wonderfull things that dailly happens in the real world).Those were the things THAT IT DOESNT have !!! It is playable as it is but has 2-3  major bugs (If a port has more than one ship of yours in , it is really complicating to handle as laggy and buggy, and sometimes ( correction many times) the forward daytime STUCKS and results in a disastrous moment to pass 20-25 days. You see that all your ships are waiting to get in ports. the penalties for not on time delivery are running and you see that you are loosing some hundrends of millions of your money by NOT your mistake and most of all the ingame menu is very buggy - you have to push the buttons with the mouse 2-3 times to start the action you were supposed to do and its kinda lame for a game that has no graphics needs). So to sum up, in general go for it, it's ''pretty'' good, not gonna tear your head or you gonna remember it in 2-3 years but desent....Oh and it had a lot of potential !!!			"

												I will recomend the game just because it isnt bad, limited but not bad. In either free mode or campaign you have a stupid investor (wish you had more choices) that gives you some cash and you buy a boat and start hauling. Basic enough. Of course there are ranks and whatnot but what i dont like is they force you to keep buying ships to ""level up"" but it isnt really needed imo. My first open run i have done the bare min to advance all the while steady shipping and have $700mil in 2hrs or so and thats still with 2 ranks of ships to aquire. Too easy.As far as the ton of ships there isnt any automation so you have to load.dock.undock.etc every time a ships ready. Thats a pain with a fleet of 6 much less 60..? I remember like 2005 there was a big rig sim that would auto your extra trucks for passive income. 2005.. We going backwards??? Its mindless fun every once inawhile, but games like this need imersion, i wanna by the port, bribe customs, etc.			"

												When I first read about TransOcean Shipping, I added it to my wishlist and followed it closely for several months. The mixed reviews made me skeptical about buying it, but as I'd been starved for a good business simulation, decided to take the gamble - and I'm pleased I did!In the game you play the founder of a shipping company, whom takes on an investor to fund his company. Starting off with one small 'Feeder' ship, you have to accept contracts and weigh decisions over speed/fuel consumption to ensure that deliveries are made on time. The campaign aspect of the game provides extra challenge, allowing you to unlock larger vessels as you progress in rank and prestige, whilst constantly trying to ensure you have enough money to provide the investor her regular payments.Ships can be docked and cast off manually, which offers you the chance to control your ship if you'd rather avoid paying the tug fees (automatic docking/cast off) in ports. This can provide a nice little break from the 'main map' game screen, which is where you'll spend most of your time. Eventually you'll have a fleet of different sized ships, and will need to juggle factors of tight deadlines, contract penalties and the various ship sizes permitted to dock in certain ports etc. Despite the fact that you spend so much time staring at the map screen, the challenge and reward of juggling everything around is thoroughly entertaining. It's a game that doesn't require too much thought and that you can play casually. I personally found the game addictive, but I appreciate that it won't appeal to everyone - I'm sure many would find the lack of variation a little tiresome/boring. If you're unsure whether you'd enjoy this game, do what I did and check a gameplay video online. There are many to watch, and will give you an accurate idea of how this game plays.			"

												If you liked Port of Call for DOS or Amiga as well as it was back in the day, here is a modern reincarnation.While the 3D view perhaps still has some issues, seeing as you can't move the camera as freely as you like to do, it still breathes life into an old game from the 90s.While it is a ship tycoon game, and not much of a Ship driving simulator (And thank god for that) it is great fun to ""manage"" your company.One difference from Port of Call is that you now have to upgrade your ships to ship certain cargos, or to increase a ship's performance.The bad side of this game is that there are some bugs in the user interface that can make you a little confused.For an example after some time in game, when selecting cargo contracts for your ship, the checkmark to show that you have selected that contract disappears, it is still selected, so if you hit ""Accept contracts"" they will show up for confirmation.Then during the campaign you will also feel like killing your second ""investor"" and here the devs would do the world a great favor by introducing an ""Arrange accident"" button for that ""investor""The investor has a tendency to pass out contracts when you least want it, and forcing you to abandon contracts you are working on and scramble to fullfill the contract or face an ONGOING penalty until fulfilled.Mark my words when I say ONGOING, it means that you lose millions until you get it fulfilled, and this get so frustrating at times, that you really wish you could get rid of the investor, by ANY MEANS NECESSARY.Past this, this game is worth the money it costs IF and only IF you liked Port of Call from the DOS era.If not, I recommend you try the old DOS title first to see if a shipping tycoon game is something for you, and then consider this title.Word of note, this game is now EOL (End Of Life) with no more patches coming, and it still has a few bugs, including one crashing bug, plus one bug that can get you stuck, and forced to either kill the process or get into the options menu to fix it.But the worst bug that can wreck you, it is very possible to get the game stuck in fast forward mode, meaning you will have ships arriving in port, and waiting for your confirmation to unload, but time will still keep passing at a record rate, causing delayed arrivals, and thus steep penalty fees.

												Heavy on pretty looks, feather-light on gameplay.So, Thumbs up for the pretty graphics of the docking-minigame.Everything else can be summarized in a few words:Tedious gameplay, very-very shallow realism, virtually non-existent long-term motivation, and full of inaccuracies.. Also I find the amount of highly unrealistic and extremely repetitive micro-management very boring. A true motivation killer.All this is played through a ""management"" interface, which does not assist one jot in managing a multi-vessel fleet. On the contrary.This game should be tagged ""shallow simulation of a shallow trade-simulation"". The docking-minigame likewise cannot be called a simulation, as is has nothing in common with handling a large vessel...in fact, not even of that of a 30ft sailboat. However, without it, this game would not even have the pretty graphics.  Nice for an average 12 year old.Most definitely not a title for enthusiats of trade and management sims. If you are looking for an interlectual challenge and some insights into the ""real"" world of cargo shipping, and big scale logistics, look elsewhere.The proposed features for the announced version 2 of this title, do not seem to address these issues. Rather, it seems to take the existing version and expands it into a multiplayer version. A great pity, because the idea is great. There is no in-depth simulation of this genre to my knowledge...and there still isn't...and by the looks of it, version 2 won't change that. In my opinion, the trading and management functions and interfaces require extensive improvements, before this title deserves to be called an exciting game and a simulation.I give 10 out of 10 for the idea, and a 5 out of 10 for execution.All in all, in my view, yet another disappointment, and most definitely not worth the cost. There are more enjoyable apps in the itunes appstore.			"

												The game bears similarities to Ports of Call, which is no bad thing.  TransOcean is an entertaining game, with a decent amount of content and an economic system that works fairly well.  I enjoyed the arcade docking sequences, at least the first few dozen or so, but they soon become quite tedious as your fleet grows.What really spoils it for me though, and the main reason why I cannot recommend it, is that it crashes more often than a drunken teenager.  It's a shame, because otherwise it's quite an enjoyable little number.EDIT: Since playing the game more recently, most of the bugs I complained about appear to have been ironed out.  As such, I have now been convinced enough to amend my earlier review and give this the thumbs up.			"

												I will recomend the game just because it isnt bad, limited but not bad. In either free mode or campaign you have a stupid investor (wish you had more choices) that gives you some cash and you buy a boat and start hauling. Basic enough. Of course there are ranks and whatnot but what i dont like is they force you to keep buying ships to ""level up"" but it isnt really needed imo. My first open run i have done the bare min to advance all the while steady shipping and have $700mil in 2hrs or so and thats still with 2 ranks of ships to aquire. Too easy.As far as the ton of ships there isnt any automation so you have to load.dock.undock.etc every time a ships ready. Thats a pain with a fleet of 6 much less 60..? I remember like 2005 there was a big rig sim that would auto your extra trucks for passive income. 2005.. We going backwards??? Its mindless fun every once inawhile, but games like this need imersion, i wanna by the port, bribe customs, etc.			"

												Everyone talks about ""Ports of Call""... and this is correct, because this game is really only a better 3d/animated version of ""Ports of Call"" (and with less simulation style...).But, in the past, there was a story of really nice sim/trading (also history) games for DOS, that were actually WAY BETTER than this game and also of the others on the market.Try checking: http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/553/Ocean+Trader.htmlAnd others sim game (totally free!) in that site.They were more challenging, fun to play, difficult, realistic, and, yes, maybe not so graphically developed for today (but still nice to watch, in my opionion).So, what is the problem with THIS game?PROS- Nice 3D graphic, but not so developed- NIce world design- Smuggling!- Overall, not a terrible game, but pretty boringCONS- Really poor simulation- Non realistic global market- Tedious ships command system- Useless 3D docking mini games- A casual game, not a simulation game as is sold- No real challenging, no real competition, quite impossible to lose also at highest difficulty!- Is ONLY ""Ports of Call"" with a better 3D and less variety!- At the end, not funny!- REALLY OVERPRICED!!!So, at the end, it could be a 6/10 game (maybe a little more if you consider it a casual game), but it cost too much!A correct price (considering 3D, but also that you can get FAR more with some nice abandonwares), would be 6 to 8 € in my opinion, really not more than this.Not recommended...

												The base of the game is really well done. The ports, the menu, the controls and the map are all great but the game heavily suffers from lack of depth. After one playthrough of the campaign you are pretty much done with the whole game. And even within that it gets repetitive fast. There is no way to build your shipping company differntly in the next playthrough, it's always the same: load ship with goods, sell goods, fuel and repair the ship - repeat - buy more ships. No crew, port or storage management at all. You just ship goods to make money to buy more ships to transport more goods. Maybe it would be fun if there was any type of endgame like buying out the competition (there is none), buying whole ports or investing in research.One would think it gets more interesting when your company grows bigger but it only gets more tiring because there is no automation at all. You have to click everything manually for every single ship every time and you don't even have to think about it because it's too easy. The visualized ports are great but you only see them while docking manually which is fun at first but also gets old really fast.I can't really recommend this game. I would maybe recommend it for $5 since you will roughly get 5-10 hours out of the game. $20 is way too much.			"

												I bought it in a holiday offer for almost nothing and it represents fairlly well the world of shipping companies etc since it's a management and simulation game. It had a real potential if the devs had enhanced it with more things and decisions made from the player. After the first 10-15 hours the game looses it's momentum and becomes a little boring .... (For example it could had the feature of making negotiations and  bargain yrself with the ports and harbormasters for the fee in every port, with the shipping yards for the new boats you wanna build depending on the tonnage etc , with the people that you have hired in each ship -captains and mechanics that provide the advantage of exp or not, or the gunmen to protect the ship from pirates etc, the contracts should be in some kind of reminder from each ship or captain seperatelly, it could had a lot more ports, and a lot more commoditites to carry, and to go to more hardcore reality, even to have the choise of smuggling guns to nations between war, drugs , fuels, and all the other beatiful and wonderfull things that dailly happens in the real world).Those were the things THAT IT DOESNT have !!! It is playable as it is but has 2-3  major bugs (If a port has more than one ship of yours in , it is really complicating to handle as laggy and buggy, and sometimes ( correction many times) the forward daytime STUCKS and results in a disastrous moment to pass 20-25 days. You see that all your ships are waiting to get in ports. the penalties for not on time delivery are running and you see that you are loosing some hundrends of millions of your money by NOT your mistake and most of all the ingame menu is very buggy - you have to push the buttons with the mouse 2-3 times to start the action you were supposed to do and its kinda lame for a game that has no graphics needs). So to sum up, in general go for it, it's ''pretty'' good, not gonna tear your head or you gonna remember it in 2-3 years but desent....Oh and it had a lot of potential !!!			"

												**Contains game details to make points, so beware spoilers.**Game was interesting and had a lot of good bits, but was too shallow overall. There's no real company progress, just meet a few requirements and you unlock the next bigger ship; rinse and repeat. They did a job creating an investor that you'll grow a seething hatred for as she continues to leech your funds ever quarter whilst creating contracts that you can't complete without breaking the law [get product X from city Y; this city only allows the tiniest ships to dock at it, and you need an upgrade to lawfully carry product X - an upgrade that the tiniest ship cannot get]. The end game requires building up a very large amount of spare cash to free yourself from the investor; the amount is 2x the company's late-game value, so if you're punished if you like to have some spare cash on hand. Building a large fleet - which is required to buy out the company - generates a ton of busywork, as there's no sort of automation available. I really enjoy sim-management games, but this one punishes you unless you grind towards great profits; mainly, trying to keep your head above water as Ms. BS gouges you for 10% of your value every quarter [her name is Ms. Blythe-Smith, but maybe the initials were chosen intentionally]. I think I would have enjoyed TransOcean much more if it focused on managing the company rather than managing the minutia.The ability to manually dock and cast off is fun, but it gets tedious considering how many shipping runs you must make; I think if you did every maneuver manually it'd about triple the amount of time played, and eventually feels a bit like busy work [the game forces you to do some maneuvers later game in order to progress, which may help some discover this bit they've been missing out on, but it also feels forced for those that want to focus on the management aspect].It looks like a TO2 is in progress, and I'll probably check it out based on how it looks and the price. TO isn't a bad game, and I was on the fence about giving a 'No' recommendation. I'd probably give it a 7/10 overall - there are just many better games in genre to spend time on, especially ones that have better replay value.			"

I know that the game is basically about planning, but it's hard to do that with this interface. One thing I can say for sure: If you want to spend a great masochistic time with TransOcean prepare some piece of paper and a pen, because otherwise you can get really lost in a grand scheme of multiple contracts.

(For example it could had the feature of making negotiations and  bargain yrself with the ports and harbormasters for the fee in every port, with the shipping yards for the new boats you wanna build depending on the tonnage etc , with the people that you have hired in each ship -captains and mechanics that provide the advantage of exp or not, or the gunmen to protect the ship from pirates etc, the contracts should be in some kind of reminder from each ship or captain seperatelly, it could had a lot more ports, and a lot more commoditites to carry, and to go to more hardcore reality, even to have the choise of smuggling guns to nations between war, drugs , fuels, and all the other beatiful and wonderfull things that dailly happens in the real world).Those were the things THAT IT DOESNT have !!! It is playable as it is but has 2-3  major bugs (If a port has more than one ship of yours in , it is really complicating to handle as laggy and buggy, and sometimes ( correction many times) the forward daytime STUCKS and results in a disastrous moment to pass 20-25 days. You see that all your ships are waiting to get in ports. the penalties for not on time delivery are running and you see that you are loosing some hundrends of millions of your money by NOT your mistake and most of all the ingame menu is very buggy - you have to push the buttons with the mouse 2-3 times to start the action you were supposed to do and its kinda lame for a game that has no graphics needs). So to sum up, in general go for it, it's ''pretty'' good, not gonna tear your head or you gonna remember it in 2-3 years but desent....Oh and it had a lot of potential !!!			"

												I started the game and time slept by in seconds. After a while, I really felt my responcibility before my contractors. Damn I hate sudden cargo chacks.Sure this game has problems in mechanics and it really needs polishing, but I like half-life games, it makes me happy. Perfect games are sometimes boring.			"

												I bought this a while back, played it for a couple days, abandoned it for 3 years. I'd say the first 4-10 hours would be fun, but after that it's a micromanagement nightmare as you have tens of ships that are requesting to dock, or need a contract, or need fuel, or some other thing, all at the same time. The early game is somewhat boring as it is very slow, and the late game is very repetitive. Overall, if it was on sale for 10 dollars or less and you liked micromanagement, it might be okay. For 20 dollars (I bought it at 30) I don't think it's worth it.			"

												This is a good economic simulator with a fun, if not reptitive, mini game of bringing your ships into and out of the port. Towards the end of the game, I found the game to get choppy and slow as I had many ships on the map. I put the game down before completing. If you find this in a bundle or a cheap sale, it's worth picking up.			"

												If you like trading in commodities and goods, and like to occasionally pilot the ship using it's oh so simple controls into and outoff dock, then your in for a treat..Beware TransOcean 2 - which is surprisingly bad considering how well they done with this one! "

												TransOcean has some good points - there is a measure of strategy involved, with picking different cargoes and so on for the best profit.However, the negative aspects of the game outweigh the positive ones.Being double-charged for fuel and repair costs stands at the top of the list, in my view. When you arrive in a port, the estimated costs for fuel and any repairs are deducted from your profits for that trip. This is particularly tiresome when you arrive in a port that has expensive fuel prices, as you lose more.You still have to refuel and repair the ship though, paying for that separately.The investor you have to deal with is another aspect. Whilst she is entitled to her share of profits every quarter, the inane tasks that she forces on you from time to time are ridiculous.On at least two occasions, you are required to transport items that the feeder ships are not designed for - and if you can't complete the entire task, you face an enormous penalty. The tasks do add yet another level of strategy to the game, but they should be relevant to the ships you have at the time.Since the developers have still not seen fit to change this, or improve the game at all, then I cannot recommend TransOcean.

												Docking the ship was a really lame mechanic. I was hoping to create a shipping empire, and instead I need to dock my ships. The tutorial doesn't really train you to dock them well. Also the tutorial put me in the red right away. If that part of the game wasn't in it, I would have stuck with it a bit longer. Couldn't keep playing.			"

												Played it a little bit... it's a snoozefest... docking was fun for the first 10 min, but I can see that it will just get frustrating really quickly... so yeah I won't be playing it.However....I'm still going to recommend it funnily enough, because I think that if you like grinding and the whole context of shipping lanes... and if you're into big fat boats that take ages to turn... then that game is actually pretty well made! Seriously! I think this could have an appeal for some people :)			"

												This is a true copy of the old Ports of Call game i played back in the days from late 1980's. I loved that game, and when i saw this game i had to try it out.Trust me! It's worth the money! I got so hooked on this game that i forgot about the existence of time. It's challenging, and asks you to do nearly impossible transportations some time, but for some reason you manage to pull it off..Would i recommend this game? BIG FAT YES!!			"
