												Alittle disappointed to be honest, It's a decent game, but with it being released so close to Car Mechanic Sim 2015 i would of expected the same... quality. To be honest, do i recommend this game? Well - there is no middle ground between yes and no, i'd say if you dont mind Car mechanic sim 2014, and want to work on big trucks, then this is the kinda game you'd enjoy. If you expected the same quality as you got from Car mechanic sim 2015, well - prepare to be very disapointed. I think it's still fun, just, not what i was expecting.			"

												I dont want to poison you. I have been motivated by improvements made over the Car Mechanic Simulator between 2014 and the new one - 2015 and I bought Truck Mech Sim 2015 too. But made a mistake. Running a triple monitor setup, this game has same flaws as Car MS 2014 - running about 30-45fps with everything off on 5980x1080 resolution using NVidia 980 GTX card. Its definitely not a bad game. If you havent played any MechSims you can try it. But Car Mech Sim 2015 runs 4x better and is better.So from my opinion ""No"" to this budget improver, reskined CMS 2014. Now we have end of 2016 and nothing changed, its shame, nothing else			"

 Truck Simulator 2015 ReviewBefore reading this review, here's a couple things to keep in mind: 1) I have played other ""sim"" sorts of games such as Car Mech Sim and ETS2, 2) I am fairly critical of such games in my reviews, and 3) It works best to judge these games by splitting them up into their separate traits. With that being said, here we go! Originality Truck Mechanic Simulator 2015 in a way piggybacks on other mechanic simulator games, but it does bring a couple fresh ideas to the genre. The first is just the fact that you get to work on big-rig style trucks, not just your everyday cars like in Car Mechanic Simulator 2014/2015. The Free Mode is a nice function, but it's nothing more than what CMS had. In this respect, I could see this game as a DLC to CMS, but as a major expansion. This game could be like Dragonborn to CMS's Skyrim; both could stand alone (and one does), and separately they have enough content to be separate games, but when you put the both together, you get a better, more complete experience.The setup of the game is almost identical to CMS 2014/2015, with similar ""repair order"" forms/tasks and a similar part purchase system. The ability to completely tear down a vehicle and rebuild it is still present, which is nice. Complexity  TMS 2015 is both overly complex and not complex enough. I get that this can be confusing at first glance, so to wrap your head around this statement, let's start with one of the core components of a repair mission: inspecting parts. There are plenty of parts to inspect, which is fine, but the level of what you can actually do with the repairs and such is very low. There could be some repairs that require some innovative thinking, but that simply isn't there. Maybe that's just personal preference, but when you complete a few missions you'll see what I mean. The idea of being too complex is that in some repairs, you have to go through every single part to find a single small thing that is in bad shape.  Gameplay  One of the issues with this game is simply how it plays. Although there is variety with the repair missions, in each repair you run through the same processes and lose interest in the actual point of the game. However, there is certainly enough content and enough different variety of repairs to keep the gameplay interesting even after hours of gameplay. If you like procedural games or just following directions well, this game's for you. If creativity is your thing, then give this game a shot, but don't expect a ton of options of what to do. Controls and Graphics TMS 2015 has basic point-and-click controls with basic movement around the trucks. However, the controls system is convoluted in a number of ways. First, when lifting the hood of a truck to inspect part conditions, a number of parts cannot be inspected; however, there is no indication that they can't - simply nothing happens. This becomes frustrating as you are unable to inspect what seem like relevant parts to the repair. Secondly, the menu is very hard to adjust to when you are in inspect/assemble/disassemble mode. There are far too many times when I went to inspect a part and accidently ended up taking it off the engine block. This could be very easily fixed with a more simple mode-switch system, such as 1 for inspect, 2 for assemble, 3 for disassemble, etc. instead of the awkward menu. However, I do feel like the developers worked on this issue with the mode-dependent cursor.As for the graphics of the game, from my understanding the game is actually created with a dated engine; however, I personally don't feel that this really impacted the game in any negative way. The graphics are what you would expect from this line of games and there is no such ""downgrade"" with this game from previous games, at least when it comes to graphics fidelity and controls movement. The trucks are very reminiscent of those from ETS2 (see Steam Curator Group link at bottom of review to check out our review of that game). The camera system of the game is a bit wonky at times, but I was able to get used to it. Enjoyability See, here's where I run into a bit of trouble when rating this game. Sure, the game is enjoyable, but the component of gamers who enjoy this genre of game is fairly small. With that being said, if you are a fan of ETS2 or CMS, don't hesitate to get this game - you will have hours of fun playing it. However, if you are new to this genre of game, I would not recommend starting with this game to get you into the simulator series. Not that the game isn't good, it just simply isn't entertaining enough for a new player to enjoy as much as an experienced player would enjoy it. Because of this, I would have to give TMS 15 a lower score in this category.  Aspect Rating   Originality 4   Complexity 6   Gameplay 5   Graphics 8   Enjoyability 8   Overall 6  Final Points on the Game TMS 2015 doesn't quite live up to its sibling game, Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, but if you are into this kind of game you will certainly find the repair missions entertaining and difficult enough to keep things interesting.Be sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did! Thanks for reading!If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCURATION TEXTAlthough TMS 2015 functions well as a mechanic sim, it does little to stand out or bring any unique experiences. 6/10			"

												I know I don't have much time logged in Truck Mechanic Simulator 2015, but I've played the hell out of both Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. Given that the game mechanics (no pun intended) are similar in TMS2015 to both of those games, I believe I can review this title with what little game time I have in it. PROS:+ Solely focuses on large trucks, which none of the other vehicular mechanic sims do. + Tried-and-true vehicle mechanic formula works.+ Decent graphics.+ Allows for multiple profiles.CONS:- Based on Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, where the entire game is one job after another, has no RPG-like upgrades,  and uses an overly simplistic interface. This is in contrast to Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, which lets you have your own vehicles, tune how you want, upgrade your skills, and a much, much improved interface.- Oddly angled viewpoints when attaching or detaching some parts (such as the truck's muffler). - Options menu is very limited.- Graphics really need some AA (yes, you can force this in your video card's control panel, but you shouldn't have to do that).- Extremely lazy English translation that is, at times, unintentionally funny, but still shows a distinct lack of professionalism. Please note my criticism here isn't because I am a native English-speaker, but because ANY developer that translates a game needs to do so accurately, regardless of the languages involved. - No Steam Cloud.VERDICT:  If Truck Mechanic Simulator 2015 had been released as DLC for Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, I would've praised it. Even if it were a somewhat lackluster DLC for Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, I would've been fine with it. However, this is a poor product as its own game, and while it's not terrible (I've certainly played much worse), there are better offerings out there. At this point in time, I'll have to say ""No, don't buy this game."" Maybe if TMS2015 goes on sale for 50% off or more, it might be worth it.			"

												I want a refund.  I can't even complete the game because it won't register that I replaced the starter on repair order 46.  I tried repairing it, replacing it, rebooting the save but it still won't register.  Also, seeing that this game was made around the time CMS2015 was made, I was expecting the new engine and better graphics.  I've played other titles similar to this published by PlayWay including CMS2015 and CMS2014, Train Mechanic Sim, and this.  This game was by a mile worst than any of the others.  They didn't put much effort into this game at all, they never even bothered with DLC.  Games like this are really just hit or miss, and this one was an awful miss.			"
