												I thought this would be similar to demolition company gold, but it's way more boring.  I couldn't even make it thru the tutorial because it is such a snorefest.			"

												Well this game is actually an enjoyable time waster.  It is not anything like a high end aaa release. But it is not nearly as bad as other reviews make it out to be .			"

												Total crap, boring as you can get.  Thought I would give it a shot as it came in a bundle, but all you do is blow up stacks of lumber and steel, not buildings like I was expecting.  I've played older dos based demolition games with more to do than this pile of ##$%.			"

												the comcept is good and the game works quite well.the only problem is that the result of your explosion configuration is affected by some sort of randomness (trying the same configuration multiple times will result in multiple different results), this is not a big deal with small levels, I was enjoying the game until more complicated levels came in, here there's a lot of stuff going on and due to this randomness you can't predict the result of your actions, and therefore correct your mistakes and try to improve your performace; the game become frustrating also thanks to the bad user interface. also adding a slow-mo mode to look at the demolition would be usefultoo bad...I think that it can be improved very easily, but I doubt devs will do that			"

												Demo 3D is a tablet game with a forgivable premise - Bridge constructor games meet Angry birds without the birds.   You set explosives on various premade structures and try not to hit red things and try to hit green and yellow things with the falling debris.   What's the problem then?  They didn't put a lot of effort into porting to PC.   The game controls all require ""tapping"".  There's no graphics or fidelity options - the graphics are at a fixed resolution, very low polygon for PC. Lack of attention to PC specific configuration items and PC fidelity drag this game below the line, unfortunately.   This came very close to a thumbs up, and would certainly score modestly well if Steam gave us a more gradiated choice.  Here's hoping they decide to review their approach and take PC gaming seriously for their next offering.			"
