												At first this game was utterly confusing, I just didn't understand it. Now I know that this is not a game, this is a social ""experiment"". Try to look for bottles in outer space, and get a glimpse inside peoples head. You can leave messages for people, and you can also get messages back.PROS+ Unique social ""game""+ Great music+ Help real people out, or condemn themCONS- Confusing at first- Not really a game			"

												Railslavegame's obsession with space and religion continues to baffle me. Also flies are apparently the gateway to other dimensions? Well colour me surprised.Music isn't as good as other titles and the gameplay is pretty weak, but you certainly weren't playing this title expecting much of the latter. Stick with his other titles for a more coherent dose of insanity.			"

One-Sentence Summary:A highly experimental interactive social platform which is rough, disjointed, and poorly constructed, yet the community is shockingly honest and transcendent.Pros:+ A unique interactive social experience+ The community is very sincere+ People's honesty will broaden your perspectives+ Floating around in vector-like wireframe space is relaxing+ The 8-bit TV advertisements are often amusingCons:- Understanding what to do is too ambiguous- The actual 'game' constructs are not enjoyable- The atmosphere might put you in a bad place- The FMV clips are cringeworthyFinal Thoughts:The experience might have been more satisfying in my mind if it had focused its full attention on the space portion with the social aspect, and with clearer indication about the bottles in space.  As it stands, I still recommend trying Selfie: Sisters of the Amniotic Lens for those interested in a unique interactive social experience, but feel that it could have been constructed in a way that would have made it more meaningful and accessible.

												Rail Slave is not very good at programming and he is not very good at art and he is not very good at making videogames that are fun. Selfie is not very good, but it is also brutal and depressing and uplifting and everything like that. Maybe by pure accident, RSG has managed to make the closest thing to actual art a videogame has ever been. When you fly around in space, you'll find bottles, each containing the deep fears and secrets of other players. People are incredibly, shockingly honest in these things. People with genuine, real problems that they put into a bottle in a budget art game for anyone to see and write back messages of encouragement, telling them it's OK to be afraid or to doubt god or to have been molested as a child. Of course, none of that really has anything to do with with RSG himself, because the things he was responsble for making are, as is traditional, janky as♥♥♥♥♥♥and probably not very good. But it is an incredible accomplishment nonetheless.			"

												This thing is mindblowing. Definitely a leap forward for Rail Slave Games, which already has several classics to its name. Art, music and writing are top notch. The social media aspect is unlike anything I've seen in a game, and (at its best) it gives you this intense, overpowering sense of responsibility. If you're interested in bleeding-edge indie work that pushes the boundaries of what the term ""video game"" even means, then you need to play Selfie. Having finished it, I'm not sure I can look at games the same way again. An indie title hasn't hit me this hard in six or seven years. Just don't go in expecting to understand anything: this is for people who enjoy being confused. It's a trippy, funny, tragic experience more than it is a typical ""game"".			"

												If you're at all familiar with Rail Slave Games, you'll know that their releases have been divisive, at best. There is no hand holding, no giant yellow punctuation marks over characters' heads, or arrows pointing the correct direction in which to go. Just figuring out what to do is considered part of the gameplay itself. As a result of this seeming ambiguity, some people expound titles such as Uriel's Chasm as being incredibly deep virtual allegories, rich with biblical and social commentary; while, for other players, five minutes is enough for them to declare their hatred (usually publicly) and remove the game from their hard drive, never to be played again.  Either way, the games (and I hesitate to use that label) they develop cause powerful, passionate responses in players.Rail Slave's newest release, intriguingly titled Selfie: Sisters of the Amniotic Lens certainly continues this tradition in a big way. There is simply nothing commercial about it, although it draws its actual play style  from older games that were, at one time, absolutely commercial. There is a version of the fly swatter game from Mario Paint, as filtered through the raw, visceral perspective of CSI. There is a minimalist version of an early Wing Commander game, but with a greater sense of the emptiness of space, utilizing beautiful vector graphics not seen since early arcade machines. And then, there is what Rail Slave calls the ""play-by-mail mmo / social network.""This network is what will give ""Selfie"" something that has been somewhat lacking in previous efforts: longevity. As players fly around in space, they can target vector ""bottles"" that contain the thoughts of other players. After reading these messages, the player is faced with a choice: to condemn that message, or  ""free"" it, allowing one to write a reply to that bottle's owner. It's much more exciting than it sounds: Each new bottle brings the opportunity to discover the thoughts of someone else and, as the bottles are in random locations with each session, I found myself hoping for certain players' bottles, as I had grown fond of their messages. Friendships were made with people with whom I could not chat in real time and, in its own way, that made for more engaging conversation. Older players who used to frequent pre-internet, online bulletin board systems[en.wikipedia.org] will find this a charming reminder of simpler times, when a sense of community could flourish even before there was such a thing as ""real time updates.""In truth, the success or failure of this system will depend on the players, and how willing they are to take these bottles seriously (although the occasional ""I like ch1cken!!!!"" was fun to come across). With the lack of paragraph breaks or basic elements such as quotation marks, ""Selfie"" will never replace online blogging; in fact, I found its lack of more robust text editing features a bit surprising,  especially for a game that relies so heavily on communication between players. That said, perhaps this was an intentional decision, designed to discourage long-winded tomes, or to bring the aforementioned pre-internet community vibe to people who are used to chatting in 140 characters or less: Twitter in space. The soundtrack is provided mainly by Swans co-founder Jarboe[en.wikipedia.org], and is always ethereal, always shifting. It's alternatively creepy and trippy depending on what area of the game you're in, and it's an important  (and particularly strong) element in developing the atmosphere that ""Selfie"" relies on.This being a Rail Slave game, religion (specifically, Christianity) also plays a large role. Strewn in amongst the player bottles are computer generated ones**, each containing a Scriptural verse. The whole experience (for that's more accurate than calling it a game) is said to be inspired by Hebrews (specifically chapter 4[www.biblegateway.com]), but as Hebrews is one of the most difficult books of the Bible to interpret, I'll leave any analysis for the player to find for themselves. Just know that there are themes in the game that are quite disturbing, and even a bit graphic.If, after reading this, you still don't know what ""Selfie"" is about, that's because I haven't told you. The truth is, I couldn't even if I wanted to. Oh, I have a definite idea of what I think it is, but my interpretation is very likely to be different from yours. One thing is for certain: Once you've found yourself in the initial area and had a chance to look around, see where you're sitting and what's in the room with you, you will be moved to feel something. Whether that something is disgust, fear, excitement, hatred, or something else entirely, it will affect you. For me, eliciting a physical response while encouraging reflection is a form of art that games rarely aspire to, and even less frequently achieve. Those are the games I find myself seeking more and more as I get older, and this one definitely qualifies. ""Selfie"" is Rail Slave Games' strongest entry yet in their unique brand of avant garde, digital experiences. To those of you who are already fans, and to those of you who think you might be: See you in space.**UPDATE: Since the original publication of this review on BundleJunkie[www.bundlejunkie.com], the computer-generated bottles have been removed from the game.

												Even in the vast sea of feverish electro-dreams that is the indie games market, Selfie is a vision that stands completely alone.  One's first impression, however, may simply be that of a surreal interactive art gallery, featuring macabre 3D renderings and a sizable amount of tastefully outlandish teletext artwork.  In the background, the uncanny music of ""no wave"" folk singer Jarboe plays (and her work is sweet, dark magic that will lay a hazy glamour upon anyone with a fragment of a soul; imagine a 1960s folk scene dominated by kind and contemplative demons, and you've got the right idea).  The ambiance radiating from these assets would, on their own, constitute a worthy aesthetic experience, but for those who pay attention as they play, all elements are soon drawn together by a fourth-wall breaking revenge story -- one involving a free love cult and some truly gonzo metaphysical rituals.  There is still a lot open to individual interpretation though, so it is no exaggeration to say that the lore of Selfie unfolds more completely for players who are willing to rub their imaginative elbow grease into it. The artwork, soundtrack and narrative, engaging as they are, really serve as a frame for the MMO centerpiece of the Selfie experience:  The Eighth Day, a vector cosmos that beckons to the drifting souls of the guilty (the players).  Every spirit has the option to float a wireframe message-in-a-bottle into this starry void.  In turn, they can fly to the twinkling bottles of others, reading the contents and, if they so choose, reply.  The crux is that the bottles are unlabeled; one has no idea whose is whose until opening.  The bottle will always be a random one.  The messages will inevitably say many different things, some serious, some flippant and most totally unrelated to the frame story.  How will players behave during these encounters?  Will they allow their greater selves to emerge, comforting the downcast and laughing along with the comedians?  Or will they squander these chance meetings in base trollery?  Bottle replies are private and Selfie usernames can be easily changed.  It's a fascinating set-up, a mutant lovechild of Chatroulette and pre-Internet BBS.  Selfie is one of the *boldest* of indies, and is certainly the most ambitious game in Rail Slave's catalog.  At the time of this writing, I have no inkling as to the character the game's community will take on (or if it will even have a unified character), but I am anxious to find out.  I must recommend this sui generis work of massively-multiplayer art to all lovers of the surreal, and to all who would like to see where a bizarre new gaming experiment leads!			"

												Absurd, repetitive and unfufilling, this experiment is far from gaming and twice as far from art. An idea is most certainly present, however it's more of an outline that fails to guide the player through the process of filling it out. In other words - filling it out becomes very boring, very fast. What, at first, seemed like a horrifying and story-rich experience quickly turned into a monotonous chore consisting of ""What the hell do I do now"" and ""WTF"" moments. I don't recommend this at any price, except if it seems interesting to you. But be warned - it's not as interesting as it seems. At all.			"

												""This game truly is a life-changer. I love the fact that I have the opportunity to potentially make someone's day merely by imparting upon a random soul a kind word or two and a bit of encouragement for the better path. To everyone who reads this: in this crazy, ♥♥♥♥ed-up realm we live in, I want you to know that love for your fellow man and understanding through one another's eyes is the key to enlightenment and true bliss. Love life as you have recieved it, for life is long, and it will surely change as the continuum of time flows on down the rivers of fabric that make up the beautiful cell we live in; space. Peace be with you all, and much love come your way.""I began this game with absolutely no clue as to how to play or what it was about. Little did I know, this game would make quite a significant impact on me. Once I began to float around the endless expanse of starry void that encompassed all of these little prayers in the night, I began to see that this was more than just ""some game."" It's so much more than that. This is human fellowship.The experiences that I've had and the beautiful souls that I've encountered...It's magical.The passage from the beginning is what I put on my profile.

												How can I even begin to describe this metaphysical, beautiful and immersive world that has been lovingly created for us? Selfie: Sisters of the Amniotic Lens has immediately enthralled me in every aspect. There are so many deep layers to the presentation, the music, the plot and the world that you are inside. From the very moment you open the game you are introduced to the plot, in a unique and very fascinating way, as intentionally indirect as it is, it immediately enthralled me and pushed me to keep playing and learn more about what I was seeing, and how it should make me feel. Even right now as I write this, the music that accompanies you in space in Selfie is playing through my headphones, urging me to try and explain the emotions that it brings up in me as I drift through the empty lonliness of space. Something incredible and unique to this game is how personalized it's already becoming, with only having been out two days, I've already read messages from real other people saying things like ' 'Every day i want to die. I can never feel better, i can never end this.'.. even if this is a joke to them, and they wrote it in jest, I still read it as quite a personal expression of how they felt, and couldn't even bring myself to jokingly 'condemn' them for it, leaving myself to have to compose a message back to them.. I've seen many messages like this now, and it's incredible to see the emotions people are willing to share in this void of space... I absolutely CANNOT wait to see and learn more about the human race as they continue to write for messages for myself and others to read... Remember people, if you feel the same way as the person who wrote the above quote, you are not comdemned.. at the least, not by me...This game is an experience, I will always be checking my messages and responses in game, this is my Facebook. There is nothing else like this game.			"

												Games are primarily for fun and entertainment. Games take us away from our problems and into magical lands where we are invincible heroes, bound to save the day. Selfie challenges you to take a hard look at yourself and face your real problems, head on. This strange simulation/social experiment is about hard truths and a twisted tale of lies and manipulation. Selfie is a game that you will only get so much out of as much as you put in to it. Reading personal passages and issues that people are possibly really going through is a sobering and sometimes disturbing experience. We forget how fragile the human spirit is when we hit the play button and start escaping. Selfie asks can games be more then what they are? Can they help people? Can games help people learn something about themselves? The gaming aspects to Selfie are not the highlight of this game. If you're looking for a game, you are going to sorely disappointed. If you're looking for something to make you think and perhaps make you feel things you don't want to, then Selfie could be something you've been looking for. The game is full of interpretation and art and the game never spells things out for you. Selfie is a game you have to be invested and try to understand what its all about. Games like Selfie don't come along very often and if you're willing, deserve a look.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												The first game I played by this developer was terrible (Uriel's Chasm), but it was one the weirdest games ever. This one is really crazy, but things are a lot less chaotic, and there are defintely some good things to enjoy here.The game is a huge wasted potential, as its gameplay is there like a second thought, as it is obvious that most of the developer's efforts were focused on the aesthetics and amazing soundtrack. The idea of sending and receiving messages from other players and finding them in bottles is amazing, and it could be even better, were it not for the 12-year-olds that write silly messages.Overall, I can only recommend this at a bargain price, as it is a game difficult to grasp (I had to look for a walkthrough on youtube) and its gameplay is really repetive (you keep doing the same thing in every level), but I appreciate the effort and I believe that, should the developer actually listen to the people who play his games, he could do something a lot better.

Whether or not I ""like"" it seems less important to me than the fact that it's absolutely worth experiencing. The honesty and intimacy of the multiplayer aspect of the game took me by surprise in the best of ways, and that alone was worth the price.

												This is one of those games that lets you thinking wtf is going on, until you play it several times.So every person might probably have a different idea of what's going on but that's the fun of games like this.There are references to other games from the same developer, such as uriel 1,2 and NPPD rush what makes me think this storyline is probably linked to those games, starts to feel like pixar, right? if you watch all their movies you find a secret hidden story in the background just like on this games...Anyways...When you done with the story, what is left is some sort of social network, floating in space finding messages left from other players, you can comment on their messages (those messages is whatever they wrote in their profile) This social network encourages people to express the most deep feelings in some really anonymous way.

												It's Rail Slave Games, all right. This ""game"", insofar as there are vaguely interactive elements, is yet another hilariously awful artsy nonsense piece that pretends to be meaningful by jamming as much symbolic gibberish as it can into as short a time as possible. There's nothing entertaining to be found here, unless vague nausea is your idea of a good time.			"

												This is an example of an interesting concept mixed with poor implementation. It's interesting at first until you invest what feels like hours scanning the deep space for people's messages. It's really is interesting, it's fun. You leave a message behind for someone to read and you get responses, you read other people's messages and respond to theirs. You can condemn people or give sympathy. It is interesting! Just... not $5 interesting. I paid far less for it on sale, it was not a regretable purchase, it's just something I still would never recommend. It plays like something that could be free over the internet.			"

												I'm at a point where I have so many games that I actively search for ones that have interesting, weird, or unique concepts. This knocks it out of the park. It's the type of game that you really shouldn't read too much about and figure things out for yourself, as discovery and introspection are very important aspects of the experience. You might find yourself thinking about it more than you find yourself actually playing it. This game could very well become an important part of your life.			"

												This is a unique game - I use that term loosely - that will not be for everyone. It does not really give you direction, or show any way of playing. This forces the player to figure things out on their own, yet nothing is straight forward. You must figure out whats going on and what to do next to move on. I spent much of my time staring at the screen wondering what to do next. Once you figure it out, you just move onto another mind bending puzzle. This game really sucks you in and is full of bizzare yet interesting scenes that, I personally, just wanted to continue to learn about.Quite the interesting game, to say the least.

												I barely do reviews cause most of the time they're redundant, there's nothing to say that hasnt been said before, however, i feel that this game deserves to be reviewed under what it is.As others pointed out, this game isnt anything amazing in terms of graphical execution or engaging gameplay, in fact, ""game"" wouldn't even be the correct term. the ""MMO"" tag comes from the fact you'll be able to interact with other people's messages, so, you only need to play the game once to be a part of itTHIS GAME DEPENDS A LOT ON IMMERSION AND LETTING YOURSELF GO, READ FURTHER ONLY IF YOU THINK IT WON'T RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE, YOU MAY PREFER FINDING OUT THINGS FOR YOURSELFAlthough there's some sort of sequence through the game, the main focus are the ""bottles"" left behind by other players, once you start you're prompted to leave a ""message in a bottle"" with what hurts you the most in your life, your deepest feelings and regrets.Once you get to the 'space' part, where you see all these bottles flying around, you can read each person's issues and reply to them, while having your own bottle replied to. Not only will you receive hearthwarming responses, wandering through space, barely noticing the small bottles which include big issues puts everything into perspective, you enter some sort of therapy where you start seeing your problems as something smaller, they're insignificant in this huge space.Interesting concept, completely different from anything you'll play.In case you can't get past the first part, which has vague instructions to say the least, you're supposed to focus on 6 different flies with right mouse button, this will turn the TV on, after it does, switch through channels until you get one channel which is different from the others and focus on it, you'll be taken into the space part			"

												I would recommend selfie to someone who (and this has been said in other reviews) is looking to have an experience. selfie will probably give you a very visceral experience both physically and mentally. you'll feel a lot of things, some positive and some negative. maybe you might even find answers for questions you've been asking yourself for years, or answers to questions you never asked, or maybe more questions than answers. I don't know if I can call it a game because it doesn't have most of what people generally expect from a ""game"". I can tell you that the content is very very much worth 5 dollars if it is what you are looking for.  I recommend you get into it soon before the community gets too empty.			"

												This game is great. If you love wanky 'art' that isn't a game at all. I went into this... this thing anticipating a bit of... well. Something.I had no expectations and I still feel a little cheated.My initial thought as I flew through space after working out what the hell I was 'doing' was 'Whoever made this has clearly never played a game in their lives.'I stand by that.HOWEVER, once I finally worked out what the hell I was supposed to do, it seemed a little more entertaining, hence the thumbs up.I rather enjoyed shooting the bottles and giving people bad advice in response to their 'confessions'.So, good shiz with that jargon. The fly-catching thing though, not so much.I now want to buy a beret.			"

												HINT (I almost stopped playing the game since I didn't know this):In the space realm, go out to the stars in the middle of nowhere, you will notice some of the stars getting closer - these are messages in bottles! Get close enough to shoot at them and you will be able to read them. This is what this game is all about!Anyway, wow, I'm incredibly impressed now that I've figured that part out... There are a few messages that are obviously not serious, but the majority of them seem to be real questions, real issues, real fears, real sorrows. This is an amazing project focused around humanity. It's quite fascinating really, and I can see it being very empowering to those who need it.---------------v--EDIT--v---------------This is truly an EXCELLENT idea. However, 1) it would be sooo much nicer if it was implemented smoother. Guide the player a little more - hint at them to explore the unknown so that they will come across the bottles.2) there would SO many more players, if the above were true, and also if it was easier to get around space, or at least, if things were closer together. It's hard to manouver around, and at times it almost doesn't feel worth it to reach out to that next bottle... though I really, really want to. Make it easier for us to reach the bottles, people need this.3) would it be possible to change the code so that we won't come across the same message multiple times? It requires quite a bit of effort to reach the bottle in general, and when it's the same message I've seen 4 or 5 times, it's quite the bummer....			"

												You know whats amazing? Read the first word of this review.In all honesty this game is thought provoking. You start off by looking at flies and channel flipping, then you're in space and opening bottles. But its much more than that, these bottles contain (hopefully true and not angsty teens attention cries) real peoples problems, its amazing how honest people are and you're free to either help them or condemn them. By freeing them to give them advice or tell them, ""Its okay to be afraid,"" or ""You're not the only one."" People out there do have problems, and this is just one of many ways to help them. I wont go as far as to call this art, but it sent me on a thought provoking journey.			"

												A part of me wants to write this review as, ""This game is weird,"" and the call it a day.  But doing so would be a bit of an understatement on not just it's weirdness, but also on the idea that it is a ""game.""Don't get me wrong, there are elements of a game here in the sense that you will find yourself exploring at points, and there is an odd little sequence where you will engage in some kind of ""air combat"" with other players, but these bits aren't exactly entertaining on it's own merits.  However it is in the exploration aspect that you will truly see the object of this game, and that is as a kind of ""online confessional.""  You will retrieve the online secrets and confession of other players of the game and it is up to you how you choose to react whether with support or ire.However the cost of being able to do this is that you too must submit something as well, so you too will be judged by a group of faceless, anonymous players who will often reply with some kind of remark about your secrets.At it's best your faith in humanity will be restored and you'll realize there really is good people in the world.  At it's worst you'll realize that some people are just horrible.  Not a horrible experience at the cost of $4.99 if you have some♥♥♥♥♥♥you need to work out and possibly want to see some people who have it worse than you.			"

												A little edit here: Not sure if you know what this game is about while reading this, I'd just say that this experience it very much depended on the community, and after my last session I'm really not sure where the community here is going. Just sayin'To conclude it shorly, Selfie: Sisters of the Amniotic Lens is barely a game. It is potentially a life-changer, which can be far more interesting if you as me.Many here said similar things and I would say it as well, this is more of an experience rather than a video game. These are the exact words from another review here, actually, and as soon as I read that line I figured I have to try this game out, even though it wasn't discounted (and I usually buy discounted games) but for just 5$... I didn't mind giving it a shot. And eventually I believe it was worth it.Not everyone would enjoy this ""game"" obviously.This title is for whoever whishes to have a glimpse into others' souls, and also open a window of their own for others to see. You wouldn't find a ""walkthrough"" for this game, there's not much gameplay here, but whatever gameplay that does exist is actually rather frustrating, so, make sure you reach that part I've just mentioned because that's what makes Selfie so good! Don't get frustrated too soon by the flies-shooting part! (I certainly did)There's some (very) minor gameplay as I said, and a rather abstract back story which I didn't yet complete and didn't find myself too intrigued by. I wouldn't write here exactly what you're supposed to do because every ""official"" review has described exactly every step you need to do.There's not much content and it all gets very repetitive.Yet it feels good, it gives you a chance to open your heart to complete strangers and see what their reactions may be.And you can react to others opening their hearts, with the potential of making someone's day better. You wouldn't know if you did, though. Everything is done anonymously, no one can respond to your reactions. And you cannot respond to the reactions you'd get from others. And that's part of the magic.On the technical side this game is not that good, not that it matters much with so little gameplay. It only makes me fear a little for my privacy, but I hope and believe there's no actual threat in here.In short, if you can stand a rather bizarre experience (Personally I like these things so much!) and have an open mind regarding this one, you can have good time with Selfie. You wouldn't necessarily ""enjoy"" it, so to speak. But it can give you a good feeling at time, and heck, even a bad feeling, which is still impressive when invoked by a video game. If you're lucky it could even give you some interesting insights and become a life-changer for you.			"

The mmo side, which is done unlike anything I've ever seen before. I have ""beaten"" this game and continue to go back and replay it to read all of the confessions that people leave. It's very intriguing and cool to see into other people's minds with out ever meeting them, seeing the most raw and feral and honest thoughts people have. It's worthy of a playthrough if you really like games that push the boundaries of status quo norms.			"

												At first I wasn't sure about Selfie. I didn't put much thought into the question asked.   I thought the game was a bit pretentious and I didn't care for the music or style.  I played through because it was intriguing.I was thinking I was going to uninstall when I figured out how to read other people's answers.  Some of them struck me and I grew more curious.  I answered a few the best I could and then went back and reanswered the question asked with more thought.I found myself checking my messages in the game every couple days and was impressed with the level of care and basic decency in this weird little community.  Then one player was an asshat and I remembered that this too was the internet so, of course there was an asshat to be found.  The next day somebody wrote a reply to me that took time, thought, caring and above all...effort.  This reply helped me personally.  I realized that this random, unknown person took time out of their day to think about and try to help someone that not only they didn't know but they would never know and nobody would ever know about this person's attempt to help.  It was a truely selfless act and the very fact that it happened proves the value of this experience. Thank you RSG and thanks to you, the unknown heroes of strange little selfieland.			"

												Full disclosure: The following is a snippet from our review found here: http://attackongaming.com/reviews/selfie-sisters-of-the-amniotic-lens-review/--[...]I’m not entirely sure how to review a title like this one. It’s an incredibly unique experience across any medium. I have not seen anything like Selfie: SotAL in my entire career as a gamer, which is as long as I have lived, and that’s really saying something. As a piece of art, and as a game, this is probably the most important thing that I’ve played, and I don’t know how to express that in writing. As such, I’ll try and hit on everything, but understand, you’ll need to play this game. Even if you take away nothing else from this review, it’s that this is a game that you have to play. And by playing it, you’ll probably ruin it. Like, that’s the thing, I feel like writing about this game in any capacity will ruin the experience for the player. So, if you don’t want to have this experience ruined, read carefully or just buy the game, it’s only like ~$5.[...]			"

												A neat lil art game mixed together with a really unique social experiment. The framing story has an interesting concept and some cool symbolic stuff, and being an art game that isn't a walking simulator and manages to have not-terrible gameplay is a nice plus.The social aspect is by far the coolest part part, leaving and responding to anonymous messages in a sort of communal penpal setup leads to you learning a lot about both those sharing their stories and those responding to them.Also the music by Jarobe is pretty nice and lends really well to the 80s aspect of the whole product.

												I was really confused by the concept while playing the game, though after thinking about it for a week or so your imagination sort of starts to fill in gaps that were not blatantly explained.  The longer you think about it the more rich the story and concept become.  I played it on skype with a friend and I definitely recommend playing through with someone else, not only so you can figure out how to play but also so you can discuss the purpose of the game as you go.  Unfortunately, the social aspect of the game did not work for me but I still truly enjoyed this game. It was unique, fascinating and rich with meaning.			"
