Turns out it was now 2 o'clock in the morning...and I still wanted to make another!If you want to contribute to a great game, with a really fun tool that will eat up your life then download this, it's free, it's fun and it's bloody fantastic!Do I recommend this?

												Create badass floating island worlds with a toysRus version of zbrush, materials, dozens of models. Then upload and maybe it goes into Worlds Adrift, the Game™. Some perf issues even on my moderately beastly machine. I'd like some more standard editing tools as well. Duplicate, additional axes on the gizmos. The bases are covered, just want more advanced. I love that everything is painted on using brushes, and can then be edited individually. It supports the organic feel of the world.The tech behind this game looks terrific (improbable.io). Bossa is sick. The use of Steam Workshop is great. This is a great opportunity for building content in a game, and if you don't care about that it's zen-like experience if you just want to chill and paint islands in the sky.Why can't Unreal and Unity come with Zen music?

												It's not very often you see something like a level editor being made available as a free download; In the current age of gaming, you'd have to shell out a ton of money just to get something like that, and even then it may not contain everything it should have. Seeing a free to use level design tool with workshop support AND the possibility of seeing your creation in the final game is pretty refreshing in my opinion. Sadly, my computer isn't capable of running it due to the fact that it renders the in game graphics, and reducing them does very little. However, that in no way is a fault on the game, but more a fault on me not having the proper hardware. Everything else about this editor as far as I've seen is pretty darn good, and can lead to a lot of possibilities. Just take a look at the Workshop for this editor and you can find pages and pages of beatiful looking environments just itching to be explored. I highly recommend this to any rookie level designer looking for something to start with.			"

												I really shouldn't reccomend this game. After all, it suffers from: - Very poor handling of the engine it chose. - Wildly inconsistent framerate. - Shaky and clunky control scheme. - Animations that are, quite frankly,♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. - Very, very few customization options for your island when it's all said and done. - Not to be harsh, but art deriction that has little to no interest in creating a unique style or being even pleasant to look at. Although that is hugely subjective.However, I'm going against my better judgement.  - Firstly, it's free. The final game won't be, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. - Secondly, it's a free creative outlet. You don't see these specific types of level editors everywhere, unless you want to learn how to program. It may be bare-bones, but considering the market isn't exactly brimming with 3D explorative level editors, I'll reluctantly give it a pass. - And the most important. Even though the final game (If I had to take an educated guess) will probably not be worth buying, it's a cool experiment. What's even cooler is being part of the experiment. Making levels that could be in a fully-partly functional retail game is kind of exhilierating. Especially seeing what other members of the community came up with. Though my levels are sure as hell not going to be featured in the final product, I still feel like I'm apart of something.So if you're cheap and want a small-scale way to express some creativity (or just want to see what other people came up with) give this game a try. After all, all you have to lose is time.			"

												Great editor , fun to work with , voxel terrain sculpting is really satisfying and gives you the opportunity to shape the world of World's Adrift. Cant ask for anything else.for peoples  that complain and says  ''developper are just being lazy so they want people to create their world for free'' , you guys do not understand anything about player created content , nor game developpement. In the end , the only thing it does  is, allow developper to focus on adding more gameplay element and polish the game  and not spend months creating island to fill up the world.			"

												Whether you actually use this tool to make your own interesting islands is one thing. You can always just download from the Steam Workshop other players creations and explore. Set to in game tranquil music, exploring the varied floating worlds of other players is relaxing. You'll have fun acting like Tarzan, with your own easily deployable grapping line, swinging between different parts of a floating island. But I do recommend the creation tool once you sample all the creative things you could do with it.			"

												Nowhere else can you spend a few hours creating a unique world that could be a permanent part of an MMO sandbox universe for anyone to come across and explore. Amazingly good tool for creating any kind of world you can imagine with very intuitive options and controls so even someone without any 3d modeling experience can pick it up quickly.For anyone with 3d modeling experience you'll find this tool is actually quite powerful. Whether you want to work quickly or spend 50 hours on one island, the Island Creator can handle hundreds of assets with ease and gives you numerous customization options, sliders, and shortcuts to quickly build or endlessly detail your dream worlds.In addition, the developer team Bossa Studios is very transparent with the development process, always with an eye and ear to the community's islands and feedback.

												The Worlds Adrift Island Creator has it's ups and downs, and yes it is still in a very experimental stage. Do I think it should have been released in it's current state? Personally, yes. I feel like it gives us as a community a good chance to experiment with the mechanics of the game and get a feel for what's to come.Is the client still very unfinished? Yes, there are still bugs and lots of things to be improved upon, but those are things that you will always have with clients similar to this one. Like all other beta/alpha games, the client has left much to be desired, but at the same time has given us a chance to have fun and learn. With all of the feedback that will come from this, I feel like Bossa will be able to really improve the mechanics of the game based on what the community feels is necessary. After all, the people that will be playing the game should be the people that have a voice and suggestion as to what things should be added/removed from the game, right?Overall I like that Bossa has given us this opportunity, a learning experience, and I look forward to seeing where things go in the near future.

												I'll admit that this ""game"" isn't for me, but I'm writing this review to get more talented people working on this.This game (sandbox) is a precursor to ""Worlds Adrift"" by having players design islands for players to fight over. The tools are very comprehensive, and some truly amazing sky-islands have already been made. I expect to see some high-quality stuff when the full game comes out.I don't actualy like it, though, do I recommend this sandbox? Well, it's simple: I know that many other people will enjoy this immensely. I prefer my beauty to either require struggle. The most ""beautiful"" game I ever played  was either Call of Juarez: Gunslinger (which can be pretty hard at points) or Subnautica (where the most beautiful parts were either fraught with danger, or very hard to reach in the first place). WA: Island Creator doesn't really do that. The maps are all good, some of them are just better, so I find it hard to enjoy the beauty of the game. There isn't any effort involved on my part. Imagine easting by having foor teleported into your stomach. Would eating still be fun? No, not realy. That's how I see it, at least. If you're the kind of person who went on all the field trips to art museums at school, this might be for you.			"

												Uhm... No. Not in its current state. It needs to be optimized. It needs improvement all around. Tools are clunky, unresponsive or over-responsive. Where is the water? Performance is terrible considering the poor level of detail you can get from this. Graphics are indeed lackluster. For this kind of performance hit, I'd expect to see something decent on my screen. Can't recommend this at the present. To make things worse, these guys are essentially releasing sub-par tools and asking the community to do the heavy lifting. If you want me to do any heavy lifting, you need to give me something worthy of the effort. I've used too many world-builders, terrain generators, and similar tools to find this program remotely acceptable. I want waterfalls pouring off the sides of my island. I want sun-shafts filtering through the trees. I want something more. Too quick to rush something into release. Same problem a lot of devs have it seems these days.			"

												This is a ""Game"" that lets you create content for another game that will be released later and if you're one of the people who's content is selected you'll get to see it in the upcoming game. Okay? Got that? Are you Sure? Because I don't think you do.Modding is one thing. After a game comes out, you'll see people happily plugging away at making mods for games they like. Fine. Dandy. This isn't that.You are literally doing the work of an employee of this company, for free. Get it? You're not playing a game, you're working. This is stuff that normal game developers hire people to do. This whole thing is a farce designed to net the company free content to flesh out another product. This would be the same as Bethesda releasing the modding tools for the next Elder Scrolls game before the game was out, then taking the best mods and incorporating them into the game, then selling that game for profit while you get nothing but a pat on the back for a job well done.Welcome to the new era of game design where you just make the community do the work for you, pay them nothing, then reap all the rewards.♥♥♥♥ you Bossa Studios.

												I mean the game's free and the tools are pretty impressive if you know what you're doing.But why the negative review? Well, other than a heavily rushed 6 min tutorial that doesn't explain much, the game doesn't tell you how to use the tools. Its annoying, but again, you could just google for some answers instead, so no issue. However, this game is incredibly taxing on my PC for some bizarre reason. It's just one island with a few assets, yet I can't get above 5 FPS. I'll admit, my computer isn't the best, but a game like this should be running fine. If there were actual graphics options other than ""turn clouds and anti-aliasing off"", this game would get a positive review. I'm hoping the actual game is better than this.			"

												I had plans to create something truly great, but my efforts bore only rotten fruit. This is nothing more than a glorified asteroid creator. It's extremely simple and offers no tools to build an island, more of a demo really. I was expecting this to be a great game/tool, but after playing this I think I'll pass on the full game now...  "

												--------------------NOT A JOKE REVIEW 100% HONEST--------------------------The game is great, i would just love it, but 2 fps isnt even close to being reasonable, i know theres gonna be idiots in the comments saying ""Oh well its your computer you f*ckin retard!"" Well, i tell you this, i have a custom built PC with some of the best specs you can get, the graphics settings for the game are turned all the way down, my internet is again, some of the fastest you can get, its just plain out the games fault, it doesnt matter how good the game content is, 2 fps average framerate is an instant uninstall. Sorry devs. But make your game playable before you release it on steam. again, without the lag, the game just has so much potential and would be a great experience, but the lag kills it.0/10 i want my $0.00 back.

												After finally getting the game to work, I still do not recommend it and here is why: Terrain Manipulation, the brushes are just awful, I cannot stand them I will never understand how these guys are creating these super smooth perfect islands, I just cannot get the brushes to do ANYTHING I want, it just conforms to this random hidious jagged terrain that still looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥after using the smoothing tool. Another reason why I cannot stand this, there is no smoothing brush, WHY?! the smoothing tool really is kind of poor, I would REALLY like to see a smoothing brush. mass placement in my opinion should just be limited to ONE obj at a time, because if you forget to deselect one single thing and hit the generation button you could end up with a massive amount of unwanted objects suddenly placed.Overall I just do not like the way the brushes work, the texturing tool takes some time to get used to but it is nice. I still however do not and will not recommend this tool.			"

												This game world you can create within is absolutely gorgeous, and this makes me very excited for the actual game release. Given that this creator program is free to try, I say it's absolutely worth your time and worth a look. It can be a lot of fun just to mess around and see what you can come up with. It's all very Project Spark-esque. Also, ignore my in-game time as it isn't an accurate representation of time played. I messed around with this program for quite some time in offline mode.			"

												I have anxiously been waiting for Worlds Adrift to announce a release date for the full game, since I first heard about it months ago.  I was lucky enough to get in on some NA test servers, and after getting a chance to play a version of the full game I have been thirsty for more.  The Island Creator is one of the best ideas I have ever seen a developer release to it's fans.  It's beneficial to the developers in many ways, and it allows people a small taste of the game before it is released.  It's also free, which gives me a good feeling about the developers, and the direction that they are taking for the game, and how they want to interact with fans of the game.That being said the Island Creator is really fun.  It gives you alot of creative tools to work with, and ton's of freedom to use your own creativity.  The developers are also updating it and adding new usefull features all the time.  The other great thing is that Bossa Studios have been activly listening to their fans, and gathering feedback about the Island Creator, and ways to improve it. It amazes me that a development team is so responsive and in touch with it's fan base, that they actually care to hear opinions about a small side project of the full game.  They even have been showcasing some of the Islands on Twitch that they like.I can't wait for the full game to be released, but at least I have something to mess around with until then.  If your thinking about downloading this, just do it.  It's free, and super fun to play around with.  If you have used any 3d modeling suite like Blender, You will understand the controls right off the get go.  It is pretty intuitive, and easy to figure out how everything works.  I have a fairly powerful computer with a 980Ti, so I don't know how well it runs on weaker systems.  It runs very well on my system.Thanks Bossa, I appreciate you releasing this tool to the public.  It is pretty epic.			"

												I've used a lot of bad and great level and terrain editors before and this one falls in the middle. It is fun and has a lot of potential but it's not nearly strong enough in my opinion. One thing it really needs is a terrain smoother. There is one that smoothes the entire map, but there is not a small one you can control. It needs a tool to make tunneling easier as well. Not that you can't do these things, but it takes forever. Again, I'm not saying this is a bad game. But it needs some more time to develop and I look forward to when it does.PROS:Nice music.Good visuals.Fun to play.Easy to learn and use.CONS:Lack of tools and resources.			"

												I gotta say if you're into world building and creating levels and what not, whether it be something simple like Project Spark on xbox or even a game engine, then this is a nice little treat to try out. The aesthetic of the game has a nice simple but pleasing look to it. The assets, things like rocks or trees, are well modeled and easy to work with and the enviroment tools are simple and easy to use for pretty much anyone. The game also has a very nice relaxing background music to it that im liking. Although there are some flaws/tweaks that I would like to see fixed or more refined.Firstly is the UI. While it is easy to get used too, it would be nice to move the object editor to the asset pool options as a way to easily edit whatever you're going use before you put it down.  Secondly is to have some better optimization added. While I was suprised to get this working at the level I did, seeing more options in the settings would be much apprectiated.Thirldy is another settings options pertaining to the controls. Currently there is no option to either rebind your movement keys and as far as im aware there also wasn't even a way to see what keys do what (Please correct me if im wrong on this).And lastly, mostly personal options, but being able to customize your character a bit would be nice, as well as adding some more textures for the terrain, and also maybe particle effects like fire, water, or energy obs and what not.All in all Worlds Adrift is definitly something to try out since it is currenlty free and system requirements are pretty low, so if this might seem to tickle your fancy then give it a download!

												For a free game, its pretty interesting.  Nice graphics, lots of customization, great creative outlet.  Its a relaxing game that just allows you to shape your world.  The controls are a bit confusing to learn, and the player movement seems a little clunky.  Other than that its a great game.			"

												Game looks lovely in other peoples pictures. The 30 minutes I've 'played' so far was actually 30 minutes waiting for the game to load. It was free though, so whatever. I will continue to try to play it and dream about the possibilities later. 7/10 just based on load screen and other people's videos/photos.			"

												lovin it. it is limited ( see edits ) but you can create beautiful unique things here. its one great freaking tool and with time it will get better i hope. right now its everything there to get started , test, and play around yourself and play the game . its troumendous fun and i spent every hour in it with joy. excewpt the firt 1 .. because theres no water ,... and that kinda ruined my island xDedit 1 :please give me the option to use more the 3 layers for the whole map, and the ability or options to ( when i paint textures ) i can set parameters for that specific texture, so when i change the color of the layer or the complexety it wont change the complete texture for the whole map ? because this right now only gives me 3 colors for the whole map which to be honest, limits the creativity bigtime. and for a game based on creativity, this is a total gamebreakeredit 2 : .... complexety limit reached , this limit is pointless with the given features and makes no sence but limits the creation of the island. it makes it impossible to build several isles at once and connect them and build a story around that. ( i actually found piece with it. but still ) gamebreakeredit 3 : need more ruines or exeritor building parts like stone fenses and benches and stuff to creat bigger and more detailed areas like i actually wanted to.. once again, limitaion of objects , or better the limitation of the complexity limit plus the limitation of objects lead to immersion loss and is a gamebreaker. yet still you can create great things ind isles. but less complex and detailed..by the end of the day, this editor is neat, yet completly dull because of all its restrictions and limited recources. if you fix and get rid of all the problems above i actually think this tool can be good because of the detail and '' holly hell that looks amazing '' effect. ( which i can already produce. dont get me wrong.. but you know... complexity limit reached ..hype )			"

												I must admit this is one of the best games i have ever played. The most magnificent is the pack of tools available to express yourself and fullfill your dreams. AND if youre unlucky and the dreams you have made are awful, this wonderful game will help you smooth them, fix them and even offer removing the useless parts. Just wonderful			"

												Amazing! I was really interested in the game, so downloaded this island maker- instantly killed 3 hours without realizing the time.Easy to use, flexible, randomizing options and smooth features that make creation easy, even if you don't set out with an idea. I found the maker itself inspired me. Also just... Yeah spent at least half my time swinging around on the grapple and admiring the game's design. Dang.Can't recommend this enough.			"

												Spent 30 minutes designing my first island, kept it pretty simple and then practiced with the grappling hook. A very well designed physics based swing launched from your hand at a moments notice. It's fantastic. Spent the next 30 minutes on another person's server trying to climb a giant tree, got some big FPS drops from the giant leaves in the wind, still was having a blast. Even made it to the treasure on the top! 10/10 . Super excited for the full release of this game. No rush though! Don't want another No Man's Sky. I strongly recommend people get this and test it all out though. It's fun.			"
