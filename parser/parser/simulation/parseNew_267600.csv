												Airport Simulator might be the most tedious and boring game ever released. Heres what you do in this game:1. Select gate for plane to taxi to.2. Extend tunnel.If its a passenger plane:1. Drive stairs to gate.2. Drive bus to gate.3. Drive luggage wagon to gate.4. Drive interior cleaning to gate.5. Drive exterior cleaning to gate.If its a cargo plane:1. Drive cargo wagon to gate.2. Drive exterior cleaning to gate.Wait 5-10 minutes1. Drive everything back to the garage.Thats literallyy it. Theres no management, there is no way to lose you just get money for every task you do. You start with 8 gates even though youre probably never going to use more than half of them at a time. You can hire ""helpers"" that drive the vehicles for you. The game is over once everything got an ""helper"". The graphics are bad but you cant really expect good graphics from a 15€ game.While playing it I got the feeling that devs were never even close to an airport. On what airport do they use tunnels and stairs/buses on the same plane? On what airport does the luggage go to end of the airport and the passangers to the other? The game is also riddled with bugs. When you save the game all textures and models unload and all you see is the skybox for about 3 minutes. The Tunnels jiggle all the time and get stuck inside the terminal. When i tried to taxi a plane back to the runway the game just crashed.Not only is this game awful it is also falsly advertised: It clearly says in the description that there are ""Many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways"" which there are none. Not a single one. It also says its available in german, french and italian which isnt the case either. Steam finally has to hire someone that plays every game for at least an hour before it is made available on the store.TL;DR Do not under any circumstances buy this game, dont even accept it as a gift.

												The. Worst. Simulator. I. Have. Ever. Played.I work on an airport ramp in real life. I looked at this and though ""This is stupid, why would anyone want to play at my job?"". Then I laughed at the thought that all the pilots and train engineers and Euro Truckers probably feel the same way about their sims. I was making fun of it on facebook, and a friend bought it for me.If someone really does want to play at my job, this isn't it. This is stupid. It's bad. It's horrible. Dr. Horrible.Why would I drive a bag cart (or is it a ♥♥♥♥ed up LD3? (It has angles on two sides, which would make me think ALF container, but it's not nearly wide enough for that, is it? My guess is a stupid bag cart, but they also pull them out of the bellies. Ugh. So bad)) to the Aft Bulk of a plane, but not drive a belt loader?Why is every tug only carrying one dollie?Why am I driving equipment up without a guide person?Why are we using crew stairs on a gate where there's a bridge?None of this makes any sense at all whatsoever. And not even in the good way. I can accept it taking 20 minutes to drive from München to Nürnburg in ETS. I can't accept that driving various pieces of equipment to a plane, one at a time, and sitting there, is a half way decent game.It's terrible. Terrible. Terrible.			"

												Maybe at some point there is more to this game, but for now, it is basically ""Airport Vehicle Simulator"". The best bit of the game is where you get to drive around the truck with the stairs on it, and you can pretend you are in Arrested Development. Otherwise, I have no idea. And I like weird games, but this is just very strange. Going to play it a bit more and see what happens. If I understood the tutorial correctly I believe I have to earn money completing the driving tasks to pay other people to do the driving tasks for me. But the driving is the only thing you do in the game anyway? I guess if you like driving around airport vehices with poor physics and no damage model (that time I bounced off the passenger walkway with a bus full of people going to the terminal was a little scary, but I received no negative feedback), then this is the game for you. Looking forward to seeing a plane land, or something.			"

												I've been on Steam since 2005.  I own over 350 games.  I've never requested a refund before today.This game is unacceptable.  It's not an airport simulator - an airport sim would have you fixing planes, managing gates, planning expansions, handling emergencies, running the de-icer, scheduling logistics for the catering, tracking down lost bags... you know, airport stuff.  Instead, you drive the vehicles from parking spot to parking spot and are rewarded with a view of a bunch of vehicles sitting around a plane.  All that airport stuff?  Carried out in the form of a timer on the objectives list.  Not even so much as an animation, let alone anything interactive.Someone could whip up this game with stock assets in Unity in under a day.  Indeed, they probably did.I'm insulted by this 'game'.  I want a refund, I want the game pulled from the store, and I want an apology from the developers for releasing this pathetic Airport Parking Simulator.			"

												Utter rubbish. Don't waste your money! The game consists of waiting around a lot for things to happen. The things? Driving a few service vehicles aroung from garages to airpot gates and back. Once you have automated all but one task (for some reason loading cargo cannot be automated) you merely sit and watch the same things repeat over and over again. Your involvement is now over. The claim of countless missions is a lie and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves. There is one mission. It just repeats over and over again. Steam should remove this game from the option to buy if they are a responsible retailer. It really is that bad!!!			"

												No.Just, no...    This game is terrible. Sound only works if you adjust it to 2001 standards (so it matches the graphics). It's slow and boring. No way to speed up time.  All you do is drive around in excruciatingly slow airport support vehicles to a predetermined location and move on to the next vehicle. This must be done in a certain amount of time or else you start losing money. If you manage to actually make money, you can use it to ""upgrade"" each service, which simply automates it. So I guess the goal of the game is to upgrade everything to the point that it plays itself...  lame.Graphics and physics are waaay buggy. I flipped a plane trying to taxi it out to the runway and couldn't recover it (see screenshots).			"

Product received for free
												Not worth it. Airport sims are the rare breed, but even with this, there are some more, with so much more content onboard.For one, this game wasn't working out of the box. I had to do tweaking to start it, which is unbearable in case of game made not so long ago.Next, it is not really a full airport sim. The procedure goes like this: some plane is boarding, and then you have to drive manually various service cars to this plane. With the speed of a snail. If you'll manage to drive the cars to the plane on time (it's like 2-3 minutes for a distance like half of kilometer, for each car), you'll get some money. When you'll have enough money, you can buy an ""upgrade"" to you cars. I thought they'll start to run smoother, run faster... no. They just finally hiring some drivers on those upgrade money, so, once you've upgraded all your vehicles, you can just relax and watch the work as a spectacular. And... that't the game! You can't build anything, can't buy anything, you just drive many cars in hope to gather enough to not driving it anymore. Nice, isn't it?More to it, there are no achievements, no nothing except that point of when you don't driving yourself anymore and just watching as bots doing well, riding across the airport and not bumping into each other...As of visuals, the picture is tolerable. Not quite good, but appropriate. What is lower than anyone's expectations, is the engine thing. All the game is about riding slooow cars, right? Well, they're not only slow, but also lame at the driving. They are stumbling on a flat surface, out of any apparent reasons... And lacking some slightest touch of reality. Like, you see the bus, which should be full of passengers, going from the plane to the gate... But it's empty! Too many polygons to count, huh? Well, I've played 8bit Nintendo games, where it was made better.So, the game isn't worth your time - totally. My mark would be 4/10. For it's still better than clickers.			"

												This is a frustratingly uneven game. It starts off painstakingly slow: An aircraft comes in and you, apparently being the only person at the airport with a driver’s license, have to drive various vehicles to and from the plane: a passenger bus, a rolling staircase, a fuel truck, two types of cleaning trucks, a luggage trolley, etc.  It’s very tedious, but eventually multiple planes start arriving and you have to juggle various tasks among them. The plane at gate 5 is fueling now, the plane at gate 6 wants fuel next. A plane that just landed is waiting for a parking spot and you’re trying to push back a plane at gate 3 to make room for it. At this point the game isn’t exactly *fun*, but it’s at least involving. Get those tasks done to get the planes off the ground!But then you earn money and hire help and once you hire enough employees to handle every vehicle at every gate the game becomes nothing more than a slightly interactive screen saver: A plane lands, you assign it a gate and everything is taken care of. You just sit there and wait for it to take off again.There is one maddening exception: The pallet loader for cargo aircraft. You can’t hire anyone to drive this. It’s all you, and it's buggy and annoying. For starters, only one cargo plane can be serviced at a time. If you have 3 cargo planes parked at gates you'll only get loading/unloading instructions for one of them. You can entirely finish loading up the first plane but you won't be able to start loading and unloading the second plane until the first plane is on its way to the runway. It can sometimes take 10-20 minutes between the plane being loaded up and actually pushing back, during which time your pallet loader gathers dust and other cargo planes take up gate space waiting to unload. Additionally if you make the mistake of parking a cargo plane at gate 6, 7 or 8 you need to make ridiculous round trips back and forth across the tarmac between unloading a pallet on the south end, going to a parking spot on the north end, and returning to the cargo area on the south end again to pick the next pallet up (for gates 1-5 the parking spot is thankfully right next door to the cargo area so moving the pallet loader from the cargo area to the parking spot takes about 5 seconds).There are other frustrations too: + Wonky physics that allow you to flip a plane nearly upside down with a nudge from a luggage cart+ Tasks that appear and disappear from your task list+ A non-intuitive interface+ An inability to move vehicles to a gate prior to a plane being assigned to it+ Awkward vehicle/gate rules. An aircraft can't push back until all of the vehicles servicing it have returned to their parking spots. It's not enough to simply clear the gate area. This makes multitasking difficult. For instance, say you're fueling a plane at gate 1 and when finished drive the fuel truck to gate 2 to service that aircraft. Even though the fuel truck is no longer at gate 1, that aircraft won't push back until the fuel truck has actually parked in the fuel truck area. For that small percentage of people who *really* like airports, there are bits and pieces of this game that are slightly interesting, but the bugs & game logic & freakin’ pallet loader make it nearly impossible to recommend.

												Best described as Airport Screensaver, rather than Airport Simulator.It is missing any time controls, which means sitting for long periods of time waiting for the next thing to do, and once a gate is automated, your job simply consists of allocating a plane to the gate, then watching as all the trucks etc do their jobs.

												What seems to be another classic title from UIG - nice idea, poorly thought out, poorly implemented, not finished, a number of bugs impacting gameplay, and value for money is questionable at best.As a complete synopsis/walkthrough basically a plane lands, you allocate it to one of eight gates, and the plane is then serviced by a number of different vehicles.  Initially, you have to do all the driving, but you earn money for completing each vehicle task and receive larger cash injections when planes take off.  As you earn money, you can upgrade each of the vehicle tasks to automate the work three times, the only difference seems to be the speed in which the AI vehicles move.  Once you have upgraded all of the vehicle tasks once, everything is automated except for unloading/loading of cargo from/to cargo planes - which cannot be automated.  Once you have upgraded everything as far as it goes, the game ends, which took me about 18 hours, almost all of it waiting and watching.The description for this product is also misleading - super jumbos, there are none; coordinating air traffic controllers and technical staff, not in the game; organizing perfect catering, nothing beyond driving the vehicle from point A to point B; detailed and comprehensive simulation of events at an international airport, only if you think the only thing that happens is people driving vehicles; many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways, not in the game; and countless missions and tasks the player has to fulfill, only one ""mission"" which happens to be the objective of the game (to upgrade all automation tasks) and then the game ends.Overall the game barely held my attention, and only then because I assumed there must be something more to the game once the gate upgrades were done.  I was wrong, now I want my 18 hours back.  Might be worth it if the price drops to a couple of dollars, otherwise you're just wasting money.			"

Title:  Airport Simulator 2014Genre:  SimulationDeveloper: United Independent Entertainment GmbHPublisher: United Independent Entertainment GmbH Release Date: 19th Dec 2013 Gameplay I immediately decide I don't know what I'm doing. Introduction text is not a great introduction. So. I have 1000 euros and there doesn't seem to be anything I can spend it on. So I search. Oh wait, there's a car. So what next? Do I drive it somewhere? -crashes into fence, then another van- Okay. I still don't know what I'm doing. Plus this car is slow. How about I drive the vehicle to the plane. I want to fly this plane. Never mind it's an AIRPORT simulator which probably means I will never fly one. Okay so let me look at the menu again. I still don't know what I'm doing. Maybe I'll just start over. This time, straight to the car! And this time I'm sticking on the road. So what now? Do I pick up people with this? Where are the people? Oh wait I hear them, they're already in my vehicle. What am I even doing? Help. So where to park. By the plane? Eh. Maybe I can drive a bus. Nope I can't. I don't get it. Help.So yeah, this game makes a lot of sense. And I can run faster than this stupid car. What if I go UNDER the plane. How about that.Aaaaand nope I give up.I think I'll leave this to other people to figure out. Pros...Cons...TL;DROverall VerdictNope. Let me just delete this game a second.Want to read more of my reviews? Click here to join my steam group and Click here to follow my curator page! "

												So I started this game, began to play and fell asleep.My dream was this was a good game ... it isn't.Pro:Several interface languagesIt installs and uninstalls fineI didn't have a problem running this game (wait is that a pro or con)Not the worst simulator out thereCon:It's more of a waiting game than a playing gameIf you get it for free ... it's worth it (almost)If you think this is actually going to be a sim city for airports, it isn't.I'm sorry this game just sucks.  It sucks jet fuel.  It sucks airplane food.  It sucks as bad as being on the tarmac for 12 hours with no AC and a bunch of people who smell so bad that a dog would gag. I'm going to assume UIE actually owned by an auto, train or cruse ship company and want people to stay away from airports.			"

												I bought this game in the sale on a bit of a whim, but even though it was less than £6.00, i'm starting to regret my decision.As the many other reviews will tell you, this game is not exactly cutting edge in terms of graphics or gameplay, but what did you expect for this much!?!Initially I was disappointed with the limited gameplay ""move truck A, to this place, in this time"", ""move truck B, to this place, in this time"" etc, but I stuck with it in the hope it got better as the number of planes you handle ramps up. Again, I was wrong. As you go on, the only way to get by is to automate the airport functions by hiring helpers. At first, they are desperately slow (you have to pay more to make them go faster) which frustrates you into upgrading everything as fast as possible. The problem is, you are effectively upgrading yourself out of the gameplay! There are perhaps 2 functions left that you have to do manually, and that's allocate a gate, and load/unload cargo. The latter is probably one of the more redeeming features of this game, in that the cargo lifter requires a little bit of effort as you have to line it up fairly precisely, and that it has some legitimate animation! If they had extended these features to more of the equipment, so you actually connected and sealed the stairs and the skybridges etc, I might have been inclined to stick around a bit longer.In summary, a bit tedious and a bit limited. Save your money...For the sake of constructive feedback to any of the development team who might see this (unlikely I know):Fix the bugs with the AI - they get close to their goal on some tasks and then just abandon it altogetherGive an option to take over automated tasks - In case of the above, I had no way to step in!Please extend the animations a bit! - Connecting the walkways, and seeing people in the buses can't be that hard to do if you can do containers in and out of a cargo hold!Find some form of expandability for once a player has automated the terminal. - Maybe designing and building a new terminal? Extending the current one? Upgrading equipment? Replacing old equipment with newer kit?!?There was a fair bit of potential for this game but it just fell short of my expectations, even for this price. Deep down inside I hoped it was going to be like 'Air Mogul' with the customisation of the buildings as well as the operation of the equipment, and i'd definitely come back to it if these things were patched in at some point, but for now, I bid you adieu, Airport Simulator 2014...

												You start the game and get into the main menu which looks like a departure and arrivals board at the airport.You select a new or previous game...Starts you out in a little van, a plane lands in the very far distance and the plane couldn't taxi any slower to the gate...Plane parks in the gate and it asks for a fuel truck..You get the fuel truck and park it in the green box and then a timer starts counting down from 18 minutes. (In Realtime....)You get a bus and drive invisible passengers to the airplane... 13 Minute timer starts (Yep.. in Realtime.)You get a baggage cart and bring it to the airplane and wait 23 Minutes (Realtime.......)One of the WORST simulation games you can spend money on, I do not advise you even look at any more reviews... just leave this page once and for all.    ALSO!  I purchased the game and had to go through a huge variety of troubleshooting and compatability and file editing before the game would even run semi-properly..  Take my advice and STAY AWAY!

												If you can't be bothered to read the whole review, then let this one sentance sum it up for you instead: This game is that bad that I begged Steam to remove it from my library so I never had to look at it again. There is quite literally nothing good to say about this game. The idea of an Airport Simulator sounded interesting and as I had acquired this in a Bundle Package I thought I would at least give it a try otherwise it would just sit there in my library collecting dust. No more than 15 minutes into the game, it will now definitely continue to sit there gathering dust forever. Just like some of their other titles, the developers of this game should honestly hang their heads in shame. The game is buggy, there are graphical glitches all over the place and there are absolutely no tutorials on how to control anything you have access to in the game, so you just have to figure it out all by yourself (seriously, what is your problem with tutorials? None of your games that I have played have anything of the sort).Also, the dialogs are blurry and impossible to read for me, I know this isn't the case for everybody, but it seems to be the case no matter what settings I apply in-game. I'm not wasting any more time on this game, so I won't write any more as I am just going to be repeating myself. I knew it wasn't going to be amazing because of all the bad reviews, but this is much worse than I even expected. Long story short: Do not buy this game, not at all, not in a sale and not as a part of a bundle unless you're getting at least one good title out of said bundle. Waste of my time.			"

												It's not bad, but in the same sense it's not good either, it's more novelty value and even at $7 it's most likely too much to pay, let alone paying the full price.The biggest problem is the lack of anything to do, while the first 5 minutes are spent looking around and working out which truck is where  once you get into the game by using the maintenance vehicles it quickly becomes repitative.This problem could be alleviated if you were able to speed up the game, giving it a x2 or x4 option would allow you to get throuogh the boredom of waiting.Finally when you get a few planes landed you are kept reasonably busy moving trucks around to best suit the timers you face, I'm not sure whether its a bug, a glitch or an oversite but despite their being numerous vehicles to drive, once you use a bus for instance you have to use the same bus.What this means is you go to one plane and pick up the passengers which takes about 10 -15 minutes, but when you have another plane to do unload or load you have to use the same bus, you then have to take the bus that is unloading passengers and move it to the second plane so you can stop the timer and then you move the bus back to unload the passengers at the first.This becomes problematic with both the bus and the baggage cart because they are used more frequently than the other types of vehicle, you unload passengers, the drop them off, then reload passengers, then park it in the garage.Other vehicles like the repair truck for instance, you just park let them fix the plane and then park them again.My biggest tip if you buy the game and play it is to save up and get assistants for the bus and baggage handler first, the rest is much easier handled.Once you get a steady stream of assistants the game becomes very boring again, you sit and watch the airport work, doing minimal task like telling the planes where to park and then unloading cargo planes every so often.To give you an example, I have just played the game for 5 hours straight, well not played, I watched the game for 5 hours straight while I read a book, clicking every so often to keep the game flowing.I'm not even a quarter of the way through the first level and if you start a second level with no money and doing the same things it's one of those games that you will delete very very quickly and thats even if you get past the very very boring first parts of the game.So if you have a book to read or a project or homework to do and you want to watch airport go about its business with no input then maybe its worth it, maybe.  If you however want to do something then this isn't that game for you, even if you want to browse the web or play something else while your waiting you can't because when you alt-tab or click outside the windowed version the time stops.The graphics aren't to bad and the gameplay is okay, its not overly buggy besides from some animations and things getting stuck when automated, but....It's very boring, very repetative and quickly loses  its charm.  3/10			"

												Disappointing to say the least. The game advertises itself as a management simulator game even saying in the features ""Many management options and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways"". This is limited to choosing things of a menu without any detail of what your actually doing. The graphics aren't up to scratch which should be expected for a simulator.The ""comprehensive simulation""  refers to all the time you spend driving around airport vehicles (like buses, stairs, etc) in painfully slow vehicles. The game processes at a turtle speed (I gave up after having to wait 20 minutes without a fast forward button with nothing to do).  There was no tutorial or walkthrough built into the game so made it difficult to play and UI wasn't very approachable. Would score this game 1 or 2 out of 10. It is a complete waste of money and details about the game are totally misleading. Feeling slightly robbed because of it!			"

												Had to manually install the PhysX and DirectX it comes with to get it to run....What a terrible game. First plane (I get it, you have to 'learn' takes over forty minutes to get done.You have to drive aprox 10 vehicles to it at 5mph, then sit for 20 minutes, then drive them away.Eventually, you can hire AI to do that for you but you will probably die first.MEANWHILE, your graphics card will be maxing out for lord knows why, you can sit and count the polygons on all the objects in the game.0/10 dont even try.I did just to give it its due dilligence before I threw it into the scrap bin.

												The goal of the game makes this a brilliant game. Why? Well is's simple. You start out as the only worker on the airport. So things takes time. Then the more you work, the more credits you earn. Credits have only one use. To hire workers to do the different jobs for you faster so you don't have to. So in the end, you can have the AI do all the work for you so you don't have to play the game anymore at all. So the game plays itself in the end. So you can do more productive stuff like watching paint dry.And the best part is. When you save the game, the game crashes since Direct X got a tumor watching it play.10/10 would uninstall again.

												This is another UIG simulator and I'm fairly certain that it's the best one of theirs that I've ever played. It's shockingly more competent than that agricultural simulator I played the other day. You basically just drive vehicles from one place to another on the tarmac and somewhat simulate the process of what happens during a plane's landing/takeoff prep. There's even a bit of time management going on once you start having multiple aircraft land at the same time. You get money for just about everything you do which goes toward automating the process at other gates. It's almost a game, dudes. I swear.The thing falls apart pretty quickly though when you realize that absolutely all you'll ever be doing is driving really slow vehicles back and forth and I personally lost interest when I was supposed to get my first jet back on the runway because they give you a vehicle that lets you push the jet around? I think that's what it's for, but it was more interesting to come at it from the side and make the entire thing clip into the ground. No screens again because they're terrified of the steam overlay or maybe just too dumb to make it work with their trash software, but there was some SERIOUS wackiness going on, I guarantee you. On top of that, the game seems to think that literally making you wait for upwards of ten minutes in real time for a task to complete is compelling gameplay or an accurate simulation.But not really, because it's a ♥♥♥♥in bargain bin airport simulator that looks like it came straight out of 1998. If it needs to be said, you're not paying attention, but in spite of the fact that this wasn't physically painful to play this is not a good game and you should not buy it under any circumstance.

												Before I start this review I'd like to say I have completed a planes' ""Needs""?..Now, I am a fan of simulation games, I enjoy seeing how different jobs and experiences work, However, Whilst playing this I got nothing out of it. I booted up the game and the menu looked quite promising, but as soon as I clicked the lovely Start I realised this was another awful simulator! All this game consists of is Drive this vehicle to the plane, Wait, Drive a different vehicle to the plane, wait... Return the vehicles to the garage. If you were bored out of your mind reading that, you won't like this game as that bit of text is more enjoyable.If you're a fan of driving vehicles somewhere, watching a parked vehicle do litterally NOTHING for 15 minutes then repeating that process for nail biting fun for hours upon end, I recommend this God-awful title to you! :)			"

												Not worth playing. Bugs left, right and center. I would not recommend this game at all. All you do is drive a small selection of extremely slow viechles to certain places at each airport (which aren't easy to find at first). Aircraft models are alright but buggy. They taxi in very inconvential directions to get to gates and the runway. The developer seems to have missed the research part of development stages in this game. They haven't a clue what goes on at airport from playing this. For it's release date, the graphics are extremely poor. I cannot see myself ever getting the sequel to this game. Glad I only paid a 0.69 pence for this!			"

												I played this game for about an hour. I wanted to give it a fair chance. I love planes, flying and was excited at the chance of running the other machines/vehicles that take care of a plane before and after a flight. But I was disappointed to see the mechanics were buggy and not polished. There is no time acceleration so you often have to wait a good 5 minutes before continuing gameplay. The vehicles goals are very---go from A to B. No mini-game concept as in when the vehicle gets closer, fit the fuel line into the plane's fuel cap. That would have been more fun.This game was a miss for me.			"

												Terrible game. Basically, all you get to do is drive around various airport vehicles (stairs, buses, luggage carts...) and assign planes to gates. However, it doesn't really matter which gate you assign a plane to, and there's not much you can do wrong with driving the vehicles around. The ""management"" part of the game has you paying money for upgrades of the various vehicles, where the first upgrade automates a vehicle (you no longer need to drive it yourself, but you also can't take control if you want to), and subsequent upgrades speed up those vehicles.Automated vehicles are slower than manually driven vehicles (which are also pretty slow), so you might think you'd cleverly automate only some vehicles or some gates or what have you and do the rest by hand. However, as soon as you're using more than one gate, you run into a problem with manually driving the vehicles: you only get one of each type. So if you need, say, a passenger bus on gate two while it's already loading or unloading passengers on gate one, you're out of luck. But as you have a time limit for getting any vehicle in place, you'll probably end up driving the bus from plane one to plane two, then back so that unloading can continue - once an activity is started, there is no deadline, but they only continue if the vehicle is present. Except stairs. You can remove stairs and the passengers will continue loading from the bus into the plane.The strangest part about this ""game"" is that the aim of it is to make yourself mostly useless, as you're supposed to get all gates fully automated at upgrade level three. Obviously, just watching the game take care of the planes for ten to fifteen minutes at a time before you get to assign a plane to a gate (one click), then watch again, isn't really that much fun. Apparently even the developers realised this, so they gave us cargo planes. Unloading and loading cargo planes is the one thing you can't automate, so you have to drive the cargo lift yourself. It's a shame though that the game is only capable of keeping track of the loading state of one cargo plane at a time - if you have more than one cargo plane at a gate, the second (and third etc.) planes will have to wait until the first one leaves.The only thing you can do ""wrong"" in the game is be too slow getting a vehicle in place, which will result in money being subtracted from your account - one Euro per second until you get it done. Actually managing to be that slow is almost impossible though. One might think that as the frequency of landing planes increases, a penalty for not getting rid of planes fast enough will occur - not so. They will simply queue up on the taxiway until it is full if you don't assign them to a gate, and once it is full planes will stop landing.All in all, the only thing this ""Simulator"" simulates is a horrible attempt at making a game, but it simulates that very well.

												Hey you, yeah you, do you like watching paint dry or grass grow? Then do I have the game for you. Airport Simulator is a game where almost nothing happens in its entirety and I really mean that. This game is so slow that you can grow a beard that is 2 feet long before you complete the first challenge. I mean what else is there to say its so BORING! I have done household chores that are more fun than this game FOR REAL! Another thing is that they are charging $10 for this abomination of what they call a game. Honestly your better off just giving that money to a homeless person because they will be able to find more enjoyment with it. Then there is the sound, dear ♥♥♥♥ing god what were the programers thinking. When you start up the game it sounds like a smoke detecor went off in your house it just drives me crazy. I honestly can't think of anything positive to say about this game and most games that I end up getting that are bad I have at least one positive to them, but not this one. So why did I buy this then? Well have you ever looked for the worst possible game to play just becasue it is bad? I thought that I would get this game because it is literly the worst rated game on steam, its true just how many games are there on steam that have a overwhelmingly negative overall user score  almost none. So I bought it expecting that it would be a good laugh, but enjoyable for being so bad like the Tommy Wiseau's The Room is, instead I was crying and wishing that I had never spent my money on this garbage. I bought this before the steam refund ever existed so I was basically stuck with this thing. Overall don't buy this garbage of a game even if it is on sale you will just waste your money and if you think that it would be funny to send to a friend as a gag gift you would be a terrible person because it will basically give them cancer. There are SO many better games that you can get for $10 and even less. Don't infect your hard drive with this disease and I honestly hope that this trend in all these fake simulator games will just die and fade away because they fill up steam promising fantastic experiance, but instead they just♥♥♥♥♥♥your wallet and waste your time.

												This game is exactly what it looks like. Very cut and dry simulation. The UI in the game is clumsy at best, and is easily bogged down. There is very little instruction on what exactly needs to be done, and the ""goals"" in the game aren't explicitly clear. They also don't follow a linear progression of difficulty, because the first goal I recieved took a very long time to achieve, but the second was done within ten minutes. It is also not clear in any facet, how you are accumulating money. You just see random influxes of cash when certain tasks are completed, and other times when there is nothing to be done. Also, as much as I appreciate the fact that the larger automobiles in the game drive a lot clumsier than the smaller ones, it is totally unnecessary because the game is programmed that each vehicle has the same predetermined speed based on your skill with that task, and that only applies when you have a gate guy driving. On the whole, I find this game needs some work, and there needs to be more things to simulate. Like actually running the airport, inviting businesses in and take up real estate to pay you rent, getting other airlines into your airport, managing your monthly expenses, gas, fuel, workers salaries, etc...If it combined the data/financial savvy of a game like SimCity, with the easy playability of Airline Tycoon, and added some additional features like growth and expansion from a small airport to an International one, then this game would be golden.As it stands, I do not recommend this game.

												Honestly. I never post reviews when I should but if this review helps just one person save there money then I hope I accomplish that.Okay at first, I am a big fan of simulation games, and upon seeing this game released on sale I decided t give it a try. Upon opening it, I was brought to the main menu game was running smooth at this point no problems. I clicked on new game, and was brought to a cheap tutorial screen that did not explain anything outside of the fact ill win when i accumlate enough money to hire 3 star assisants. I was left to my own will to figure it out, so i decided i would give it a go. The world loaded, graphics are mediocre at best, I have seen worse. The first plane landed I was ready to go, I had to pick a gate for the plane to park in, I picked gate #7. The plane eventually made its way over to the gate and parked. A task list then popped up, this is where it takes a turn for the worst. My first task was to drive the gate tunnel to the plane. The controls for this are horrible and theres no explanation for it at all. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to line the tunnell up with the plane. Ok got that done, my next task was to drive the stairs over. I switched to the stairs, which were all the way on the other side of the airport. I started to drive over to the plane, in the slow slow vehicle. obviously i dont expect ferarri type speeds but it took me at least 3 minutes to get it over there. At this point im thinking okay, i hope it gets more interesting. Nope, my next task is to drive the bus over. Again its half way across the map. I drive it over park it. My next task is guess what? Drive the  mechanic van over. I did it.. My next task was? You guessed it.. I had to drive the luggage truck over.. With horrible vehicle controls on it, i made it over after almost flipping the vehicle about 19 times.. I was hoping i was done.. Nope, my next task? Drive the cleaning van over. I drove it over..My next task youll never guess. Nope not driving, It was waiting! I watched a timer count down from 8 minutes to 0 minutes to do guess what, Drive the bus over to the terminal. After doing that, guess what? I had to drive the stairs back, then the gate, then the luggage truck, then the mechanics truck and then finally i drove the cleaning van back.So long story short, if your looking for a annoying horrible physics less than ideal driving simulator that does not explain anything about game mechanincs then buy this. If your looking for an airport simulator look elsewhere.Pros: Sort of cheap price with the saleCons:BoringNo explanations of game mechanicsMediocre graphicsHorrible music something like elevator music.

												Well, Airport Simulator 2014, they sure broke the mould when they made this game! The game itself, it starts off slow, VERY slow, and then once you start generating little bits of cash and start to upgrade your gates, it starts to get slightly more entertaining! Then, if you're like me, and you upgrade all of your gates, once you upgrade every gate to level 1, there's nothing to do, besides escort cargo for a cargo plane! I told myself everyday, 'Don't worry Josh, ride the wave, you'll do it and finish the game tonight'... I said that for 4 consecutive days... 4 FUDGING DAYS!!! But, i did it... I got the confirmation message, telling me that i'd completed the game and couldn't upgrade my gates any longer and saved myself from dropping into the deep hole of pure insanity!! Never been so happy! I'd recommend it, IF the player had time, and patience, and time... And patience! 4/10			"

												Utterly false advertisement.This game describes itself as an airport management simulator. Back in the day, I played Airport Inc/Tycoon - a game where you built your own terminals and areas within them, runways, and competed for aircraft contracts etc etc. From the description, I could only assume that this game was like that, but with modern graphics and (hopefully) better gameplay.How wrong I was. This game is mediocre on every level compared to the 14 year old game I previously played - and that wasn't brilliant.How anyone can develop a game and think it will be fun to drive poorly animated, poorly controlled airport vehicles to and from a plane at incredibly slow speeds is something I have yet to figure out.I have played 41 minutes of this game and hoped I was missing something. Perhaps after I had done all this to one plane, I would be able to move on with the 'detailed and comprehensive simulation' - no! Another plane arrives and repeat, you must...Please save yourself the money and don't buy this game. I now need to try to get my money back for flagrant false advertisement.Simply - dreadful, miserable experience. Playing 'Five Finger Fillet' whilst drunk, with my own hand and a real knife would be more enjoyable than this tragedy of a game!			"

												Beyond ferrying horridly simulated cars back and forth from every landed jet (which is all that every happens) there is literally nothing to do in this game. There is no risk, nothing to lose, no way to go wrong, all you do is drive trucks to a landed aeroplane and for this you get a little bit of money. This money can be spent on upgrading the trucks, which basically only speeds up the tremendusly tedious task of driving back and forth.It's not worth money. Hell, they should pay us for playing it!

												Do you like airports? Do you like simulations? Well uhh.. Look elsewhere. This game is so buggy it makes me wonder if the developers played more than ten minutes of it. The two biggest faults are that vehicles get stuck all over the place -- even when the game's AI is supposed to be handling them -- and there's no fast-forward button. Some tasks take 9 minutes to complete. That's 9 minutes in REAL TIME that you literally have to sit there and wait. The game leaves a LOT to be desired, and it's a shame, because the overall design/layout for the various tasks and stuff is not entirely awful. With some major overhauls this game could actually be worth it.That being said, I completed the game to the best of my ability, unlocked all the upgrades for all the gates (took me a solid 24 hours) and even after having everything automated the computer still managed to get vehicles stuck. I've encountered all kinds of wacky, silly bugs in this game, a few of which make the game unplayable and require you to load a save you made before encountering the bug.I'd love to see this game updated and fixed, but until then, don't even consider spending money on this terrible, terrible game.

Honestly, after the first hour, it was a sad reaity that all one would do the for majority of the time was sit and stare at a screen and click a few buttons every few minutes.This game should be rated ""P"" for PATHETIC. It feels drastically un-finished, the game physics are poor (and have been demonstrated by numerous others who have played this game). I'm sure whatever money that the Developers have made from this game, they wouldn't be able to take into a Brothel and organise a root.

												The maximum price I would pay for this game is $0.99. Almost everything people have already said, I can agree with. With one exception. I actually did enjoy the game for the first hour or two. The challenge behind making enough money to automate things was great. However, that quickly dies once you find that you have two major steps in playing the game. 1. You work your butt off driving things and trying your hardest to get planes out on time.2. Once step one is nearly complete and a number of automation is set up you drive around in a vehicle watching things go. Even then your ground crew isnt the most efficient because they will take much longer to drive to places than you. Sitting back and watching a painfully slow airport sim (which you have no control over other than driving vehicles) is crap. You may not realize it at first but when it dawns on you the game gets put into the ""junk"" category in steam.-----------------------------""Many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways"" -This is so bs. You purchase more gates at the terminal. Extension of runways...no. Never happens. Nope. no.-----------------------------""Countless missions and tasks that the player has to fulfill in order to guarantee a successful airport""-One mission. Drive. Drive something different...but drive. Drive from the car park. Drive to the plane. Drive into the red box. Drive your vehicle back. Repeat with a different vehicle. This is the game step by step. Where are the missions? Countless tasks? No...-----------------------------"" coordinating air traffic controllers and technical staff""-Game tells you what to do, what order (forced to do things in this order), and when to do it (once again forced to do it at a certain time and in a certain order.)

												Enjoyed the game for a few hours.I like simulators and some are good... this one was only good up until I finished one passenger plane and one cargo plane. After getting the assistants it became a game of waiting to assign a plane a gate after arrival, and with only eight gates and a long turn around (never timed it... ~30mins??) it's not much you can do.Can only control one of each type of vechile at any given time, so if you're servicing multiple aircraft on your own, it becomes difficult to service them all without losing time/money.I've been waiting for a good airport sim of some sort for a long time...this is not it...this is far from it......I'm just glad I only spent like 50 cents on it...

												DO NOT BUY!  This is NOT an ""Airport Simulator"", it is at BEST an ""Airport Support Vehicle Simulator"".  The entire game consists of driving (very, very slowly) various utility vehicles between airport gates.  The whole ""point"" of the ""game"" is to earn enough cash to buy AI drivers to take the punishment of ""playing"" this sim instead of you.You might think an ""Airport Simulator"" would involve scheduling flights, or building/upgrading facilities, or even just managing staffing levels to ensure smooth operation.  No, no, and no again -- not with this title.But hey, if you've always dreamed of driving a baggage cart from the garage to the airplane and back, knock yourself out.  :-)			"

												Quite possibly the worst game I've ever played. Consists entirely - and I mean entirely - of driving ground vehicles from their parking spots to the airplanes and back (or, if you've upgraded them so that they're controlled by an AI with less intelligence than your average toddler) watching ground vehicles go from their parking spots and to the airplanes and back. If, like me, you're compulsive about these things, though, you'll want to finish it anyway.

												this game ...jeez, this is the video game version of watching paint dry. now the game wouldnt be that bad if the games pace steped up but nothing happens. i played the game for 45 minutes and i was still waiting for all the tasks to complete on the first plane that arrives when i booted it up. the game uses a real time system so when you have to say load the passengers it will say 12 minutes. that is 12 minutes of waiting and doing nothing, sure you can get into a van and look around the airport but ...thats it. thats all there is, make sure all the tasks are done then wait for the task to complete and then nothing then repeat. i feel this game could of been good if the overall speed was improved and mabey some animation of luggage or passengers coming in and out of the plans. dont get this game. i paid £1.99 and feel it was a complete waste, i would have rather got a coffee from my local store and enjoyed that.

												Half the game is driving several vehicles from one end of the airport to the other very slowly, one at a time. The other half is imagining that the vehicles are actually doing anything after you park them next to the plane. Also very glitchy, after an hour I finally got to the point where I was supposed to taxi the plane to the runway and it got flipped over and fell through the map.Supposedly you can eventually hire staff to start driving vehicles for you, but after over an hour and driving ~10 vehicles back and forth I was able to afford 1 staff member, out of ~80 possible staff members. Not to mention staff can be upgraded to level 3, so 1 of ~240 in an hour.			"

When time arrive to get back to garage, the computer was unable to move the truck.  I activated the Reload action, that reset the action (for a cost of 2.500 Euro.  But the ladder struck got stuck at the same position.  Done it once more with the same result.  Had to bring another vehicule to put it in front of the place so the ladder truck would be unable to get close to the plane, and it worked.

												I want to start off by saying that I enjoy most simulator games and i have beaten the campaign on airport simulator 2014. This game took 20 hours to beat and was as boring as watching a box of rocks, I was only able to overcome the shear pain of playing by filling out paperwork (Work Related) or by actually playing another game (handheld/phone) while this one was running. When you first start off in the game you have to do all the work yourself, which is just driving vehicles to and from the planes in a timely fashion, and the idea is that you will make money and hire workers so you dont have too do the tasks. In the end you will have a task that you must complete on average every 15min, the rest of the time the airport runs itself. I do not see how this game can ever be enjoyable to anyone! UIG (creators/publisher/whatever) needs to be taken off of Steam, there games are simply crap, and should never had made it past steam's quality control. I got this game in a game bundle and have no regrets on my purchase, however had i bought this game solely looking for enjoyment i would be VERY upset. I hope this helps to stop such an occurance happening to someone else.			"

So don't bother buying this game is worsless. I've played it until the end to see if it would give me a large airport, new tasks, or other things to do but no. it's only a game were you do every time the same thing again and again until it is fully automated.

												NOT A SIMULATION GAME!!!!!Honestly dont even know what to call this... literally you just drive vehicles to the planes... then sit and watch. No upgrading buildings, hiring personel, managing airline contracts. You just drive, sit.. and watch. The point being this game is a joke and im so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I excitedly spent 14.99 instead of reading the reviews first...			"

												There are no management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways. This is a clear lie in the game's decription.The game also has tremendous bugs, and it seems that the company has no ambition to fix them. The game is completed with less than 24 hours of playing. Do NOT buy this game!			"

												Lot of potential but does not deliver.  Lot of bugs, gates corridor move into impossible position, vehicule get stuck, even those controlled by the computer. No time forward feature to cover the downtime cause the game run in real time.  I had an issue in wich the ladder vehicule controlled by computer got wrongly position at the airplane and got on 2 wheels.  When time arrive to get back to garage, the computer was unable to move the truck.  I activated the Reload action, that reset the action (for a cost of 2.500 Euro.  But the ladder struck got stuck at the same position.  Done it once more with the same result.  Had to bring another vehicule to put it in front of the place so the ladder truck would be unable to get close to the plane, and it worked.  I have contacted support for the game, and they never even answer me back.  Do not spend your hard earned money on this game.			"

												I played this game several years ago. After seeing it for sale and titled Airport Simulator 2014I thought it must have been updated and a few of the bugs removed.Same old bugs with the gates. They move randomly and get stuck. It’s a joke to call this a 2014 edition when it’s the same as beforeGates need to be fixed. Gates G3A, G4A and G5A need to be made static they are not used ingame. Graphics update would be good because the render is so slow like the game.Aircraft become static and will not move from the gate. Buy something else guys ""A Refund would be nice""			"

												Trust me, my friend bought me this game as a dare..... He said ""If you can play 4 hours of this, i'll buy you besiege."" The game was so boring as there is no fast forward button.... you legit have to wait for the tasks to be done for example. You have to drive the fuel truck to the parked plane, wait half an hour (real time) for the plane to finish refueling then drive to the other side (at a max of 10 kmph (5ish mph) to put the truck away, then you have to get another truck with a slower speed and take that to the plane, wait another half hour.... ♥♥♥♥ this game seriously... Worth it for the bet, not worth it for fun. Seriously. 10/10 would rather watch paint dry for 4 hours.			"

												Have you ever said to yourself, ""Man, I want to see just how the behind-the-scenes at an airport works?""  Well then you're in luck, hours of endless work are now available at the low low price of $10.  Seriously, this is a true simulation, this is not a game by any means.  You will not be speedrunning this game, you will not be looking for ways to accomplish the tasks faster, because you can't, the game works on very long timers and no matter what, you can't rush the next objective.I played for a very brief span of time, and from what I saw, it's the most hands off approach to the maintenance teams at an airport.  Park the plane in a docking bay, now the work task list shows up, click on a task, click drive, get your vehicle to the arrow on the ground, then move on to the next task.  Extend the tunnel, drive the maintenance stairwell, repair the tunnel, repair the workshop (??), unload the luggage, etc.  It's the most boring monotonous list of things to do, and serves as little more than an education tool than an actual game or simulator.So I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you're looking to educate someone who glamorizes airports (who does that?).

HOLY HELL steam/valve how do you let something of this low quality be sold on steam? Literally next to no instructions, drive up to a plan with multiple vehicles that do various tasks (all but ONE you actually help in) and SIT and watch a timer tick down in REAL TIME... not anything you can speed up you literally watch seconds fall off the clock until the next task. This isn't a game and isn't a ""simulator"" it's a piece of trash that somehow magicially has a 15$ price tag... honestly anyone tricked into buying this should sue the game company (if they still exist) and then track down the devs and feed them their own waste biproducts for a week.

												This is the worst game ever… Not even good for simulation games standards, not even fun as a joke game. All you do is wait for a plain to show up then send a vehicle on a 5 minute voyage across the entire airport. Then you send another vehicle on another 5 minute voyage. And then another, and another… Thats all you do, just put vehicles next to the plain in the general area the game tells you to. The most fun thing to do in this game is to just ram the cars into the plains that are landing, and even that’s boring because the cars move at a snails past.I would only recommend this game to Canadians that have American friends that they hate, and are looking to give them a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gift… *grumble grumble…*			"

												This is barely a game... it's an airport simulator in only the most rudimentary technical sense.There's little to no gameplay - you make very simple decisions in the control tower or you can use a little van to ""drive around"" the airport.  In no way do you control the layout of the airport or budget - it's not a ""tycoon"" game.   It's someone's 3D model of an airport with planes that land and take off, and all you really do is watch them do it. Some people may enjoy this... but most people probably expected a lot more.  The second reason this ""game"" should be avoided - technical reasons.  There's no 1080p or higher support (for a 2014 game!).   The game will run at 1050p... but it's just 720p upscaled to 1050!  Jaggies everywhere!  Console players may enjoy this kind of treatment but PC gamers don't.  Textures are low res, but you can't change the graphics fidelity much anyway, the options are too basic.I picked this up in a bundle in one of my crazed bundle buying sprees, so have only myself to blame.

												Airport Simulator 2014 is a mixed bag as far as simulators go. I'll give you the negative points first; The video settings, no matter what aspect ratio and/or resolution I set the game to I could not for the life of me get it to show me the full game screen in fullscreen mode. Instead, I was forced to play in windowed mode, which was irritating. The game crashed a total of 3 times in the span on 4 hours. The fixed view from the control tower has blind spots due to where it is located, and if you preselect units which are almost completed with their tasks, you run the risk of the game bugging out and being made to sit and wait a long, long time before the next objective becomes available. I should also mention there is no tutorial, you are thrown in head first to figure it out as you go.Sounds like a lot of negative right? It is, but this game for some weird reason was also very addictive. Once I got over the initial shock of not having a tutorial, I got into a nice rhythm and within about 4 or 5 hours I had upgraded all 8 gates at least once and was working on the second level upgrades. My airport was essentially running itself by that point. I had a lot of fun with it and while it does have it's negative drawbacks, it can still be a lot of fun to play. I would recommend this game to someone, only after they have reviewed each of the negative points I made and went into this game cognizant of what to expect.			"

												Airport Simulator,Isn't a game for every one, but it's ideal if you want to play something easy with your small kids. They can try to drive the different vehicles to the designated spots. (Which is basically the only thing you do in this game)As such it's a nice game.If you're looking for a more fast paced or micro management game, than this is not really it, because it's rather casual.

												This game really isnt a simulator. A simulator would likely allow you to get inside the vehicles you drive, or even go inside the buildings. This dosent do much. Certain aspects are broken. Like taking the plane taxi and moving the plane in place for takeoff. On my first try I flipped the plane several times. In order to move the plane you have to ram the wheels. Yes ram a airplane full of passengers which can cause a flip. If it was real life there would be no survivors. Another thing is when you first get in its very confusing and you get lost in certain aspects pretty quick. A simulator is expected to be like the real world. This dosent even come close. You technically dont hire people at all. You make upgrades which actually are helpers which actually do all the driving for you. Once you get to a certain point, the game literally plays itself. You dont have to do anything except tell the planes what gate to go. What would make a airplane simulator fun would allow you to build buildings, put in shops and organize how your main buildings process new custormers, buy airplanes, hire employees for various jobs, and even design your airstrips. This game has none of that and cannot be recommended. Out of 5 I give this game a 1.5.  It earned a .5 for not being 100% broken.			"

												Though somewhat outdated (even at the moment it was launched) I must admit it is strangely addictive. Maybe it is because of the mindless tasks you need to fullfill or the soothing music, but one of the game producers is called Insomnia, which should give some hint to how much it will demand from the gamer.The graphics are rather good and the music is excellent, though very repetative since it's only 1 or 2 tracks. You are in charge of the loading, unloading, fueling, repairing and pushing back airplanes at an airport. This is easier than it sounds, since all you have to do is drive vehicles to their marked parking spots next to the airplane, at their (un)loading docks or garage. With the exception of the cargo loader for cargo planes and the taxi used to push an airplane from the gate to the taxi strip, the occasional upgrading of vehicles so that not you but an NPC gets to those jobs and assigning a recently landed aircraft to a gate there really isn't all that much you can do.I found it addictive though, and with a little program called Voice Attack I don't even have to touch my mouse / keyboard unless I assigned an airplane to a gate which has no NPC's. Ow yes, almost forgot, the cargo loader for cargo airplanes cannot be automated, so at least you can do that manually.It still has a lot of potential and a future version 2015 or 2016 I wouldn't mind playing. I recommend this only because I have fallen slave to it, but I think most people would rather play something where you actually have to DO something.			"

Apparently a lot of people hate it; I can't understand why.There are flaws, of course. The airport desperately needs a minimap, the speeds are atrociously slow, and pathing can be dodgy. But it remains nevertheless a pleasant game to kill a few hours with.			"

												THIS GAME IS... surprisingly goodI played alot of the simulators also made by this company and, I must say, this is the best one that I have tried so far.I am still fairly early in the game, so I have to do a lot of tasks manually, as opposed to letting employees do all the work, but the manual tasks aren't nearly as infuriating as in the other simulator games. The mechanics are good and, while some vehicles are difficult to get used to, the game really isn't too hard. Pro Tip: save up to get two upgrades at a time so you don't have a really slow level 1 worker doing a drive that should take 2 minutes in 9 minutes. Also, try to get upgrades for the taxi ASAP as it is the hardest to control out of all of the vehicles.Pro Tip 2: Ovewhelmed by all the work you have to do? Simply drive a vehicle that is required by 2 or more airplanes to the respective spots on the plane (so that they start doing work on them) then drive the vehicle away. The game will say that the work will occur for a period of time, but the timer will never run down. NOTE: does not apply to taxing or putting vehicles back in garage.P.S. Ignore the haters, this game is ok and pretty tense; Especially if you (accidentaly) wait for too long.			"

 General idea / purpose  It's not as bad as most made it out to be. It's actually quite fun and educational if you take the time to read the infos on why you drive the vehicles around the airport. To be fair, this is a simulation of airport operations not driving experience so it's to be expected that vehicle handling is only an approximation. That said, vehicle handling is quite distinct between vehicle types. The cute baggage transporter is a little skittish compared to its bigger sibling the cargo transporter for example and this is compounded with the fact that it uses a swivel junction point. OK enough about vehicle handling as this is not a driving simulator but suffice to say the overall handling is quite pleasant and the zoomable rotational camera makes it easy to look around to see where you need to go. Specific implementation	 As the name imply, this game depicts quite well the scope of ground operations needed to support aircraft servicing requirements. Having said that, the representation of airport operations are somewhat simplified ; not that i know anything about it in real life. Simplification is both good and bad. IMO this level of simulation could be called basic to intermediate.Example Basic model You drive the refuelling vehicle from parking bay to aircraft. Refuelling is fully automated. You drive the vehicle back to the bay on completion of refuelling. Detail model You manually start & stop the refuelling operation waiting for the tank to fill-up. Close valves and drive the vehicle back to parking bay. Tanker needs to refuel ballast from either ground storage or wait for scheduled fuel suppliers to replenish fuel stocks.The same goes for other operations like transporting catering supplies to & from aircraft. No provision is made for stock resupply or cost. Especially cost. Nowhere in this simulator is cost a concern. You crash a vehicle, no repair cost, you tip a plane no penalty or fine. Like i said this is both good and bad. To fully simulate airport operations in fine detail would probably need a 6 core, 12 threads CPU with 32 GB RAM at least. Summation - Unfinshed Business Back to what is at hand. There is no human traffic anywhere within the boundary of operations save the drivers. Passengers embarking and disembarking are not shown for example but this is alright unless the game simulate congestion or delays. In a nutshell Airport Simulator 2014 only focuses on ancillary vehicle operations in relation to aircraft needs. No other aspects of airport management are simulated like operational costs, resource cost, commercial income, stocks resupply schedule and other staffing requirements besides ground handling crew. I've not put sufficient hours into this game to comment on execution bugs if any but 2 things clearly indicate lack of completion. One is the lack of graphic customizations; you're only given 5 levels of general settings, 5 being the highest. Two is the inability to pull the aircraft across the tarmac using the taxi / towing behemoth; not sure if this is the case in real life but i would expect at least a coupling and de-coupling function before & after taxiing manoeuvres. But this is minor, it should be possible to complete the game if savegames can be backed-up. Final score  7/10 Reminiscent of Transport Tycoon			"

												Had potential. But there is no ingame tutorial, no in-game instructions. The help files are somewhat helpful as instructions, but not very thorough. Part of problem is finding your goals. Spots with arrows to you goals are in the ""world"" but not a compass in HUD i so it can be quite hard to find your goal. I gave up after an hour when I could not find the goal to transport my passengers that I unloaded from a plane to a bus. Even after zooming out as far as I could and using the tower view, I could not see it. THen in frustration I drove the bus on the runway to see what would happen when I got in front of a plane taxiing. The plane kept going, bounced my bus into an underground ""glitch"" and the bus fell into a twighlight zone hundreds of feet under the runway.  Seems like the goal is to drive various vehicles ()luggage, cleaning, maintenence< etc) to their goals and the game progresses from there.			"

												The problem with those who do not like this game is they did not know what the game was about.  I believe they thought it was a flight simulator.  IT IS NOT...  It is an Airport simulator.  You have to manage an airport.  There is no flying involved in managing an airport, but there is a lot of running around.  Airport Simulator is a lot like The Sims.  If you don't like The Sims, you won't like Airport Simulator.  Maybe if you look at airport simulator for what it is, you might enjoy it more.  It is entertaining to solve the puzzles, while all the time trying to keep up with the traffic in and out of your airport.  But I can understand those not liking the game because they just do not like the tedious tasks involved with running an airport.  You probably find it boring while I consider it a challenge.  Oh. yes,, I do like The Sims too. :) :)   I own them all and am waiting for Sims 4..			"

												There's something very relaxing about driving maintenance vehicles to the airplanes and returning them to the garage. My shift began at 10 A.M, and the airport seemed to be a ghost town. It didn't take long before the first plane landed. The luggage collector's speed was limited at 20 km/h, and I soon found out that all of my vehicles were. The previous maintenance crew must've had it's reasons and after a while, I didn't mind it all. I decided to declare the airport ""Valium International Airport"", turned on some yacht rock and drove away into the sun, towards gate 3. Many days later, I invented robots and the airport was under the control of an A.I. hive. And me? I watched from the control tower, smoked cigarettes and drank coffee. Endgame			"

												While this game has overwhelming negative reviews, I really enjoy playing it! I have a lot of simulator games and I like this game because for me, it is relaxing, but it also poses some challenges. The airport vehicles you are managing in the game do move slow, but once you have been through all of the tasks at least once, the game becomes a breeze because you are not constantly searching for the correct spot to park your vehicle.The only complaint I really have about the game involves the cargo lifter task. The instructions for this task are not clear and as a result, I am unable to complete the task, thus I keep losing money.Nonetheless, I find this game fun to play!			"

												I managed a whole 3 minutes on this game, that consisted of;-     change settings to ""playable mode""-     open help menu which turns out to be unreadable, being about 2 pixels per letter-     drive a van about 4 meters, before loosing controll over the van (still couldnt see behind the giant help menu)10/10 IGNFor god sake... you have to play the game for 5 minutes before being able to post a review... ill be back in just 2 minutes of painstaking amazeballs2 minutes well spent, i managed to drive the transit van a little further this time, glitching under the front wheels of a plane. i also managed to figure out that the array of 8 white pixels on the help menu that look suspiciously like the word back, are infact a button that closes said menu!Still... 10/10 IGN			"

												step 1 get cheat enginestep 2 set speed hack between 2.5 and 5this game is moderately intertaining but they decided to make everything real time which leaves all the phone of being at the airport only you have to do everything for the airport including refueling the plane and cleaning it up inside and out. With speedhack enabled its good for about 4 hours of mind numbing intertainment. clipping is a big problem and you will need to save often as planes will randomly appear on roads that need to be accessed.the game is worth $1.49 or les IMHOscore 56/100			"

												Don't know why they are so many bad reviews on this game! Maybe it's just me, but I love this game! When I first loaded it and let my first plane get to the gate I just left it. I thought top left where it said what was going on that it was going to do it by it's self. I left it for a few minutes before I realised what was going on. *Maybe they should be some sort of tutorial to show you how to play the game, and also a waypoint or a map to show you where to drive the vehicles*But all around a good game to play, look forward to playing it again! :)			"

												This isn't simply an airport simulator, but an airport ground crew simulator. It starts off with you playing the part of the manager, perched atop the tower looking down on your kingdom, or airport. Once a plane lands and you send it to a gate you get to experience the thrill of driving each different vehicle over to the now parked plane.  Feel the wind in your hair as you drive the Passenger Boarding Steps, Bus, Dollies, and many more at a ever so safe 3MPH!  Then, because there can never be too much excitement at the airport, you get to drive all the vehicles back to their original locations!  And after enough time has passed another plane will land so you can do it all again!Make enough money and you can 'hire' people to do these tasks for you.  That's when the game gets real fun, as you sit in the tower and watch everything happen on its own!  Like magic! "

It's difficult to ever feel completely satisfied with a play session of Airport Simulator 2014. There's always one more pressing quest, one more unexplored tract of land, one more skill to increase, one more butterfly to catch. It's a mesmerizing game that draws you into an finely crafted fictional space packed with content that consistently surprises. The changes made since Airport Simulator 2013 are many, and result in a more focused and sensible style of play, where the effects of every decision are easily seen. Featuring the same kind of thrilling freedom of choice The Airport Simulator series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack, playing Airport Simulator 2014 is a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced.

												I love airports. I mean I really love airports. I love the fact that they are a meeting point for people from all over the world, and that they never truly sleep, and I love the whole miniature world inside the airport that is really separate from the country it's in.So you'd have to try pretty damn hard to write an Airport game I didn't enjoy.Congratulations, developers!This game basically has you driving lots of airport vehicles slowly around the airport and stopping them in the right place. E.g. the vehicle with the stairs on it to let the passengers out, the bus to take them to the main building, the repair vehicles and so on. You then have to wait lots of real time for them to perform their tasks. You can't speed time up, so have fun rotating the screen or driving the little utility vehicle that doesn't do anything round the airport, slowly, while you wait.There's not even any passengers to see, so you feel like you're just playing with toy cars.Also there seems to be no on-screen notification that a plane has landed (at which point you need to assign it to a gate) so if you're deaf like me that could be a problem.Add to this some difficulties starting the game up and shutting it down and you have the perfect gift... for a person you don't like.

												ok so though i should maybe wade into these reviews and put my tuppence in as looking at the previous reviews there does not seem to be a lot of reviews from people who have actually given the game a good go.Yes there are a few bugs that need ironing out* you cant use ALL of the gates (ie the A's) and some of the gates when you start to use them you need to take your viewing vehicle and ""right"" the tunnels or you will ont be able to use it.* the automated items do not seem to have anough intellegence about them and sometimes get lost meaning that you lose money on the task that is being completed.* the places where vehicles are kept could do with being more obvious to the player (a mini map miht help with that)* the cargo plane graphics could do with refining as some of the planes do not display properly when the cargo is going in and out.On the positive side* it is fun (to some) to get the vehicles to the right place on time so you can upgrade to atuomation* it is challenging to prioritise the tasks based on the time you have for them* graphics are good* hours of fun for those who have the patience to play simulator gamesI will be marking this as recommended as I personally enjoyed this game and hope to see a 2015 version with all th bug fixes soon "

												A lot of people are complaining this is too dull, too boring, too slow, well I have to say if you are used to other simulators like SimCity then no, this may not be the game for you, but if you're like me, and you like to understand what goes on when a plane takes off and when a plane lands, and you like airports then this IS a good game for you :)I've had a good amount of fun with it and I recommend it !P.S. Just finished the game, the ending really is somewhat disappointing but it's what it is. I will admit, by the time you get all of the gates with level 2 vehicles the game is 30 times slower , that was the point when I had to get a speed hack. Never thought I would, but it was that or 30 more hours playing , and when I say playing I mean driving the cargo from plane, to storage, to garage, because that's really it once you have every single thing automated.

												It's good fun, even if it ought to be called Airport Vehicle Simulator 2014, as you never enter or exit a building and can only drive vehicles to/from gates or observe everything from the tower. If you approach the game from the expectation that it's a cheap crappy sim, you won't be disappointed.A few bugs here and there (including some planes landing/taking off being full volume and in mono), extremely annoying and pointless generic upbeat background music, and quite stupid AI.Gameplay is insanely slow and boring (it's realtime) unless you use speedhack at 2x in CheatEngine.Ultimately nowhere near a full Airport simulator, and is an enjoyable timewaster despite annoying bugs. Air Traffic Control Simulator sounds like a better idea for a game instead of this.			"

It is simplistic, so if you like action and suspense and stuff like that, this is not a game for you. There are some bugs and glitches here and there, but not enough to majorly affect the gameplay. Its easy to see that a lot of thought was put into the game. One thing I have noticed is that a good amount of the people who have posted bad reviews haven't even played for an hour.

												If you're wanting to juggle the impossible while trying to fend off the inevitable failure, then this game is for you.You wonder why the airport wasn't successful? well as you begin playing you will find 1 vehicle per type, yes... only one for all 8 terminals, on top of that the planes land at a rate of 1 per approx half hour...one plane isn't too bad, I can get it turned around within 30 minutes, but once you get to 3 of the same type... especially passenger planes, then resources become more than noticibly stretched.this game is not without bugs and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're an avid QA team member or willing to put up with the constant resetting of your saved games.the lack of function in the game and the haste that has been shown to be released to manufacturer shows that somewhere along the lines of command... someone needs to be laid offsurprisingly, the game is made with the same engine as Agricultual Simulator 2013 and made by the same developers, so I expected more content at the least to go with the bugs, however it is more stable than the Agricultual Sim 2013 and has not crashed on me yet.The bug where you get free cash every so often is confusing and very disturbing, making me think if it's better to just leave it running in the backgound like Euro Truck Simulator 2, or to just quit while I have my sanity... however because the desire to play the game is low, I'll give it a miss and warn people not to play it... I just hope they fix that employment problem they are having that keeps making them rush these games out to ""recall"" so soon			"

I was duped into thinking this was a simulator in the vein of most simulation/strategy games et al. the settlers or command and conquer. Definetly a waste of 14 dollars. I think steam should revamp the selling of games, perhaps a 5 dollar rental fee for say 2 days and if you want to purchase said game, pay full price minus the 5 dollar rental. Just a thought !			"

												Look at the plenty of reviews below. 5 mins into the game and I already know the rest is trash. This will simulate an airport. At this airport, you are the only one working there. Prepare to drive every vehicle there is and wait for things to happen in REAL TIME!! Do not expect to be entertained. I should have read the reviews before buying the bundle. I would also like a refund if possible. Waste of my 4$. I thought there was a standard on what Type of games would be on Steam, but this is really rock bottom. Many many stick figure flash games are worth more than this.			"

												This game is a let down, i have played it for a while and once you get workers it is boring as u can drive around the yellow car which does nothing, you pick the gate which plane goes to and have to cargo manually so cant even leave it to be automonous.I suggest that as the game is back up to around £20 dont buy unless want to waste alot time as there is no time speed setting just real time.

												Disappointing game.  You repeat the same tasks over and over to service planes, and once you upgrade all the gate equipment, its mostly all automated so there is really nothing to do.  There is no management and business options for the expansions of terminals and runways as promised by the developer.  There is only one possible airport to ""manage"" and there is no ability to build or run any of it except for basic gate operations.I played for a while because it sort of was a stress reducer and easy game, but then I encoutered bugs that prevented my from going forward such as poor vehicle physics and concurrent cargo planes that got stuck at the gates and would not let me unload them.  The game gives you one mission, which is to upgrade all the equipment at all eight gates to level 3 using money you earn from servicing planes.  There are no challenges, no random events, no real strategy, and no tutorial for just starting out.  Additionally, the graphics are crude and there are no people ever visible in the entire airport except for the drivers of vehicles.I really think an airport simulator could be a great game if it could be done right.  Managing gates, terminals, shops, parking, traffic, runways, security, and air traffic control could present a truly emmersive real-time strategy game.  This game shows little to no effort to attempt to capture such a strategy.  I want a game that does gate/traffic management like a SimCity, internal terminal economics/traffic like rollercoaster tycoon (every ride is a gate), and vehicular traffic and parking management like Cities in Motion.  I would pay $49.99 for such a game, but please do not pay for this game.			"

												Please, PLEASE learn from my mistake and DO NOT waste your money on this!After giving it a solid go (~10 hours over several days) I have to say this would have to be one of the very, -very- few games I've ever played that I just couldn't in good conscience recommend to anyone. I honestly feel like an idiot for paying anything, let alone $15 for this.The main issue that has made me throw up my hands and say ""I'm done."" is the bugs. It came to a point where I literally could not continue playing the game because of a bug with the Tunnels, or Aerobridges as they're probably better know as. Upon looking at the community hub this is a widespread issue with the only fix being crashing another vehicle into the bugged tunnel and hoping to dislodge it. In terms of gameplay the vast majority is literally driving aircraft service vehicles (eg. Catering Trucks, Tugs, etc.) from point A to point B, leaving them there for several minutes then driving them back to point A. While the coordination of this to get planes in the air again as quickly as possible did get me to use my head at times, the lack of variation and visible rewards really kill any prospect of this being a game you'll ever touch again after a day or two.Pricewise I'd say if you were -absolutely- desperate to experience the badness of this game, do not pay a cent more than $5 and thats probably being way too generous. While I am legitimately interested in the goings-on of airports and really would absolutely love to see a simulation game that can truly reflect the experience, this is not it. This is a half-baked,♥♥♥♥♥♥weak abomination made by people who, judging by this product, seem to have no respect whatsoever for fans of the simulation genre or gamers generally. Avoid this ""game"" like the plague, seriously.			"

I found 3 massive ones that make me question whether they even tested this game.  For example taxiing the plane to the runway for take off just froze progress completely once, with the counter not moving and unable to progress further.  Also, the aim of the game is to hire ai controlled assistants to complete tasks for you, but for me they just glitched all over the place.  For example I had an assistant for the fuel truck, but he just glitched, stuck in one spot, which meant the task was never able to be completed, I couldnt even take over control myself to get it done!  Waste of time, money and patience.  Like I said, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			"

												If you're wanting to juggle the impossible while trying to fend off the inevitable failure, then this game is for you.You wonder why the airport wasn't successful? well as you begin playing you will find 1 vehicle per type, yes... only one for all 8 terminals, on top of that the planes land at a rate of 1 per approx half hour...one plane isn't too bad, I can get it turned around within 30 minutes, but once you get to 3 of the same type... especially passenger planes, then resources become more than noticibly stretched.this game is not without bugs and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're an avid QA team member or willing to put up with the constant resetting of your saved games.the lack of function in the game and the haste that has been shown to be released to manufacturer shows that somewhere along the lines of command... someone needs to be laid offsurprisingly, the game is made with the same engine as Agricultual Simulator 2013 and made by the same developers, so I expected more content at the least to go with the bugs, however it is more stable than the Agricultual Sim 2013 and has not crashed on me yet.The bug where you get free cash every so often is confusing and very disturbing, making me think if it's better to just leave it running in the backgound like Euro Truck Simulator 2, or to just quit while I have my sanity... however because the desire to play the game is low, I'll give it a miss and warn people not to play it... I just hope they fix that employment problem they are having that keeps making them rush these games out to ""recall"" so soon			"

												Where to begin...well - I guess that offering the conclusion first will save time for everyone: This is not a simulation game - it is a very monotonous time management game, without a FF-button. Also there are plenty of glitches.The game pretends to offer the challenge of managing an airport, but once you get into the game it turns out that you are presented with the series of tasks that goes into servicing a plane on turnaround, this i done on a time limit and you are payed for each completed task and fined for breaking the timelimit.So far so good, this could have developed into something if additional complexity was added - but it turns out that the next step is to begin servicing the next plane at the next gate. In time you can purchase ""assistants"" to perform tasks at the gates. Doing this automates the task, and ensures that it is performed slowly enough to incur fines, without there being any way to help things along.After a few hours I was wondering when things would change, and a quick peek in the forums revealed to me that they wouldn't.... So basically you will be less and less involved in the tasks, and eventually you will have hired assistants for every function.Amazingly this is done without ever giving you any sort of real gameplay...

As it is never enough:- Plane arrives (takes a while);- You drive every vehicle to the plane (takes another while, depending on gate;- You wait a load of time listening to the same loop music... Sanity check here;- You drive everything back to the respective garage;- You upgrade (hire assistants - no more driving) everything. That`s all. After a while you will probably upgrade everything and win the game (I have not survived more than 30 minutes, so I have no idea of what would be this ""end"").Can STEAM refund? lol "

												I'm pretty sure this is the only review I've written so far, so, it was enough to spur me to write this.This game is terrible.Gameplay. Well, Somewhat misleading. I was expecting some management, complexity, something interesting that would delve into what it takes to run an airport. Instead, it's a tarmac driving simulator....at all of 5-10 mph. You can upgrade the different jobs by three levels at 7 gates. That's it...that and driving back and forth 500 feet at painfully slow speeds...oh, and waiting on timers. I could only stand a couple hours of it, so if there's anything else to it, it takes longer than that to get to. Graphics. Acceptable for a sim game I guess. The design though (level...only one I assume) looks like it's from 2003 or something. Uninspired and simplistic.Bugs...bugs everywhere. I stopped playing (besides the fact that it was incredibly borind) because I couldn't get the first plane to take off because the taxi vehicle dosn't seem to want to connect. Also, if you have multiple planes at different gates, switching between jobs (loading baggage at plane 1 and unloading at plane 2) will use the same vehicle, and thus, will pause work at one of the planes. You have a dozen or so vehicles of each type, yet it wants you to do this....both wasting time and bugging things. Long story short, I tried to push the plane with a taxi and ended up with both plane and taxi in the wall upside down.Don't buy it. Even if you like sim games, don't buy it. I like sim games. I hated this game. I kind of want a refund.			"

This game is embarassing, boring, and pointless.Embarassing because I wasn't intoxicated when I purchased it.Boring because even after you drive around all of the identical vehicles, you have to wait upwards of 5 minutes real-time for them to finish each job. I could see that for an iPad game were they are trying to get lazy, impatient inbred children to buy gems or whatever to finish their jobs, but this is (supposed to be) a PC SimulatorPointless because they hvae not captured what could be potentially fun about running an airport, the things I thought, nay. ASSUMED, would be in the game; there is no chaos, no fast-moving vehicles, delayed flights, inclamate weather to deal with. So far, the only thing the game has forced me to Deal With has been boredom. "

												Absolutely fantasic game about managing massive amount of small trivial tasks that all just happen to be in an airport environment. Requires some clever analysis of the game logic to understand how to avoid the penalties. Really cool game once you understand what its all about. All tasks in themselves are small and boring but have 20 of them going on at the same time, then managing gets tricky and really addictive.For example one of the cornerstone of this sim is the question, how do you fuel three airplanes simultaniously with one fuel truck that can only be at one place at a time without being late anywhere nor busting any deadlines. Yes it is possible and it is intended that you figure this trick out and thats where things get interesting.Finally DO NOT upgrade all your gates to level 1 because at that moment you have killed the game - you have nothing to do anymore. Instead keep 3-4 gates always to yourself and upgrade the rest. Also avoid level 1 upgrades. The wrkers are unbeliveabely slow. So always upgrade a station to atleast level 2. Once 4-5 gates are all level 3, you can start upgrading the gates you kept for your self. The upgrading of the last gate is however always painfully bodring and slow. However once the final gate hits all level 3, the game ends.			"

												First Impressions:Meh...I found this title to be a bit boring.  You can drive vehicles around from Point A to Point B, but all of the work seems to be done for you once you get there.  There are also no time controls (none that I've found) so some parts of the game can be incredibly dull while you wait for more to happen.  The graphics also seems to be a bit antiquated.   I personally wouldn't pay $15 for this title.

												I will start with the good things about the game:+ This game has a nicely modeled 3d world+ Also, a pretty chill soundtrack. But apart from that, the good points end. Here are my negative points:- The gameplay is too slow (you have to go 5 minutes just pressing W to ride your super slow car to a spot where a plane just appeared out of nowhere).- The game is not very much fun to play. All the vehicles in the game need to be rode (I'm not a native english speaker so this may be wrong, past perfect of ""to ride"")to the same place, which makes it à very repetitive expoerience- For fun I drove two cars into eachother. In the end the cars leaned against eachother, with the weels off the ground so I couldn't move anymore. I had to quit and restart. Then I noticed another thing:- The game doesn't have an autosave feature, so I had to start all over again. ConclusionAll in all I really have respect for the guy who modeled it all, because The 3D world looks very nice. The game designers have to make the game, eevn if it is a simulator, a lot more fun to play, because I couldn't set myself to playing it longer than half an hour. I got it in a Humble Bundle, so I didn't really waste my money, but if you consider buying this for a full price, Please Don't. Save your money and go to a movie or something.			"

												If there was ever a game that I regretted buying, it is this one.  I have always been a huge fan of everything aircraft related, I even worked at an airport for a time.  This ""game"" was more tedious than any day I ever worked.  Very slow pace, very boring gameplay.  Laughable controls as you move each service vehicle to and from the aircraft, one...at...a...........time.And as I was almost finished servicing the first aircraft, I thought to myself, ""I think I will cheat some cash to automate this crap.""  Yep, thinking about cheating to automate a game in less than one hour because it was so boring.  Not a good sign.Controlling the different vehicles is a matter of using the up arrows.  Everything moves at the same slow pace, turning is unrealistic, no damage models, of course.The gameplay is simply telling the plane where to park.  Then you move the ramp to the plane.  Move the stairs, move the bus, move the cleanign crew, move the maintenance crew, move the caterer, move each one back on at a time.  Repeat on the next plane....and the next...and the next...Was it worth the $7.49 I paid?  Hell to the no.  This would have worked better as a free-to-play with a 99 cent option to automate the trucks.			"

												Please, PLEASE learn from my mistake and DO NOT waste your money on this!After giving it a solid go (~10 hours over several days) I have to say this would have to be one of the very, -very- few games I've ever played that I just couldn't in good conscience recommend to anyone. I honestly feel like an idiot for paying anything, let alone $15 for this.The main issue that has made me throw up my hands and say ""I'm done."" is the bugs. It came to a point where I literally could not continue playing the game because of a bug with the Tunnels, or Aerobridges as they're probably better know as. Upon looking at the community hub this is a widespread issue with the only fix being crashing another vehicle into the bugged tunnel and hoping to dislodge it. In terms of gameplay the vast majority is literally driving aircraft service vehicles (eg. Catering Trucks, Tugs, etc.) from point A to point B, leaving them there for several minutes then driving them back to point A. While the coordination of this to get planes in the air again as quickly as possible did get me to use my head at times, the lack of variation and visible rewards really kill any prospect of this being a game you'll ever touch again after a day or two.Pricewise I'd say if you were -absolutely- desperate to experience the badness of this game, do not pay a cent more than $5 and thats probably being way too generous. While I am legitimately interested in the goings-on of airports and really would absolutely love to see a simulation game that can truly reflect the experience, this is not it. This is a half-baked,♥♥♥♥♥♥weak abomination made by people who, judging by this product, seem to have no respect whatsoever for fans of the simulation genre or gamers generally. Avoid this ""game"" like the plague, seriously.			"

												While interesting as a simulator, this game is terribly buggy.  Assets randomly disappear (like the entire terminal building!) and the inability to hire a minion to drive the cargo carrier makes sequencing cargo planes a nightmare, they just clog up the gates.  While not truly simulation behaviour, the game should be more aware of what is going on, you can end up with very long periods of nothing to do as you have gates available but no planes are landing are you are waiting for your existing planes to finish loading or taxi away.Feels like a beta, the elements are there but there is little polish.

Truly a squandered opportunity that should, in all earnestness, be removed from Steam for sheer inane ""gamelessness"". There are bugs, but beyond that there's no real content. No simulating of an airport, I spek truth when I say that I have played iOS games that do a better job of simulating airline management than this title. If I had bought it after the 'two week refund' I would have given this back in a heartbeat. The only title absolutely hidden off my list. I cannot discourage enough. Perhaps the real pain is that there is so much potential in the setting. Whatever potential, it was squanderd.			"

Also, if you run a small vehicle into the tire of a plane, the plane will fall over. It's not even funny stupid. It's like someone started making it, then gave up, but decided to sell it anyway. Luckily this was a gift. I'd never pay money for it.			"

Prepare to drive every vehicle there is and wait for things to happen in REAL TIME!! Do not expect to be entertained. I should have read the reviews before buying the bundle. I would also like a refund if possible. Waste of my 4$. I thought there was a standard on what Type of games would be on Steam, but this is really rock bottom. Many many stick figure flash games are worth more than this.			"

Then driving every vehicle to the gate is okay, but then you have to deal with the crushing lag on the controls with the keyboard, making you crash into buildings or planes...Just buggy and not worth more than the 33c I paid in a bundle.

												Absolutely fantasic game about managing massive amount of small trivial tasks that all just happen to be in an airport environment. Requires some clever analysis of the game logic to understand how to avoid the penalties. Really cool game once you understand what its all about. All tasks in themselves are small and boring but have 20 of them going on at the same time, then managing gets tricky and really addictive.For example one of the cornerstone of this sim is the question, how do you fuel three airplanes simultaniously with one fuel truck that can only be at one place at a time without being late anywhere nor busting any deadlines. Yes it is possible and it is intended that you figure this trick out and thats where things get interesting.Finally DO NOT upgrade all your gates to level 1 because at that moment you have killed the game - you have nothing to do anymore. Instead keep 3-4 gates always to yourself and upgrade the rest. Also avoid level 1 upgrades. The wrkers are unbeliveabely slow. So always upgrade a station to atleast level 2. Once 4-5 gates are all level 3, you can start upgrading the gates you kept for your self. The upgrading of the last gate is however always painfully bodring and slow. However once the final gate hits all level 3, the game ends.			"

This game is embarassing, boring, and pointless.Embarassing because I wasn't intoxicated when I purchased it.Boring because even after you drive around all of the identical vehicles, you have to wait upwards of 5 minutes real-time for them to finish each job. I could see that for an iPad game were they are trying to get lazy, impatient inbred children to buy gems or whatever to finish their jobs, but this is (supposed to be) a PC SimulatorPointless because they hvae not captured what could be potentially fun about running an airport, the things I thought, nay. ASSUMED, would be in the game; there is no chaos, no fast-moving vehicles, delayed flights, inclamate weather to deal with. So far, the only thing the game has forced me to Deal With has been boredom. "

												Table of Contents:- Foreword- Graphics- Gameplay- Sounds- Controls- Quality- Overall Experience-ForewordI never was at an airport, so that game was quite interresting to me. As from every Simulator Game i didnt expect much.Well, i didnt get much, but way more than i expected.-GraphicsThe graphics look like from 2008 tbh. Pretty bad graphics, except for the models, they were not too bad.It was just the environment looking really bad.-GameplayWell, the gameplay is basically ""driving"" the gate to the plane, and driving different vehicles to the gate and back to the position they started from.Vehicles are so insanely slow that its not even really fun to drive them. Their controls are pretty bad too.The bus's description says its 75km/h, felt like 10km/h though, same for every single vehicle.-SoundsThe music was bad like in every simulator game there is, just regular Sim-Music...The Sounds were not bad, just the Fuel-Truck motor-sounds were louder than any others, that was weird.-ControlsThe controls are basically (W,A,S,D) and your Mouse.Not much to say. Vehicles are terrible at their handling. Its all pretty weird.-QualityLike every UIG Game i've played so far, the game changes your screen resolution to a random resolution.Some change to 4:3, some to 16:10, some stay at 16:9 but change the resolution to something like 1280x720 or something.The cars are sometimes kinda ""drifting"" which looks pretty weird, cars are driving 10km/h and are terrible at their handling.After saving the game it reloads all the textures which takes up to 30 seconds.A thing i really like though is that the game runs in realtime. You wait aslong as you would in reallife for stuff, it gets your System Date and Time and uses that for the game which i just love. Well, if there's only one plane at the airport you sometimes have to wait like 5 minutes to do stuff, its great though. I a fan of that.-Overall ExperienceIts definetly worth getting the game in a bundle for like 50 cents, but thats it. Its not worth its 10€.I had ""fun"" for 50 minutes, its basically a driving simulator, but i somehow like it.So, i wont recommend the game for more than 2€ tbh, its just boring after some playtime, but for less, go and get it.

If you still for some reason are considering buying this game, spoilers are ahead. The game consists of the following features:1. Wating for planes to arrive at your airport, which occurs somewhere on the order of once every 15-20 minutes. No, you cannot speed up time until the next flight arrives. No, there is nothing even remotely entertaining to do while you wait.2. Driving various airport vehicles from their respective parking spots to the airplane and back. Cargo trucks, maintenance vehicles, cleaning services, and even your own personal truck! Honestly, the game makes it seem like it's going to be incredibly difficult to fulfill all the airport roles by yourself but it takes only a few minutes to move around vehicles that then take ten minutes to complete their respective jobs. On top of that, you can't even do anything fun with the vehicles because most of them are incredibly slow at max speed.3. Waiting for planes to mysteriously decide to leave the gate after an arbitrarily decided amount of time that you have no notification of whatsoever. After you finish ""servicing"" the plane, it waits in the gate for some time before randomly departing.This game is easily the most disappointing title in my entire library. Please do not buy this game.			"

												i try not to read reviews before i try the game. everyone has their own opinion. i enjoyed the game to teach management and coordination skills, but the AI is just to buggy. when a tunnel is stuck on the nose of a plane and won't retract, so the plane can't depart, you are basically finished.....also had three vehicles get stuck at an intersection.fix the issues so its playable, and put in a fast forward button so your not sitting around waiting for 20 minutes to pass.thks "

												United Independent Entertainment GmbH must be one of the most dishonest software companies in existence. This ""Airport Simulator"" is all about driving airport vehicles, and nothing else. The description of the game is completely misleading (see later). It should have been called ""Airport Dogsbody"" instead. Passengers need to get off a plane? Drive the stairs to the side of the aircraft. Luggage needs to be unloaded? Drive the luggage trolley to the side of the plane. Passengers need to get to the terminal building? Drive a bus to the side of the plane. Plane needs to be cleaned? Drive the cleaning truck to the side of the plane. The description on the Steam store page says ""Many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways"". That's a lie. You can't expand the terminal buildings or runways, and there are no business decisions to take. The description also says ""Countless missions and tasks that the player has to fulfill in order to guarantee a successful airport"". That's a lie too. There's only ONE job at this airport, and it's driving vehicles backwards and forwards to and from the aircraft all day long. Admittedly there is a ""profit"" figure which goes up with each driving job you complete, and this money can then be used to automate the driving tasks. But that simply leaves you with nothing to do but twiddle your thumbs waiting for something to happen at the airport. There's no ""accelerate time"" button to speed things up. And there are bugs galore too. I was given a task to push-taxi an airliner to the runway, ready for departure. But no matter where I stopped the plane, the task would never end. I was left with arriving aircraft queueing up on the taxiway, trying to get into terminal gates which were blocked by aircraft that I couldn't taxi! It was a nightmare. Steam should remove this game from the Steam store, and UIE GmbH should be prosecuted for obtaining money by deception. My only solace is that I bought this game in a Humble Bundle sale for a small price, so at least I didn't waste much cash, and some of my money went to charity. Don't make the same mistake I did.

												This is a total waste of 7 euros. What a pointless piece of rubbish. Terrible graphics, totally slow gameplay, nothing simulating about it. You drive vans around a deserted airport and every 5 minutes the game crashes. Avoid this game like the plague!			"
