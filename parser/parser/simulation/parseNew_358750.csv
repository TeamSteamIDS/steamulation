												Oh my god, I never thought I would change this review to a positive.The newest free content update Captain's Edition is worth the price on its own.The main game is like the first except you don't have much of a choice and the maps are based around the content rather than the content being based around the maps.The story is pretty nice and I can see a nice long series coming out of it.The gameplay is real nice besides the frame issues which is extremely weird issue for such a basic art style with no real animations.You go as the famous Captain Shields who had fought through entire armies by himself and his Ryders (basically space mechs) to avenge his fallen planet with the Prototype ship constantly haunted by the ghosts of his past. It's pretty comedic but trust me when I say this game can be dark.Now the game before this update wasn't really worth the update, same upgrade system and shop system besides seperate resources and in fact at the start it seemed like less content to the free game they released.Now I'm eager to get into [ RE ] turn, the newest update that adds in a whole new story and whole different type of game after you complete the normal game. It puts a twist on the ending and allows you to travel through time to change your fate. I know where all the choices went and they all went into this expansions, and it is beautiful. Tell Tale take notes, your choices actually matter and you could actually die and get everyone you know and love killed.My favorite moment had to have been the dialogue where Shields said he didn't feel like he had a choice anymore and that it's like all his decisions vanished. He also complained about how he used to rip up rule books. God I think I'm in love with this series.My hours were what 3-4 originally? Then I went through to check the map update for like 1-2. Now it's like over 12.Anyways the base game, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, no choices like MOA but this new expansion (I say expansion because it's new content and it's pretty god damn big for free big) is definently worth it. Also I get to decide my own fate now, no one tells me who to ♥♥♥♥.Seriously though that self reference to the base game is beautiful, I wish more games did that kind of thing I just hope it doesn't get over saturated if it does start happen because it's just so good right now.The story is so good as well and the characters are magnifico, we get more background on the villians as well and on Shields' personality and the story is better than the base in my opinion.

												The game was .... a disappointment. The only thing that improved in this game over the previous installement (Mask of Arcadius) were the visuals and voice actors. Everything else took a step back.The higher production values, rather than enhancing the game, did nothing but limit it. Having played through the entirety, I can't help but feel that what the devs did was create a game based on how much voice acting and animation they could afford. The final product was made to fit the packaging, which is a terrible way to design a game.As a result, we got something that was incredibly rushed and bland. There's been almost no improvement in gameplay. In fact, Liberation Day plays like a lightly modded version of the original. The mission count is low and unvaried. The original had a nicely fleshed out story that taught you a lot about the world and invested you in its characters. Liberation Day took all of that and turned it into a shiny, half-written screenplay with all your favorite characters shoehorned into whatever role the plot demanded. We learn absolutely nothing new about the world or its characters, who have become one dimensional tropes in service of a rushed game.MoA relied only on simple sprites and backgrounds and it really shined because of that. The devs created as much content as they felt would serve the gameplay experience and story and we got something that was not only special, but FREE. Liberation Day flipped that around and ironically, all the money that Patreon supporters and buyers of Sunrider Academy poured into the company has only ruined the next installment by making the studio believe it should try to crank out a AAA production level game.

												Updated review of my last, please read my old v1.0 steam review. You may find it here: http://imgur.com/6qNRC8kAs I deleted it you will not be able to view it on steam.What can I say, Love in Space fixed a hearty majority of the issues with Liberation Day, Sunrider is once again one of my beloved franchises, and I am a (somewhat) pleased fan. while I cannot 100% say that v2.0 has rectified all the atrocities from it's v1.0 initial release, however this is a massive improvement from the last. Before I continue I absolutely must address everyone at Love in Space for putting in the effort for this marvelous update. It really shows how much you care for your fans. v2.0 truly is appreciated and must be commended, that without a doubt deserves to be brought to light. You heard our cries and you responded, I personally thank all of you.With the game as is right now it is certainly more satisfying. What was added made it much more enjoyable. Yes, there are things that cannot be fixed in terms with romance, choices and various other essential fundamentals for an eroge, this however this isn't the final chapter. I'm sure we can all expect nothing but greatness from from Love in Space. After all Diamonds are only made under high pressure.			"

												I loved the original Sunrider and Sunrider Academy. The amount of good quality content was fantasic, and I backed the patreon expecting nothing less from their new game. Sadly, this game is just not worth the price tag for the length that it is and the quality of the content. The story is too linear, to the point that your choices dont feel worthwhile, some choices dont even matter(*spoiler* if you dont spare cosette, she will appear in later dialogue, even though she is dead.) I was hoping for more out of this game, but it just fell short. So be warned potential buying that this may not be the space wiafu simulator you were looking forI would recommend not purchasing this, and just replay the original, you would have a better experiance if you did.

												Oddly enough, this series show us clearly that ""for free"" doesn't mean ""cheap stuff"" and that ""for a price"" doesn't mean ""quality stuff"". Good luck to the developers about fixing this impression with the next chapter, but one thing is sure: this one didn't deserve the 20€ I immediatly spent to buy, after the previous very good experience; thus, I will not spend such an amount for the next release.PROs:- fight has improved, is now more balanced and smooth;- good acting for the voices!- globally good plot-twist;- a HELLA lot of tension;- a bit of character development, which is always appreciated;- good OST.CONs:- no more battle animation? Sad...- major events are actually rushed, the ending suffering it more than the rest;- your love route has been fixed and you're doomed to witness it wheter you like it or not;- a HELLA lot of cliché;- do our choices even matter in the end? Nope. Ah, wait, once you have the opportunity to introduce a new ship in the shop-list of the Miner Union and that's it;- the quality of writing tends to decay.tl;dr: wait for a huge discount.			"

												For background, I’ve purchased all three Sunrider games, I’ve played Mask of  Arcadius extensively and I’ve purchased Academy as a way to thank the developers as I really want to like them.I’ve played this game to completion on Captain difficulty, I did not listen to all the voice acting but I read all the dialog.This review is SPOILER FREE and applicable to V2.0.TL:DR: This game has many minor flaws and a huge storyline related flaw, as such I find myself unable to recommend it.Technical:This game suffers greatly in the technical aspect, Love in Space was a team of people that have a lot of passion on Eroge and Japanese Anime culture in general, however, they lack a lot of the technical talent in game development (which makes their efforts on creating games even more commendable) and have to resort to using what is basically a heavily modified version of the Ren’Py engine, which was never designed to create TBS games, leading to several gameplay related bugs, severely limited graphics fidelity and etc.The reliance of the Ren’Py engine is clearly showing and the unoptimised engine is really hurting and limiting on what the TBS portion of the game could have been, LD right now utilizes simple graphics and sprites to represent combat, with no animation whatsoever, the TBS genre is currently experiencing a revival, and what LD has to offer in the TBS department is simply lacking even when compared to other indie products such as The Banner Saga.Misc (Sound, non-gameplay related systems):This game have a lot of minor issues that would have been redeemable if there weren’t so many of them.The original English voice actors did not return due to scheduling reasons with the developers, they’ve decided that it is easier to have Japanese VN voice actors instead because they have the connection and it would be more convenient. Changing voice actors is going to be a bad idea most of the time especially for sequels (somewhat forgivable for remakes, persona 4 golden comes to mind) as it breaks the players’ emersion. To add to that, the Japanese voices are simply subpar, a lot of the voices are bad even by dlsite/dmm doujin game standards, whilst this might be subjective, I invite the readers to look for youtube videos of the Japanese voices and judge for themselves.LD offers a save import function from Mask of Arcadius, similar to the way that Mass Effect handles save transfers, this is a really great idea, that is if it actually works, the save importer is unfortunately really bugged and a lot of people are unable to make the save importer work. Thankfully LD also offers decision choices for MoA when starting a new game similar to how Dragon Age 2 handled it.The UI within the VN portion of the game feels slick and modern, however, display bugs and slowdowns especially in the store page are pretty blatant, and this is again, clearly a product of using the Ren’Py engine.Story (Spoiler Free):Whilst people like to claim that stories could not be objectively bad, I have to disagree, without posting spoilers, I have to say that the single worst part about LD is the story despite the myriad of issues previously mentioned.Let’s get the elephant out of the room, LD contains an extremely linear storyline, there is a forced romance that feels extremely rushed and there are not choices at all, even the illusion of choice is lacking. To add on top of that, the storyline itself is objectively bad, I will explain below without spoilers. Whilst I do not feel like resorting to petty insults, I would like to respectfully remind the writers and developers that VNs are supposed to contain choices in them, otherwise, they are just dynamic novels, and those need actually really good writing, music, voice acting, and execution to pull off (planetarian comes to mind).In LD, the protagonist is the standard dumb MC that doesn’t know anything and frequently breaks character, he is literally no better than the generic harem MC in LD. This is very disappointing given that this was not the case in the previous games.In addition to the lackluster MC, the entire story makes the player feels like that they are just in for the ride, the MC does not have any impact on the storyline at all, it feels like the MC is just following everyone around, the player simply cannot make any meaningful choices and the MC himself did not make any meaningful choices, the MC just feels dead.The forced romance is very problematic, it is clear that the developers are favouring a certain character with reckless abandon due to personal preference, whilst I agree that developers maintaining their personal touch on a game is very important, I think that even the way that they handled the forced romance is bad, the entire thing feels very rushed, the MC and the romance partner were acting blatantly out of character and the worst part is, the romance simply does not seem to any anything of significance to the storyline, at that point, I have to wonder why don’t they just make the romance optional if they wish to really focus on that character and not do other romanceable characters.The basic concept of the entire storyline is quite intriguing, it shows a lot of potential, however, the execution done by LiS’s writers is unfortunately really bad, characters frequently act out of character, the plot turns into a jumbled mess towards the end starting from the middle of the story, and the writers wrote themselves into corners on several occasions only to perform arsepulls or deus ex machinas to get themselves out of the corner. There are more subjectively bad writing but that could not be discussed in depth without spoilers so I will refrain from doing that.ConclusionThe unfortunate fact is, the awfully written (no other way to put it) storyline is the large, rusting, final nail on the coffin on top of the myriad of bugs, voice problems, engine problems for Liberation Day, as such, I simply cannot recommend Liberation Day to anyone for any price and the experience is genuinely not enjoyable and feels like a disservice to the franchise as a whole. I play the game and I see so much potential with the universe and the general plot themes, I want to like the game but I simply cannot.			"

												As a former patreon backer (paid $10 for beta access) and longtime fan of the series, I really cannot reccomend this game, at all.The pretty production values and Japanese VA (what is wrong with English, I wonder? It's a beautiful language!) came at the expense of practically everything that made the previous Sunrider VNs (First Arrival and Mask of Arcadius) the gems they were.The story is gutted, and railroad-linear whereas the previous VNs had multiple choices. People have mentioned the unsatisfying ending, but they've neglected to mention that it's unsatisfying not because of itself, but because of the atrocious pacing, forced romance, and hamfisted characterization that preceded it. For around $10 (price in my region, might be higher in yours!), you get around 3 hours total of storyline content (as in VN sections as opposed to fights). That's pretty much inexcusable.As for the gameplay, it manages to be worse than previous iterations. QA apparently went out the window. Longtime fans know that the Ren'Py engine that Sunrider uses is pushed to its limits by the battle system, and so we can forgive the occasional slowdown. But Liberation Day was much worse than that in this department. Battles weren't just slow, they were basically slideshows. I have a 4th generation i5 on a kickass custom rig, by the way, so don't even start saying it could be my system. It isn't. These same molasses-slow battles were frequently interrupted by near-freezes and once even an outright crash. I cringed at that last bit, by the way, because it happened at the exact same spot (2nd or 3rd fight) it did for me in the beta version about a month ago.In conclusion:This game isn't worth the money. It's inferior in every way but production values to the previous Sunrider novels, and those things are not worth the problems they brought. Also, I'll repeat myself: Japanese VA. WHY? Half the draw of this series for me is that it's an original English VN, written competently in English. What did you accomplish kicking the previous girls to the curb and replacing them with Japanese VAs? Was the weeaboo fantasy of a fully voiced JP game worth gutting the game over?I'm just really disappointed. I expect better for the next installment of the series, but I'm afraid that LiS may have shot themselves in the foot here and won't be able to recover without ending up with some serious egg on their faces.

												Reviewer backstory: I had first come upon the Sunrider series back when the first game was just recently released on Steam. I had instantly become enamored when I first finished and was excited to see more as I became interested in all the characters. (Solamancer btw) After MoA and Academy I was excited for this game Liberation day, it had sent me into Mass Effect 3 frenzy all over again. I became a Patreon supporter so that I could get Beta access and have a copy of the game reserved at launch!Game Review: Ver1 was a bitter experience for myself. This mediocre version of the game had completely neglected the story and its paltry choices left me dumbfounded. While the gameplay by itself was well done and the Japanese voice acting was impressive, that too was hampered by slowdown from the new game engine. A final note is that I am one of those who run through on waifu mode because I'm more interested in the story aspects which Ver1 stumbled on at the end with a seemingly fatalistic ending and railroaded relationship with your science officer.Ver2 largely retained the gameplay features with a few bug fixes but its main contribution was the addition of an epilogue to reintroduce choices into the game and to show that this was not your character's final act but simply a chapter closed and a new foe to face.The DLC: I write this review after having played REborn and this was the best part of the game by far in terms of choices and story as it now allowed choices to create unique paths and reach new endings. The game would always encourage you to try again if you reached a bad ending or even aim higher if you reached the ""normal/alt"" endings. It was worth a bad ending or two to figure out the secret to getting the good endings. (Thanks Wanderer!}Sola love!All in all it was a pleasant experience in the end. Here's to leaving Ver1 behind and seeing the future of this series!			"

												This review is based upon the 2.0 version of the game. I have not played the 1.0 version.So we return to the surprisingly competent space drama with crazy anime girls. How is the third installment? (Sunrider the free game is actually two games, not one). Well, I got to import my save Mass Effect style, for one, and it seemed to have roughly the same impact as the ME import from ME1 to ME2 did (I never played ME3. ♥♥♥♥ EA). Namely that there are numerous mentions of your past actions and perhaps some influence on the events of the plot, but essentially the core of the story is the same. Arguably the most important imported choice comes in the form of what you decided in the big final decision of MoA, which determines one of your anime girls appearance for the entire game, and perhaps what sort of emotional baggage lies under the surface for that character.Anyway, Liberation Day (LD) is a noticeable step up from the previous games in terms of budget, with Japanese VA's, prettier art, and updates to the interface and combat system to make it look better. I did have 2 crashes, but that's probably just bugs that need fixing from a game that only recently came out. Good thing this game autosaves constantly.Ok, enough dodging. Time to talk about the story that got this game so many negative reviews.Again, i'll state I played 2.0, not 1.0. I don't know when the game originally ended, but considering the Japanese voices stop after a certain point, it is pretty easy for me to guess when. And yes, that is kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥ending since so much is left unanswered in preparation for the sequel. The stuff that comes after that point does much to clear things up, as well as providing setup for what is to come next. So as for how it ended, i'd say the update which the devs speedily released as fast as they could once word of how mad people were about the 1.0 ending almost certainly helped.As for the rest of the plot? A mix of predictable plot points that center heavily on jealousy and suspicion thanks to how the last game ended. There are still plenty of silly moments, but the plot is primarily serious and high-stakes as you prepare for, and then fight, the battle to liberate Cera. I'm not a fan of the forced romance with Chigara, especially since she isn't one of my favorites, but i'll forgive it (somewhat) thanks to LD's final act when everything gets turned upside down and predictability goes out the window. I was playing a silly anime girl game with some heavy plot elements when suddenly I found myself in something more like what GRRM would have done (though not as deep or well-written, obviously). Good thing i've gotten used to that sort of thing. XDStill not on board with Claude or where the plot takes her, though the scene with Ava going through the Medical Clinic later in the game was hilarious. So, how is LD? It's alright. Is it overpriced for it's length? Yes. Did the devs perhaps spend too much time on boosting the budget with VA's and better art when they should have spent more time making game content? Probably. Is it a bad game? I don't think so. Most importantly, do I want to know what happens next in the Sunrider series? Yes. The preview for the next game (whenever that shows up) sounds like things are about to get even more insane as new players enter the fray that could change everything. Things to come certainly are looking interesting, :oUntil next time!EDIT: Just played the 3.0 Update that adds the [RE]turn storyline to the game. No battles to fight, but a good VN experience where the choices you make can lead to happiness... or dying horribly. Also it lets you follow story routes for most of the rest of the crew (Asaga, Ava, Sola, Icari, and a secret Claude ending). It's more good stuff. Best of all, it was a free DLC. It's addition not only lets you play a new story after you finish Liberation Day, but makes an already decent game even better. :D			"

												Yes, zero hours on the clock and I'll explain.. lol, five minutes to be able to post a review, ok.TL:DR These guys are something special, and maybe this game is lacking compared to previous chapters, the company sure isn't. I'm going out on a limb here, and support a company that shows they care for the product AND userbase. That's very rare in this day and age. Aight. Sunrider Mask of Arcadius was a free game I stumbled upon while browsing for a turn-based grid game. Little expectations, but boy was I in for a surprise. This totally free game with a couple of awkward moments :) turned out to be a GEM, everything about it screamed that it was happy with his creators. And the user/fan-base was likewise happy. Guys, you scored bigtime on my love-for-gamecompanies-meter, something that seldom happens anymore. So, Love in Space created a little love on earth and I was curious where the next chapter would take us. Following the just released Liberation Day, it was kind of a surprise to see so many negative reviews, but mind you.. almost all the negative comments were correct and it broke my heart a little. But then something truly amazing happened: Love in Space read all those comments and instead of getting mad at us (like most companies nowadays) they showed their humble shame in a matter that I can only applaud and got to work at breakneck speed. These guys MUST have worked around the clock to deliver new installments to improve on the beatdown newest chapter. Believe me, as former 3D developer in the game market I know a bit or two about the work-hours prior to release. The tension and nightshifts eventually got to me (getting olderrr *ugh*) so I am a happy deskslave now :P. The amount of work spent on the improvements in such a short notice shows me two things: willingness to improve their product (it's primarily not treated as a sales-product, well eventually yes but they couldn't bear watching it being buried underground by a enraged fanbase) and I keep coming back to this, willingness to listen carefully to well.. us, as in the users. Haven't seen this kind of commitment in quite a while and I'm loving you for it, despite the mistakes in Liberation Day. Heck, we all make mistakes but it requires HEART to acknowledge this and come up with a solution. In the end, it's not how or why you fell, it's how (and why) you get up again! Triple Cudo's For That! Soooo, zero hours on the clock and this will stay for a while :). Currently running around in another game (Don't Starve Together) and it requires my attention and time. As for the pricetag on Liberation Day, I have to strongly say: 'Meh..' It being overpriced is clearly true, especially compared to previous releases lol, and even the discount can't really hide this fact. Well, on the other hand, they gave .. GAVE us a free game which turned out to be very special and even nice companies have to eat. Even Mother Theresa couldn't live on air alone and was depending on the karmic principal 'give love, get love'. So, my karmic little guy told me I already got much love from Love in Space, now it's maybe my turn to give something in return and show a little trust in people that can make mistakes, but also can admit it and get up again. By your latest actions my broken heart was fixed, and I owe you this much for showing that not all game companies are heartless, moneygrabbing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ After release, it's so rare that products are improved upon, without the PAY FOR THIS DLC WHICH ACTUALLY SHOULD BE IN THE BASEGAME attitude... KEEP AT IT, LOVE IN SPACE! Love from Earth, Oldskool.  "

												I'm going to be painfully honest... the gameplay struck me as being fine overall, if not buggy at times. But bugs can be fixed. Story issues... that's another thing.If I'm honest, the start and ending felt fine to me - the issue was that they were painfully linier. Even having the same ending with minor variations to it would have been better then stripping out practically all the choice and thematic RPG elements that made the first two Sunrider games so enjoayble. It feels like there is an entire chapter, or maybe even two, that is missing between the end of the prolouge levels and the start of the Cera invasion - like the first few episodes and last few episodes of a series were just stapled together. Add to that the linier romance choices in a game that practically objectified having multiple girls in it, and it feels like this game made a massive failling narratively. It has better production values and full Japanese VO's, but in all honesty it's not worth the trade-off of axing the wonderful story that had been developing. The VO's are great and all, but feels painfully like the majority of the budget went there instead of developing the story, and it really wasn't worth it for something that, let's face it, is pretty much just a gimic - Sunrider Academy felt like it got more love story/writing-wise then Liberation Day did.  Truthfully, it's not a 'Bad' game - but it is straightforward and certianly is dissipointing. If I were to put it in mecha-anime-fan terms, Liberation Day is to Sunrider what Gundam SEED Destiny is to Gundam SEED; it is a lackluster continuation when everything is said and done compared to what the prior had to offer, and I really do not think it's worth a 24.99 price tag (just 5$ shy of equaling Sunrider Academy's price) when it has barely a third of the story-content and an eighth of the actual choice oppertunities compared to Sunrider Academy.It's not a horrid game, but I just cannot reccomend it - at least not at the current price. And for someone who's been a fan of the series since it was on Kickstarter, it really hurts me to say that.			"

												As of now, the V2.0 patch has resolved all but two of my greatest complaints about this game.The first is a lower framerate for battles, which is caused by the engine, if I understand it correctly, but it's a turnbased tactical game, so it's not EXACTLY needed (but still nice.)Choices have little impact as of now, I state ""as of now"" because from my understanding we're at the halfway point of where the series would like to end. I feel like the writers are skilled enough to make them very important to the end.Now, I believe this is worth your time and money due to the skillful writing and story of the game. The universe and characters feel very fleshed out. The strategy of the gameplay is fun, and very difficult if you choose to make it so.			"

												Won't lie. I agonized with this choice for a long while, whether to give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down, but overall, I was a little let down by Liberation Day. It just...I just didn't really feel anything new from it. Granted, they recognized their fans' feelings this time and made edits to avoid the agonizing cliffhanger (to a degree), but, as usual, this has more of a kinetic novel feel than a visual novel.None of your choices really mean anything in the end. And I was horribly let down by the Captain's Addition alternate universe scenario, the ONLY time you get to choose your favorite heroine...well, you get to choose from four heroines. The answers were literally the same every time with (Insert Heroine Here).It all just feels futile after the first playthrough and there's no real reason to replay it except for the handful of battles in the main story.The main story was good, but it can only make you forgive so much before you're sick of it.If you're a ""One and done"" time of gamer, then go for it, but if you're the type of gamer who wants to try and do things differently each playthrough, everything always ends the same way so don't worry if you feel that sense of futility creeping up on you.It will vary from person to person. I won't discourage anyone from playing it, but I can't recommend it.			"

												On launch I had some issues with this game. But I can safely say that with the RE DLC (which by the way is free) it has become the best chapter in the series. Props to the devs. I have literally never seen devs respond so quickly or so dramatically to feedback from their fans. I'm blown away by the loyalty to the consumer base and the commitment to quality. These guys deserve your support so give this great game a shot.			"

												--UPDATE WITH 2.02--How I feel about this with hame at version 2.02 is the same as version 1.0, the only difference is that they fixed the ending which is pretty good.I want to say this before anything. I love the Sunrider series and it's great and it deserves more attention it should get.Now this....ugh...I waited for this for months, Am one of the few who pledged the full price before it was released. There was so much hype for this game and I guess I bought it into but I dont regret supporting the developers. Now lets get to the reviewI REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS GAME AND IT HAS IT MOMENTS BUT it broke my heart like my ex-fiance did to me. The game starts starts out great but get uninteresting and the plot becomes obivous and the ending is so horrible,so ♥♥♥♥ed up that you just be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for wasting the time. This game broke my heart. I'll make this simplePros-Better style(drawings of  certain characters-Theme song rocks!-Still funny as the First arrival and Mask of Arcadius-FAR BETTER ENDING THEN 1.0's ending Cons-PlotThe plot of this one is to take back Cera, a planet which has been hyped but it dies in this one. The story did a decent enough job but when you get to the end, you just end up not caring when you get the real ending. The plot was also really obivous who was the villian and the villian was a mary sue and had a dull personality-Story is short, about 4-6 hours- Combat is the same with no real improvements!-LAG!!! How can you have lag in a ♥♥♥♥ing novel where most of your game is ♥♥♥♥ing texts with pictures and nothing else? This isnt a true game! the game is poorly optimized and with the game running at a solid 5-10FPS in most cases especially if your trying to speed through a mission. Thankfully it only lags during battles.-Forced romance whiether you want to or not!-When one of the main characters die after rallying anyone in the final battle and everyone cries when they die, afterwards no one is cares afterwards, no memorial, no funeral, they dont talk to themselves about them besides Ava.-All character development was wasted besides Icari and Kyska.-NO combat scenes anymore(WTF) Scnes dont count lol-NO ENGLISH! as someone who speakes english and is a american, its hard to watch or read something in a different language but here its dumb. The first two games had small dialog of English but they fit and they sounded real where now they been replaced with japanese voice actors and sound so generic. They did to make money but still...- All supporting characters,ships,mechs still look out of place or havnt been updated with new graphics.- I felt as none of my choices didnt matter in the end I could do this forever but the bottom line, play First Arrival, Mask of Arcadicus and if you like those, pirate this and if you like, then buy it and support the developers. This game is not worth 25$, more like 10$			"

												Loved Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius? Loved Sunrider Academy? Love RPG-style visual novels in general? Well move along, because this game isn't what you're looking for.  There are only 2 or 3 choices throughout the game and, when you do make them, all your choices (from MoA, as well, which is a small plus) just provide flavor text without affecting anything in the story.  You don't even get a ship screen like you did in MoA.You're forced into a romance with one of the more boring girls,  just so her betrayal (via Alice) and death affect the protag more, though most players probably would've felt the shock and horror regardless , while Claude, Krysta, and Icari (best waifu) are all pushed to the wayside, and all interactions with Asaga and Ava are only there to provide jealousy.   Did you end up capturing Cosette? Well you never get to talk to her or try to persuade her to join you (though she'd obviously stab you in the back), as both her and L7NN are forgotten about fairly quickly.   Oh, and remember how in MoA you say a bunch of nice things to Sola and she starts falling for you? Well forget about that, now she's an emotionless drone who does nothing but observe Asaga.Aside from a few marked improvements in gameplay and art style which have been mentioned in other reviews, Sunrider: Liberation Day is just lazy and seems to only exist to put money into the pocket of the developer.  For the most part, it's a copy-paste of MoA with a few new units, and an altered (not upgraded) store/research system.  I honestly feel bad for those who supported this game on Patreon, because it feels like the developer just took all that Patreon money so he could take a trip to Japan and justify it with unneeded Japanese voice-acting.  I've seen a lot of backers leave since the release of this game, which I'm assuming are due to the fact that next to none of the expectations were met, so the next installment (oh yeah, it ends with a ""to be continued"") will probably be worse than Liberation Day if it even gets made.So to take away from this and other reviews, unless the game is heavily discounted or you can burn money, just wait for someone to do a ""Let's Play"" of it, because it'll be pretty much the same experience.

												Love in space has demonstrated something we don't often see on steam. Developers learning from their mistakes, and community interaction. The game had so many issues at launch. Where were the choices? why didn't we have a star map anymore? why didn't we have a ship map anymore? What the heck was that ending supposed to be? Luckily, the Devs took note of these issues and the game's mixed reviews of about 50%. Now with the 2.0 patch, restoring missing content and fixing issues, the games has a positive score of about 70%. Amazing. but the game is nowhere near perfect, you can't simply patch out the main story, but Love in Space, unlike others, made an effort. So without further praise, it is my pleasure to announce my review of.... Sunrider: Liberation Day What kind of game is this? How do you play? What do you do? Sunrider: LD is a tactical turn-based game set in space. It is a direct sequel to Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, preciously released on steam for free. It is also a visual novel. The story is told in a VN style outside of battles. It has heavy focus on story telling with fire emblem style battles. Your goal is to avenge your home planet of Cera after the tragic events of the 1st game.ControlsThe game is controlled entirely with the mouse.  Unless you intend to do some tinkering in the game's console, cheater.  It controls just fine. 10/10SoundThe game sounds great. Fantastic OST, with loads of voice acting. On top of that, the 2.0 patch brings back the old English voice actors from the 1st game. The theme song by Iced Blade is sold as DLC for a rather high price, but it retains the quality of everything listed. 10/10GraphicsThe game looks great. There are no 3D models, but that doesn’t hold it back at all. All 2D sprites are well crafted and look fantastic in HD. The OP and Vanguard cut scenes are well animated, as well as the combat animations. However, there is a slight lack of said cut scenes. I understand the development cost, and the fact that this is a visual novel, but it felt a bit empty to me. A return of the old battle cut scenes would be nice as well, for those of us who had a PC that could run them. 8.5/10DifficultyThe game's difficulty is completely up to you. Want to die forever? set it to the hardest mode. Just want the story? Set it to waifu mode. It fits almost every player, no matter what skill level. I found myself playing through on normal, and I still had to retry a few times, and I’m okay with that. 10/10StoryProbably where the game struggles most. You made your calls in the 1st game, and sure, it may alter the course of the game a little bit, but that’s the issue, a little bit. The biggest complaint about this game is the lack of choose-able routes for girls. No matter what you do, you will be forced into a route with 1 girl. The game has 8 female characters, but you have no call over who is your favorite. The 1.0 ending was confusing, but the 2.0 engine fixed it. Sadly, it could not fix other things that had already been done 5/10PerformanceThis game is a visual novel. it should run on a potato, right? No, you’re going to need 3gigs of ram and in I3 according to the specs. Why? because they're getting a turn-based strategy to run on a visual novel engine. Is this impressive? Yes! Is this how it should be programed? Probably not. Forgive me if I have no idea what I’m saying, perhaps I don’t understand. But I feel like the specs are way too high for a game with no 3d models. 4/10 OverallAs I said Sunrider LD is not a perfect game, but it is one that is worth the time the developers put into it. I can’t recommend you but it at is full price, as the story is too short, but it is a game that deserves to be played. If you haven’t already, I recommend you play the 1st Sunrider, and see what you think. I wish I could give this game a higher score, but it’s just not up to it. However, the story is not over, there will be a 4th installment to the series, and I expect nothing but greatness from the love in space development team7.5/10 - Recommended			"

												~[UPDATED REVIEW POST SPACE WHALE CLEAR + V2.0 RELEASE]~~[PRETTY MUCH SPOILER FREE]~V2.0 - THE ENDING HAS BEEN EXPANDED UPON AND IS NOW FAR BETTER (30-40 MINUTES MORE AFTERWARDS). I LIKED IT BEFORE BUT IT WAS A DIVISIVE PART OF THE GAME, EVEN I HAVE TO SAY IT'S A VAST IMPROVEMENT.Ok, just to get it out there, I'm a big fan of the series and have played everything attributed to Love in Space so i'm going to be biased. That said, I was a little disappointed with some parts of this game though I still very much recommend it provided you've played it's predecessors. This review will probably be quite long, so bear with me, if you find this unhelpful please leave a comment to clarify your gripes and I can try to improve it. Otherwise i'll assume it's simple downvote spam because I liked the game lol NEGATIVES:- Short. Much shorter than the pricetag suggests at first but similar in length to the previous installments so that should really be no surprise to any buyers who have actually played the games. V2.0 adds some extra length to the end of the story, around 25-40 mins or so of dialogue which helps.- Linear. Choices and dialogue options are incredibly restricted in this game to the point where there are somewhere in the ballpark of ~5 decisions to make in conversations. I'll come back to this later.V2.0 adds more choices into the extra story at the end of the game, though they aren't particularly big choices it's nice to have them- Cliché. Personally I am fine with clichés as long as they're done well, and I think this game succeeds at this. Some people will turn their nose up at it though, so it has to be mentioned.- POTENTIAL SPOILER WITH NO SPECIFICS:  Weird forced romance despite previous decisions. Some of us are wholly not into the pairing that is embedded into the story, but it plays a role so i'm ok with it. Some people will be more irritated than me though. - Feels.... Easier than MoA? Maybe it's the new systems for upgrades and equipment or the combat tweaks, but it felt easier than the previous games up until very late in. This might disappoint some. Draw Fire is particularly overpowered right now, though that may be addressed at some point.- Spelling and grammatical errors. Eh who cares, it totals a massive 3-4 mistakes in my playthrough. Nothing particularly bad.Ok enough of that depressing♥♥♥♥♥♥lets get to why I still love this gamePOSITIVES:- Imports your save from the previous games. Helps you feel like it's a direct continuation of your game, though as i've only done a playthrough and a half I haven't seen all the differences previous choices can make, will probably update this in future when It's more clear how much it affects the game- Vast improvements to combat and combat animations. The jumps to closeups and clunky attack animation screens of the previous games are reduced or cut to make combat look and feel more fluid. Flak, shields and armour are much more visible than before making it easier to make decisions in battle- Visual upgrades. This game looks amazing, pretty much every character and scene is fantastic and the in-cockpit screens are beautiful. The one exception being the admiral as always. His face reminds me of raisins and haunts me.- Voice acting. Pretty much fully voiced, though only in japanese. This is FINE. People of course are complaining about it, and with V2.0 they added the ENG battle voices back into the game (same as the MoA voices) with an option to disable the Japanese story voiceover. - Shop/Upgrade system overhaul. Two resources, one for buying equipment and one for upgrading your ryders and the sunrider. You can undo your upgrades at any time and reallocate the intel to other areas if you're having trouble with a specific thing. ( PLEASE DO THIS TO MAKE IT EASIER GUYS ) Soo much better than before.- Free restoration patch to remove the censorship. It's pinned in the discussions by the dev, so be sure to get this straight away or you're not playing the ""full"" game.- GREAT story. Yes it's a little cliche, yes one or two of the twists are pretty obvious ( NOT THAT LAST ONE DON'T YOU DARE LIE ). It's pretty linear, but i've only done one playthrough with my main save so I haven't seen all the options yet (a lot of the bonus stuff is still locked so there is more) The ending was a point of contention in the community, but with V2.0 they've greatly expanded upon it and objectively it is a more fleshed out ending. It carries a little less impact than the original in my opinion, but it's still enough to keep you hyped for the next installment of the game.So here you go, I recommend this game and it's franchise to anyone who likes turn based strategy games, Visual novels, space operas, mechs or sci-fi Anime/MangaV1.0 = 8 / 10V2.0 = 9 / 10MoA = 9 / 10Would definitely cover myself in butter and slide about in this game again.I'm commander shepard and Sunrider is my favorite franchise on the citadel.~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL EARLY REVIEW~~~~~~~~~~~~~It's finally here, and even just a few minutes in you can tell it's well worth the wait. -IMPORTS YOUR SAVE FROM MoA!!!!! (Or tailor your own list of choices from the previous games)-Vast improvements to combat and combat animations (Soo smooth!)-Impressive visual upgrades including awesome in-cockpit screens-Tons of voice acted scenes so far (Seemingly only in Japanese with English subs)-Improved shop and upgrade system (we'll be seeing those a lot...)-FREE PATCH TO REMOVE THE CENSORSHIP (Pinned in the discussions)Oh baby, I'm ready. Pass me the butter.			"

												I quite liked Mask of Arcadius and was excited to play this game. Unfortunately it was a very different experince but not all change is bad so let's discuss the improvments of Liberation Day:-The art is better-The UI is easier to read-The overlong combat animations are goneThose are the improvments. Now let's take a look at all the ways this game has changed for the worse compared to its predecessor.First and most suprisingly: this game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Strange for a visual novel with some strategy combat and less animations than the first game. Strange for this to be a problem on a PC that can run The Witcher 3 on rather high settings without problems. And it is strage that it is so bad that the stutering actually made me select the wrong options multiple times because the game couldn't keep up with my mouse. This is just unacceptable.Secondly the lenght. By all accounts this game is way shorter than Mask of Arcadius (which was free), there are plenty of games for half the price of this one that will give you many times the value.And finally my biggest problem: linearity. Mask of Arcadius had quite a few choices. Such as simple dialoge options, who to talk to between missions, what missions to take and even a few moral dilemmas that took quite some time for me to decide on. Nothing of the sort here. There are hardly any dialoge options, you do all missions in a set order and there is mabey one choice that affects the story.To close this little review I wish to ask an open question for any passing Einstien to answer: Why in the name of all that is holy would you write a cast consisting almost exclusively of cute anime girls and then force the player to romance the most boring one? It boggles the mind! I have a lot of thinking to do. In short: unless you are a millionaire you probaly have better things to spend your money on. Give it a miss.			"

												I don't believe the game is worth the price.Compared to the previous iteration the story is thin, there are fewer choices and there is a forced romance you cannot skip. Not to mention all the bugs.When i heard about the kneejerk reaction to fix things with a v2.0 patch. I was skeptical. What could they possibly fix i said to myself? how long will it take them?They suprised me by releasing it in under a week. What even suprised me even more was the quality of the patch. It was good and added allot to the story (at the end). They even tossed in a few more choices. Even if they are illusional.I am recommending this game not because i believe it is worth purchasing in its current state, but because I witnessed a developer/company who respectfully listened to their fans feedback and tried to find a solution.Good Job. Please make a great game next time.			"

												This Game... Rarely have i seen so much investment in an indie visual novel franchise, which proves that we as the fanbase really care about Sunrider. This game isn't perfect, but does it really deserve such a backlash? The problem is that people compare it to MOA and yes, compared to it Liberation day does seem to lack in a few parts. But the game is still awesome for what it is. The combat, which was already great in MOA, has improved quite a lot. And i'm not only talking about the animations. It is much more balanced now, and Ryders that were frickin useless in MOA (I'm looking at you, Icari) now kick some serious ***. The Upgrade and Store mechanics have improved, the Visuals, bla bla bla. So, the major problem people have is the story. It's... fine. It continues the story of MOA in a logical sense with a few ( :P ) twists at the end. I would hate to see the Sunrider franchise come to an end because of lackluster sales and i seriously hope people will give it a try because all in all, it's still a really good game and a great Space Opera			"

												I have been waiting on this game for so long. but I am disappointed to see that the options are so limited.Not to mention that there are some serious lag issues, along with frequent crashing.Some of the music is fairly good, which I can appreciate. Same goes for the art.But overall, I find this game rather disappointing.I haven't even come that far and I have already had the game crash on me multiple times. Battles lag immensely. Animated cutscenes are basically a slideshow.I'm not all that happy with this game, Love in Space. I was so hoping for a good finale to the series, only to find that it's impossible for me to even get through a combat section without the thing crashing on me.			"

												***This review is for the ""1.0"" version of the game at release. This will be altered when 2.0 is released***Now don't get me wrong I adore this game series, it happens to be my favourite series of all time, and normally I wouldn't leave a review till I'd 100%'d the game or had a reasonable amount of hours but I think some feedback is needed here. I understand the problems with getting 'hyped' for a game and what it can do to your expectations so I did my very best to moderate my excitedness for this game ever since it was announced however that didn't seem to help.This isn't a bad game for what it offers and there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been said by some of the other reviews but what I can say is that this game could have been so much more and  should  have been so much more. It lacks what I loved in Academy. The gameplay is solid, except for the fact it takes me 20 minutes to select a unit, and the story it offers is good as a continuation from Mask of Arcadius but, as said before, it could have been so much more. The game contains no romantic choice whatsoever which was probably what angered me the most (Yes I know it may not have made sense in the context of MoA's story). From memory there are about maybe 4 choices at the most in the game which begs the question of ""Why not just make it linear?"" consider there is really only one logical choice in them. The choice really feels forced.I never actually thought I'd leave a negative review for any game at all in this series consider how much I love it but I don't feel right just leaving this alone. I don't want a refund. I take a form of dumb pride having this in my library because I love these games so much so I'd never even consider something like that. I just feel the game underperforms for it's pricetag.Apologies if this is poorly written. I decided not to spend 20 hours on the review itself which is coincidentally  much more time than I would have spent in game.			"

												If you liked Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, you're going to like this game as well. The strategy part of the game is mostly unchanged and still quite challenging and fun (if you don't want a challenge, difficulty settings are available). Granted, through some parts the story feels somewhat rushed and you might not like the romance the game forces your character into, but do yourself the favor and keep playing (I'm not going to spoil anything but trust me, it's worth it). Also, by finishing the main storyline you unlock the [RE]turn DLC content, which is a kind of ""what if"" scenario that gives you a lot of the choices you may have missed during the main storyline.Overall, I'd recommend this game. Any mistakes the devs made while developing this game have been adressed which shows that they care about player feedback. At this rate, the only downside is that we're going to have to wait another two years or so for the sequel.			"
