												No control options, horrible camera views, non existant physics. Equipment that should weigh tons bounces around like a go kart. Don't waste your time. I've been in construction my whole life so when I see something like this it makes me think my son would get to see a glimpse what it's like...nope. Pass on this junk.			"

												*Un Bias Review 2.0!* Ok First off I would like to say I am sorry for my first review it was mostly because I was in a bad mood after buying the game. There are a few things that I missed on my first playthrough. 1 There is a settings menu, which is great! unfortuatly messing around with the resolution a bit broke the game, my second screen, and my steam, Some how it inverted the colors and filled the screen with dots. Even then the menu screens still were in the wrong resolution and had big black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, In game it fit the screen fine. The second problem I ran into was to do with the physics, I had alot of very bad clipping problems with a few of them resulting in my loader or what ever I was picking up flying into the wall. The third problem was that nothing had any weight or feel to it, it felt as if I was driving a hover loader picking up things with a anti gravity device or something, because they all just slid around on the floor. The fourth thing was the default music was way too loud. While looking in the settings tab I found you could import your own music *HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ More games need to do that! I can see they were aiming for a realistic feel to the game but it was a bit off. When you are in the first person view you can't see very much so I use the free cam, the only problem with the free cam is most of the sounds are missing when you go into free cam *Engine sounds, Debris hitting the floor ect* The physics just freeze sometimes, the game is still running *rain falling and such* but the loader doesnt move at all. The game runs pretty choppy with fps drops about every 50 seconds. I will list my full pc specs aswell *16GB of RipJaw Z series ddr3 ram, Msi 970A G46, Amd fx 8350 Black Edition running at 4.0Ghz, Radeon 7870 Ghz Editio (Yes I know its bottlenecking right now I am saving up for another one but money is tight right now) and a 750W power suply* There we go I hope this review is less Bias :)			"

												Well I have played 4 hours of it upon writing this review. I am not quite sure where the complaints are coming from but here is my personal experience. Brace yourself it is not exactly short. This will more be a review for people who want a bit more detail of the game instead of just a ""it sucks"" type of review.Camera:Press C and get into outside view, use left mouse button and can move camera any angle you like.I could post the suggestion to maybe in the future put more camera control in all the views.Graphics:I have not seen an issue there either, when launching game it gives you options to change settings and so far am getting basically what I see in the trailer. If you experience lag, just lower your settings. It has its bumps and jolts here and there but nothing to make it unplayable for me.(Will also add I am not sure how peoples CPUs and GPUs are overheating, Mine are all within normal temperature while running this game)Gameplay:Challenging at times. But I enjoy a challenge. The game will require you to take your time and go slow at times, you are not a racecar driver. But if you do you can complete your challenges, I have been able to complete all them first try so far.You can flip your vehicles over so be careful. To me this just gets you to be careful while playing and adds to the challenge.Yes some things will bounce around, but I only seemed to have that problem if I went at it like a bat out of hell. It just convinced me to take my time doing it which honestly allowed me to enjoy the game more.I find it to be a decent simulation, you are doing just as it describes. If the game made it too easy on you and were able to rush whole thing would not be any playablitity.This game I think is suitable for people into this genre of games, you must be willing to accept this genre before enjoying it. It will not be for everyone.TipsAs for anyone having crashes or not starting here is some things I personally found that helped if I ever get an error. 1) Do windows updates2)Restart computer3) Launch settings instead of game, click save and play. I have had this fix errors even if I didn't change the settings, is this gamebreaking? Not really as it is a 2 second solution. (If this is your problem. Not saying it will solve everyones but solved mine.)Conclusion:Is the game perfect? No, I am not saying it is, it has its flaws but what game doesn't?The developer has also been quite active with the community to take in feedback which is a plus. Just give him your feedback if you see something, at least this game has an active one.As for the price range, it is only $15, it is not like it is a $40-$60 AAA simulator game. I think the price range for this and how the game plays out is quite worth it for that range for people interested in the genre.If I encouter any game breaking problems I will post it as well but so far my game is still running fine with the exception of the couple things I mentioned, all minor to me.

												Controls cannot be reconfigured.Machinery has self-centering steering even when stationary which makes it almost impossible to drive.Machinery has no suspension and the 4WD works intermittently making your machine remain stationary with wheel spin and then launch forward.I gave up in the 2nd mission when you're meant to pickup bricks but the bricks magically bounce back out of your loader bucket when you stop.

												Poorly optimized, graphics aren't too good and are covred up with intense lighting. I couldn't play the game because it was so laggy. I was sporting a hard 60 fps sitting in the tractor, literally as soon as the bucket hit the bricks, my fps dropped to 5 fps. Awful, just awful. I would get a refund, but it came with 3 other games for 99 cent, and one of them is actually fun.			"

												8 out of 42 players like this game.Graphics are okay assuming you have high end SLI'd GPU's.Controls aren't good enough to be considered, ARCADE;  this game should not even be under the category of simulation.40 pound rocks can make the Bulldozer flip over; no exaggeration.No speed range.  There are only 2 speeds: Fast and Out of Control.Running over 40 pound rocks can cause you to loose what you just scooped up from the ground; no physics at all.I am seriously thinking about reporting this game to the Better Business Bureau; it should be banned from America.

												Wouldn't recommend this game.  The only settings available to change from the UI are sound, graphical quality, vsync and soft-shadows.  It hard locks the resolution @ 640x480 which on a 1080p monitor looks horrible.  In addition the vehicles are way to touchy and no where near realistic.A bit on the vehicles, they move too fast.  When trying to do something that requires percision, that is not an ability.  Most controls are centered to the left side of the keyboard.  WSAD for movement, RF,TG for bucket controls,  It just feels un-natural.  You should be able to select your speed when operating the machine.  In addition to the machines running way to fast, they bounce all over the place.  Or when you pick up an item in your bucket it bounces right out of said bucket.  It makes it hard to finish any of the missions.I'd rate it a 2 out of 10.  And that is only for the concept of the game.  If it was better implemented it would be a better game overall.  I would recommend passing on this game.			"

												Dont buy. There are soo many things that is not right, and i have a -really- low standard for odd games. (For example i own most of the german indie titles for construction, building, towing, transporting etc).Graphics: Not all to chabby, but stutters even on low settings.Physics: Let's not go there at all.Camera: Well, uhm, it's just bad.Gameplay: You cant move the camera *and* drive at the same time. As soon as you move the camera, your veichle stops.There is problems scooping up stuff in general with loader and buckets. Debris just bounce around and out.Soo, in conclusion, save your money. I bought it as i can tolerate most odd games, even bad ones. This is just worse./Rikard			"

												Playway great developers they try hard and then they try even harder despite what people think they stick to it and keep going forwards.Well i have a soft spot for most sim games this game is a bunch of fun im enjoying it and every one is entitled to there own opinion and you will always have negative people but i just tune them out.The game play is great alot to do if you want to do it right the graphics are good with every thing set to max under launch option not shore how people are over heating but with everything set to max CPU runs at 37c and GPU runs at 42c The textures could use little touching up some are little fuzzy not shore if its he type of texture used or the way they are rendered or just me playing with optionsControls can be a little frustrating at times they can be rather sensitive but if you take your time and be gentle you can overcome thisThe game has good game-play with contracts mode free-play mode and challenge mode they are all fun nice range of vehicles but i believe shared vehicle psychics is the only down side but considering the price i can live with thatBest of all the developers are active taking suggestions and then fixing the game which seems to be the playway way of doing things which is great and for small price of $14.99 its great value for money			"

												I am really disapointed. For a game thats is called construction machines there is really very little constructing going on. Ive come half way through the game and all i have been doing so far is loading and unloading and pouring some concrete that took  less than 60 sec to complete. The missions are really short, however this is a good thing, the machines in the game are so bad it would be torture to have longer missions. The title is great, everything else isnt. The gameplay feels akward and like an early beta, controls are akward and not acurate at all, even driving around feels strange. Shame, with a little more work, this game could maybe even work.			"

Physics not existing! camera controls (not existing) even you use ""c"" key to change view it zooms in to bucket or cabin quickly. gave up on 3rd mission. Camera angles makes your spine get into weird shapes to be able to understand the perspective. all machinery feels like you have 6 v16 engines with nitro put in. slow movement is not possible. so you ram into your other machinery and tumble it down so easily. got this game for under 1 dollars pn sale but worths less than that. Which non of these is a limitation for the year it has been released. there was a lot of good physics in any game in around 2014. its purely a bad game.			"

												Poor physics makes the game impossible to play, especially when not using an analog controller.I truly regret spending 12 EURO on this game..... :-(Joints on the machines act like theyve been attached with rubber bands, like when u put stress on them, theyll actually come apart and get drawn back together by an invisible force.The game seems to combine the worst of reality and arcade into a big mess, which boils down to a truly crappy game.Even older construction sims are way better than this one, its so disappointing and thats prolly why theres no trial download either, because they know that no one would buy it once theyve tried it.I pretty much feel scammed by buying this game, all i can hope for is, that the mnoney I and others spent here, will go into supporting development of a descent new version of this game...

												So now I have given the game half a chance and played it for a while, I do have to say that giving the game further time didnt help it at all just frustrate me further. The controls are poor at best, they have not even used common controls. The camera angles that you operate from are far from anything decent so the number of times I have had to remote camera just to see how close to an object is rediculous. Having a camera anglethat can be chase view with the ability to pan and tilt etc would have made it better. The game is really buggy and it feels unfinished or unpolished so to speak, but I would have to say vehicle control, camera views and gameplay really needs some work.			"

If only i could make Helicopter Simulator 2014: Search And Rescue to work as well, that would be a charm.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4llsgi_construction-machines-2014-how-to-run-it-in-windows-7-64-bit_videogames


YouTube™ Video: Construction Machines 2014 - How to run it in Windows 7 64 bit 

			Views: 8		

			It's pretty straightforward; set compatibility mode to Windows XP (Service Pack 3). Dunno why so many people can't run it. My guess is - some tweaking may be required initially.		

It's quite fun; i would probably play more of this. Despite its fun factor, one has a better appreciation of the people who are in this profession. They make it look too easy.Frame rate is ok; just need to adjust settings in the launcher to suit your system capability. I can get more than 60 fps if various options are set to very low on my potato PC notebook. Keyboard is used for avatar and vehicle movement while mouse is for camera. Camera views are rotatable and zoomable for external view but the cockpit view is tied to steering motion so it's a bit inconvenient to use.1st job:http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4lm6ox_construction-machines-2014-job-1-move-debris_videogamesUpdate - 2nd jobWhile the first job is easy depending on how you want to play it 'coz you can just push everything into the pit, no need to carry them in the bucket. The 2nd job is needlessly difficult. For one thing, you're supposed to load bricks onto the truck. That is fine and good BUT the bricks are scattered all over the place, not in piles as you may expect but in single pieces. Simulation detail levelTo exacerbate the task, the boom arm motion is jerky and the vehicle motion is also jerky in that it has ridiculously quick acceleration. Initially, the quick acceleration was fun in the first job but not in the this one as it makes moving the bricks frustrating 'coz it tends to bounce and fall off. Incidentally it's very difficult to scoop and carry more than one brick at a time as said before the bricks tend to fall off. Even though some bouncy motion is probably normal for Wheel Loaders, it seems excessive in this simulator; there isn't enough damping IMO but this may be due to my choice of physics realism. I will try again with the most realistic option and update this review if there is improvement.Watch a real Wheel Loader at work and see if you agree:

Flawed mission designSo if we are going to struggle to load one brick at a time, what's the point of using a heavy lifter? A human being could do a far better and quicker job; just throw the bricks onto the truck! Anyway i'm gonna try to finish this job 'coz i hate myself. No really i just want to see what's up next and next and so on.GraphicsThe 2nd job shows the range of atmospheric and time effects. It takes place in dark rainy conditions. The ground is wet, shiny and slippery so it isn't just eye candy, there are physical effects on vehicle handling.Career ProgressionThere's continuity and a persistent world in that the construction yard is in the same mess as you left it before in the previous job so that's an interesting twist of small strategic element. Your previous vehicle remain the same color and you can choose a different color for your next vehicle. I presume that in advanced stages you could either have color coded fleet or uniformity for your fleet. Avatar functionThe avatar doesn't seem to have any useful function to manipulate objects so that the mess you made can be rectified and re-arranged neatly or to kick objects into the pit. Even if you could kick or bump objects around, its awkward movement and control makes it impractical. It's only purpose seem to be to personalise the career mode. Perhaps it can be used to corral the bricks into sizable heaps so that the Wheel Loader can pick it up more easily. Incidentally the avatar's jumping motion isn't smooth nor believable but it's funny and it has some semblance of MJ style of moonwalking when walking backwards. No side-stepping in 3rd person view....Third update (regarding the Flawed mission)My bad, the bricks are larger than the common red bricks found on non-loadbearing brickwalls; it's too heavy for a man to lift. I tried kicking it... wouldn't budge so we are back to scouring the ground for scattered bricks. Therefore it's still a flawed mission IMO.... 4th update (Flawed mission - not really)Ok so i was a bit hasty with preconceived notions that it would be too difficult or tedious. Reason is twofold. First it wasn't so hard once realistic physics is applied and you take advantage of a bit forward momentum when scooping bricks. 2nd reason is that you needn't collect all the bricks lying on the ground and enough bricks are around to practice scooping techniques....End of 4th update.End of update (about 2nd job)SummationBought this in PlayWay Sim bundle so it's a good deal. Haven't seen any game breaking bug. Of course it's a little too early to tell as i have not completed the game yet. Most of the time was spent trying to find the right settings for my notebook PC.Only 1 minor bug encountered in the beginning during the short tutorial; the mouselook was inverted when on foot in first person perspective. External vehicle view has no problem rotating the right way. Had to delete profile and recreate a new one for the problem to disappear. I hope it doesn't recur later in the Career,So far no regrets buying at this low price, Worth it i think. You can even customize your own music playlist but it has to be in ogg format. So if you want to squeeze a bit more performance, you can use a lower bit rate for the music files.Despite its quirkiness, it's a fun game with refreshing and upbeat music, the likes of which was heard in Capitalism Plus. Its clunky handling can be mitigated somewhat by careful use of movement keys and bucket loads of patience.Score? hmm maybe 6.5/10... revised to 7.5/10 after completing job #2.addendumHere is a recently updated video of what was mentioned about the 2nd job.http://dai.ly/x4lpl0r "

												In short, a polished turd. The control system is horrible, with touchy WASD control and no option to use controller input. Combine that with an awful camera system which doesn't even let you pan or zoom - pretty frustrating as the camera is always in an inconvenient location. Even Demolition Company allows these basic things.Despite its appearance, this game does no better job handling physics than other similar titles. Bulldozers bounce around the map and drive like go karts.I think the developers spent more time on the glossy UI than they did on the core of the game.			"

												I would like to recommend this game - equipment simulators are often sincere, dedicated to their simple premise, and deliver on a lowball promise to replicate the experience of using these machines.  It's not flashy, or dramatic, but much like model railways, there's an enduring interest in simulation.Certainly, all the stuff you expect is in this game - a variety of machines, even a first person view as you run around your machine, check it out, and jump in your vehicle, steer, drive, operate the bucket with simulated levers.   Doing jobs earns you money, which you spend to buy better equipment, so it has a nice progression/career system.In the case of this game, however - the technical settings let everything down.  No support for 4K means the game is now effectively dead for all machines of the future.  I'll be happy to review my review if they ever fix it, but until then, gaming moves on, and the developers have chosen, through inaction, to let Construction Machines 2014 stay behind.			"

												I don't feel like wasting my time reviewing this game so to keep it simple don't buy it. The controls are awful the mechanics within the game don't work at all and when they do are pitiful at best. The graphics especially on the character model are just awful and are seemingly done straight out of the PS1 era. And lastly for 7 dollars you could actually nab up a good game. Just keep the money in your pocket and leave this one on the shelf. 2/10 Certainly not a game I would soon play again if ever. If you would like to see some gameplay where I can't even beat the level because the game is so awfully put together here is a link.

												Disclaimer: Reviewed using press copyA wise man once said, ""The goal of our lives...to fill holes."" Powerful, and true, like pre-plastic Pamela Anderson. This game is definitely full of bugs and runs absolutely awful, but I haven't played a decent construction sim since like demolition company in 2012I had fun with this! The first mission just pushing stuff into a hole is basically the best parks & recreation simulator I've ever played. I tried getting the super big pole into the hole but I knew it wouldn't fit, unfortunately some glitchy stuff happened and it got stuck which sucked. There were 2 poles but if 1 was so much work I didn't even wanna try both.moral of the story just try to fill your holes with whatever and enjoy the experience, construction sites are hot and hard when you're by yourself. if you guys have any tips on getting the big towering rusty pole (or both!!) into the first hole leave a comment! <3 xoxoxo3 out of 5. also there's a settings config launch option from within steam, click around in that it might fix some issues.

												I don't know where to begin. Right now I don't know if I can recommend Advanced Warfare because of how buggy it can be. Sometimes it will connect to a match and either take longer than usual and the match has already started (even though I join before the lobby has connected) or it'll freeze whilst ""synchronising settings"" and then quit due to connection failure or something. When playing online, I cannot tell you how ANNOYING it is to be mauled by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weilding a laser. Oh, and it's not just the odd one, I mean I faced an ENTIRE TEAM full of them at one point lol. They take no skill because you can literally use it like a bloody lightsaber! The singleplayer is... typical COD. No innovation. I mean, Black Ops II had a branching storyline for God's sake. I skipped Ghosts altogether due to the rather rubbish reviews for the PC version. But, seems like Sledgehammer Games are afraid of being risky and adventurous with a story. My brother, who hardly plays games full stop, decided to give this new COD a crack, and casually breezed through it in a few nights.On top of all of this, the game likes to quit completely and recommend ""Safe Mode"" due to DirectX errors. I have like every version of DirectX that I need (and the game will go ahead and install the ones it needs anyway...). My PC is good enoguh to run this, but even on ""Optimal"" it still has errors. I'm talking 8 GB of RAM, Core i5 4690K, GTX 660. However, this isn't the first game as good ol' Need for Speed: Rivals does it too. I'm not the only one. But, what can I do?Also, if I crank up the settings up to maximum and play the story, the textures are aweful! Flat and no visual substance whatsoever. Plus, it runs like poop. Oh, but do ""Optimal Settings"" and things are fine. I don't get it.I've had fun with this title, when the connection is good and stable. But I can't quite recommend this in the condition it is in. Activision need to promote the idea of ""bug checking"" and ""ensuring EVERY verison of our game is up to scratch"" and not, yet again, leave us PC players feeling left behind.11/10 would construct again			"

												When I purchased Construction Machines 2014, I tried my best to ignore the mostly negative reviews in hopes that it would be a really cool game I could enjoy. I've gotta say I should have listened to the reviews. I love the premise of the game: you're a construction business owner and you have to perform ""contracts"" (in which each contract is a small task like moving rocks or picking up bricks) to earn more money, buy new machines to have fun with and ultimately expand your business. The prospect of the new tasks are fun, but once it comes time to actually do them it just leaves you disappointed and actually frusturated. The controls are very sensitive yet completely unresponsive at the same time. For example, if you're attemting to gently manuever the front end loader around a rock so you don't hit it, just tapping the turning keys lightly doesn't turn the vehicle at all. However if you hold the key in for a slight second longer it turns the vehicle almost all of the way. One would believe performing pinpoint manuevers is a necessity in a cluttered construction yard but this game won't allow for it. Oh, it's worth mentioning if you actually DO run over the rock or obstacles you were trying to avoid, the physics are so bad that the whole truck behaves like a stiff piece wood with no shock absorbers at all and it just looks pathetic rigidly shaking around over what you just hit. The engines sound like a lawn tractor and they don't change noises based on your engine RPM's or activity, it just sounds like it's a constant idle. The music is so bad and repetitive I actually just shut it off completely and listened to the constantly-idling engine which then became annoying in itself. The graphics on the ""high"" setting also resemble that of a bad Nintendo 64 game but the camera angles are so frusturating to deal with so you barely get to see any of the poor graphics anyway! All in all it was a supurb idea that was poorly delivered in every way shape or form. I give it a 2 out of 5 for the excellent concept but totally poor construction (pun intended.) Save your hard-earned money and purchase something else gamers!			"

												FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! Worse camera angles and physics EVER the controls are VERY bad. just trying to get things into your bucket is a MASSIVE challenge with the camera glitching your every move and the ""debris"" with its weird physics just doesnt seem to WANT to go into said bucket.

												this is really bad. aside of the bad controls (it's impossible to make a machine exactly what you want) also the physics is really broken: heavy rocks look like they're made of paper or rubber when they bounce all around the place. avoid this game!			"

												Bad controls, horrible camera angles that make the game almost impossible to know what you are doing, and zero physics, it took a ver long time to pick up a brick becuase it glitched around and phased through things. Advanced physics and realistic contols? Bullcrap. BRUTAL DO NOT BUY!			"
