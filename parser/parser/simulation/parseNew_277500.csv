												Ok ill burst the bubble.Most look at the screenies and think is this a facebook game?Answer is yes, graphics and gameplay is totally facebook.You even click stars that appear on the ground!All you do is lay a field , click harvest etc, and do the same again, once money is earned you can buy a second field and repeat.This is my first impression of such a short play but this is the game straight away soon as you start playing, this is just my honest impression.As for bugs, yes there are bugs, like fields getting stuck and wont grow, only option you have is to restart the field all over again, this means it could actually bankrupt you and game ends.The timer does not stop for everything either, you could miss a step on your field because a pop up window opens and you have missed the timer on your field to click to send it into the next stage.I love these type of games but i am being honest here after only playing this game a short while, so yes this is a early impression.Games like this belong on facebook not on steam in my opinion.

												This is my first review and I feel like I should express my feeling after playing this game for 2 hrs so noone would have to face the same expirience. This game is boring. There are lots of flaw in this game for example:- No auto-feed for livestocks so you have to feed them by clicking. Imaging you have like 10+ barns- Kinda broken. You can earn a lot of money from selling produced food e.g steak and chicken meat. There is no need to plant any crop- AI is way stupid. It will do almost nothing. You will feel like you're playing alone.- No way to cure disease for your crop!?- Background music is lame and repeatitive- No shortkeys so you have to click everything (Facebook style)- Way too easy to play. And you have to collect more stars to unlock more stuff with aren't worth unlocking.The only good thing about this game is it tells you the suitable temperature for each crop so you might be able to try to plant them in real life (I guess). That's all I could think of...Sorry for my bad English..			"

												This Game is BOOOOOORING!The Tutorial is really slow, and is a bit irritating.i have played about an hour of freeplay, and either i have not found it or it has no automation at all!wich is infuriating if you have 15 cow stables and everyone needs to be klicked twice every minute.also the UI is suboptimal, it is too complicatet too sell stuff (again no auto), and every window needs too be closed by clicking a 3 pixel X, before its possible to do other things, like open the window you wanted to open in the first place, but you misclicked because the mouseovers are too slow, and the buttons for the menu are not intiutive.One might say i have not played enough to Judge, but i say this game punishes you for playing, so iÂ´m not trying again!SincerlyNordfalkeP.S.

												Farming World is an isometric farm management game. You'll setup fields, till them, plant crops, wait, pesticide, harvest and market them. Then repeat the process over and over. There are frills like buildings that let you have animals and others that turn your produce into better products like canned goods. Its all a nice system, but its just monotonous. Even though there is a 100x speed up, there is a lot of downtime during the winter if you don't have 12 month produce.The game menu is pretty easy. It consists of options, buy menu, land agreement menu, market menu, contracts menu (which I didn't need once), statistics and the bank. The menus feel click heavy. When you open one menu you need to click close to put it away instead of being able to click something else. The mouse wheel doesn't scroll the game menus. The main screen has a nice ticker at the bottom that tells you when things have finished. The top of the screen has a nice array of your capacity for equipment, storage, cooled storage and grain storage.There are three modes to chose from, tutorial, campaign and freeplay. Each one of them starts you off with the same farm. I've played the tutorial three times and somehow never finished it due to the game not recognizing that I did exactly what it asked me to. The campaign and free play are identical except the campaign has a 'rival.' A computer run farm that up until 5 hours in, I never knew it existed. Its not an emphasis. Its just there. There's no competition.Both modes have you select the country, difficulty and color of your machines. Then you just play until you lose. If you fall into debt you can get a loan from the bank and the terms you'll repay it. If you can't repay it, that's a game over. If you have no money, you can't hire workers to harvest your crops. The bank will only let you get one loan at a time. The campaignOn the surface it looks like a Farmville game, but after almost five hours of playing, I'd say its worse. There are fewer clicks in a Farmville game. Luckily in this game you can increase game speed. You can setup a field and make the size of it. Then you need to buy or rent the land for your field. After that, you need to click the field, click to till the land. The game will ask you if you want to buy or rent the equipment. If you have the money, always buy the equipment. If not, renting is cheaper. There seems to be a flat rate for renting. After that, you'll need to fertilize the field and rent or buy the equipment. Once that gets done, you'll need to plant the crop. Luckily you can hire an advisory for a week, but just read the stats on each of the crops. There are dozens of crops to chose from and you'll see how long each of the four life phases take. From a seedling to maturity. The game shows you how much water, temperature each plant needs. If you don't have the conditions it has a ! next to it. Meaning your crop isn't geared toward success.Once you select the crop, you need to buy or rent the equipment. After that, you need to wait for the crop to grow into a different phase of its life. You can click to auto water crops that drop below 50% water. If you don't auto water, you'll be clicking over and over again on each field to water it. Then you can use pesticide on it. The choice is yours, organic, or synthetic. Each has its own success rate. The market wants organic, but there is less protection. Then when the crop has entered its next phase, you can use a second dose of pesticide on it and buy or rent the equipment. Eventually, the crop will mature and you'll see a percentage grow and grow. That percentage is how much of the crop has matured. If you harvest at 50% you get 50% of your crop instead of 100%. If you planted your crop too late in a season, it might freeze. So that's the challenge. Finally, you hire workers to harvest the crop. What I mean by hire, just click on an icon and poof it goes right to work harvesting. To harvest a crop, you need the warehouse space. If you don't have the space, buy a bigger warehouse.Now that you have harvested a crop, you can click the market tab where you sell your crop by sliding a bar and clicking the sell icon. Everything you sell, whether its crops, milk, meat or produce has a market value, which fluctuates like it does in real life. So its a slight gamble. If you want more money, you will have to construct buildings. Fruits and vegetables can be canned or juiced. Flowers can be put into bouquets at a florist. Grains can be baked into bread. Meats can be butchered. Milks can be processed into dairy. Stuff like that. Each building can turn one thing into another thing. Then you sell those things at market.You can rotate your crops and have two crops or more per year. Some need to grow from the start spring til the end of summer, so you can fit in a different crop in the fall until the winter freeze. Over the winter is where the waiting comes in. Sure you can grow crops in frigid weather and have most of them die, but you can also wait. When waiting, you can speed things up to 100 times as fast, but at the every month, there is a finances popup that requires you to close it. This seems unnecessary. I should just have the money put into an account. It just makes a long waiting process even longer.Like crops, you can have livestock too. Horses, cows, chickens, goats and cattle. Construct buildings for them, then highlight the buildings, and select the type of animal to put in there. There's no extra cost for a milk cow building vs a horse stable. Its all the same building, which seems like a forgotten detail. Thankfully you can autofeed animals like you can autowater fields. When the animals get old enough they begin to produce milk and eggs. You can also sell them at that time as well. Animals will mature and grow old where they won't produce, nor will they be as valuable when you market them. The only problem with animals is the fact that their fences break. You'll need to find which building has a broken fence. If you have 10 buildings with animals, you need to click on all them to find which has the broken fence. It happens once a year to each animal building.Once you get the rhythm down you can run a successful farm pretty easy. However, with it so successful on a small scale, I didn't feel the need to keep increasing the size of my farm once I was making $100,000 a year off lavender, carrots and milk.The game offers a nice sort of progression with stars. For every filed you harvest, you get a star. These stars get used to unlock everything. Better equipment, better workers, plants, animals, buildings. Everything needs to get unlocked. The game starts you with a few stars so you unlock what you want to. Its a nice system, but there's no need to unlock everything when you're making so much profit per year.When you run out of storage, silo or garage space, you'll have to buy more buildings. The game lets you unlock bigger buildings. You can even unlock better machinery and workers. They work faster and have slightly higher percentages, but if the default is 90% efficiency. The cost of stars isn't worth having 100% efficiency even if they work twice as fast. Everything already takes a day. Perhaps giant farms might need that.With all that said, the game is just dull. It works well enough, but I don't feel the need to make my farm bigger and better. It lacks scenarios or any variety to make one playthrough different than the next. The only replay value I can think of is your own choice. If you decide to have goats instead of cows. It is a functional game with no frills. No rivals, no challenges, no diversity from one year to the next. The fences will always break. I will always till, fertilize, plant, spray, spray 2x, wait, harvest, market. Over and over. The more fields just means the more work you have to do.			"

												Tedious, tedious tedious. I'd rather watch real grass grow. half an hour to harvest one small field that yielded 50.6 percent after tender care. There are so many other sims on Steam that deserve your money, Game Dev Tycoon, Cars Incorporated, for example, not this one. 1990's graphics, no way to adjust screen resolution, miniature text. A huge waste of money. Unless you're living in 1995 then it would seem brand new.			"

												A better name for this game would be Waiting World, since the only things you can do in this game are waiting, and waiting some more.There are no redeeming features whatsoever. I would dissect the game's mechanics to point out where and how it went wrong, but there are no mechanics to dissect aside from waiting for a crop to finish and then waiting some more.If you want a farm game that's more interesting, get Sim Farm from somewhere. But whatever you do, avoid this one.			"

The game doesn't teach you very much, but after playing a few games you get the hang of it. I would recommend this game if you have some time to kill and just want relax with a (some what simple) fun game.			"

												I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about, it seems like a pretty accurate farming sim to me. If you've ever thought you might enjoy being a farmer, buy this sim and enjoy doing all the accounting work that a real farmer does, and perhaps find that you might not enjoy being a farmer so much. I tried 'hard' and failed miserably, so it's not unlosable, either. I do have some nitpicks about accuracy (what is 'organic pesticide' and how can you get an accurate prediction for the next month of weather?), but otherwise... admit it, you probably don't want to be a farmer, why did you buy and install a game called 'Farming World'?

												It's a decent farming game. The graphics look very outdated, reminded me of early simulators like SimFarm, but if you are a fan of the genre, it probably won't matter that much.The gameplay is pretty straight forward, going away from the ""driving farming machinery"" approach that some current simulators take and focusing on timing the planting acording to the season and planing when to sell the crops.There's a problem with the DEP registering that prevents the game from running. If you are experiencing this, try add the game executable to the DEP exception list and it should solve the issue. I would recommend this if you are already a fan of the genre or if you don't mind the simple graphics.			"

												This was a game I thought might be some light fun as a management game, and had hopes it would be patched to enjoyable state, but as it now seems abandoned by the developer, I have to say that in its ""final"" state, it is not recommendable to virtually anyone.  Gameplay consists of designating land for specific crops, punching buttons to get someone else to drive the tractor and do all the work, and then hitting fast forward for several days in a row until it's time to punch the next button.  It plays in ""real time"", but EVERYTHING happens at noon, so there's no point in any other time of day.  It's not even like there's so much to do that your tractors might not complete a field in 24 hours, either.  When the requisite time has been fast forwarded, you punch the ""harvest"" button, and the picker hoarde zooms through your fields, and you make freakishly large amounts of money.  Rinse and repeat forever.Many of the game features don't even work.  There are ""contracts"" where you can take functional missions to supply specific amounts of product by a specific time... but the button to actually complete a contract was never implemented.  There are ""rival farmers"" you are supposed to ""beat"", but they basically decide by throwing darts at a chart of options blindfolded.  Basically, all you do is plant crops and harvest, and use the money to buy more fields you can plant more crops within. There are also features that exist, but serve no particular purpose.  There is a weather system, with supposed storms coming through (although you can't actually SEE any storms, there are no effects whatsoever but that your crops mysteriously die) but you can't even tell without looking at the weather report menu.  Since there's literally nothing you can do about the weather anyway, though, there's no reason to do anything but fast forward through them.  There is a star-based unlocking system, but that only serves to make sure you have less variety in your game than you already had.  You get stars by harvesting crops, which is the only way you make money, so there's no reason it couldn't have been based upon money, anyway.  It only exists this way because Farmville did it, even though it serves no purpose here. Worse, it hides what the actual money price of something will be until AFTER you pay the star costs.  Hence, you have to plan your management of your farm around having to pay construction and upkeep costs on a factory whose real costs you can't see until AFTER you invested something in it.Then there are critically lacking features, like being able to see the prices of crops so that you can strategically plan what you are going to sell before you have actually invested all the time and money into growing them.  Yes, that's right, it's a game about picking what crops to grow for the maximum profit *WHERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA AT WHAT PRICE ANYTHING COSTS OR SELLS*.  The statistics page is utterly useless, as it shows you absolutely nothing of value, like what fields cost what amount of money to grow anything (you have to track that by hand), and what the crops sold for when you did grow them. You have factories that let you turn raw fruit into canned fruit or other similar intermediate or finished products, but there's no comparison of overhead to finished product and raw material selling prices.This is a management game where you have nothing to actually manage.  There is no strategy here, all land is basically the same (even fertility differences are just papered over with punching a button to ""fertilize field""), the whole map is one flat chunk of arable land, no matter where in the world you set up, and climate, once picked, basically ensures you will spend the whole game raising strawberries or potatoes or corn or whatever ad infinitum.  No thought, just micromanage those buttons to keep sending out tractors to plow, plant, spray, or harvest before fast-forwarding to the next time to do more of the same.Ultimately, the game is like playing Candyland with yourself.  You roll the dice, have random crap happen to you that you can't do anything about, and then eventually progress further down the board and maybe declare ""you win"" when you get bored... but this game lacks the finish line, so...

												Overall:  3/10 - Not what I was hoping for.Problems:  Lack of economy, tons of micromanaging, not very realistic.I love sim games, this one is far from one.  It has a very noticeable lack of economy compared to other business sims.  This leaves it with only so much depth.  The realism of crop growth is also non-existant.  Maize/Corn for example does not grow well in America.  But what the game lacks in realism and depth, it makes up for in micromanaging!  For crops, you buy/rent a plot of land, plough, plant, choose to pesticide or not (not sure the point of pesticiding in this game), and wait several minutes on full speed for the game to go through a couple months until you can tell it to harvest the crop.  Then you can goto the market and sell it for a seemingly rock bottom price or hire the salesman to sell it for a slightly higher price, but then it might not sell, or take over a year perhaps.  Then you do the same to the next field and so on, don't forget to plough and order seeds again after harvesting, nothing is done for you.I think the animals are bugged, at least I hope it's a bug and not part of the design.  You have to 'raise' them from infants to adults, and then butcher them or just out-right sell them.  They seem to continually grow, or rather keep their numbers up even during the butchering, but if they get too old you're stuck with them for a few years without anyway to sell them short of demolishing the entire building, which is certainly an option.  I'm not really sure the point of the animals in this game but they sure do bring in money.It's hard to say if this is a finished game, hopefully they're still working on it since it feels more like a pre-release alpha game in development.  I was hoping this would be a remake of an old classic, but sadly it isn't even close because of the lack of complexity.  It's more like a game you would expect to see online but with a total lack of quality graphics.			"

												It's boring. It's godawfully boring. I'm sure that most anyone who's considering this game has read the other reviews- which nullifies my two cents...but... I have to warn potential buyers anyways. I honestly think Farming Simulator 15 is a better purchase. But all this opinion is useless if I don't say why. So, let me start off. I got this from the Humble Bundle (despite this, still a wonderful organization, I recommend it totally.) Which means I paid what I wanted for it. It wasn't even worth it if I paid a single cent.  The only redeeming factors was that I got other better games from the bundle. On a first glance, looks interesting. A nice little farming simulator. I figured I could have some fun, set up some automated chains, so on and so forth until I built a budding farming empire. I pursued this dream for as long as it took to install the game, run it, and then play a bit of tutorial and freeplay. Then, having gotten bored from waiting for my crop to grow, watering it, picking a random pesticide because the game asked me to, and then watch a little harvester make it vanish, and suddenly I had some crops, which I could then click a button to make them turn into money. Maybe...just maybe that would've been acceptable...if that wasn't the entirety of the game. There was no point in doing anything past that. Money was pointless. I could make a new building for something or other, but there wasn't really a reason to. I could try to make more money just for the point of having it, but it's not fulfilling in the slightest. Instead, I'd wish for my time back.The point I'm trying to make is, the most satisfying thing this game (and from what I've seen, the company in general) can give you is the satisfaction of uninstalling it, and never bothering to install it again. I've not checked the developers forums, or anything of the like, but I see no signs thus far of any developer response to the community, no updates to try and make the game better. Just a quick cash in with a cheap boring game with no substance. However, all that said, all the malice I have for the game said and done, I'm happy to change my opinion and review if the developers provide something to respond to the community- anything to prove that they actually care about the game and its players. Otherwise, don't waste your money on this game. It doesn't deserve it, and its just sending the message that this game and other cash cows can get away with giving the consumers nothing of any real value. It's sh*t, and it's not even good enough to fertilize the cash crops its supposed to bring in.			"

Watching the grass grow...Farming world is a game about, well Farming. The game has a good selection of crops, animals and produces you can ""manufacture"". You can employ farmhands, or experts to help you for some money (like weatherforecasts, brokering and other stuff).Most of the time you ""watch!"" the game, you are literally watching your crops (or lifestock) grow and being harvested. You yourself just decide the size of your fields, what crops you want to plant and what buildings you construct... all this costs money, and you need stars to unlock even more stuff to use.It would be a fine game, if the watching grass grow wouldn't be such a terrible, terrible pasttime - either in real life or simulated... yes, there is a fast forward... but that's making the game even more boring.I liked about this game the different kind of crops, trees, vegetables and lifestock that could be brought to production. Furthermore the idea was quite well developed, yet it is lacking a lot of things making a game worthwhile.I didn't like the waiting stuff, the kind of presentation (it was far too primitive to be really entertaining) and with time the music of the game can drive you nuts... real nuts that is.I bought this game, because I thought it was a good idea - but I had to realize it wasn't, there are games that have some of the same topic in its gameplay and yet did it better, although lacking the variety and depth, are more entertaining.Not Recommended!Actually I am hard tempted to create a physical copy of this game and sink it into the next slurry lagoon.

												How do I know how long my crops will take to grow BEFORE I buy and plant them?Do my crops come back after I harvest? It looks like they should but they never seem to. (?)Are there any actual goals in the campaign?Where did the crops I just harvested go? Did I just get lost or did them actually bug out and disappear?What are the basic crops and animals to start with, so I don't have to spend thousands $ and wait for 5483986 days to harvest my first crops? Do I have to try them one by one with no prior knowledge whatsoever?These and more are questions not answered by the tutorial and that I cannot answer in a fast, effective way. And I sure as hell am not gonna try every option one by one to get that info.Lots of micromanagement and long periods of just waiting and waiting. Ineffective buttons: it would be more useful if there was one ""feed animals"" button and from there you could choose organic or antibiotics, instead of having several so you easily get confused in the tiny button mess, click the wrong one (no confirmation) and decrease the value of your animals by mistake.Oh and it's reaaaally boring.TL;DR: glitchy, unimaginative, boring as hell. Stay away from this.			"

												This game idea is very good, but it have TERRIBLE execution.In less than two hours, i've found out that this game is more about fixing â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fences than actually farming, every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 30 seconds or less, it will complain to you that you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing need to fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fences. (Of course, that's because I had 10 pens)It also becomes pure micromanagement, the game was also easly broken by buying cows and selling milk/meat.There is no reason to ever plant any tree.			"

												It's not bad game, but I think good yet.I've play it some hours and found it's interesting, IMO the game positives and negatives+ have good planting / raising simulationthe 1st time I play this game my expectation is just like plant, raising animals and done, but farming world have more just like season for planting, season to grow, mature time, and harvest time. every plant / animals have their unique lifetimes.+ many option to make final productafter have some cows or chicken, there are many option to sell it. you can direct sell to market, or product their meat using butcher building, or let it grow until old to product eggs and milks.- bad interfacethe interface is simple but made me confused, developers put everything on the main game. when there is notification about hungry animals (because forgot to auto-feed), I don't know which pen that need to feed (yeah because you will build more than 20 animal pens). the notification icon is too small. as manager of the farm I need to know more detailed information of notifications. there are no graphic market  of farm goods, no detailed information of plant / animals (they only put unique numbers, no story of the items), and more.- more like social gamein the game you need stars to unlock plants, animals, buildings, and vehicles, IMO I don't need to unlock when I have many bucks and right season to plant it, it should be research not stars things.- still buggingfound some bugs like > I can't sell old animals> I can't build something (and there is already road on there)> Butchers are not working > and moreI am not recommend this game because you can get better farm simulation game than this one.

												I'm a lover of sims, tycoons, and farming.  This game had potential for what i was looking for, but in the end everything about it was awful.  I was lucky enough to catch the game on sale.  I would not buy this game.  The graphics are extremely subpar, the tutorial left me lacking for how to do things, which come to find out you can't even turn the buildings.  There is no way to see prices without actually having taken the time to grow a crop, which takes at least 15 mins real time to do.  Even then, I was extremely disappointed that growing things hardly ever yielded a profit and raising chickens was the way to go.  Overall i'd give it 0/10.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!			"

												I was still trying to figure out how to rate this game... Before I decided to just write off the whole game as a lost cause. Started growing some crops, advisor says coffee is good...  planted that.. and realised that it takes months to ripen..Restarted the campaign. Unlocked melons and planted that.. and realised that whether it's a small plot or a big plot, I still pay $1000 for that machine.Restarted the campaign. Bought a 10x3 plot of land. Planted Melons. Watched them ripen. Harvested them. And realised they disappeared and I cannot sell any melons from anywhere..Uninstalled game.			"

												Too easy. It's really hard to fail at anything. Much harder than to succeed. The most interesting feature I've found was the ability to cut meat out of your animals without killing them. That must be horribly painful and animal rights groups might find this disturbing. But it's an interesting thought. And is balanced by the fact that after the animals reach a certain age they gain civil rights and retirement rights, after which they can no longer be sold or cut.Farming is ridiculously easy (you rent everything and still get >100% profits), animal harvesting is easier.It's so easy that if you notice turkey meat sells for more than beef, you can set your butcher to cut your cattle into turkey meat.TL;DR: it's too easy, devs didn't pay much attention to details and the game gets boring after 10 minutes (that's counting the download time).

Even simply clicking new game would crash, and I have been unable to finish the tutorial since the game's release.

Although considering the horrble game breaking crashes, and occasional freezing, it's simply not worth buying at this time. "

The gameplay is okay, but it's quite buggy and laggy, personally I am a big fan of sim/farming games, but this one is totally overpriced and at the look of it it's like those facebook games convert into pc games.Time consume is like very long waits in the game.This looks like farm frenzy #1 in the old days. many ideas are alike.after 10 mins of gameplay I shutdowned all the tut. music/sound etc, I am very disappointed at dev.everything takes forever to build. Day/night cycle is useless. (brighter screen vs Darker screen.)The idea of sim/farm game is really good, but it needs a little more work than this to do the job.			"

												This is an excellent farm management sim; but I can't help but wish it could have been better. The first annoying thing you will notice is the camera is lacking. You can't zoom out very far, cannot rotate view, and even on the closest zoom you will strain your eyes just to see your people working. It's not a very flawed game though, and if you like this sort of genre you will definitely have a lot of fun. But, seeing how it borrows heavily from previous farm management sims, you will probably wish you could play those again instead. This game sports some unique features, but at the same time you will wish it had some that were available in older games of this type. For this reason I would highly recommend ""John Deere: American Farmer"" or ""SimFarm"".Farming World is still a nice game, however.			"

												Kind of interesting, but still manages to be both boring and cumbersome. There are large amounts of time where all you can do is wait, which is annoying. Also it's very unclear how to actually make money in this game. For example, I took a contract to make apples, which I did, but for some reason it still said I hadn't fulfilled the contract. I have no idea what I did wrong and the game is not clear at all on how to improve.			"

												Mass production of alot of farms becomes insanly tedious, for example Animals break fences alot....maybee 10 times in their life cycle before payout. This would be fine if you have 1 set of animals...but if you want lots...you will find your self a full time fence repairing game.....just crap.The concept is great, and could be a sweet little game....but the forced micro management on little items like the fence, spraying, watering etc is just horrible.

												Was really looking forward to a cool farming sim, but this is not it. Bascially just boring. Overly realistic in that it takes forever to grow anything, and then lacking in strategy because there's not much you can do other than plant things and wait for them to grow. A lot of the information provided in game about crop conditions and weather seems good to start with but then proves to be unclearly defined when it comes to actually using it. I don't mind about the graphics cos it's not a game where that's the focus. Showing visually how much of a crop is dead or ready to harvest was good, and some of the other informational displays were simple and efficient. But... just not fun.Lots of bugs. I have played for three hours, and I got corrupt ostriches that would not reach maturity as they had a negative number of days to go, a massive field of tulips that were harvested and then disappeared so I couldn't sell them, a missing icon on my field so I didn't know what was planted there, and divide by zero errors everyday just before noon so had to quit that game. Also, whenever I grew animals, there was 0.1 tonnes of meat available but the slider to choose how much to sell confusingly let me choose about 10 values of ""zero tonnes"" at different prices.Distinct Lack of shortcut keys. Was disappointed that the landscape and set up of the initial farming village was identical in UK and USA scenarios.			"

												A great game to relax with if you are into agricultural sims. This particular game is more a business sim and less a tractor sim like many of the other agriculture computer games. If you were one of the rare handful of people who could run farming giant then you know what this game can offer. Overall I enjoy it, but it is a very niche game and you will either love it or hate it.			"
