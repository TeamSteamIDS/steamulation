												I finished State of Decay, I enjoyed it, and I would recommend it--but with some hesitations. The more I played the game, the more it felt sort of rote and a little tiring. It feels like the developers built a great core gameplay loop, but didn't do much to add to that.The way the game works is thus: You have a base stocked with survivors. As time passes, the base uses up resources. So you go around a few towns and surrounding countrysides, break into houses and warehouses and the like, and steal stuff. You'll find both items that your character can use, and resources that your base can use. You carry regular items in a backpack, which has both a slot and weight limit after which you get encumbered and tired more easily. Base resources are loaded into a large rucksack, which further encumbers you. If you can't carry everything at an area, you can send for someone from your base to run to where you are, pick up the remainder, and bring it back to the base. NPCs can get caught by zombies while they're making their way out to the looting point or while they're making their way back. You can designate certain buildings to be ""outputs"". The game doesn't explain at all why you would do this, but the internet explains: the most important reason to do it is that an area designated a outpost spawns no zombies and is booby-trapped so that if external zombies move through, they get killed. You'll want to put at least a few outposts near your base to sort of create a zombie-free buffer. The second reason, which is not made clear in the game at all, is that if you leave base resources in an outpost, you will have a permanent daily allowance of that resource, which lowers your need for scavenging. By the end of the game I had a daily surplus of food and medication and broke even on fuel, so I only needed ammo and construction materials.After a while your character will get tired. Fatigue lowers your maximum stamina. You can keep playing, but it'll keep getting worse. So you're advised to go back to home base and switch to another character. Likewise, serious injury lowers your maximum health. This is the game's way of forcing you to use multiple characters. This can be frustrating if you only have a few with good skills. Skills include cardio, wits (ability to search through things quietly), melee combat, shooting, and reflexes (appears to relate to combat) and they are leveled up by using them; someone who shoots all the time will quickly get a high level of shooting skill. At a certain point, once you've leveled skills, you can also select ""specializations"" for your characters. The game does not explain this, so it was about 2/3rds of the way through the game before I discovered this was a thing.While you're out and about, you'll be asked to do missions. Missions could involve helping out neighboring groups of survivors, going to save one of your runners who has been caught in a zombie-infested area, helping to board up a building, climbing tall buildings to locate new sources of resources. You can also find new areas to move to, as each base has different built-in facilities and different numbers of expansion slots. I only moved my base once, from the default church into a spacious and facility-rich warehouse. You can use materials to build different areas in your base; a guard tower, a garden, a medical tent, a research library, a cooking area, a gym/training area, etc. Some require particular survivors with particular skills to staff them, but most just give you a sort of passive boost. You can upgrade most building facilities. Ultimately other than areas that help survivors recover from fatigue or injury, I didn't really notice much of an impact from base facilities at all. It felt like another mechanic that was sort of neat but ultimately hollow.There is a plot, but not much of one. At random, you'll get radio missions to go deal with various groups of people. There are military personnel who are here for an unknown reason, local small criminals and drug/weapons dealers, a group of friendly survivors, a courthouse serving as some kind of post-collapse civilian government, and a few one-offs. The actual plot missions themselves differ very little from the random missions you get. For example, taking the sheriff on a ride-along to clear out zombie infestations and save a trapped civilian is exactly like clearing out zombie infestations and saving trapped civilians.Your player characters are basically randoms. You start as a camping dude named Marcus who has great default skillset. He's accompanied by a perpetual whiner who is useless named Ed. You meet up with an ex-military woman named Maya. Pretty much everyone else after these three are total blind randoms. There are five or six NPC voices that voice everyone; there's a wide wide wide variety of dialogue but little in the way of characterization. They do this because anyone can permanently die. During my first run-through, I lost both Marcus and Maya due to bad planning about 10 minutes apart 4 hours in. I was so gutted that I restarted the game. In my second and final playthrough, I was about 7 hours in when I lost Marcus on a routine errand. I considered restarting again. So they've done a good job of making the loss of a high level character pretty tragic. Marcus was my only loss that wasn't ordained by plot reasons on my second playthrough.I guess I would describe my experience as sort of hollow. I loved the melee combat, which is quite complex and very tense (although poorly explained). I loved driving around in my car and opening my door to whack a passing zombie, or doing a donut and whipping a zombie hanging off the back into a telephone pole. But... I guess I never really felt like anything matters. I'd just wander around and scavenge (unnecessarily, my resources were never low) until I'd get a mission, missions were basically no different than wandering around in general, I'd play side missions until I got a plot mission, which were no different really. Occasionally I'd have to go back to my base to check on construction or switch characters. I was never scarce on weapons or ammo or meds at my base. I always had more than enough influence, the game's currency.So in conclusion, I'd say that this is definitely a game that's worth trying, but that if you're like me, you might get tired of part-way through because there's not a lot of variation and much of the game seems a little like busy-work.

												Seeing i poured more hours into this game than the average review-writing player, i figured i should write my own review as well. There might be spoilers.So here goes:I'm not a fan of most zombie games, which seem to revolve around ""shoot millions of zombies to win"". There is no ""winning"" State of decay. The zombies are everywhere and the horde is endless. The base game ends when your survivors manage to leave Trumbull Valley and you are left wondering ""How long will they last without my help?""And this is exactly what i love about State of Decay.The game & DLC's in a nutshell:State of Decay:You and your buddy went on your annual fishing trip, while you were gone large swaths of the US have been overrun by zombies. You get attacked as soon as you tie off your boat. Fighting them off is easy enough but now need to figure out what happened and where you can find a safe place to stay. Jump in the nearest car and meet up with fellow survivors holed up at a church. Then the game begins for real and answers are gradually given.Breakdown:Same map, alternate storyline. Several weeks after the outbreak, you and Lily are the last 2 survivors of an enclave and you know you wont last much longer on your own. While you look for another enclave to join, Lily packs up and will meet you there with whatever supplies are left. Once settled it's back to basics: survive for as long as you can. You quickly realize resources are dwindling while zombie numbers increase. Eventually it's time to move on: you pack all equipment in the RV, load up your most important survivors and look for a new home. Your new home is on the exact same map, but with fresh resources and.. more zombies.Lifeline:New map. You are in command of the last military outpost in the overrun city of Danforth. You must secure your base, shore up your defenses and start the search for various survivors. The brass will direct you to high-value assets: scientists, doctors and their families whose expertise might be crucial to find an eventual cure. Along the way stranded survivors cry out for help and you're the only one with the means to respond. Your actions will decide the fate of not only Danforth, but possibly the whole world.I'll do a short pros and cons but there are a few things i should really point out first. State of Decay is not about killing lots of zombies. It is about people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. There are endless zombies but finite resources. Sure, it is great fun to smash your truck into a few zombie hordes or grab a machine gun and go on a killing spree, but that's not the intention of the game. When you're done a good truck will be broken, perhaps beyond repair. Or a lot of bullets will have been wasted on ever respawning zombies. So when you clear an area of zombies, you damn better scavenge as much as you can.When you scavenge you may find resources you can use to improve your base or tools for zombie killing. Food and various painkillers/stimulants are also often found. There are a few possible home sites (bases) in the game for you to eventually choose from. Each of them has certain requisites and advantages/disadvantages, but larger is better :). Always you have to make tough choices: will i go for a workshop to repair weapons & cars, or rather a field hospital to aid the people who will inevitably fall sick? No one wants to go down with Black Fever.. trust me. Maybe i can have both IF i sacrifice room for the workout area, but then all survivors will have less stamina and fighting skills.. Choices.Over the course of the game missions will pop up: help scavenging, clear out an infestation, save a survivor, trade resources with your neighbours, kill a freak zombie.Unfortunately most of these missions can be boiled down to a simple fact: your fellow survivors have the mental capacity and survival skill of a baked potato. You are the only one who's good at it, and it's up to you to do ALL the work. I found this annoying when i first played the game and put it aside for a few weeks for that reason only. However, if you accept that's just how it is, embrace it, and you'll still have a most enjoyable game.A few other points of light irritation:- Graphics: good enough for a game of this price, but definately not top notch.- Controls: especially car controls feel sluggish.- Clipping: zombies occasionally clip trough solid objects. Not a problem if it's just a regular zombie, a bit more annoying when it's a Big Un or Feral in an enclosed space.- Useless survivors: Plenty of them and no ""clean"" way to get rid of them.The pros:Open world game: You go where you want, when you want.Permadeath: Your survivor got ambushed and killed? He's dead, no reloading an earlier save.Stamina & carry capacity: The game's way of saying you're just an average Joe, not Rambo.Traits and Skills: The game's way of taking the ""average"" out of ""average Joe""Soundtrack: Composed by Jesper Kyd. 'Nuff said.Mods: Don't like this or that? Maybe want to see more of that other stuff? Check out the modding community, or find out how to do it yourself. Besides tweaking Breakdown to make it more enjoyable, i also added myself as a playable character. Much fun was had.All in all i found this a very enjoyable game and the DLC's are definately worth it. Has been on sale several times @ -66% orso. Even grabbed back to it a few months after i finished it.			"

												""There are a lot of zombie games, but this one looks old, but feels fresh"" Game overall is very good and deep, and has nicely executed gameplay mechanics that make you occupied for long time, just because you come back to it for more. You need to gather supplies in order to survive, but also you need to keep people in top shape by wiping out infestations, killing hordes, gathering supplies and eventually take them outside of base and kill some zombies together with them to make them feel more clever. Base too small? Find another one, and order everybody to move to it. You've been long time outside of base exploring the area? Your character will get tired and eventually run out of stamina (or the stamina bar will be impossible to fill fully). When you'll get hurt too many times, your health lowers and you need to switch to other characters. Lost your character? It's gone. You cannot have it back. This is the main thing I love in this game. When you loose one of characters, it hurts, this character is gone. This is when I realised that dialogs and overall - story - of characters is very good and nicely written. At some point I felt so emotionally connected with Markus (main character you start as first time) that when I died while playing as him, I've started game again from the beggining, because I didn't want to loose him. Did I mention that game is open world? Yes it is, you can do whatever you want untill whole map will eventually run out of resources. That is another unique thing about this game. Nothing respawns. Crashed your car and it exploded? You loose it. Gathered supplies from nearby house? They're gone. They never respawn. This adds so much realism to the game, and fear that you need to take risks in order to survive. You can also get some new freeloaders to your base. Of course it will be possible to switch to them, after you fullfill tasks they give you (going to their base and dropping supplies), or just after bringing them to your base. Generally speaking, there is a lot to do, and this review will not cover all of this stuff, you just need to find out more by yourself.Technically speaking, this game is pretty outdated. Graphics are somewhat old looking, but they're not ugly. Just textures could use better resolution, and animations could use some more fixing. Well, we cannot expect much as Undead Labs ported this game from Xbox 360, where it was successfull as it is now on PC. It runs on CryEngine 3. First I thought it was Unity 3D, but after some readings I've discovered it uses Crytek's engine. I thought that it pretty much wasted it's potential. As mentioned above animations are sometimes jerky, and doesn't fit the situation. Some textures are ugly, low res, but overall, it's not ugly to the point to make you puke. Performance is pretty poor on Ultra Spec. It does run noticably better at High Spec (Graphic options are named like this) with 60FPS, but does have some drops to 40 in towns. My PC is not top notch, I have i3-3.2 GHz, 4GB RAM, Radeon HD7850 2GB, but still it could use some more 'love' to make it run smoothly. Game has very limited graphic options (one slider) but it does job well improving the performance.Controls. Game lacks some stuff that could come in handy for some group of players. I dislike forced Mouse Acceleration. Thank god Undead Labs added rebindable keyboard bindings, so it's easier to configure and play. Game does not have multiplayer and will never have. Developers stated a lot of times that this game won't have any possible coop or multiplayer. It's all reserved for upcoming Class4 (this game is Class3) and honestly? In single player it plays so well that I didn't even noticed lack of multiplayer. Overall, game is worth the money, so is upcoming 'Breakdown' DLC which will only add some more of gameplay. Game has enough content to make you occupied for looooong time. It's best zombie game to date, it looks old, but feels fresh despite it's obvious flaws. Undead Labs - Congratulations.8.5/10			"

												Definitely a decent game, it can be a little repetitive but it does offer some good fun. It really reminded me at times of playing a GTA game with zombies in it.Know this before buying!!!The worst part about this game hands down is the fact the game plays on its own when you are not there....What? Things progress/change when you are not playing! This should have been a Hardcore feature or something similar, seems like the devs were taking the ""simulation"" aspect a little too far. If you only have time to play an hour here and there, you might not want to play this.The other annoying part about this game, which I think ties back into the simulation aspect, is the save system. While some may like the system implemented for this game, I find it unbelievably stupid. It's basically only checkpoints, no save points you can create, ever. My ideal save system would be like Fallout 3's, essentially any time and anywhere. These issues might not bother you or might make you want to play the game more, but for me, these issues make playing the game less enjoyable. I still recommend it as there is some good fun, but just be warned about those features. I would have surely waited for a cheaper sale had I known about those features first.			"

												Game is a real shocker. Open world zombie game done pretty good! Combat for me, is fluid and very fun. You can easily trample 5-10 zombies with this system and never get angry at someone doing what they're not supposed to be doing it. The NPCS during combat are amazing, they do so much damage a full crew of 4 could likely take out 200 zombies. A smart move here, is that in this game killing zombies is mostly useless! They did not add any sort of item cultivation or gold drops from zombies which is great.The environments are pretty good as well. You always feeling like youre in a random farm or in a little suburb, largely because the zombie variety is so good as well!The ability to macro manage your ""crews' resources and deal with shortages and other random misfortunes is a great add.

												What a great game. Truly the best zombie game out there. It has all the stuff I always wanted to see in a Zombie Survival game.Yet I give it a thumb down, simply because:40 Hours into the game and I lost my savegame. Not a single survivor was lost, I was near the end. Unlocked most of the characters in Breakdown and suddenly it's gone.Apparently that's something that just happens. This is known among the users for quite awhile and yet it was never patched. PC Port of this game is a freaking joke. Instead of fixing this broken piece of ♥♥♥♥♥, they decided to spit on the paying customers and re-release it as some kind of GOTY edition, with better visuals and actual bugfixes. Of course the guys who bought the game with all the DLC would've to rebuy it again. Makes so much sense, right?""Thanks for your support, here, buy the game again, but this time with some fixes.""So in conclusion if you supported these greedy and lazy SOBs during their early access period, you're punished for it.Not buying from those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s again.Thanks for nothing, you disloyal, greedy, lazy-♥♥♥ developers.

												State of Decay is a game that fills a niche that many games tried to fill but none did yet. But it does it in its own unique way, and it does it very well.You are managing a group of survivors in a zombie-apocalypse. Its something you need to get used to, there are alot of random characters and some plot centric ones that you can get attached to, and mourn for when you loose them to the zeds. There is permadeath, and its cruel. The game can bring out emotions in alot of ways, which is a strong point for it.There is also base-building in the game on several predetermined locations. The game is a Sandbox, things happen if you are playing or not. As long as you keep morale high and your base secure, you shouldnt have too many suprises whenever you get back to it after you took a break. The story is told over different mission arcs that you have to follow, to eventually get out of the valley the game takes part in. Overall the story is well presented but it could have been longer and the end is unsatisfying in my opinion. The non-story missions are quite repetitive and can get to be a bit of a chore over time.Generaly the game felt too easy once you know how to deal with the zeds and have your survivors trained. Yes, you can level your survivors skills and there is nice progression in the skill system. And even tough you might feel like a zombie-slaying superhero at times, as soon as you pay not attention for a moment you can be in dire troubles. If you get reckless you will loose characters to hordes, and to special infected (which are very similar to those in Left4Dead). The graphics are pretty dissapointing resolutionwise, and the user interface is clumsy and ugly at best. That is because the game was ported from consoles for PC, but generally ist not a bad port. The Devs really tried their best to make the game work for PC. The controls with Keyboard & Mouse where fine (Controllers work too of course). The graphical variety still can overcome the bad texures, so that those only stay a minor annoyance.I didnt run into any plot-stopping bugs or crashes (seems those where fixed), the game gets still patched from the devs and there will be a second DLC coming out at one point. The first DLC adds an endless mode to the game which is a nice addition.Its a bit weird to sum up this game with its many small flaws and at the end still say its a great game, but it really is, even tough it could surely have been better in many aspects. Its the whole experience and atmosphere that makes it worth playing. Its a unique game in many ways, and a very welcome and creative suprise in the many zombie/survival games that all feel pretty similar overall.Everyone should play this, wholly reccommended.And dont lose Maya, like i did.

												I recently bought State of Decay from Steam’s summer sale for around 4€ and I don’t think I’ve ever been happier with a game purchase. I’ve heard/read people saying it’s a good game but didn’t realise it was SO addicting too.Let’s start by explaining what the whole game is about, without spoilers of course. It’s zombie apocalypse time and you are one of the survivors. You aid other survivors, build a community, search for supplies like food, gas, ammunition and weapons to survive.You have the freedom to move around the open world how you like, set up a base (home) in various locations, choose what kind of services your base has (medical room, library to study, mechanics to fix cars & gear etc.)You can build watch tower in your base, order men to practice shooting, extend the safe zone around your map by sniping everyone around your base, train other neighbouring survivors in your camp in exchange of goods.You can take over empty buildings like gas stations, cafeterias etc. and build outposts there. Outpost have a ‘safe zone’ around them, where zombies will not spawn so it’s a good place to have a breather. Outpost also grant you access to your base supplies, so you can quickly switch weapons and other gear there.Your base has a radio that helps you keeping in contact with other survivors and NPCs in the world. This is also how you will get most of your quests, distress calls etc. You can contact your base via radio and ask them to track specific supplies for you - or you can just scavenge around and search houses and buildings for everything usefull.You can load stuff you find in your backbag and in trunk of a car. When you can’t carry more, you can ask base to send runners who will make their way to your location and loot the place. You can wait for the runner and aid him in returning the goods back home, or go your merry way and let them do it without you. They are usually quite handy with their weapons, though it all depends on what gear you are giving to your community.Sometimes they chew more than they can handle and might end up surrounded by zombies, trapped in house etc. If you like your buddies, you go and help ‘em - or let them struggle alone. If you don’t offer any help, that has an impact in your own reputation within the group. So basically, don’t ♥♥♥♥ around and help your own men. Also helping neighbours and other communities has it’s benefits.The more people you have living in your base, the more rations they take up per day. The more people you have, the more security you have. The more people you have, the more inner problems you have. People will occasionally get mad at each other, have sleeping problems, fear the outside world. Quite often you can solve these issues - but there’s bound to happen something nasty eventually.You start the game by controlling one person. After a while you gain more friends and allies and you can then control them too. Once a person is too badly wounded or too tired, you can then switch to another person and keep doing the tasks required to survive, while others rest and keep up the base. (Guard the perimeter, cook food, hunt for supplies, fix broken equipment, manufacture traps, silencers, bullets etc.)The world inside State of Decay goes on, even when you are offline. The event gradually slow down, the more time you are away from game and in three (3) days the time will be almost at stand still. So, if you have a real life too and log in the game next day, be prepared. Something might have happened to your community while you were away.If you are into zombie/post apocalyptic game this game is a must buy. I highly recommend it. Oh and remember, if you ♥♥♥♥ up and someone dies, he/she is dead for good. I was saddened to see my favorite guy die just because I was too cheap with healing kits.			"

												Zombie survival at its finest. Great game play, awesome open world experience with zombies. The zombies are a threat in large number but easy to deal with in small numbers. Looting is enjoyable and rewarding at times other frustrating when zombies keep coming from the noise your making. Level up characters can make you think about who you take out on supply runs and how careful you plot your moves when dealing with large groups of zombies or special zombies. Shooting is good but you have to keep in mind that the zombies will start coming to you the longer you stay in one place shooting rounds off. Interactions with other characters is there but with other survior groups things can be improved upon trading mainly. over all I still stick by my first line and I do suggest this game to someone look for a good zombie survival game with a open world. And there is upcoming DLC for a endless how long can you survive that scales the zombies up the longer you live.			"

I enjoyed this game greatly and was looking forward to more of the bugs to be worked out. But it seems they have rereleased this game to us instead of patching or fixing it with the claim that they are using the new DX11 to justify it. So if they fixed it for their ""new release"" I would assume they have no intention on fixing it for the original game and dlc's. This was one of those companies that was heading in the right direction but have lost track of the value of a majority fanbase.			"

												I absolutely do not recommend anybody purchase this game. It has been abandoned and the numerous issues still surrounding it will never be given attention or fixes as the developer has now moved onto a ""remastered"" version of the game called ""Year One"" -- all updates, all improvements, all fixes, are now part of Year One Edition and that is a paid upgrade.Yes, the developers and publisher are now charging for updates and patches. They trotted out some inane rubbish with lots of grovelling and heartfelt pleas about how they really would give the update away for free if they could afford it, honest! really!So no, do not buy this game. It is abandoned.Do not buy Year One Edition either, because the developers are untrustworthy, duplicitous con artists.			"

												Found the game very enjoyable but became burnt out on it very quickly, its incredibly repetetive with a very short storyline surrounded by filler side missions (mostly involving useless AI's that cant do ♥♥♥♥ for themselves). Combat is fun, the feeling of survival is VERY strong and immersive and the range of weapons (both ranged and melee) are pretty darn impressive. Not to mention for all those people who love their eye candy.. fairly good graphicsThe main thing that gets me with this game however is that the survivors you work with overall are just... useless. Your base's radio operator is constantly spamming you with messages about how ""so and so has wandered into a horde of zombies like a dumbass and you need to save them!"", you go and save his/her ♥♥♥ and then another message comes in about another idiot who's achieved the same thing (sometimes even the same guy! xD) Ultimately you dont really connect with any of the characters in that most of the lines and voices (there is very little variety in this regard) are just copy and pastes from one person to another, all in all i would estimate about 5 voices for each gender. One thing i always like in my games especially open-world ones are the mods! there are quite a lot of different mods for this game involving things like little tweaks to zombies, combat, vehicles ect and big stuff like base overhauls and porting weapons and vehicles from the DLC into the main game. Probably put an extra 20 hours into the game thanks to this.The game is certainly worth buying for a zombie fan if you've got cash to spare or it's on sale but dont expect to be playing it for months to come, its a very short but sweet playthrough for most people i have spoken to despite the flawsI would rate this game a 7/10 and i hope that people find this review i made useful			"

												I absolutely do not recommend anybody purchase this game. It has been abandoned and the numerous issues still surrounding it will never be given attention or fixes as the developer has now moved onto a ""remastered"" version of the game called ""Year One"" -- all updates, all improvements, all fixes, are now part of Year One Edition and that is a paid upgrade.Yes, the developers and publisher are now charging for updates and patches. They trotted out some inane rubbish with lots of grovelling and heartfelt pleas about how they really would give the update away for free if they could afford it, honest! really!So no, do not buy this game. It is abandoned.Do not buy Year One Edition either, because the developers are untrustworthy, duplicitous con artists.			"

												After about 17 hours I finished the campaign, and I enjoyed this game very much!Let me give you all some pros and cons from my perspective:Your mission is to survive and make your stand with others like you, gather supplies and look for shelter is the first thing that comes to mind, and also try to kill everything in a specific area to try and create a ""safe zone"", which is actually impossible since the zombies will eventually spawn there again. I saw a horde spawn right next to me right after I got out of the car once, I disliked this aspect of the game to say the truth, it killed the ""sneaking"" feeling of hunting down and intercepting enemies before they reach the area you just cleared.A car is your best friend in this game, they are just ridiculously over powered. Once you unlock the vehicle delivery radio assistance you are pretty much invincible, that makes the game really fun because you can go out playing bowling simulator with zombies in the streets... But it's a huge con in my opinion, the game gets too easy. A fuel system would be a good idea to implement, and also a specialization system to turn the cars on, it feels really weird that every car in the city is open, with infinite gas and the keys just sitting there in the ignition...When you die you die for real, and since there's not a manual save option in the game make sure to press f4 when you see you're not going to make it... When you die you switch to another survivor from your group which is friendly to you, or if you don't have any friends you just get a random guy. I died once and decided to restart the game, learned my lesson the hard way.Once you progress enough in the game you can relocate your base, the best option is the Snyder Trucking Warehouse. You need at least 12 people in your group to move there, and once it's up and running you are going to feel untouchable, since you can have up to 8 outposts, and the consequence of that is a very big safe zone for you to chill during the zombie apocalypse.Regarding the other survivor groups that appears during the game, the only thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is the fact that you lose trust with them, if for example you approach them with a car, you get a penalty for ""reckless driving"" and they also can catch on fire if you throw a molotov near them, don't even think about using guns, unless you are alone, they will get in your way and get hit. But if you swing a machete or a sledgehammer in their head nothing will happen... It would also be really cool if other survivor groups could attack you, trying to steal your supplies or even your base.You lose stamina and even health as time goes on, the only option to get better is to switch characters and let the other one rest. But most people really don't want to go out playing with another survivor, there should be an option to rest and wake up rested the next day. It's also much more difficult to play in the night, you do have a flashlight, but other than that everything else is completely dark, all you can see are the red eyes of the zombies, and that's awesome! I remember one time when I went on a mission to retrieve a watch for one of the survivors, I had to go to the starting area of the game, and I went there after the sunset and managed to explode my car trying to jump a broken bridge, which attracted a lot of zombies, and there wasn't any other vehicle nearby. All I had with me was an axe and some firecrackers, I had to sneak all my way through the woods, and use the firecrackers to get the attention of the nearby hordes so I could get the damn watch and gtfo of there, I felt like I was in the game at that moment, and that's when I thought, this game is awesome! Totally recommended!			"

												NOTE: This review is months old so the game might be different (and $10 cheaper) now. To those who think you're being original asking how I can 'not recommend' it with 200 hours logged... it's been remarked upon, check the other comments. I'm not saying it's terrible, just that I didn't really recommend it- read the whole review, not just the red thumb, you might decide the positives outweigh the negatives for you. Also, I didn't actively play for 200 hours.State of Decay's a good game, and a mediocre 'simulation.' Unfortunately it insists on trying to be a simulator too much and the result is a flawed game that demands respect but does little to respect the player's time. SOD has an impressive open world with most buildings having multiple entry ports. These buildings are part of the world and require no loading as do some games. This is necessary because at any time you might need to escape into or out of a building as zombies attack. There are also multiple sites for 'home bases' which is nice but are not without problems: restrictions on facilities that don't make sense, barbed wire fences that block players but not zombies, etc.The zombies themself are well-done, and most can be outrun or fought without much difficulty... until the complications start. Like running from one pack of them right into another, or having one come around the corner just as you've used up your last bit of strength. There are also special zombies, some of which tend to be pretty annoying because of their quick lethality and insane hitpoints. I find the zombie hordes to be much more enjoyable, as they lead to more tense moments and thrilling fights\escapes\deaths. There are quite a few characters in the game that can be found or not found randomly in most cases. Sometimes you'll only know one was there when you find a corpse. Others can be recruited and, if you earn enough ""trust"" from them, become playable. This brings up a strange mechanic of the game: who are they trusting? The game does not have a 'main' player character (though you always start as the same guy) and affords no opportunity to create one. Instead the player switches between different survivors encountered. While many of the possible characters have interestings traits and appearances, it would be nice to be able to create one, and this would make more sense mechanically than having a pool of survivors share nebulous resources like 'trust' and 'influence'. It would seem such an idea runs afoul of the designers' narrow philosophical approach to the game; more on that later. Unfortunately many of the random characters end up feeling generic, even to the point of sharing the same voices. Because you can't see someone's traits before recruiting them, it's a crapshoot if you get a useless drunk or a warrior doctor. Since it's not easy to kick people out, one strategy\exploit is to constantly recruit survivors and then purposely kill the weak ones by guiding them into a group of zombies. That such a tactic need exist points to a need for improvement in the game.The quest missions are good, though there are not many of them; most of the time will be taken up by a series of ""SOS"" style requests for assistance that get annoying because of their frequency. It would seem that the survivors whom the player is not controlling exist solely to get in trouble and make the player divert from whatever task he or she was doing and rescue them. It gets very tiring to hear the radio operator keep calling out ""Aren't you going to help our friends"" again and again as you're trying to find the supplies to keep the base going. Also annoying is the fact that there are some quest missions you can let linger for as long as you'd like, and others that resolve (i.e. fail) on their own, but the game doesn't differentiate between the two types for you. This feeds into the idea that the devs wanted to force the player to choose between competing tasks, but ends up just overloading the game and stopping the players from doing what they want... unless you're okay with one of your survivors dying because you were across the map. Guns and other weapons are plentiful and varied, the latter perhaps unnecessarily (how many blunt objects do I really need?). Ammunition is so scarce that it makes some guns nearly useless but there are ways when you want to just open up with an M60. And yes, doing so will draw plenty of zombies, so a silenced .22 pistol is much more effective. Weapons are fun to use in general. Survivors can 'level up' with different weapons, making them seem like an investment, a nice feature that could have been used even more: how about experienced survivors stop needing their hands held? There is no save option (but on exit) and the game enforces permadeath. Moreoever there is a rudimentary 'simulation' (more of a calculation upon restarting the game) that bases itself on how long you've gone without playing and the state of decay (see what I did there?) at the time of quitting. It might just take away a bunch of your influence and resources, or it might cause all sorts of other problems if you had to quit while things weren't hunky-dorey (i.e. without clearing infestations, raising morale, etc). This is the biggest problem I have with the game, as it sits there on my steam shelf threatening me, saying ""if you don't play me now, you might as well never come back."" So I tend not to go back. Changing one's system clock can circumvent the process, but that seems like a ridiculous workaround. While the game slows down time progression after a couple days, it's a very poor choice to have such a mandatory 'feature' for people who may only have a couple hours every few days to play. You'll log in hoping to progress your game, but instead be forced to try and make up lost ground. It hurts what could be a great game to pick up and put down occasionally. The developers want the game played a certain way and stress that they are trying to simulate a zombie apocolypse, rather than make another game like ""Dead Rising."" Unfortunately, SOD doesn't do better as a simulation. The player is always having seemingly every task delegated to him or her, but is expected to play as just another NPC. It's clear that if the player weren't around, things would collapse (at least given what happens when the player logs off to attend to real life for a few days), yet you lose 'influence' (i.e. money) by putting a weapon in storage (the store) and taking it back out again. Again, there is an exploit to avoid this, but there shouldn't need to be one. I could get behind the theme of a zombie game that focuses less on individuality, but I'd want it to be done better; maybe an isometric like Jagged Alliance... except with zombies. It would be nice to see other survivors going about their tasks instead of only hearing from them when they need help, for example.Had the developers made the permadeath, save system and 'simulation' into a recommended or 'hardcore' feature, the game would be quite better off, as would players who could make that choice. The open world, while a little small, is quite good and does feel somewhat populated (particularly before various locales get overrun via the storyline). Walking or driving around feels 'right,' even when it is a little annoying to have to drive across the map. I'd recommend this game to someone who really wants to get addicted; it can make you want to do just one more thing before bed, taking up lots of time. It also does 'open world' quite well. But if you don't have that time available, I would be wary. I came down on the side of ""not recommending"" in general largely because the developers are so strident about their 'vision' that they not only don't include some basic gaming conventions (i.e. save slots), but actively disassociate from them. Just because something is popular doesn't always make it bad, and making something harder doesn't necessarily make it good.			"

												State of Decay has one of the best plots that Gamers have been craving. An open world zombie game, that you can explore, build shelter, scavenge food, and so forth. Altough it doesn't deliever on all their promised points.+ Great Concept+ Addictive+ Interesting (and altough somewhat annoying) Characters+ Scavenging and organizing stuff for your camp is rewarding+ I've personally encountered few bosses- Very repetetive gameplay- Very repetetive dialogue- Too easy, theres no difficulty option..- Not Very rewarding loot-AND WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ IS IT NO MULTIPLAYER?I've been waiting for this type of game for a while, ive always wanted to be the masterming of a zombie apocalypse, i like the fact that when you die as a character, he or she is gone forever. You shouldn't mess around in this world. This is serious business. But it's too easy! During my so far 13 hour gameplay ive died ONCE. It makes scavenging, and ""having a chat"" with your fellow survivors feel like a chore.Good Concept, Good Game, Could've been alot better.7/10 "

												Bought this game on release. One year later they bring out another version of this game called Year One Survival Edition (http://store.steampowered.com/app/329430/) and......stopped the supported for the previous version. But instead of giving the remastered version for free to owners of the previous, you are supposed to purchase it again. This is not acceptable and therefore I am voting the game down. Other publishers made this better. Gave you either the redux for free or for a cheaper price. I CANNOT RECOMMEND TO BUY A GAME FROM THOSE DEVELOPERS. To the substance of the game. It has interesting parts, but graphics are not that good and gameplay gets boring very fast. Overall I was disappointed that I purchased it. The menu are very confusing and could have been made more clear. The survival aspect is not worth the money.NOT RECOMMENDED (5/10)			"

												While the game itself is fun, the dev's are terrible supporters of their product. The game was a mediocre console port, with glaring issues for the pc (performance, gfx, controls, interface/gui, etc.) While most issues weren't completely gamebreaking, they added up to enough to make me quit the game until propper support was released.Two DLC's (one of which was originally announced to be free) and one year later, glaring bugs and issues are still abound, with no support. Now, they have announced the Year One Survival Edition - which includes the original SoD + DLCs + added content + gfx update + some bug/control fixes. Sounds great! Except they want to charge another $30, AND drop all support for the original SoD.edit: Since this game is no longer supported, just get YOSE edition when it goes on sale for ~$5-10.6\10			"

												For all of you looking for a true zombie survival game, you've come to the right place.  You're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time having stories to share with your friends unfold before your eyes.The base game has an enjoyable story, though it's the sandboxy feel that goes along with it that makes this game an excellent one.  You are continually capable of working toward your next story goal at your own pace, though if you're like me you'll find the majority of the game is spent exploring, collecting supplies, building up your base, dealing with other survivor groups, gaining skills for you survivors, etc.  Every character has a unique backstory and there are -a lot- of survivors out there that you might run into and have join you.The base building is simple, yet very enjoyable as well.  Depending on what skills your survivors have, different options are available and you have plenty of options available to you.  Do you want to be able to support more survivors?  Build a bunkhouse and a garden so that they have a comfortable place to sleep and food to eat if your scavenged supplies run low.  Looking to cut back on the sneaking around and really take the fight to the zombies?  An infirmary will keep your survivors healthy and a munitions shop will keep them well armed.  Just remember, even healthy, well armed survivors might run into a challenge when facing off against the 'freaks' or special zombies.The Breakdown DLC removes the deep story aspect of the the vanilla campaign, though it adds a brand new achievement system that unlocks 'hero' survivors that, more often than not, are more capable than your average survivor.  This mode also has 'Breakdown Levels', each time you complete one you move on to the next, more challenging phase, with new survivor achievements to unlock.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the zombie survival genre.  I'd been looking for a game like this for a very long time and was extremely happy when I installed it and truly learned what it was all about.  Enjoy and I'd love to hear your stories!			"

												NOTE: This review is for the original version of State of Decay (which sadly is no longer available for purchase), not the Year One Survival edition.State of Decay is a third-person open-world zombie apocalypse game where you build and fortify a base of operations, recruit survivors, and scavenge for useful items and vehicles. It's a highly addictive, frequently tense, and often action-packed game that exceeded all my expectations, and I strongly recommend it.  While you initially start by playing one survivor, as more people are saved and given shelter in your community you'll be able to switch back and forth between a dozen or more playable characters. This becomes a necessity, as survivors will get injured (or even permanently killed) or just flat-out exhausted when performing missions, and will need time to recuperate. Characters have a handful of skills such as melee combat, fitness, or shooting that will level up with use, and some survivors you recruit will even turn out to have special talents, such as an expert gardener who can increase the amount of food supplied by the greenhouse you built at your base, or a munitions expert who can use your workshop to create useful items such as pipe bombs or mines. Your community as a whole has a morale level that you need to keep reasonably high by completing missions and scavenging supplies, or risk adverse results such as a survivor abandoning the group, or even deciding to off themselves. Influence is also measured and plays a huge factor. Provide for and assist the community and you'll be able to equip yourself with better gear from the group's communal supply, convince another survivor to tag along and watch your back, or direct the group's radio operator to keep an ear out for the location of especially needed supplies. Slack by letting missions expire or by failing to scavenge enough useful items, and you'll end up poorly equipped and with minimal clout until you can turn things around.While there's a variety of activities and missions to take part in - rescuing newly discovered survivors and getting them back to base safely; hunting down relatively rare boss zombies (or ""weird ones"" as the characters sometimes refer to them); working your way through several threads of primary story missions; or simply trying to return home in one piece with that valuable case of medicine or that fragile high-end sports car you happened across - there's no doubt that Decay is primarily about fighting zombies. And seeing as how they're virtually everywhere, you can't outrun them beyond short distances (zombies don't get winded, but you definitely will, often at the most inopportune times), stealth is only practical on occasion, and vehicles are too fragile to be used as your main zombie-killing method, you'll be engaging zombies quite frequently whenever you're away from your base. There's a reasonable variety of nicely-done fighting animations. Special combat moves can be unlocked as your skills improve, and that weakling survivor who started out by barely being able to swing a pipe and had trouble defeating even a single zombie without getting gnawed on rather extensively can become a real powerhouse in time, rendering an encounter with a few zombies as nothing more than an annoyance, and even becoming capable of wading into the middle of an entire horde of half a dozen zombies or more and coming out alive (although almost certainly not unscathed). While guns are a relatively common find, making noise in Decay generally leads to bad things happening, so you'll likely be doing most of your killing hand to hand. The noise from bashing in a door or a zombie's skull, the engine of a vehicle, or even just searching through an abandoned house can be enough to alert a nearby zombie or two; firing off a few shots from a pistol, shotgun, or rifle, even one with a suppressor attached, seems to bring every zombie for blocks around running, and is best done only as a last resort, or when you're a few steps away from a nearby vehicle or the safety of your base, or in the handful of story missions where you actually have some significant backup. Fortunately, even though you may do it hundreds of times by game's end, sprinting up to a zombie so you can dropkick it to the ground and then finishing it off by driving your knee through its face never really gets old. It's a thoroughly addictive game, building and improving your base and leveling up your various survivors. It's also often a surprisingly tense one. The game has a day/night cycle, so half the time you're in the dark, and getting a request to clear out a nearby infested warehouse or hunt down a dangerous boss zombie when you can barely see ten feet in front of you is unlikely to be something you'll look forward to. Even during the day, some of the structures you'll enter will be shrouded in darkness, with a zombie unseen (but fortunately usually not unheard) ready to pounce from some dark corner. And of course there's the ever-present threat of permadeath. No matter how badass your survivor is, there's always the possibility that a fight will spiral out of control, that beating one zombie to re-death makes enough noise to alert another, and fighting that one draws in two more, and suddenly routine combat has turned dire and potentially deadly. That one time you keep your injured, exhausted, broken-weaponed, out-of-healing-items survivor out extra long because you're low on influence and you've decided to search one more house for supplies may also be the one time they manage to accidentally alert a nearby horde. Which quite possibly will lead to you becoming an unwilling witness to the rather brutal death animation. Decay is not without some issues. There are minor annoyances, such as the lack of variety in the vehicles, or the fact that despite gasoline being a salvageable resource nobody thought to bring a generator along and you're forced to stumble around your base bumping into walls in the dark with an under-powered flashlight. But there are a few more serious issues as well. At least one side mission failed to trigger. One of my survivors clipped into a piece of furniture and became stuck, forcing me to exit mid-mission and lose progress, while on another occasion a favorite survivor became inexplicably glued to a structure's outside wall, making her a nice easy target for a charging boss zombie and getting her killed (on the final story mission, no less). And the game essentially continues to play after you exit, with the continued, unseen scavenging and activities of the community members simulated the next time the game is launched, and while that lends it an interesting twist, it has a tendency to cause overtly negative events, such as illogical, precipitous morale drops, and some players even reporting returning after an absence to find significant items or survivors themselves having disappeared without even a journal entry of explanation.Ultimately though, those issues have little bearing on the overall experience, and the positives far outweigh any negatives. In short, not only is State of Decay the most enjoyable game I've played in recent memory, it's quite probably my favorite game of 2013.			"

												They are now releasing State of Decay with better graphics and we can just all hope we get upgraded since its we who bought the game that made this possible, but not likly since they have gotten a new name on it ""State Of Decay Year One Survival Edition"". and for all of us who bought the game and all its DLC's we have to buy a new game even thou its the same game and only get 33% off the full price, when ppl do this i stop supporting that company/ppl on every new release they have, since they cant upgrade the ppl who made them money to begin with, so this is a rip off, dont buy. Better to go and play farmville on facebook sadly, at least they dont ask you to take it in the brown eye and then ask you to lick it clean afterwards. But latly there have been alot of this crap going around with giving the game away for free after ppl allready have bought it, so the ppl who used money on it feel like they are treated badly since the guys who didnt support the game by buying it gets it for free.

												Yeah...Dont think I'm willing to burn away $30 for a game I already own. For those interested who have NOT originally bought and played this game, State of Decay is actually a really fun game. For me it did a pretty damn good job at making it seem like you were actually surviving. Going out to scavange, ammo is sparse, there's permadeath, you have to build your base and maintain it. It felt like zombie survival. Sure it was buggy...really buggy at times but it was still fun. So after however long it's been since I've played it I figured I'd give it another play....only to find out that the game I have is garbage and have to buy it again in order to play itThis is terrible, this is a scam. You cant update the game and delete the original. What was so hard to just fix the actual game? So no. I'm not gonna rebuy the game I already own. For people who havent played it, I'd recommend it...for those who own the game...dont bother. You already own this game			"

""IT'S GOOD RIGHT? I MEAN IT DOESN'T SUCK.""I still remember it. 3 years ago. 4th September. I was about to date one of the most bomb girl you ever saw. And guess what? What I was doing instead of doing what I was suppose to do? Well, I believe you got it right. Since this is review of State of Decay and I mentioned it just now for the first time, your answer is State of Decay. Alright, enough of sentiment, let's get into the game. Story starts out pretty weak, again with lot of questions and as usual you are just ordinary citizen of small US town and after a while zombie-killing machine. The whole story itself is really not that important, at least wasn't for me, it's about enjoying that zombie rampage, enjoying RPG elements and just trying to survive. Really good thing is, that you can die, your friends can die, people in your house can die but you will take the control of somebody else and you'll continue. That's really awesome. Way more better if it was just ""you die, game over"" cliche. AI is really really weak. No matter if it's zombies or survivors, it's both really low. Survivors are absolutely not independent. It's not like I do mind taking care of somebody else, but thing is that they can't take care of themselves and that's it.Getting supplies, scavenging town, building rooms in your house, upgrading your house,, building new spots and making area secure is one of my most favorite elements out of this game. Audio is not really strong side of State of Decay and visuals are not that good either, but there's no reason to turn away from it.  Game will last you estimated 12 +- hours and price point is fair. You can extend that time period by buying two DLCs which are basically worth buying. I will make more in-depth reviews on both on their respective Store Page. So now just few sentences.Breakdown - This DLC does not carry any story, it's just basically let you do infinite survival. You're unlocking different heroes and try to survive as long as possible. Hordes are spawning fast, and supplies going away fast too. When you run out of everything you'll use your RV to get out. And to be honest that's it. Get it for 2,49€ in sale.Lifeline - You are in control of Greyhound One unit on your way to rescue scientists. New map, new characters and new weaponry. It'll extend your gaming experience by 3-4 hours. Linear but still fun. Again, get it in sale and you're good.Get both for achievements.To sum it up, pretty nice zombie survival game for good money, pretty enjoyable and you can play it even second time and still enjoy it. Easy achievements and killing hordes is fun. Weak AI and audio but you can live with that. Most definitely worth the shot.Bonus Point: Wheat FieldsRating: 8/10 "

												Was a great zombie survival at one point, until the developers decided it would be a great idea to rerelease the same game in HD, and screw their fanbase over by leaving us with a buggy and poorly optimized game.At the timeof release, I really really wanted to like this one; but the ""state of decay"" the game is in now is an understatement.The developer pushed their customer's good faith too far and their new HD release (with bug fixes!) shoved Undead Labs back into obscurity. Literally forcing you to buy the same title, for a patch and some new paint.TLDR; Don't buy it, was worth it at one point; not anymore.			"

Not too many patches and the game is a poor port that struggles to push 45FPS on a good rig.Then the ""Year One"" edition came out so you can buy the exact same game with the exact same stuff again but with basic patching and ""better textures"".Trusted devs, got stabbed in the back.

												State of Decay, is a zombie game that focuses on survival. Population size is dwindling along with the resources you can find throughout the city you explore. Time is not on your side, the world will persist even when you are not playing. Finding a fortifiable location to barricade from zombie hordes is critical to winning the game.ProgressionAs you progress through the story you are given certain facilities to use as your headquarters, once you hit a certain point of the game you are allowed to re-allocate your base.SurvivalThe main game focuses on a balance between survival, difficulty and story. Any character you play can be killed off by zombies and stay dead. There is no way to bring them back other than starting over again or attempting to exit the game before it auto-saves. Some characters clearly have better traits than others especially the first guy you play as. If you let them die, you will be disadvantaged. Training multiple characters to be strong and capable of survival is critical. Breakout DLCThe DLC is survival oriented with the story stripped out, which results in a good experience, not interrupted by constantly redoing cinematics or certain missions over and over. Instead, it allows you to play at your own pace and repair the van to proceed to the next difficulty. Every trip reduces the total amount of resources within the city, scales the damage of the enemies up, and reduces the amount of cars available.Persistent WorldA major con to some people but also appealing to others is the persistent world. Alot of people dislike the fact that while you're away from the game the resources are depleting every day. The people who play more hours a day have a much greater benefit than those who play few hours or attempt to play it casually.			"

												Sod was a good game, though it did have some minor bugs, with worthwhile DLCs.The makers though decided to give a middle finger to this games owners by deciding to package up future bugfixes and every other improvement into a 'special edition' of the game. Rather then push bugfixes for the game - as they should - and release the enhanced content - New weaponry, missions, graphics - as a DLC they decided to wrap everything up into a entirely new game.Owners of this game were given  the ♥♥♥♥♥ end of the stick - You want bug fixes? Ok, just buy this game again!			"

												This game was epic not my top zombie game but up there however it is no longer updated in favor of the special edition. I understand that companies can't support their games forever but they are supporting the special edition but none of the updates are trickling down to us pleebs. I also understand that they payed extra to get more content. Which is well in good but you could at least send down the bug fixes so we can play the game again. This killed an impecable game which I throughly enjoyed. In short another great game killed by greedy devs. Game 6/10 Devs 0/10			"

												I don't normally post reviews and before today I would have posted a positive review. Today I thought to myself, I haven't played State of Decay in a while, that would be a lot of fun. But wouldn't you know it, the damn thing doesn't work! Completely unplayable. The Undead Labs logo screen freezes and after a Ctrl-Alt-Del I get to the menu and the text is just black boxes which are located nowhere near where the text should be. I tried my luck, clicking around on the screen to try and just get into the game, but the game itself is just a black screen with some coloured boxes at the bottom. This game was great, but I cannot play it and I think it's absolutely ♥♥♥♥ that the developers/publishers won't migrate players to the newer version or at the very least release a patch so I can play the game that I PAID FOR.

Shame i bought it when it was new as i wont re-buy the entire game for a minor game/ graphics update in YOSE, plus i can no longer get the ""Preppers Pack"" DLC, (though i may still get the new character unlock... i guess) as i have the Original Game, still that is of little consolation, the HD graphics Pack should be a FREE DLC (Like Skyrim Did... and then Gave me a free copy when it became the remastered version). I supported your realese early and this is how it gets repayed.  I wont replay my now outdated copy with naff graphics, and wont payout again for this game, Not Cool.			"

												At first you may thought that...typical ""owh, it's another generic zombie game"" ... but don't... it's not, it's better... Have you watch/read/play the Walking Dead series? No? than you should...if yes, feel it's different than other zombie genre? cause that's how State of Decay will make you feel. Have you try DayZ? or Rust, or Borderlands or other apocalyptic games. which most of it focus on 'multiplayer' or 'coop'. If that what you digg, than good for you. What if you didn't? what if you want to play a single player experience and proceed at your own pace. Without having to deal with 'a**hat' in online game, that will ruins your game by killing you at the glimpse of your body. Than, this is your game. A single player experience of zombie game that you never play before.This game is not about all out killing zombies. It's more of a base management simulation. When it make you feel/think how to survive day and night, while managing a group of survivors. Like how Rick have to, in Walking Dead. Gathering resources is not because you want to, but only just because you need. Take only what you have to, and leave the rest for later. Resources are scatter.. and limited for the whole map. No respawn of resources. You may see the map kinda small, but after you travel, it is really big. Lot of places to scavange. Lot of story to unfold. Roleplay a bit on your journey. It will make the game better. Take the limitation in game as a challenges, on what you can do in order to overcome those obstacles, such as storage limits etc.  Feel the need to survive, in this State of Decay.			"

												Hello guys!For all of you (like me) who struggle(d) with the issue of game freezing after Undead Labs logo, dispair not! There is a simple fix : create a .cfg file named ""user.cfg"" with these simple parameters : r_Fullscreen=1r_Width=1920r_Height=1080or any of your liking, depending on your monitors native resolution, then place the file in the ""Game"" folder in the game`s install directory so : Steam/steamapps/common/State of Decay/Game. Now you`re set to go! Game engine will render scenes and text properly. But remember not to touch the resolution sliders as it will result in a crashdump. You can only alter the details slider (which will be set to min by default).Now, for setting up AA, this is what you will have to do if you have an Nvidia card : SGSSAAOpen State of Decay driver profile via NVIDIA Inspector.Change Antialiasing compatibility to 0x000012C1[4]Change Antialiasing - Mode to Override any application settingChange Antialiasing - Setting to 4x [4x Multisampling] or 8xQ [8x Multisampling]Change Antialiasing - Transparency Supersampling to 4x Sparse Grid Supersampling or 8x Sparse Grid SupersamplingApply changes. This method is very performance demanding and may decrease your general performance.FXAAIf you are a NVIDIA user enable FXAA from NVIDIA Control Panel or NVIDIA Inspector.Or use FXAA Tool.SMAAUse injectSMAA by mrhaandi.Or use SweetFX by CeeJay.dk.I will leave my source for all the information I`ve posted, but you can find more there, so check it out : http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/State_of_Decay.

												Do not buy this game, allow for me to explain.I played this game for hours on my 360, before I knew how great gaming on a PC was. I used to go to Undead Lab's website and look forward to everything they would post however now I see who they truly are. Once on PC, the game itself ran decently, however as I continued playing I noticed constant frame droppings for no reason. I also took note of the animations in the game, they seemed really awkward. The textures also seemed to look dull, I was expecting them to look a bit sharper considering this was running on CRYengine but never mind that. A remastered version was coming out to the new consoles, which means an update for us!!!! .... kind of.We too on PC got the Year One version however what it is, is simply an update to this version of SoD. Literally an update, you are literally being forced to pay a fee for an update. This version of the game seemed to be dropped and they will only continue updating the new version. Shame on you, Undead Labs. I don't think I will be purchasing another UL game for now.			"

												Game is extremely meh. It's repetitive, grindy, and feels incomplete/unfinished especially with its joke of an ending. Base building is super shallow and relationships between survivors are nonexistent. AI is atrocious for survivors and zombies. If you're in a siege mission, then all your AI companions do is stand still and board up windows while the only thing that zombies do is attack the boarded windows. Big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't enter the house, they just ram into it which damages the boards. You literally have to exit the house and kill the zombies outside to progress things.Your survivors constantly go missing/get stuck/need to be rescued, hordes constantly spawn, infestations constantly spawn, special zombies constantly spawn, etc. The game simulates itself when you're not playing it so if you don't want to come back to a game where all your neighbors are dead, all your supplies are drained, and your group is missing, then enjoy babysitting constantly to quit the game on a good note. You can also just keep the game indefinitely paused to prevent this.There are few home sites, and only 2 of them are any good.Scavenging is pointless if you play for long periods of time. Despite having a day/night cycle, days only pass during simulation. Supplies only drain when you're not playing the game and you can easily overstock on everything in about 30-45 minutes.The game is also incredibly easy. After clocking in about 30 hours, I only died once and that's because I was trying to make my experience as hard as possible.Mechanics are easily abusable. Stuck alone with no health and a feral chasing you? Switch to a character in your home base and then switch back to your character. He/she will teleport immediately back to base.Game is very short too. You can easily beat it in 8-10 hours.I guess the best thing I can say is the port is very faithful to the 360 original. They even ported over all the bugs and glitches!Almost nothing has changed in this game from when it was an Early Access title to a full fledged release. There are no graphical customization options, limited resolution options, awful performance, and mouse acceleration.The DLC looks like it might be fun but I'll stay away from it until it's sub-$5.My full review:

												State of Decay is a third-person zombie apocalypse survival game developed by Undead Labs and published by Microsoft. State of Decay is a single player only game.State of Decay gameplay is quite deep, but somewhat repetitive at certain point. At the start of the game, you play as two main characters, Marcus Campbell and Ed Jones as they are ambushed by the living dead. Then you will have a home base where you and other survivors making a stand against the undead. From there, the sandbox play begins. Your home base is where you and your others survivors live, obviously, and it needs supplies to survive. You need to hunt and raid outside to get supplies like foods, medicines, building materials, ammunitions, weapons or fuels. Your home base can also be improved, you can build a workshop, garden, sleeping area and more as long as your home base has the space for them. You can move out from your current home base and find a new bigger or better one too. When you're out there hunting, you may find some neighboring survivors or survivors who may want to join you in your home base. You will also find some driveable civilian vehicles which can also be used as cargo for your scavenged supplies for you to bring home. Your home base will sometimes attacked by approaching zombie hordes. You will need to set up some outpost to defend against these living dead hordes. Outpost will also create a small safe zone outside your home for you to take shelter.In State of Decay, survivors can become tired, injured or sick. When that happen to survivors you currently play, better get home and switch to another survivors. Yes, you can switch characters when you have become friends with them. If a survivor gets tired, his/her max stamina will decrease, same goes when he/she is injured. Survivors will also gain some experience and skill as you play with them, such as cardio, wits (ability to search faster but quiet), fighting, shooting and more. But beware if your survivors is killed, their death is permanent. Survivors can be equipped with melee or firearms, whichever you prefer, but melee weapons will gets damaged over time and will be destroyed if not repaired. Firearms can also gets damaged and if not repaired, will become jammed but not destroyed.Graphics of State of Decay is great, looks good, but not one of those next generation thing. Using CryEngine 3, State of Decay does have good environment view, lightning, good textures, physics and effects. Characters animations are great, when dodging zombies, attacking with melee, it's good. Blood and gore effects are also present in this game, in fact, you can see your survivors getting torn in 2 pieces by the zombies.State of Decay performance is good, but can use more optimization. At maximum setting, the game sometimes but rarely stutters which can ruin your aim when using a gun. Aiming a gun also seems clumsy and quite hard. Otherwise the performance is good and fine.If you're looking for more friendly zombie apocalypse game, then State of Decay is for you, since the game is single player only, you won't find yourself get shot from the back by somebody when you just spawn in the game. With deep gameplay mechanics, State of Decay can entertain you for many hours. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

You left everyone who purchased the whole game and DLC's and decided to publish the updated version as a new game (YOSE) and sell it for a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money to force people to buy it again if they won't to have the game up to date. That's something a blood-sucking company such as EA would do.			"

												You will never get over the beautiful nature and atmosphere in this game. You don't need the YOSE Day One DLC to improve the graphics. I thought they were going to release a normal update but instead they charge you $30 for some simple improvements that you don't need. As for the glitches they aren't bad at all and sometimes aren't even noticeable. It's still beautiful the way it is. If you're one of those people who are into super fast paced massive Rambo shooter garbage games, then this game is not for you. Because it's slow paced and ridiculously relaxing but can also be challenging at the same time. And VERY realistic, because even when you quit the game, it still carries on!This game is a shocker, it's wonderfully made and most probably the best zombie survival game out there. Open world. Excellent vehicle handling and controls. I love the gore. Smooth combats and the NPCs are amazing and not brain-dead. The soundtracks are lovely. And the atmosphere is one of the very best.A true feeling of surviving an apocalypse. Scavenging for resources, such as food, medicines, ammo, fuel and materials to improve your base. Building outposts. Setting up traps to prevent the zeds from nearing your home. Requiring skilled people to be able to do things such as repairing the vehicles, creating weapons and explosives, training the survivors, doing experiments and so much more. Meeting other survivors you can help and trade with. You always need to make sure you are well prepared every time you're out on a mission because you never know when you can encounter a horde or the freaks. Zombies can be hilarious with their not so bright brains but can be distracted with lights and noise such as gun shots, cars, sprinting. But what I like the most, is when someone dies, they're really gone. Which is frustrating, but makes you do your best to survive and be better at the game. It's really amazing! There is so much more things to do! I only wish it had Co-op or multi-player, so I can never stop playing it. But still, I can't get enough of it. I highly recommend it and both DLCs. You get to experience the zombie apocalypse as the army in Lifeline. And you get more of State of Decay in Breakdown. And both are very challenging as well and incredibly fun! Five stars!			"

												While undeniably a fun open world experience that is hands down more entertaining and rewarding than games like DayZ and H1Z1, this game has always been a buggy mess on the PC with graphics that are lackluster at best and a downright mess at worst. To be blunt, it needed a ton of mods to be even minutely enjoyable after an hour or so. It was in desperate need of major patching to fix graphics issues and repair many of the game breaking bugs it suffered from, and finally that improvement is here! All you have to do is repurchase the game and double your monetary investment!			"

												I've been playing Undead Labs's State of Decay for the past several weeks after nabbing it on sale. The game is a single-player third-person zombie apocalypse sandbox of sorts: while the main game has a storyline to follow, you certainly don't need to follow it and the story won't advance until you do, giving you a lot of time to just poke around.I have enjoyed the game very much.  It's certainly interesting enough to play and while it starts out reasonably tame, it can get quite difficult.The main game begins with your character and a buddy returning to the more civilization-adjacent parts of a national park after a two-week fishing trip only to find that, while you were gone, civilization kind of had a major meltdown.  From there, the game focuses on steath and survival by building up friendships with others and establishing a base from which to operate and outposts to reinforce that base and provide small ""safe zones"".CriticismsThe criticisms I have are somewhat picky.  To start, the story is very simple and somewhat shallow — it would be easy to play through it relatively quickly and then be just done with the game.  A lot more could have been done, but, as I understand it this was Undead Labs's first game, and it was made for XBox Arcade with all the limitations that requires -- so we will perhaps see more story development in their next full release.Second, there just isn't enough information in the tutorial; you feel bombarded with information (because a lot comes in through your Journal) that you can't make much sense of — and then lost because basic information (such as the benefits of establishing an Outpost, or whether it's wise to leave resources in Outposts or loot them thoroughly before setting one up in a location) can be a little difficult to find.Third, there are too few voice actors, meaning that you end up with the same voice actors' lines being used for several different characters who end up sounding exactly the same while they say (verbatim) the same things; get two of them with the same voice together on a mission and it can get kind of confusing.Finally: the driving physics and UI need some work.  The game was set up for XBox, so maybe this is where PC players like me start to have problems.  But while I can play Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto and drive just fine, I find the driving in State of Decay frustrating — especially because the smallest mistake can send a car sailing through the air as though it suddenly weighs nothing.  And cars that turn over always explode, so there's that.PraiseMeanwhile, though, State of Decay is nice to look at: the colors are just muted enough to evoke the proper autumn at the end-of-the-world feeling, and there has been a lot of attention to detail in filling out the large area (Trumbull Valley) in which your character gets to roam.  There are three small towns to explore, as well as a lot of countryside, with a lot of interesting things to look at if you appreciate the details.The game also makes you take a step back and figure out how to survive.  Your character can go stealth or maniac, or pretty much anything in between.  But don't count on the zombies to cooperate since that's sure to get your favorite character eaten nearly every time.  And since death is final, that really makes a difference.Strategy and sound are important, which I really enjoy, and on top of that there is also resource management to deal with: you've got a base full of survivors who need food, medicine, and ammunition to remain survivors, and construction materials to keep their base up.  Scavenging through the zombie-infested, burnt-out world is a constant necessity.In the end, the game is definitely worth a few bucks (especially if you can catch it on sale), and I look forward to other games from Undead Labs.Breakdown DLCI've played several hours of the Breakdown DLC (at level 5, currently), and it's been a lot of fun and a lot of frustration, but the frustration really seems to be the point of it.  It's primarily the sandbox version of the base game, with a couple simple tasks to do to ""move to the next level"".  Each level, the zombies get more numerous and more difficult to deal with and the scavenge-able resources get harder to find.If you don't mind that sort of challenge — the one where you are pretty sure you'll ultimately fail — it can end up being a lot of fun.

												wow...that game blew me away.i was never too much into those zombie and/or survival-games...but this title might have changed this :)The mix between scavaging ressources, fighting zombies, driving/walking around the open world and trying to keep your group of survivors alive and sane is pretty well done.The game will push you to do all the above, that you won't end up bored, but it's ""relaxed"" enough to not make it frustrating (imho).Basically all houses in the world can be entered and searched for goods you'll need for your outpost, which adds a lot to the atmosphere as you don't have any locked doors (at least not that i can remember).The world itself is pretty beautiful and detailed, although graphics isn't the big strength of the game, it still is very well done, but it would have been nice to have some tuning options (antialiasing etc pp).Gameplay will become repetitive, with few sidemissions to do, like rescuing other survivors, cleaning out zombie-infested areas and helping other survivor-groups out.But for me, the variety of options you have, makes it interesting all the time because you seemlessly switch between scavenging, doing a sidemission, driving around, sneaking around, looking for better outposts etc. so it never became boring for me (but i could understand if people find it too repetitive).All in all, it's a great zombie-survival open-world game and would recommend it to anyone who even slightly into those games.

												The stealth gameplay is decent if you have the patience for it, melee is more or less a button mash, shooting isn't anything spectacular, but it works good enough. Driving is fairly straightforward, though you can't drive through barriers, making you have to look for the long way around some areas. Honestly, it's a port of an arcade game, so what can you really expect in this regard.There's a permadeath feature in this game, which is an interesting feature, but it serves to highlight State of Decay's biggest problem. There's no reason to care about anyone apart from the intro characters because you'll quickly realize that, past some scripted events at the starting base, dialogue between survivors is generic, and the only real personality you get out of any of them is via their stats sheet.If the people we're supposed to care about in your game/show/movie/whatever don't have unique personalities,  we have ZERO reason to care about whether they live or die. If we can't care about the characters, we can't care about the story they're in. And that's what happened to me. I quit just after getting a new base,TL;DR - An open world zombie survival game where the humans have about as much showable personality as the zombies, possibly even less.  Skip it. "

												You know the feeling where you're playing a game that's kinda terrible but you really really want to level this ♥♥♥♥ so you can finally go to sleep and do it again tomorrow?Turn that entire an entire game and you get State of Decay. It's a flying kick zombie skull crushing base building persistent sandbox world morale mission dating sim with a bevy of uniqueish characters and firearms that is probably actually detrimental to your health. I mean... the game progresses in real time when you're not playing.DLCBreakdown is a survival version of SoD's main map, procedurally populated that allows you to play different characters from the story with unique abilities. Lifeline is an actiony soldiers-kill-zombies-and-rescue-civvies game that is more linear and has a smaller map. It also adds guns and a vehicle or two to the base game. It's probably a 6 hour game if you blew through the missions back-to-back.Worth?I'd say the base game and Breakdown are worth $10. Lifeline would also be worth $10 on it's own. This game is the type most people do one long binge session, then don't touch again. Despite the DLC there's not that much replay value.This game is often on bundle for $10 or less with all DLC.

												Unfortunately, while the game on its own is good, the developers decided that instead of patching the game for free, they would re-release it under the guise of a ""remastered"" edition. This means everyone who bought the original game not only are completely disregarded, but do NOT get the patches for bugs. It's a pretty horrendous model, and it's sad that it happened with this game.			"

												I tried to like SOD but unfortunately it didn't like me. The game starts well with you straight in the thick of it, which almost made up for the bad cut scenes where my character's feet are glued to the floor. Nothing is explained: the whole inventory, skills, crafting menus are left for you to faff about with until you get the hang of them. The only skill you really need however is inventory management in order to shuffle around all the semi-useless tat you find and carry: putting them in bags, putting them in backpacks, putting things in car boots, driving somewhere and unloading it all again. It's like a packing-for-holiday simulator without the holiday. Friends help out, but sometimes run back to base for no reason. Others won't let you be their friends but occasionally get sad, even though you're doing all the work. You scavenge the same building four times in one street. The same four lines of dialogue are heard again and again. Enemies spawn endlessly from quest locations. On and on and on. Finally comes the best surprise: the game plays itself when you turn it off. All your tiredness goes away (hurrah!), all your stockpiling runs out and all your barracades are taken down (not so hurrah). So that's SOD: it's like my day job. I work hard while others do nothing but get tired, sad or both, the work mounts up faster than I can deal with it, and if I take a day off, I'm twice as busy when I get back. 4/10.			"

												Being a big fan of the zombie culture that has been getting dramatically more popular over the past decade I couldn't tell you how ecstatic I was for the launch of this title. The world isn't in any shortage of zombie games, there being even a few survival style ones out there. I'd like to think I've tried most of them as possible even some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones *coughfortzombiecough*. Typically I'd pass over console titles, but this was different. As a gamer who has played PC games exclusively for around ten years or so I was really biting the bullet when I purchased an XBox and accessories to play just this title alone.I was not dissappointed. Undead Labs delivered a title onto XBox live like no other when it came to this particular niche of the zambonie genre. Even with a broken XBox that I had bought cheap, and a knockoff microsoft controller that had it's share of problems I was having a blast. I watched the world around me change as I began ransacking the county, ventiliating craniums along the way. My survivors honed their skills, as they were being equipped better and stockpiling more, still surprising me to this day with how many weapons there are. The empty courtyards of the bases converted into stat boosting facilities. Hordes moved through town, infesting and congregating at buildings. Other survivor groups came and went. Joined us, or were made into lunch. It was quite pleasant. Unfortunately the general overlay of the map does not change, and even then the console hardware wasn't up to snuff to help matters much either.Then the PC version released. I most certainly was excited to see what was different and when I launched for the first time I was pleasantly surprised. After maxing out the settings it looked like an entirely new game. Through its developement I was a bit salty about the title going to XBox Live, and still think UL would've been better off focusing on it as a PC title to start with but this more than makes up for it. Breakout launches tomorrow, and I've been watching the updates for it. Its going to be good, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed good.If you don't have State of Decay already, you should be ashamed. Its only $20 and you will get your money's worth and then some. The only thing that could make this near perfect zombie game over the top is multiplayer.			"

												This is the first game that I wish had a ""maybe"" to answer the question, ""Would you recommend this game.""State of Decay has many of the things that I have long looked for in a Zombie Survival horror type game. But before I get ahead of myself lets break it down.Graphics are fairly good in my opinion. The specular maps aren't really anything to write home about and the texture resolution will not light the world on fire but for the price and from a small developer they did alright.The sound if pretty satisfying. Different guns and bomb have a variety of splody sounds and I'm not really one to care too much about bass or presence...my gaming rig doesn't even have a sound card O_oStoryline is fairly simple. In the campaign you are a survivor with a friend camping in the mountains when you realize the world has gone to ♥♥♥♥. You meet up with other survivors, find shelter and have quest missions while you try and figure out how to get out of town for good...blah blah blah. To be honest I found the storyline campaign long, and annoying. Far too linear and the fetch quests became really annoying after a while. The rest of this review deals solely with Break Down.Breakdown is the sandbox version of the story campaign with ALL of the storyline elements and quests removed. It lets you set up a base, and ""outposts"" around the town that provide a ""safe area"" where zombies can't spawn into. These outposts can be set up around, food, medical, ammo, or building supplies which can give a bonus to your total supply cache.Scavenging is the major function of this game. Search houses, find anything helpful and take it back to the group. The player is rewarded with ""influence"" points that allow them to set up more outposts, relocate the base, or perform special actions from special characters within their group. A military character will have an ""artillery strike"" option. A priest has ""words of encouragement"" that can remove negative fatigue status from a character. Influence is also needed to remove any supplies a player might take on a scavenging run, guns, ammo, melee weapons, medical supplies or food.Break down's goal is to survive until the ""escape RV"" is located, fixed and supplied. The player then chooses a small group of characters to get on the RV and leave the town. You are then randomly spawned back into the same town and the difficulty increases. More zombies, fewer supplies, harder special zombies.There are a LOT of zombies as well as special zombies. Combat becomes a balance of choosing the right weapon for the right characters. (ie: matching the proper weapons with a characters stats.) Using the right moves in combat that will maximize damage output while minimizing the use of stamina. You will meet randomly generated NPC characters that can join your group. The player is capable of switching between characters and infact HAS to in order for previous characters to rest, or heal from wounds.This is where the tedium comes in. State of Decay is full of crap, awful characters. You will find drunks, slobs, jerks, sleazeballs and s luts. None of whom will aid you in your survival. You have a maximum number of characters that your base can support and the game quickly turns into a macabre ""culling"" of the ""dead weight"" from your group. You can and will take characters out on supply runs and make sure they your ally never returns. Or you may just take direct control of a character and throw them off a cliff to break a leg and be eaten by zombies. You won't do this once, or twice. You will do this as many time as it takes, until the game spawns good characters. The problem is that you don't know the stats of survivors you invite to join you...until they have joined you.This can become mind numbingly boring. The environments are HUGE and mostly empty. You will drive for miles into the country, past farms and fields. There are only two towns in the game. Missions and friendly ""enclaves"" spawn randomly so if you are in the southern most town you can receive a quest on the other end of the freaking map...hope you like driving.Another issue is that the game had ""Early Access"" and I believe it also had a beta and there are still tons of glitches and flaws in this game. There is an active game forum on their website. You can report glitches and the staff is usually quick to respond but I hate small developers turning paying customers into their own game testers. I've been a game tester before and if I'm reproducing a bug for a developer...I'm getting paid for it.State of Decay Vanilla had tons of bugs, many that crashed the game. Before those were fixed, Break Down DLC came out. The bugs still haven't been fixed and they are releasing their second DLC.Inconclusion, I guess I can't recommend State of Decay. If you can get it bundled 75% off or more on a steam sale or humble indie bundle, go for it. But full price...noooooo.			"

												State of Decay takes straight away: once the loading screen disappears, you should become separated from the frock of live dead persons and to drag especially nimble zombie from a neck of the best friend. The shy hope to find rescue on a post of a coast guard quickly disappears — instead of the armed soldiers three ""civil"" frightened to death there huddle. 15 minutes later roaring crowd of walking corpses will break into the house and will relieve survived of need to be afraid. This game will be suitable for fans to kill the zombie. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours). "

												After so many hours of gameplay and updates, the game behaves worse than ever. It is still full of bugs, and its performance has become terrible. When I bought it, before any dlcs were out, I could run it on ultra settings or high and have no problem with the performance, now I cannot run it even on medium settings, it misses frames, there is lagging and several other issues graphic wise. The controls behave horrible especially when you are driving a car, any car. I have a gaming laptop, it's 4 years old and needs to retire and get some rest but it still runs Skyrim, Dragon Age origin, Dragon Age II, Fallout New Vegas, Dead Island, Dead Island Riptide Risen, all 3 of Mass Effect, to name but few, it runs them as it did when it was young without problem. So instead of improving the game they made it worse. Now I see they release it again, probably with every issue fixed but they ask again money for it from their customers, us who bought this crap from the beginning. No I do not recommend to spend your hard earned money for this game. They do not respect us and they try to squeeze more money out of us.			"

												So much potential, squandered. They released the entire game in stages selling it as DLC. The simple fact that normal things like basic replayability was sold to us as DLC was absurd enough, but the hostility of their community managers towards the earlier critics of the game is what caught my interest most of all as I take a keen interest in the use of suppression tactics against gaming media who aren't part of the sycophantic love-bomb crowd. You can tell a lot about developers and companies based on the way they handle criticism. Some people, like Squad, will cyber stalk their critics and try to 'expose' them for past misdeeds (in their eyes), others will wear it and even address it and repair their game improving it's standards. In the case of State of Decay it seemed they would actively delete any criticisms they encountered which left me far more cynical of their game overall. But even with a fanboy attitude when I first discovered the game it was another 'great potential, poor execution' zombie game, sadly. :(			"

												This game was quite fun and I still find myself playing it on occasion, the bad review isn't necessarily completely the game's fault, mainly the developers. If you could care less, go buy YOSE unless you already have this version.This game itself was quite buggy on many PC configurations, though I could have recommended this game to anyone despite the bugs because the gameplay was worth it.However, the bugs and issues were fixable with some tweaks. Now, they charge for an update to the game which is a very scummy move from Undead Labs and it's becoming much more common with other developers as well.If you already own this copy of State of Decay, save yourself the headache and spend your money elsewhere because the ""Update"" is not worth it. If you really want the game but don't own it, YOSE is the only (Legal) choice now.			"

												Edit: Forget this review, the devs are releasing a newer, improved version of the game, so get that instead.Yet another zombie survival game. Oh, don't we see them so often? The answer is: Yes, HOWEVER, this game takes a new and interesting approach to the apocolypse. Nevermind finding a cure or trying to leave town to some place nice and quiet; State of Decay forces you into a world where the main focus is to fortify a home/base and to live off the surrounding, sometimes desolate buildings. Find food, feed your community members. Find materials, upgrade your base. Find oil, power your generator. Find ammo, defend yourselves from the shambling remains of what used to be your average Joe. Find and rescue other survivors, convince them to join your community. Survive as long as you could as a community. This game makes it clear you need a hand in the end of the world. Now, let's not get too off-topic - this is a review. This brings the question: So why should I get this game?    Well, although this game had a so-so port from Xbox to PC, although it has semi-frequent glitches, and although it has rather repetetive dialogue, the game makes up for this in many other aspects. I can play this for hours on end, but for the sake of my mental health, I keep each session under 4 hours. This game is great fun, and it can seriously get nerve racking at certain points, whether from the plot or from you just scavenging a town alone. There hasn't been one point in this entire game that I didn't enjoy spending time in the destroyed world that remains. After all, you don't choose the world you live in, but you choose what role you will play in said world.All being said, I highly recommend you give this game a go, and if you like it, get the DLC (but we'll leave the DLC for another review or two).

												State of Decay is the kind of zombie game I'd been hoping for; equal parts exploration and combat, with sprinkles of RPG on top. Are there flaws? Certainly. Does the game feel complete? Not in all areas, but the core concepts and ideas are so good that in the end (heh), it doesn't leave you feeling as though you got half a product.    Despite some quirks and an abysmally abrupt ending, I think State of Decay is worth your time and money, and here's why.GAMEPLAYLet's be honest here: this game, like many other games, lives and dies based on its gameplay. There are other factors that are good, but if the gameplay was bad in a game like this, it'd be looked over, maybe rightfully so. Luckily, Undead Labs has nailed almost every single facet of gameplay, from melee and ranged battles all the way to their robust progression and homestead systems. I'll break these down into small sub-sections for readability's sake.          COMBAT - RANGED           State of Decay, like many other games, features both gun-based and melee-based combat, but unlike some, doesn't miss a step with either. The ranged combat is typical TPS fare, but with much more emphasis on ammo conservation and timing your reloads carefully. There are many guns on offer, from rifles and revolvers to shotguns and grenade launchers, and they each have unique handling amongst the many varieties in each type. There are also skills you can unlock to make yourself better at certain types of guns, as well as a handy late-game skill to slow time when aiming, and you can craft and find weapon suppressors that last a certain amount of shots for when you need to headshot some zeds, but not attract dozens of others.          COMBAT - MELEE           The melee combat is satisfingly meaty, and by the end of the game I felt like there was a lot to it that I hadn't begun to master. With a handful of melee categories, and quite a few weapons in each of those, every swing you take at a shuffling corpse is different, but all of them feel meaty and, dare I say, visceral. There's some limb dismemberment, leading to situations where an undead is still coming at you with both of its arms laying on the ground behind it, but it's all about either decapitating a zombie as it stands or knocking it to the ground to finish it off with a cool animation. There are some skills that tie into the melee as well, including ones that make you excel at a certain kind of weapon, or just sweet knockdown skills, my favorite of which was a low spin-kick that all-but-guaranteed a knockdown on multiple targets, setting up sick combos as I spun and crushed my way to victories. There are durabilities on each melee weapon, unlike guns, but they're pretty abundant so you never feel helpless for long. The only downside to using melee is that it's tied into your universal stamina meter, meaning if you don't make your hits count, you'll quickly be out of breath against zombies that just won't quit.            MOVEMENT AND VEHICLES            The on-foot movement is pretty basic, but the sprinting, climbing, and vaulting over objects is all hooked to your stamina, so not only can you not sprint for long, but sprinting into a fight is a bad idea. You can eventually level up your Cardio over time, but by and large you're going to want to use vehicles for anything that's more than a slight jaunt. The good news is, there are dozens of vehicles, all with different handling and appearances, and driving them is fun as hell, probably because it's never not satisfying to throw open your door into a zombie while you're doing 50MPH across a cornfield. There are some.. curious physics when you collide with something in your car, leading to some amusing crashes where I was thrown, rolling, into the air as my car hit something and did a forwards flip, but by and large the vehicles are well-done and can really get you out of a jam, despite the fact that zombies can climb onto and tear doors off of your vehicle. When this happens, you and your passengers can be pulled out of the car by an especially overzealous zed intent on your destruction.                PROGRESSION               Progress in State of Decay is level-based by skill, and each skill levels up by repetition. Kill a bunch of zombies with a gun, your Shooting levels up. Run for miles and you'll be rewarded with a boost to Cardio. It all feels very natural, and at certain levels you'll unlock new skills to help keep you on your feet and help you put the dead back in undead. Each character levels up differently, and some of them have different traits, meaning a few characters might level up shooting quickly, but be bad at Wits, or vice versa. It's a good system, and it means you'll want to swap between characters frequently.               CHARACTERS AND DEATH                To be able to switch to a character, you need to be in Friend status with them, meaning you haven't shot them too many times/nearly ran them over/made decisions they didn't like. It's a basic system, but one that ensures you'll want to keep on everyone's good side so you can use as many characters as possible, especially since death is permanent. When a character dies, they're gone for good, leading to morale losses, but you can pick up some of the stuff they were carrying and bring it to your home base for a slight morale boost, leading me to the next subject: home.               HOMES               The place you'll be spending a lot of time in, bringing supplies to, and upgrading is up to you; there are a variety of home spots after the first main one, and where you want to set up shop is up to you. Personally, after I made my first homebase switch, I felt vaguely annoyed. I'd lost a lot of progress and had to rebuild some facilities, and by the end of the game it didn't seem to have mattered much. A watchtower is all I really needed, so someone could keep zombies from breaking in, and by the time I got that at my second house, the game had very few missions left. Nonetheless, the amount of facilities you can build is pretty good; ranging from sleeping areas to infirmaries and workshops, each one grants bonuses or crafting options, and they can help turn the tide against the undead onslaught. You'll need to find the materials for each, though, and that's a big part of my annoyance with the game, as you'll see next.             LOOT/SCAVENGING/EXPLORATION             To scavenge a shiny, white glowing container, simply walk up to it and hold a button. A small ring pops up, showing how close you are to being done with scavenging that. Holding another button means it goes faster, but is louder and has the chance to make a loud noise, attracting zombies. When it's open, you figure out which stuff is worth taking in your very limited personal inventory, see if there's any Construction Materials/Ammo/Medicine/Food containers inside, which load onto your back and make your stamina drain very fast with sprinting, and back out. You can only carry one of this kind of container at a time, but later you can radio scavengers to come pick up more. It's a fine system and the first 100 times, it's fun to see what kind of things you'll find, but by the end of the game it becomes a chore, especially since materials get scarcer and scarcer, leading you to driving all over the map in hopes of finding a stash of materials to build another upgrade to your house. The constant fetching can be annoying, which I'm about to gripe on further.  --Continued in comments-- "

												I don't recommend you buy this game, which is good because you can't.I would leave a review on the Year One Survival Edition page but I don't own the double-dip version.Negatives:-People often float everywhere and the animations are busted.-Looks like the camera lens has been coated in vaseline to hide the console quality graphics.-Combat system is all about awkward animations and clicking.I get the feeling that the developers made the game so that they would enjoy it, and not so that we would enjoy it:-There are loads of systems at play which are mega-confusing to anyone except the people who made the game or have the time to read through lengthy guides online. It doesn't help that the game doesn't pause when you're in the menus, so you can't even take your time to study them or learn what's going on. Every couple of seconds there's someone shouting over the radio or a zombie approaching - I like that they were trying to emulate the experience of the zombie apocalypse, but I'm trying to learn the damn menus and read the damn numbers and remember what I was doing last time I played. And that leads onto the next problem:-You have to download a mod to turn off the 'feature' where medical supplies/food/etc are used up in real time when you're not playing the game (the worst design decision I have ever seen). If you stop playing for a while, loads of your supplies are used up. Not because anyone in the game world did anything, but because you yourself stopped playing the game for a week. Makes no sense whatsoever.Positives:-You can't buy this.			"

												While those interested in the burgeoning zombie survival sandbox genre have no shortage of titles to partake of, those seeking a solo experience have been left with few options, particularly on the PC. Multiplayer games inspired by the Arma 2 mod, Dayz, seem to be popping up everywhere but the appreciable potential for a singleplayer game that focuses on PvE rather than PvP has on the platform gone unfulfilled. State of Decay looks to cash in on this opening, offering up a sizable chunk of game world populated by zombies, AI survivors and lots of loot-filled buildings to scour. While there are more than a few rough edges in State of Decay and a lack of the heart-stopping tension found in Dayz, there is an engrossing and enjoyable game here with a lot of things to do given the low cost of entry.The start of the game sees you fighting zombies and completing simple fetch quests for a small group of survivors garrisoned in a ranger station. You are introduced to the combat and looting mechanics, but these only garnish the more engaging aspects of the experience. Soon you find yourself entwined with a larger group of survivors holed up in a church just outside a small town. This will serve as your base throughout most of the game as you earn the trust of fellow survivors, fortify your encampment and go out in search of supplies. Ensuring the well being of this group of survivors is ultimately what keeps State of Decay moving forward, as it provides good incentive for you to engage in the gameplay tasks which without context would be fairly banal.After the opening sequence of the game, the constant flood of missions that you are informed of via radio chatter take a back seat to exploration and looting. Ensuring that your group of survivors have enough food and medical supplies will be the most pressing issue, and can be remedied by searching through houses which may contain zombies, supplies or occasionally survivors who can be convinced to join your group. You can climb tall objects and 'survey' the surrounding area, revealing locations of interest. Once inside a building, objects which contain items must be searched, and this takes several seconds to complete. Whether you try and sneak around avoiding combat with the walking undead, quietly scavenging what you need, or go in swinging to clear a house of its decrepit occupants before searching for goodies remains entirely up to you. You can radio home to request an AI survivor come out and pick up the supplies for you, but this requires clearing a location of all zombies first.If you decide to clear a location of zombies before poking around for loot, the combat is functional but uninspired. With a melee weapon you swing away until either you run out of stamina, the zombies' heads explode or your weapon breaks. If you manage to knock a zombie down you can finish it off with a brutal swing of your chosen instrument of death, but most of the challenge lies in ensuring you don't get surrounded or backed into a corner. Firearms are straightforward and satisfying to use, although ammunition isn't readily available and firing a unsilenced weapon will attract nearby zombies, meaning they are best used only when the situation gets out of hand. Sneaking around zombies is a viable method, particularly when dealing with larger groups, and can be accomplished by takedowns from behind, distracting zombies with objects or using firearms with home-made silencers that only last for a set number of shots.The zombies themselves shamble around convincingly enough, at least until they get stuck in the terrain which happens all too frequently. The undead will hop through windows, climb fences and grab you from behind as they endeavor to end your life. Special zombie types eventually start showing up, which range from the bullet-proof SWAT zombies to ones that explode in a cloud of poisonous gas when killed to hulking beasts that charge like bulls and sponge up a lot of firepower before going down.If you do get killed, which happens very infrequently, rather than reverting to an old save you will start playing as another survivor in your group. It is in your best interest to keep survivors alive for as long as possible since you gradually gain passive improvements to a character over time, such as improved stamina, melee damage and increased health. If you are out and about with one character for too long, their maximum stamina will be decreased until they go back to the base and rest. When you do this, you will take control of a different survivor, meaning you will end up playing as many different characters throughout the game.While the explorable area in State of Decay isn't huge, you can enter and drive vehicles left lying around which are all conveniently unlocked with keys in the ignition. Driving a car feels responsive and light almost to a fault; if you crash into an object at speed your vehicle will go flying in some pretty crazy ways. Running over zombies is a very effective way of killing them, although cars will become damaged in the process. Zombie hordes roam the streets, and running into them at full speed will be as damaging to your vehicle as it will be to the shambling flesh-eaters.The amount of time you spend on State of Decay is linked directly to how invested you become in the well-being of your survivor group as well as your tolerance for repetition given there is no real end to the game but the random objectives start repeating. It takes a good amount of time and scavenging to fully upgrade your survivor camp with an infirmary, vehicle-repair station and watchtowers among other fortifications, but if you don't buy into the well being of your AI dependants you will struggle to care enough to go through the trouble of collecting all the required materials.If you have been looking for a zombie-themed survival sandbox but don't want to contend with bandits and hackers in online games, State of Decay will scratch that itch. The lack of tension in exploration is vindicated by fairly complex mechanics surrounding the well-being of a group of survivors you must watch over. State of Decay succeeds in its ambitions and despite some rough edges provides a compelling open world experience.Recommended "

												It's actually a decent game.  However, there is a game-breaking bug that can occur very late in the story that stops progression.  Lots of people have reported having this bug for about a year now, yet it's still there.  Since the game constantly auto-saves as you go, you're just hosed and have to start over.  For that reason alone, I can't recommend it.			"

												State of Decay is the open-world third person apocalyptic survival game that I have waited for this whole generation, Day Z and Dead Island were close for me but they both lacked a few things here and there. While DayZ had survival, Dead Island had the world and mechanics, State of Decay have both of these aspects, and pull them off very successfully.You quickly realize that the game push a lot of information at you the first few hours, like every home base can only have so many structures, do you want more sleeping areas to keep the characters in the camp rested? Or maybe you want a library to research some better medical aid for when someone get hurt? From this point on the game becomes very dark, it will test your moral. And rightfully so.Every now and then you stumble across new survivors, complete strangers in need of help. What are you going to do? Do you help them and risk running out of food? Or do you save them in hope of finding a few food supplies?This also takes us back to the base aspect, you could build a garden instead of a library or sleeping area, as this will give you food daily. Because food each day must be good right? Yes, it is, but if you don't have enough beds for everyone, each character will slow but sure get tired, fatigued. This goes for your playable characters as well as NPCs in the camp.If a player character don't rest after a while of exploring, the stamina will decrease, making you worse in combat and increase the chance of dying. Death is permanent, and there is no save/reload feature to abuse. The game autosaves after each finished mission, and that is it.The less playable characters you have available, the harder the game gets, because you have less to pick from when the others need a few hours in the bed to rest.Keeping a character alive and well will not only serve as a jump option, but they also gain skills and level up depending on what they do. Melee combat? Increase the fighting skill, making you more efficient with melee weapons. Same goes for guns, looting etc.However should you be unlucky and die, the items you got on you can be retrieved with another character, so don't panic!You will meet tough situations where people you know get infected, and we all know how to ""fix"" that problem. It can be a hard call, depending on the connection with each individual character, the NPC can get overrun while on a supply run you called in, and if you don't help them, may they RIP.The game consistently keeps throwing missions/tasks at you, you have to prioritize, which is more important? Save this guy? Or scout this area to call out locations of meds, zeds or maybe you want to find out what the Army is up to.The story is also pretty well put together, i keeps you interested, and makes you feel connected with the characters living in the world, making you feel the need to help (most) of them. Helping other survivor outposts will also benefit resources like ammunition, food, construction material etc. But how you play in the world also affect how everyone in the world watch you, reckless driving is negative and will make everyone look at you in a bad way, same goes for reckless shooting. But in the end, it's all about survival, keeping morale up, food on the table and killing the zeds!			"

I can't say that I was happy after hearing them saying that they weren't going to add co-op to this game which would of increased the replayability even more.

GG EVERYBODY WE TOOK YOUR MONEY! I attempted to get a steam refund because of a glitch where literally I couldn't advance story and all that happened was my camera panned around the sergeants head. I attempted to fix this by removing all files and doing a fresh install and it didn't fix. I was denied my refund because ""I played the game 4 hours"" When in actuality I played the game about 1 hour, and spent 3 hours trying to debug something because I WANTED A FUN GAME. Okay I lied it was probably about 1 hour 15. While the additional hour was spent waiting to see if maybe something would load around the sergeants game and the remaining time was spent doing a brand new save file seeing if maybe I had just a corrupted save. So in the end ♥♥♥♥ YOU STATE OF DECAY. They ♥♥♥♥ing push out a ""year one addition"" and advertise it on Steam I wouldn't buy it. If it fixed all the bugs then ♥♥♥♥ing let everybody who bought your first attempt get it for free? NO YOU WANT $20.. yeah you know what you can take the $20 I spent on your game, buy a ♥♥♥♥♥ and shove it up your ♥♥♥ you piece of ♥♥♥♥ game developers.			"

												State of Decay is a GTA-esque zombie survival game.  You play as a group of survivors who must search for supplies and safe-houses while the main storyline unfolds.  Even though it’s another zombie game, this one does a whole lot of things right.  The story is almost generic but game play is quite enjoyable and after a while you really care for your crew.  It is devastating to lose a character after working so hard to level up his/her skills.  And dead means dead people.  No going back to reload saves here.There are several RPG elements, not only for your characters but for upgrading your base as well.  The game also added a touch of realism by having people get tired which temporarily gives them a greater and greater stamina penalty until they rest.The above being said, the game does have a large number of bugs still present, from clipping, to map glitches, to even crashing every now and then.  Also, this game BEGS to be co-op.  It would have been fantastic to go out and scavenge supplies and run over zombies with friends.  Sadly, the devs have stated that it would take too much to add co-op to the game at this point.  Huge missed opportunity there. Issues and all, there is no buyer’s remorse.  I still had (And currently am having) a ton of fun playing this game.  And that’s the important part! "

												Small price tag for a game that will yield a far-above average amount of hours even without DLC.An all-original free-form survival game that focuses on the growth of a group rather than the goals of a single person.Where do I start - base building, a large open world map, character traits, firearms, epic combat, etc.State of decay is an open-world, 3rd person, survival, group-management game that will definitely leave a mark on your ability to enjoy any other game that resembles it.The player progresses through the game by managing their group and their base. Keeping your group up to date with supplies, keeping your survivors from going insane, and keeping things mellow, are some of the tasks the player upholds when they first start their game. The player does not play as a single character, or a 'god' that overwatches the community, but rather the community itself. The base concept is that you gain enough trust with a person to befriend them, at which point you can switch back and forth between the characters you have befriended to take advantage of everybody in your friendgroup. There is no single main character, although the player can choose to concentrate on a single person. The twist here is that when characters die, they are dead forever, and won't come back. When playing the game, the player upholds a third person perspective with whatever person they are playing as. You can loot and scavenge, clear areas, set up outposts, scout out areas to add icons to your map, and much, much more.This game is one of those games that will leave you in doubt considering how much content it actually has versus how much you would think it didn't from a distance. There is so much going on in this game it is easy to miss the minor features here and there. From a distance, one may think it is just a third person combat-based shooter. But if they put any more than an hour into the game, and actually saw what the game had to offer, you would rethink your entire perspective in a single matter of visiting the base management screen.What I'm trying to get at is that the game does not start strong with the story mode. The game gives you the illusion that you are playing a game where you just follow a line of missions where you just go from mission to mission until eventually beating the game. Until you reach the church (The base and group the story mode gives you to start), it will seem like that. The game does not provide convinient tutorial on the game's content, leaving it up to the player to realize that they aren't playing a linear game maybe 3 hours since they started.There is a 'random bank' of survivors to ensure that the player will not end up with the same people every time (unless they are counting the story characters from story mode), there is no set spots for certain items to spawn, and every game playthrough you go through will be noteably different. The game generates missions based on what is needed or if the player hasn't tended to a growing problem. If you leave a guy to wallow in his anger for a long time, he will be at risk of snapping, giving the player the option to try to talk them down from their bad mood, or ask them to leave, as an example of this. Other survivors you aren't playing as can ask you for help, or you can even ask them for help as well.The game does not use money currency or anything like that, you use your influence in the group to make descisions and take things. This also means that you definitely do not start in the decision-making ranks, meaning that you will have to play it for a little bit before you gain the trust needed to make the big move to the bigger compound, stop that zed hunt, etc. Influence can be gained for sticking around for a while and doing a lot of influence-gaining tasks. Be involved with your group, and your group will be involved with you. It's not a game where you can screw around and hope your bros will survive.That's the one bad thing - you can't really screw around when driving that car off a cliff will destroy it permanently or the fact that ammo is really rare. It depends on what your motives for playing are.While I recommend this game, I must warn you that it requires time and goes off of a real-time simulation. Survivors will gather little supplies daily, or you might get lucky, but there is daily rates of consumption of each material depending on what your setup is. Maintenance may be required, but usually your group will make it. It's nothing you can't handle.Get this game if you have the time. If you are looking for something combat-based that you can play in an hour and not have to worry about anything, go play something else.			"

												Liked the concept and followed this game from the beginning, but wanted to wait while most of the technical issues will be fixed. Now Undead labs no longer support the game and offer me to pay them a second time for patched version.A blatant money grab if there ever was one. No person with any self respect or sense of justice will buy anything touched buy Undead labs ever again.			"

												So appearently, two years after the release of this buggy heaping mess, they decided to re-release the same game with an appearent ""Remastering"" to make it seem like a completely new and exciting game.The first game, this game, was buggy as hell, hard to run, unfun, and just generally a snooze-fest.The updated re-release, while seeming and/or promising to fix this, ends up having not fixed any of the bugs that made the first game such a train wreck.Not only that, but it appears they also did not fix anything.So, basically, this is a real-life simulation of if the WarZ dev team actually came up with something good, and did what they did what with the changing of the name and the lack of any other changes, before reuploading it. However in this case, the initial junk pile was never taken down, leading to two versions which, if you compare side-by-side, show that they hadn't changed anythingEven with the updates I never bothered to buy, I can't imagine that it would magically become a better game, or one that is good to play.

												Not the finest or the most polished game there is, but it managed to introduce a fresh spin to the open-world undead genre, with its permadeath elements and well-developed character/home base enhancements. Though side missions can be tedious, you're not obligated to them, and managing your base and the survivors in it can always be a blast.Combat's relatively well-made, keeping the tension up as you maneuver through the hordes hoping not to lose your best character - the undead never ceases, after all, so it's either that you focus on the job and get creative, or get efficient, or get killed.

												I actually liked State of Decay quite a bit. It's a fun little survival game with a lot of atmosphere and great community expansion with NPCs. Unfortunately the developers decided to drop support and instead release the exact same game with a minor patch and graphical update as a ""remastered edition"" that costs $30.State of Decay decayed way too soon.

												State of Decay certainly doesn't waste any time. Mere seconds past the Start screen, it throws you headlong into a zombie apocalypse in full bloom. Tree branch in hand, you clobber the shambling corpses attempting to munch on your screaming camping buddy, and then seek out the few remaining survivors while scrounging for supplies, weapons, and ever-safer home bases. That's just the first 20 minutes, but the core of State of Decay's gameplay never changes as you make your way through its open world and battle an endless cast of zombies. State of Decay finds its soul in the dreary repetition of apocalyptic survival.State of Decay's open world manages a substantial degree of immersion, complete with an expansive and occasionally intimidating map and the ability to drive cars freely across the landscape. The cars handle poorly, but the ability to use them to mow down roving zombie swarms offers a malicious satisfaction. You quickly learn to fight zombies only if you absolutely have to in State of Decay, and therein lies much of its appeal. This is not a game about Bruce Campbell badassing about in Evil Dead; it's a celebration of the normal person and all of his or her associated weaknesses. Some of the characters you come across have no combat experience at all.Death is permanent in State of Decay, which means that even characters with fully voiced storylines and unique dialogue die forever if you let them get overrun. From there, you can only continue through the eyes of another character you've befriended.Few things add more tension to State of Decay than the terrifying noise guns make, because a single foolish shot can bring an unmanageable horde upon you.Permanent death is a smart addition, though, since losing characters with high skills across the board carries with it a real sense of loss, particularly if their voice quests and customized responses in some quests led you to believe they were an essential character. Sometimes they don't even have to die in the field; if a character you've been controlling sustains enough injuries--a few undead chomps don't result in instant zombification in State of Decay--he'll lie bedridden and useless at your home base. The good news is that the need to rest and switch out characters results in you amassing a balanced group of playable characters anyway.It's a bit strange that a game that places such a heavy emphasis on interpersonal relationships should have no cooperative mode. You spend your time with State of Decay alone, joining up with other NPCs only for specialized quests and escort missions that bring other survivors back to your current base camp. It's especially odd since State of Decay starts out with a party of two, suggesting that you'll always have a buddy at your side if need be.State of Decay serves up a near constant barrage of suspense and immersion that leaves even the briefest jaunts away from your home base tinged with the threat of death. Its flaws are numerous and impossible to ignore, but in spite of them, State of Decay is a captivating survival adventure set in a bleak and harrowing world.			"

												Fantastic game, by far my favorite zombe/sandbox/survival game. Takes some getting used to the menus and features, but is well worth taking the time and effort. A few features are annoying, like the frequency of random events and requests bogging down the ability to just explore and enjoy (it seems the developers are more used to creating quest-driven games and aren't too comfortable with open worlds), and there are some bugs that the dev team seems uninterested in addressing. But the game is otherwise so fine I'm willing to put up with these.So why not recommended? Because this is sadly a classic case of a company taking horrid, blatant advantage of their supporters. I bought the game in early access PC port mode, and what do us loyal fans get in return? Refusals to fix bugs, DLC that adds very little and refuses to fix bugs, and then a massive re-release that is just a slight visual upgrade that yet again refuses to address bugs and - big surprise - early access peeps don't get access to.Newsflash, video game developers: Giving someone early access is an implicit contract that (1) you will actually finish the game, and (2) your early supporters are supplied with upgraded versions as the game further develops.Undead Labs has clearly decided to abandon their project and just soak up whatever money they can from the suckers. It is painfully obvious they had no intention to actually finish the game once the money started rolling in. They - and especially founder Jeff Stray - are dead to me. I will henceforth blacklist any game they put out (assuming the unlikely outcome that they produce any more), as well as any Xbox port to PC, and anything Jeff Stray or other leaders of this offensive scam ever attemt to do in the future. Pathetic.			"

UPD: Added a paragraph about the Lifeline DLC below.Don't you just hate it when you return from a relaxing fishing trip at the lake and find out that both your wife and mother-in-law turned into vicious man-hating psychopaths? Oh wait.As you have probably already guessed, this is a cross-species relationship simulator where you spend roughly about twenty hours of game time bashing your former loved ones and neighbors in the teeth with a rusty pipe wrench. Over and over again. Oh, and don't forget to rob their house while you're at it! That's it. That's the entire game. Honest.In all seriousness, this is by far the best open-world zombie survival simulator around, on a par with Project Zomboid, but let me be (for real this time) honest there for a moment. It gets repetitive. It offers nothing new to the zombie apocalypse genre, story wise. It's full of (albeit, hilarious) geometry glitches. But then again, so is Skyrim! Yet it's a great game. So what's so special about SoD, anyways? Well, for one, how about tossing a creepy-♥♥♥ talking doll into the midst of a zombie horde to keep them entertained while you rummage through somebody's underwear in search for an aspirin? B*tches love talking dolls. Still not enough? Fine.SoD, much like The Walking Dead, has a great deal of realism added to it. Resources you scavenge, for once, play a huge role in the game and your characters aren't unstoppable killing machines - if they die, they die permanently. SoD has quite a heavy emphasis on strategic micromanagement, instead of being just another run-n-gun. Finding a suitable home base, upgrading its facilities, going on exhausting day-to-day scavenging runs, and keeping morale up is essential, and what makes the game incredibly fun. The story... Well, it's there. Alongside with everyone's favorite Plucky Comic Relief trope (Barry Wheeler? Joe Barbaro? Yeah.). But anyways.Looking for a highly immersive zombie apocalypse experience? Look no further. Just one word of caution, it's highly addictive. And if you're a true masochist, try out the Breakdown DLC, which ramps up the difficulty and removes the story altogether, focusing solely on the survival aspect. Just don't forget to tell your mommy you won't be coming for dinner.Too busy trying not to become one, amirite. She'll understand.P.S. For those still having doubts, Lifeline DLC is a super nice (and surprisingly cheap!) addition, since it FINALLY features a whole new map for you to explore: I'll go so far as to say that it's worth buying just for the map alone, and if you get it on sale then it's just a steal. My only complaint is that you don't have a lot of freedom during the story since you're on the clock pretty much 24/7. But I guess that comes with being in the military, eh?			"

												This game is awesome for Zombie Survival fans, it has lots of characters, missions, and of course boarding windows.  For regular gamers this game will get real boring, real fast.  Its all a series of fetch quests, then again that is what survival is, get food, building supplies and other stuff to keep your survivors alive.  This game has permadeath where once a survivor dies their gone for good.  Also the game plays itself or something when its turned off or if the player stops playing the game keeps playing itself.  While the developer on their forums wrote up this long post about how its impossible to remove, ignore the dev, and just download a mod because there are tons that disable the game from playing itself.  The game is very unique, and its a HUGE world.  There is alot of dialog in this game, its pretty impressive really.  Finally a zombie game that is PVE, not that PVP crap like other games which is just any FPS deathmatch game with zombies.  This is a game based on survival.  There are some flaws in this game.  For example if you loot a house of stuff or search it, the house can never be searched again.  But if you kill the zombies those in that house, those will come back again and again.  So its kind of out of balance that way, even the cars wont respawn.Regular People:  1/10  Value:  $4.99Zombie Fans:  7/10   Value:  $9.99			"

												This game has finally everything I had hoped for in a zombie game - especially regarding the survival aspect of it.The thing most people tend to forget about zombies and zombie stories is that the zombies are not the main threat, not the main reason the outbreak is so hard to survive. This game gets it right: The main problem is gathering supplies and keeping a group together, you have to be able to rely on your teammates and hope you have enough space to carry the loot to your hub so you can upgrade it defend it against zombie hordes marching your way.I also love the aspect of finding new survivors and them helping you out - or abuse your medical stash.All in all, State of Decay just gets the Zombie Apocalypse right.

This review is based on playing the game with all DLC:Quite frankly one of the best zombie survival games I've played in an extremely long time. While it suffers from some bizzare design choices, it still as a whole presents a zombie survival simulator that isn't just about bashing zombie's brains in.The base game:The base game with no DLC is a solid experience. It starts you off in a tutorial area to teach you the basics of the game, killing zombies. When it comes to interaction with zombies you have three choices. Fight, run, or sneak by. Fighting is pretty good in the game but it kinda suffers from dependancy on weapons. The game does have abilities for the survivors to use their own physical skills like punching and kicking to take out zombies, but they don't do much damage. You're basically forced to use a weapon, whether it be a melee weapon or a gun. But since finding a weapon is extremely easy, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Using guns also is a great experience. Each weapon feels distinctive and while some are weak like low caliber pistols, others make you feel like Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead. Guns also adhear to a noise system. If you fire a gun, you attract zombies from far and wide. However guns are extremely powerful against the special zombies in the game so the balance of when to and when not to use a gun is a constant concern. As said before, there are special zombies in the game. If you've played Left 4 Dead you probably know what to expect. The tank, the attracter, the predator, and the stunner. There are other special types, but they're basically just regular zombies that can't be killed by guns. And while it's starting to get annoying for zombie games to always have special zombie types, at least in State of Decay they're more rarer than in other games.Next is my most favorite part of the game, base and resource management. In the game, just like in real life, there's a constant need for materials. Whether it be food or construction materials or ammo, your community needs supplies in order to stay alive. If you don't keep up with the demand, your base will fall. There's no work around, you have to scavenge houses and buisnesses to find supplies. When you do find supply crates you have two options, you can carry the crate in a pack on your back and take it back to base for upkeep in your base or you can break it open and put whatever's inside into storage at base. You don't get upkeep on your base but you get what's inside, be it ammo or food or whatever it may have.Finally there's the story. The game takes place at the near beginning of the zombie apocalypse. You and your friends have to work together to survive as long as you can while trying to figure out a way out of the valley you're trapped in. Along the way you meet other survivors. Some you can recruit into your community to help you while others have their own thing going that you can be friends with, or enemies. Doing most of the side missions involving the other communities are optional but if you help them, they'll help you with all sorts of abilites. One for example can drop motars on a group of zombies while another can deliever a car wherever you need. The main storyline is also very well made with an end game challenge that actually made me want to rage quit, something that rarely happens anymore with games getting easier. The ending also is extremely great considering what's on the horizon for the developer that made the game, Undead Labs. I won't spoil it for you but let's just say if you love the game and want more when the sequel comes out, it may be worth it to get an Xbox ONE, assuming of course Microsoft keeps it's word and makes the sequel Xbox exclusive.Now for those bizzare design choices I mentioned. As I said before, base management is my favorite part of the game. But unfortunately the tutorial is a little lack luster and sometimes confusing. It sometimes explains too much in some areas without explaining enough in others. What's the benefit of having construction A in the base over construction B? Also the choice of allowing the safe zone to become so big through the establishment of outposts is kinda weird to me. Don't get me wrong, not having to worry about my base while I'm across the map is great, but it kinda takes away the fear of being overrun in a setting that's absolutely perfect for that kind of fear.  All in all, it's still worth buying just for the base game alone. Especially when it's on sale and even more especially if you decide to use some mods for the game.Breakdown DLC:This DLC alone is worth buying the game. It's basically the base game except there's no time constrictons and you're free to do whatever you want. The challenge is unlocking all the playable characters through certain actions. In the first playthrough you have to say, kill 5 special zombies to unlock a character. Overtime you'll unlock all the characters you can in that playthough and be allowed to move up to the next. In level 2, zombies are harder to kill and there's more special infected. But there's more challenges, unlocking better survivors. The constant challenge of an increasingly harder game is alone worth playing while unlocking the better newer characters is just a great cherry on top. While some have criticize the DLC for not doing much in terms of changing the game, I say it's perfect for those that want a long term challenge.Lifeline DLC:This DLC quite frankly will test everything you learned from the other parts of the game. This time it's an entirely new campaign you'll be playing. No old characters are rehashed and you even play in a new map. Quite possibly the worst case scenario map to play in a game like this, an urban city. Zombies are EVERYWHERE! Sneaking is now not just an option, it's a necessity in this densily populated area. The campaign is also surperb in delivery based on what characters you play as and the base building and maintaining is still my most favorite part. But the biggest challenge is, again the population of the map. Firing weapons is just a big no no on this map as every zombie within a mile is gonna hear it, even though ironically you start off with all the guns and ammo you could ask for. If you're looking for the ultimate challenge in urban zombie survival, this is the DLC for you. Just don't be surprised if you find yourself yelling in terror about all the zombies running at you.

												State of Decay.Now with its two DLCs Breakdown and Lifeline (at the time of this review's writing. Idk if they intend to release more dlcs)The base game is a fun, gritty experience at a post apocalyptic world where zombies overrun the world and you control survivors and try to tough it out and survive. Your decisions have weight and consequences, whether you choose to handle a situation as soon as you get into it or delay your decision, there are consequences that will affect your game in ways that amaze me. Though i really dislike the fact that the zombies themselves can run, there are mods for that. Sure the unmodded experience is fun too but i feel like mods tend to enhance gameplay. I myself installed several, mostly ones that make the zombie population a lot more dense and force them to shamble and walk towards you.Adds a lot of tension as you try to mow down zombies with a table leg you just found in a house you were scavenging. Every hit exhausts you, you run and hope they don't catch up. You panic as you keep running to avoid your death at the hands of the zeds.You get back to your home base, you build more improvements and go over your plans to hit the next few houses for supplies and maybe even radio other survivors. And for a moment, you feel safe and sound. Until a siege comes along.What i think that this game does best is make the player emotionally invest in the characters.You grow attached to a certain survivor and you want to see him/her make it out. You grow attached to some survivors and you do everything you can so that they survive. When i had to put down a few survivors because they were infected, that really hit me hard in the feels.and i was pretty bummed when my chosen survivor got torn in half by a horde during a scavenging mission gone terribly wrong. Good job Undead Labs. Though after my main survivor died, i kinda didn't touch the game again.:<			"

												This game mixes part zombie horror/survival with some city building and people management. The game starts with you taking control of a couple guys coming back from a remote fishing trip to find out that the area they are in is now in the middle of a zombie outbreak. You meet up with other survivors and try to get enough supplies and weapons to survive long enough to..... well I'm not sure to what end cause I'm pretty sure I screwed up somehow and wasn't sure what happened but I got to the end game screen.I recommend this game because it was fun to play. I've played it on both Console and PC and both times the game was enjoyable. That being said there was some design decisions that made sense for the game I guess, but just didn't sit well with me. Slight SPOILERS ahead I guess.The game is constantly forcing you to do things, there is never seems to be a break. There is always someone in trouble getting supplies, or someone missing or someone who wants to take out a zombie infestation. While you are doing those misssions there are also story missions that are happening and this game doesn't care what else you are doing, if you don't show up for that story mission someone is gonna die and that part of the storyline is gone. The problem with all these side/main quests happening ALL the time is it doesn't just let you explore the game. The map is a pretty decent size with some neat areas to find and explore. The problem is that you don't want to be on the northwest corner of the map when a story mission suddenly pops up on the southeast corner. Maybe I just failed at seeing the options to tell the people in my little fortification to just sit there and don't leave but it was annoying to have these quests pop up all the time. Made the game probably a little more of a realistic zombie game but from a guy who likes exploring, the way these side quests worked just didn't work for me.I did really enjoy the way the inventory worked in this game, it was really well done. You can get different sizes of backpack, though you'll pretty well get the biggest size pretty quickly and that is usually enough to get the job done. You also get the trunk of the vehilce that you're driving (if you use a vehicle to get around). In addition you can carry one bag of supplies (again the trunk of the vehicle can store multiple bags). Anything that you find can be stored into the community inventory which gives you influence points (instead of using money), so you can trade things you find for other things in the community inventory(either things that were there originally or things that other survivors have made). Finishing various side quests or main quests will also give you points to get additional items out of the inventory. If you get the big bag and use the vehicles trunks/box efficiently you'll have enough points for pretty well anything you'll ever need.The Zombies were pretty standard zombies, they moved at about the same pace as your characters but could be out run with sprinting, however you can only sprint for a limited amount of time. There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more. But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way. The fit the game really well. As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part. Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.You can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up. Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable. The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game. You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest. Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point. One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.The one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable. There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game. Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.Controls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me.			"

You can't fix a game's issues and rerelease it to the public, charging full price, without your local fan base being upset with you. That is just greedy and uncalled for.

You dig about Steam community for help, NONE. Go to the Undead Lab forum, the admin there act like they are trying to help, but nothing they ever do helps solve the problem.

												State of Decay is a sandbox zombie game done right. Managing your survivors, gathering supplies, avoiding death and infection, doing missions to get to the bottom of what is going on - all are handled very well. This is especially worth checking out if you are very into The Walking Dead. The port from consoles is not perfect by any means, but continues to be worked on.The only complaint I have is the degree to which the game 'plays itself' when you aren't playing - constantly draining your supplies, having survivors go out on their own and getting wounded or sick, etc. You need to be able to give a lot of time to the game and play it daily. It would be nice if this could be switched off as an option (even if it gets classed as 'easy' mode).I checked the game out as part of my first impressions series and you can see more of the game to help you decide if it is for you by watching it here:

												State of Decay is a fairly fun game, based on a mix of third person action, micromanagement, gathering quests and a great amount of repetitions, both visual (there is just a small textures and buildings core, the rest is a copy of it) and situational (there are like 3 or 4 different types of side quests, popping up a dozen every hour).All in all, I appreciated the ride for the most part, got bored every now and then doing always the same couple of things over and over again, kinda hated the performance issues (60 to 15 framerate drops during loadings are a tad too annoying while driving) and got absurdly underwhelmed by the ending (likely the worst thing of the entire game, and not because it's bad, but it's just so useless and badly realized that they could just have cut it out and settled for an infinite survival sim).It's clear Undead Labs were aiming extremely high, and I think it's also clear it was too high for them to actually pull off.

												Of the 130+ games in my Steam library, many of which I will never play the whole way through, this is the only game I actually regret spending money on.  The game lured me in with its promising use of survival mechanics (which may even be well done), but I simply cannot play because the graphics give me a splitting headache after the first 10 minutes of play.  Over-saturated colors with ridiculously high contrast turn everything into a colorful blur, and the game has almost zero configuration options.Add this to the fact that they are re-releasing the game with major patches and bug-fixes, and charging full price for another game rather than fixing what people already paid for?  Money-grubbing at its finest.			"

												I'd heard good things about this, and it surpassed my expectations to become my favourite new game in months. It's very close to what I always imagined the ideal zombie apocalypse survival game to be. And it's not just combat, combat, combat, this game makes you feel hunted and the moments of dramatic tension that arise naturally as you're sneaking around are great.There's an excellent balance between realism and action, a rich setting packed full of references and amusing little details, and clever use of noise as a gameplay element (loud noises can attract zombies from all over, which is often a risk, but also gives rise to tactics like the use of noise to lure or distract enemies). I also liked the combination of multiple playable characters and permanent death, if you get your character killed, it's final - they're dead and gone, and you'll have to play someone else from their group. It really feels like a loss when a survivor you've been building up into a badass gets torn apart in a raid gone horribly wrong.Owing to its small budget, it's a bit rough around the edges, but it has a heart of gold and a lot of ambition. At first I thought ""another zombie game?"" but this was a breath of fresh air to me.			"

												If anyone remembers the incomplete indie zombie survival game, Fort Zombie, State of Decay can be said to pretty much be its spiritual successor, and quite a successor it is. Its awesome! Like any game though, it has its ups and downs.- The game captures some incredible survival atmosphere. Scavenging to survive and keeping quiet while doing so is the key to gathering massive tons of precious loot. Such loot is not infinite, even if seemingly abundunt in the beginning, albiet difficult to get to sometimes with so many zombies on the prowl. The game tries to make it difficult but its quite easily beat once you learn the controls and how you manage your play. The minimap also makes it a little easier to spot zombies before they come for you.- Sound is your greatest enemy. The louder the sound, the more zombies you'll attract, and its almost impossible to come out of a running horde's charge unscathed (unless you're willing to waste precious ammo, or are smart enough to lure them into the radius of an outpost). This mechanic makes it that more fun and challenging to play around with, since almost everything you do will produce some kind of sound. That being said, its a good idea to be smart and patient. Sometimes, its better to walk than to drive a car, and better to melee than shooting a gun.- Guns are somehow easily obtainable from midgame onwards, although many dont account to anything unless you make headshots count. Missing or shooting without a silencer is almost a sure fire way of getting yourself swarmed. Two words that describe the ultimate in the late game finale: grenade launcher!- Every survivor is unique. Nobody looks the same as the other. Their initial skills and specialities also vary greatly, with some colourful extra skills to give that survivor their own unique flavour. You can switch to almost ANYBODY you pick up, as long as you take the time to earn their trust through missions and good deeds first. A number of the voiceovers for survivors are recycled, though, unless if its a major NPC with special dialogue. My other gripe is that its impossible to trade between characters. Stuff can only be traded through the stash and character switching.- Death is horrifyingly gruesome. When your health bar depletes, you go into a kind of button mashing recovery mode with all these zombies ripping at you. When you recover, your max health is reduced. Go down again and it will keep decreasing as they keep hitting you. When it reaches zero, your hapless survivor literally gets torn apart. Once you see it (for the achievement), you probably wont want to see it again. Its also a waste of a very precious resource. Your survivors are the ones that get things done, and losing them will make it a lot more difficult to play. Unlike loot, getting survivors to join you can also be quite difficult after a certain point. You'll also have to think about the amount of living space and food supply you have in your base. If you dont have enough, it will cause people to leave.- Missions can be repetitive, but its always fun to work out how to best tackle a situation without using too many meds or foods to boost health or stamina, or whether to stealth it or charge it. When you swing a melee weapon or perform executions on zombies, you use some stamina, which can quickly deplete if you're swarmed. No stamina almost always means a quick death if without food. Seriously. You wont even be able run away.- Although its already in a final build, there are still issues with clipping. Zombies and survivors get stuck in walls and in the ground. They wont be stuck for long, at least from what I have experianced. So far, its mostly tolerable.- After finishing the main storyline, you can purchase the DLC for a kind of endless sandbox game. The objective is to survive as long as possible. Moving bases will increase the difficulty, though Im not sure how. Im on the verge of completing the main campaign at this moment, and will be down for one of these soonish.Overall, I will give this game an 8/10. As far as single player zombie survival games go, I would think that this is what a proper one should look and play like. It would be interesting, however, to see how a game like this could fare as a multiplayer game. I would think that a number of player controlled communities, each competing for scavenged loot in an area, could make things even more interesting.			"

												In this game, you assume the role of an entire community where survivors of the apocalypse literally put their lives in your hands. This game gives you the choice between good and evil, and shows someone's true colors... when they play the game seriously.TL;DRI highly recommend this game. There's so many little details that you miss on you first dozen play through that when you see it you go ""Why didn't i notice that before?"". This game is aggravating. This game makes you feel like you are actually immersed into this world, and it's quite terrifying.Pros+Non Linear StorylineThis games storyline (For Base game and Lifeline- Breakdown does not have a storyline at all) is very unique, and you can fail missions to continue the story as well.+Every playthough is differentI have yet to find get the same playthough in my 40+ hours on steam.+You control a communityUnlike other zombie games, this one is more focused on the community aspect instead of a ""Lone Survivor"" type game.+Perma deathIf you lose a character, they are gone. (Until you start a new game)+You don't have to do every missionThere are consequences to not doing certain missions, but the choice is entirely yours.+Great communityI've been a member of Undead Labs' forums for a few years now, and it's one of my favorite places to be.Cons-Has it's slow pointsIf you don't know what you are doing, or have scavenged most of the map, there seems to be nothing to do.-Minor bugsThere's a few bugs that haven't been squashed due to the game's engine, like the erect truck glitch, where it literally stands your car straight up if you put it too close to specific objects.-Single player onlyWhile this game doesn't have multiplayer, it's still a great game, but later State of Decay titles will hopefully have multiplayer.Rating9.5/10This is by far one of the best single player zombie games you'll find out there.

												With abominations like The War Z, Nether and 7 Days to Die coming out recently, I'd almost given up on this genre. State of Decay has been sitting in my library for months untouched because I expected the worse. However I decided to start it up and oh my god, I'm annoyed for not doing it sooner.From the very beginning you're thrown into the open world and get taught the basic mechanics, before being given free roam and being able to approach the zombie apocalypse however you want. Want to stay with a group of survivors in a church? Go ahead, help them and earn their trust. Want to kill them all, loot their resources and start your own base? Go ahead, have fun!The combat itself is nowhere near as bad as I thought, it reminds me a lot of a basic version of the Assassin's Creed combat, with an option of using guns of course. The RPG elements are really cool, and I like not being anchored down with a 'main character' - you can play as whoever you want once you befriend them and level up their own skills.I see myself playing this a lot more in the future. It's honestly amazing.			"

												This game throws you in its world pretty much unprepared, explains only the most basic things. The graphic is mediocre (even for Xbox 360 standards), has sometimes odd graphic glitches, weird bugs (even after multiple patches), sometimes weird restrictions in gameplay (you cannot pass items to your companion) and a wonky AI.Yet it was one of the most enjoyable games I played in recent years. It balances wonderfully multiple activity's like base management, companion management, resources gathering, missions, exploring the map and the zombie killing without laying a heavy emphasis on any of it. Contains a rich atmosphere and fitting music/ambience. State of Decay - Main Game (9/10)It starts kinda slow, but after you leave the starting area heading to your first base it really gets interesting. Restarting the campaign multiple times trying something different.BreakDown - DLC (7/10)Basically the sandbox mode of main game without the story arc but with a few new playable characters and items. Has 10 levels which goes insanely hard with the last two levels, where you have pretty much no resources to work with, large strong zombie crowds and special infected everywhere.LifeLine - DLC (8/10)Plays near a infested city with a new story arc and characters. While it's not as big as it initially looks like (you cannot enter the city), it still has everything which made the main game fun, set in a new (even though smaller) environment. State of Decay is in my personal top 3 zombie games of all time with the very first Dead Rising and  Walking Dead Season 1.			"

												I really liked the concept of this open world zombie survival game, but it was let down a bit by mediocre execution. It really lacks polish, well..  that's being generous, it's just really rough around the edges.The good stuff:- You can control multiple characters - change between the survivors at home base. They have their own loadout and XP based skillset.- Permadeath - it REALLY intensifies the experience when you're on a mission, and all of a sudden you are low on health, exhausted and struggling to reach your car parked outside while a horde is on your heels.  I lost a couple of experienced survivors that way - I simply underestimated the danger and paid the cost. But learned to park close by, facing the right direction :)- Place outposts, and customize/upgrade your home base- Lots of different interesting weapons and items- Fairly diverse assortment of missions- Great atmosphere - loved the area/map. Really invited you to go explore searching for great lootThe bad:- Melee combat system too simple- Poor A.I.- The survivors are literally chronically exhausted pansies with no adrenaline glands..  GRR!- Camera getting obstructed by bushes/trees- Anti-climatic ending.Bugs/annoyances:- Zombies waist deep in.. FLOOR! You can't even melee them.- Zombies doing the running man against thigh high crates trying to reach you- Too few ""one liners"" - e.g. returning home with multiple rucksacks will often trigger the exact same ping-pong ""dialouge"" 4 times in close succession. - Cars getting relocated during cutscenes- Conversating characters during cutscenes not even remotely looking at eachother - Cars burning in the streets for weeks - energy crisis averted!-  Scavenger hunt progress increases while the ""scavenger"" is fighting outside..I could go on and on.After completing the last mission, I felt there were still so many things to try out, and achivements to accomplish. But at the same time I felt like waiting for a sequel which will hopefully have the refinement this game lacked, while retaining all the truly great things it did have. 73%			"

While the last one trait someone could like, but for me its just frustrating. And whats more important its buggy. You cant save when you wish to. Game chooses when it automatically save, wheter its authors choosen as necessary.

												The price is RIGHT! got this game and the expansion for approx. $15 on sale and NO REGRETS. Think GTA series meets Dead Rising. Social dynamics are interesting and the action/tension of exploring and accomplishing what it takes to make your enclave survive is really great fun. Some aspects aren't exactly intuitive, but nothing in the interface sticks out enough to detract from the main thing: Trying to survive in, and hopefully lead, a group of survivors in a zombie apocalypse. Stealth and melee and shooting? yup. Barricading and scouting from secure locations? Yup. Currying favor, stemming infighting and trying to bring in increasing numbers of divergent people under one banner? oh yes. The game delivers the goods on an aspect of the zombie genre that most games wish they could have -- that of building and guiding an enclave. RECOMMENDED.			"

 State of decay's core strengths lay within it's actual game play, it's clear early on in the game that undead labs wanted to ensure the game had a solid framework rather than just focusing on the cosmetic appeal of the genre. At its core state of decay is a survival game. I'll talk more about the games story later in the video but needless to say, you start the game and find yourself in the middle of a most unpleasant of zombie apocalypses.Stealth is key to survival in state of decay, and the game provides a variety of mechanics for you to utilize to make sure you don't find yourself surrounded by the undead hordes. Your bog standard zombie in SOD isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, their eyesight is very poor, out of sight really is out of mind in the game. The enemies do have an acute sense of hearing however, the game visually feedbacks how much noise your making, whether your searching through cupboards or breaking down locked doors, best to be as quiet as possible or you will literally have the unwashed masses at your front door in no time. Throughout the game it is often easier to kill the standard zombie by stealth kills or building yourself so very fine traps. Though noise is your worst enemy it can be your greatest ally, creating distractions with a variety of tools, can be a great way of getting out of a particularly sticky situation.One of the great things about state of decay is that its not just you versus the world. There are a lot of survivors out there and you'll eventually get to become part of a survivor community. Your community has its own base and number of people and these too things require attention. Lets start with bases, there are a number of locations in the game world that can be used as a base. You can only have one base at a time. Each base location varies in size and that’s important because as your community grows so too will the need for beds and space. Bases can be upgraded in a variety of ways, from self sustaining food gardens to guard towers, choosing what you need is crucial as space is limited. Upgrading your defences and keeping your base well stocked and guarded is important too, bases will get attacked frequently, they can be overrun and people can and will die.The survivors at your base also will need attention too. They need food, medical supplies and ammunition. Each survivor in your community has needs and desires, you wont please everyone, but its somewhat beneficial to at least try. Each survivor has an affection rating towards you, once you become friends with a survivor, that character becomes a player character meaning you can switch between characters at any time, especially useful when one becomes too fatigued to be any good in the field. The survivors in your community can be used to go out on computer controlled scavenging runs as well as used as companions to take out with you. Survivors have their own stories and ongoing lives, occasionally they will ask you to do something for them, whether it be deal with a zombie or a more side quest esc personal mission. Doing these side quests for your survivors improves your relationship with them and this is the way you will eventually be able to control them yourself.Other survivor communities populate the landscape too, you can interact with these in a variety of ways from doing missions for them to trading. Trading in state of decay works off an influence system, every-time you do missions, kill zombies etc etc your earn influence points, these influence points can then be used to purchase ammo, weapons and supplies from the survivor communities. You also need influence points to upgrade your base structures as well as a variety of scavenged resources. Sometimes you may even have the option to add some survivor communities to your own, but beware things might get a bit cramped if you don’t have the space and NPC's can have fall outs with each other, the walking dead style.One thing I really like about the game is in its RPG elements, each player character has four base skills, Cardio, wits, fighting and shooting. On top of that each individual character has a set of personal skills and traits. Take the fighting skill, this skill covers melee fighting and overall hit points. By using melee weapons on a character a lot of the time this skill will start to increase and unlock more stat bonuses. By doing certain actions a lot with a certain character this may also unlock personal traits, that add traits to that individual too, for example if you have a character that you use to scavenge a lot, you may develop a personal trait that adds a reduction to the time it takes to scavenge.The game world itself is pretty extensive for a smaller title, you have around 8 square kilometres of playable area to go explore at your will. The world ranges from very American mid west countryside to more urbanised areas. The game also features dynamic progression, meaning even when your not playing, the world is still changing, after all just because your sleeping doesn't mean those zombies are. Its important to leave your bases well stocked before you leave the game or you may load up to an abandoned base with a lot of bodies.There's a good enemy variety in the game to boot, not all zombies are brain dead walkers. There are a number of special zombies which are more of a challenge to take down. In some cases when facing specials it can be better to run to live to fight another day, especially if your low an ammo, especially if your facing the hulk esc beasts known as juggernauts. An interesting mechanic for the enemies in the game is the horde mechanic, if several average zombies converge on one area, they will start to attract others and a horde will form. These hordes can be very dangerous and are not to be taken on directly, its best to ensure the zombies around your base are as scattered as possible, keep that population down.Graphically while a eye pleasing game in most respects, state of decay does suffer from FPS drops, terrain clipping but even with some cosmetic issues it never loses that immersive feel, and because the core gameplay is so good, you actually end up forgiving its short comings. The game does a great job in the sound department, cracking zombie heads with baseball bats sounds as grim as you would expect it too, its certainly not lacking in aesthetic.Now lets talk story. The game starts you off as Marcus and your friend Ed coming back from a fishing trip in the mountain lakes, once you get back you quickly realize that all those 1980's horror movies have come true and your set off on your journey to find out what exactly is going on and how to get the hell out of there. While I don't want to spoil the games story there are some interesting plot mechanics that I do want to mention, specifically that certain story events can be missed if you ignore them too long. Spend too long wandering the world looking for supplies and some events can be missed and things will change. Not only this but certain story events can change the world around making survival increasingly difficult for you and your new found family.Even more recently the new downloadable content Breakdown has been released. Breakdown is a true sandbox mode, stripping the game of its main story allowing you to embark on a seemingly never ending quest for survival.In all Undead labs have succeeded in creating of the most enjoyable zombie survival games of recent years. The mix of solid mechanics, engaging characters and open world survival is a breath of fresh air in a genre where we seem to get a boat ton of below par games thrown at us non stop. State of decay is a must for any zombie survival fan and while its by no means perfect, you will get value for money.			"

												This game is pretty bad. It doesn't run as well as it should for looking as murky as it does. It has choppy animations and bad voice acting. The game constantly pesters you with side missions and punishes you for trying to have any fun. I promise you this game will bring you more stress than enjoyment. I bought it for the sale price and I seriously wish I didn't.			"

												State of Decay creates a potent mix of strategy, resource managament, open-world exploration, and zombie apolcalypse action in a brilliant concoction that is unlike any other single player game you've ever played. While the game is very rough around the edges and contains an assortment of glitches, State of Decay's excellent core mechanics remain interesting and incredibly enjoyable throughout the time you'll spend trying to surive in Trumball Valley. This is one of those games that will consume you once you get into the routine of survival, improving your community, and exploring the huge open world in search of survivors that may sometimes prove to be even more evil than the hordes of undead. A truly one-of-a-kind experience, and I can't wait to see what Undead Labs does next, especially if they decide to make a sequel. Highly recommended.			"

												I've finished campaign after 22 hours (I was doing every side-quest).If you like show The Walking Dead and playing games then this game is just for you!Game guides you through the simple story which is not bad as it is from this genre to be expected.Characters are lovely and combat system isn't bad.After campaign you have Breakdown and Lifetime DLC.Both are great and if you have full pack you will spend A LOT time at this game.I can recommend this game for 80% :)Edit:After chievements hunting, I can say that the game has some very bad pages in the form of bugs. So enjoy the story, but on a perfect game, find something else.			"

												So i liked this game, it has zombies, some action and open world elements, but it had some bugs. Didn't really care about the bugs it was fun enough to play, but then i saw that they released the year one survival thing not long after i bought this game, i thought hmm lets see if it isnt just a free upgrade for this game. But they had to dissapoint me it was a copy of this game with improved graphics and double the bugs, worst of all this game is completely abandoned and its impossible to get a refund for it even if you're thinking of buying the YOSE. So do i recommend this game? NO. Do i recommend the YOSE? Maybe, if you're willing to look past the bugs and if the game is on -95% or something....			"

												So I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into with this game when I got it. I had watched a couple of people play the first 20 minutes or so when it first turned up. I am really, completely and utterly pleasantly surprised. I loved every minute of playing it.I'm a scaredy cat & I normally coward out of things after a short while. Not so with this. It's not really scary at all even for me (though the noises a couple of the special mobs make gives me the creeps).It's certainly not a difficult game, and while I don't normally use that as a reason for critique it really could stand to be more difficult - though I know some people have said otherwise & I think that comes down to play-style. I lost one survivor but only because I was dumb and in a rush and switched survivors when I thought she was somewhere safe and she mysteriously died in that same spot. That's all. In amidst the pot luck of who will survive when you log back in it was my own lethargy that got her. You become strangely attached to a couple of the members of the group despite them being mostly ambiguous people - you really do feel that it's your responsibility to look after them.The thing with this game is it is a persistent world. Think animal crossing - if you leave for too long things happen. I played it every day over the holidays logging off each time only once everyone was safe & sound and morale was full. I never returned to any nasty surprises other than a couple of enclaves getting over-run but - that's their own fault ;P If you can dedicate the hours in a short enough time frame it's not a deal-breaker but if you want to put it down and pick it up where you left off a couple of weeks later you might just find it burning around your feet. If you still have feet.Using an X-box controller at least it was so smooth and satisfying to fight and running over zombies and hearing them pop when you run over them is just, satisfying. They don't really explain much to you but, I didn't find this off-putting but I did have to google what Fame & Influence really did.For me it really could have stood to be a longer game - to have had the next area open up and be able to move up into a larger home base. But then I was lucky enough to have the time to maintain morale & resources. The OCD in me loves searching buildings & seeing the little X's appear on buildings once you've cleared them.And finally the story - it's nothing ground breaking or complex but just enough to make me feel a little sick. And for a game that's just a little sick, that's not too bad to me.			"

												The limit to how much you can have in your base supply is stupid, there's 4 pickup trucks sitting outside my base that I'm just using for storage since turning supply packs in just makes them vanish when the base is full. You can break them open to get goodies based on what kind of supply it is, but its a total waste for materials supplies. You can also call in someone to come collect them, but they might only get like +4, when taking the supply to turn it in yourself you get 15, so... The max vehicle storage area is only 6 (That I know of), and the smallest is 4, so I don't get how a pickup truck could have the same storage size of a police car, but have 2 more places than a muscle car. The most useful supply is materials, for base upgrades, and theres only a handful of them to find without having radio girl tell you were some is. Ammo, food, fuel and medicine are just sitting in the pickups outfront till I might need some. Mashing LMB at zombies seems to be the safest bet in most combat situations, most of your survivers wont have a high enough skill level for special moves. This makes the first guy you play as much more useful than anyone else since he gets a huge xp boost in the starting tutorial. If you go out with someone who sucks overall, taking a budy pal with you will make it infinately easier since they dont seem to have health. Letting them get swarmed and using the previously described fighting style solves all problems when getting swarmed. Driving is crazy finicky, holding w in some cars launches you at lightspeed and you can stop on a dime if you let go of it, but getting out at highspeeds makes the car fly down the road from you. Ammo takes a rediculous amount of backpack space, 30 rounds being the stack cap for each ammo type and reloading takes a decade for every gun. I cant stand the suppressor shot limit, some being 10, the most I've seen is 50 I think, the UI is strange like that.			"

												Rating: 8 out of 10(I'm still playing breakdown right now, so the whole views are about the original game.)I would recommend you this game if you like games like DayZ but get tired of getting killed without any reasons.I've played for like 20 more hours in 3 days and I love this game. However, to be honest, there are lots of things which could be improved about this game.Pros:1, The graphic is good. 2, The bgms are appropriate for the atmosphere.3, Gameplay is fluent and comfortable, though I would recommend you to play this game with a controller.4, There are main quests and side quests which keep you having objects to achieve (They're fun at the beginning). For instance, you may choose to help neighbor to earn their trust in order to make progress of making them join you or you may choose to search for resources to build more facilities at home or you could kill zombies in order to get your skill level up.(I love the sound effect of blowing up zombie heads and slow motion of finishing them)5, There are different types of special zombies, which are obstacles for new players at night or during defense quests from neighbors.Cons:1, This game is still not gonna be an amazing game which wouldn't make you feel repetitive about its goals and quests. Also, the main quests are too weak to even be considered as main quests. However, it's contradictory that you will find main quests are so short after you finish them because you would expect a lot more from main quests while the game doesn't offer many different quests after you play for a while. Then, what's the purpose of main quests anyway? just to tell you you need to move somewhere with some reasons? Or just try to create a fake sanse of progress with repetitive quests? After beating the game, I could also say the ending isn't like an ending. It's like a shutting down right from your face when you just wonder what's gonna happen next and bang, the game ends...2, Though there are special zombies, they're not hard after you play for a while and figure out how to battle with them. To be honest, it's fair and it fits the realistic surviving atmosphere. But, it's really boring to fight against them. I would like to say that since this game doesn't bring many conflicts between people and communities (Like pvp in DayZ but with bots), I would like to see more and harder special zombies in this game to make this game more challenging. Not only several types of special zombies but a lot more should be put in. Also, I think it's gonna be great if some special zombies are gonna appear after you continue finishing main quests. Using them to represent an increasing difficulty and challenge of this game would make people who like to shoot feel more interested in making progress in this game. And yes, we need a big ♥♥♥ boss zombie to attack our base to make it more like a community and a raid. Imagine the difference between you walk on the street alone with badass guns and you sneak on the street to hunt down some big ♥♥♥ zombies with your people. I really would like to see the latter.3, Side quests could be much better. I would like to see more details about side quests of different people. I believe there are lots to develop about humanities and societies. It's not only big things between different communities but small details about each person. Their feelings, their memories, and their beliefs could all be developed more. A family picture in a house, dead body of couples with hands holding each other, or even a lonely, weak and hungry dog standing near its suicide owner , scenes like these could be put in this game a lot to make gamers feel more desperate when they do their searching in different houses. And then you shall put some inspiring side quests by contrast to make gamers into the game. Zombies and weapons are all about gameplay. People, communities and their stories are creating the atmosphere of this game. When Skyrim is favored by lots of people but more buggy than this game, the importance of side quests should be taken into account.After all, it's a good game and a good try. Thie game still has its potential and I really hope this game could be amazing in this genre.			"

												I'm torn about whether or not to recommend this game. On one hand, it's fun, and has some pretty cool ideas. On the other hand, there are lots of bugs that cause some pretty big issues. It irritates me when devs make DLC for a game before fixing the base game first.Overall, I enjoyed the game. At least one game breaking bug happened while I was playing, that I was only able to solve by researching the problem online. Because there are still such major flaws, I cannot recommend State of Decay, in good faith, in its current condition.			"

												I really want to love this game, but I can't. I love the idea of an open world game where you don't just have to survive, but you also have to build a community and make choices that make a difference in the end. And the game does an OK job of that, but it throughs these tiny wrenches that mess everything up and ruin the game.Pros: +High stakes- it saves just about everytime you do anything, so if you ♥♥♥♥ up, then you ♥♥♥♥ed up.+It gives personality to some of the characters, making them more enjoyable to play as+ You can play as any survivor you save ( I don't know, I think this is a really cool game mechanic)Cons: + like i said before, when you mess up there's no going back, and that creates tenssio, which is awesome.... until you die as your favorite character. Some of the characters have dialog that is so much better than others and when they die, it's frustrating.+ The controls are often unresponsive, especially when you go from interacting with something to moving+The most fun I had in this game had to be when I was running over zombies with a car, zombies fling left and right is just so satisfying. But after you hit around 20 zombies ( which will take you around 30 seconds to do) your car engine starts to smoke and if you kit more zombies, the engine catches on fire and the car explodes+The graphics arn't that good and when you turn your camera in any direction, this wierd bluring affect happens and it just makes the game annoying to look atI get that some that they're trying to make this game intense, where when your survivors die, the die for good and you have to live with that, and some people might love that ( I this is you, then you might want to get this game). But it's just frustrating to me. If I die as a character, chances are that it's my favorite character since i like to play as that character. It's annoying how I might get so far through a playthrough and then some bs happens and I die. Like I said I love the idea of a game like this, but it does so many tiny annoying things where I'v just gotten tired of plying it. I would much rather have a fun game where I can ♥♥♥♥ around, than a game where 1 ♥♥♥♥ up means inevitable death.TL;DR: If you like games like h1z1 or the farcry series, then I would just wait till a sale.

												This is a game with a few faults, bugs and glitches yet it's still one of the best zombie games. Survival is the main priority, find a home and upgrade it, build a storage or kitchen, medical center or workshop. Find other survivers to join you. Playing as different characters was fun, looking for supplies in buildings is a nice touch of realism. Melee combat is pretty good but i found the aiming with guns annoying and troublesome. The story was meh and could of been better but overall i'd say it's an awesome game, It focuses on survival and not just killing as many zombies you can which was a nice change.			"

												With so many Zombie Apocalypse Titles out there, the whole scene is getting boring rather fast, but I must honestly say that State of Decay is a great game. It's the same as most other zombie apocalypse game do everything you can to survive scavenge, fortify your base and so on and so forth but they did it a bit different.You start off with 2 friends Marcus and Ed at a campsite in the mountains where you meet up with a couple of other survivors who ask you to look around a bit to see if you can find any other survivors, the first person you meet is Maya, a soldier who was out by the lake with two of her friend, sadly her friends were overrun and killed by the zombies. Your little group of 3 then make your way back to the ranger station only to find everyone there has also been killed. You get hold of a two way radio and from there the actual fun begins when you head toward your first home base.Once at your new home base you need to make friends, you only have access to certain gear if you do your part and put in the leg work. Now you are going to do a lot of running in this game, a lot of button mashing fighting and you are going to get very upset at yourself for making stupid mistakes that get you killed, because if you die then you’re dead. That’s it that character that dies is gone forever, never to be seen again. SO DON'T DIE... Remember you are not super human.The game is not very hard but at the same time it's not very easy either at first you run up to every zombie you can find to beat up to see all the different cool moves your character has to take down zombies but as you progress you learn one very important thing, being overrun is dangerous, too many zombies in a small space could be fatal and so you find yourself avoiding contact later in the game.So what makes the game great? Well here's a list of why I think it's a great game.1. The story progresses if and when you want it to, though there are plenty missions available you don't have to do them all.2. If you scavenge supplies and you find more than you can carry you can call in for help. Leave the premises and a friend or two will go get the remainder of the supplies.3. Relocating your home base, as your circle grows you need more space, and different home bases give different ""Rewards""4. The Zombies are balanced out, it’s not like most other games where there are little or no zombies, or they are massively over populated and you have almost no chance of survival.5. The vehicle damage is very realistic, you hit a fence or a couple of zombies a few times and you are going to start getting radiator problems.But there are also a few bad things in the game.1. You find yourself doing the same thing over and over again a lot in the game. 2. The game has no manual save option, which makes it more realistic ( I actually like this ) but it's bad for when you make a stupid mistake and end up dead then you sit there afterwards and think why the hell did I do that.3. This is probably what bugs me the most, the whole time you are playing the game it feels like you are sitting behind a console, and I am a very big console Hater and I am not afraid to say it. The game feels like a cheap console port to PC and it's close to unplayable with a keyboard and mouse, if you want to enjoy the game you will need a controller.4. The gun mechanics doesn't work too well, due to the fact that the game is third person you often find yourself shooting at strange angles which in reality would be impossible to hit the target but in the game it works.This is by far one of my longest reviews ever, but a lot of words to describe a good game.My Rating - 8/10 - The Console port to PC is a big disappointment and makes the game difficult to play on a keyboard and mouse. Seriously a great game. Buy it..._+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_Breakdown DLC ReviewI played through State of Decay and really enjoyed the game but I did however find the game very short and was a little disappointed when I finished it was almost as if the game just got good and then it was finished. But a little while after I finished I saw that Breakdown was available and I must say If you love State of Decay as much as I do then this DLC is just for you. This DLC basically takes the game as we know and remove the whole story mode and turns it into a full on sandbox mode, your only goal is to survive and eventually when you want fix an old RV randomly located on the map and hop out of town with 5 of your best mates. Once you do that you start from scratch again, less loot, more zombies and stronger zombies. The map gets randomized but the idea stays the same SURVIVE! A lot of people complain saying this DLC wasn't added content but just removed content but I say good work, now the game can be enjoyed for much longer. I will definitely recommend this DLC. It also adds a few new achievements for achievement hunters as State of Decay is one of the very easy games to complete all the achievements but these however aren't as easy as the base game.Get it - Enjoy it - Rate itMy Rating 9/10Only bad thing in breakdown is that there are too many side missions going on at the same time, almost impossible to do them all and keep everyone happy and progress in the game. I find myself almost helping a stranger in trouble every 5 to 10 minutes.			"

												This is exactly how I imagine a Open World Zombie Survival Simulation game would be, In fact I'm surprised how good the game actually is, anyway here are my thoughts;Pros- Large Open World, I've only just explore the first two areas, there’s still so much more areas I need to discover. - Different Types of Zombie Enemies- Nice and Fluid Combat System, and Running Over Zombies with your car or door attack always feels great :D- Like an actual Simulator, there are limited amount of cars & fuel resources and they can blow up/get damaged, your weapons can break, and your character can get injured and tired, and It can be difficult to fight back large zombie hoards if you are alone when all of the above happens to you :P- You Can Establish Outposts around the Town, Create medical bays, gardens to grow your own food, radio tower for communication, shooting lookouts to improve your community overall shooting skills and defensive range of your Outpost.Your community can also expand larger by finding more suvivors.- You will need to go out for supply runs every so often to make sure you have enough Food, Medicine, Building materials, Ammo etc.- Controller Enabled! :D (I think the game feels better playing with a controller - Might just be my personal preference)- Countless of Hours PlaytimeCons - I noticed there were a few negative reviews saying this game can get repetitive, due to the quests which are given like random shortages/goods or trades with your fellow neighbours, with that being said players can get bored and stop playing. - When it gets dark you should be given the option to sleep.- Single Player Only.Suggestions/FeedbackI think if this game is already very good for what it is. Very fun and Enjoyable. Personally, i'd give it a 8/10 but if it wanted a 10/10. What i'd suggest is.. - Since there are already a few main characters you meet at the start of the game you could tell an in-depth story for each character like in GTA 5 you can switch characters and play through different characters story and learn more about them, also some good cut scenes would be quite great, perhaps with some conflict between two or more characters or even other groups.- New Expansion in the near future with a map extention, new weapons, cars, homes that go up to like 50-100 people to manage, go out in groups of 5-10 to do super dangerous missions, everything in big scale too :P Last but not least If this game was Online, Multiplayer, Co-op would be super awesome, simply cause playing with friends makes games even more enjoyable.Anyway those are my Pros, Cons and Suggestions. I Love this game and I recommend giving state of decay a shot if you enjoy games in this genre, Thanks for reading.- Chrono			"

												Too much hype for the intro video... Played this game for about 18 hours, which is not a lot of gameplay time for an open world that generates the same 4-6 types of side missions over and over again... I'm honestly 50-50 on this game, but what really caused me to choose to not recommend this game was the major cliff hanger at the end and being shocked at how short this game is and how much time I pretty much wasted on doing side missions not knowing which missions were progressive ones, so I spent probably 10 hours out of the 18 for doing almost pointless stuff.This game was fun, I enjoyed the side missions for the first 3 times they generated, and gathering supplies to progress in this game, but this game could have had more realism and more stuff to do. I don't suggest expecting lots out of this game and instead I suggest trying out DayZ (standalone&mod version). It's more realistic and you basically create your own adventure and story line if you are into making it seem like that. I'd give this game a 5/10. "

												Welcome to Trumbull Valley. Enjoy the skull smashing and decapitation, and don't worry about those red smudges on your clothes, it's perfectly normal in here!State of Decay, an arcade-ish zombie ""sandbox"" game by Undead Labs. ""Sandbox"" because you have the possibility to do what you want (in game limitations of course), without any time limits.There is a story, but it's not what you should buy this game for. It's the fun from killing zombies, and building a community to survive.""Building a community""? Yes. You have it in here. You start out small, with some people barely tying up an end with the other end, and you are supposed to help them survive. Or you can just ignore them completely and go kill some zombies. Up to you.The combat is pretty enjoyable. The game doesn't have any tutorials on to how to kill that walking corpse, but you will figure it out fairly quickly. Or just check the wiki. There are few types of zombies, from the normal shambling ones, through sprinting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and ending with a juggernaut that requires some effort to take out.Gameplay itself is also done well. You can get into nearly every building you see, you can look around for supplies to help your group survive, you can swap between characters. And there's character progression.Many people recommend playing on a pad, but I actually have no difficulties to play on a keyboard & mouse.Graphics are nice, even for a X360 game, made on CryEngine 3. AI is good enough (as for a zombie).If you are looking for a game where you kill zombies, run around and do stuff, and where it ""tries"" to simulate an apocalypse, then this is it.I got this for full price, and I am not disappointed. There's a living modding community going, so the game has at least some years of life more. Although, if you do not care about a story mode, and you prefer just a survival sandbox, you should also get Breakdown DLC.			"

												I love the whole concept of this game, it is truly a zombie apacolypse survival that is enjoyable. I feel the storyline could of definately been continued, the character development was nice and once again could of been developed further. I feel the bases were a bit lacking, I could think of a dozen ways to improve them but modding wouldnt resolve those issues. Over all it is a good quality game and I do hope for another one that expands even further than where this one went.			"

												State of Decay is a survival games that put you in a world full of zombies or zeds as the people in this game called them.The first thing i have to say about this game is this game isn't perfect, it got alot of bugs that sometimes can get you really angry at it. The most annoying bug that i encountered so far is when a zombie noclipping through the wall and when sometimes when you press up, your character when the opposite way, that is really frustrating when you try to help your follower from getting killed by a zombie. But, i still give it a thumbs up. Why ?? Because this game gave me some really unique experience that i can't get from any other games. It gave me absolute freedom in a world full of zombies, and many of the game mechanic really give me the impression that you are not a superhero, you are just a group of people that trying to survive this harsh world full with zombie, and you spend your day trying to find supplies in some of the abandoned building for your group so they can survive for another day. One of the game mechanic that i really like is the permadeath, When the character you controlled or other character in your community died, they died for good. No respawn, just death.Soo far, this game is really great. Buggy, but great. Do you ever wander what is like to surviving in the world full of zombie and still have fun ? Then, this is a truly awesome game for you ! It prove that what makes games good is not the graphic or how polished is the game, but how fun is the gameplay. Recommended !			"

												To begin, this game has shocked me. I watched probably the first 1 min of the game and decided not to try it out. Later on , it was on sale and I tried it out.It is addicting. Seriously.I wanted a zombie game where you can move around and scavenge. Surviving with other people is excellent, too.I will state the problems I had until now:1. No online. Multiplayer, co-op, whatever. It would be better if I DIDNT HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME. Also, there aren't a lot of places to go after you explored everything. 2. Game can be frustrating when you have to babysit everyone. Like seriously, every day one person is sad, or angry and I have to take them for a walk like a child. Seriously. Take it out. Or make it rare. I'm getting sick and tired of that.3. More DLCs and maps would be great. Seriously, this game needs to be continued. It is incredibly immersive and it should have more content added.4. Let us manually save. I don't want to continue with dead survivors. 5. Two reasons why the survivors died:A) Ever paused a game and alt-tabbed to quickly chat with someone or look something up? Well, doing that about 65% of the time, the game CONTINUES BY ITSELF. I died 2-3 time because of that. It is so stupid. B) Saving a downed survivor.....is hard. I managed to save one....but she blew up....literarily....Why? No idea.Other than that, I love the game. Cars and special zombies are excellent. Anyone who is a fan of zombie games and open world gameplay will absolutely love this game. I wish the developers will release more content which I will buy instantly. I am currently playing this till i feel like not playing it until DLCs come out. Which is usually over 50 hours. :)I recommend this game to anyone who is considering to get it. Hope they update it more in the future.Thank you. :)Btw, Just read the topic in the forum addressing the multiplayer. I can see why there will not be a multiplayer. There will never be which is sad since this game had potential.			"

												If you like hitting the undead with an array of melee weapons, Shooting round after round into advancing hoards.Or simply scavenging for supplies and rescuing survivors. Then you should absolutely check out State Of Decay.I enjoyed this game a lot. Searching for supplies never gets old and I think that is because the loot varies, from basic food supplies (coffee, snacks, ect) to medicine or ammo, melee weapons of all sorts and guns. Who doesn't love finding a stash of ammo for that one favourite gun of yours? Searching for supplies feels natural in this game. And it really adds to the survival element.State Of Decay is slow paced compared to a lot of other zombie games and a lot of the time you'll have to take your time to really assess your group of survivors and the base as even when you're not playing, the game itself is still active. I left off with good morale within the group and came back the next day to find one of the survivors had fallen sick and another had died. So the game really keeps you on your toes and is constantly changing.In the game you'll be able to complete a lot of missions, you'll pretty much always have something to do however if you ignore missions for long enough or simply get occupied doing other things within the game certain missions will solve themselves, not always in a good way either. Fail to help a fellow survivor kill a certain zombie, or find a lost survivor and they might die doing the mission on their own. So the game really encourages you to constantly be active. However this doesn't happen for every mission so if you prefer just exploring and doing supply runs, then do your thing. The game is far from perfect and there is honestly a few things that could have been polished further, the driving mechanics feel clunky and occasionally the AI will do a few silly things. However playing the game I found myself looking past those things and instead simply enjoying the world and gameplay and of course fretting over my survivors. Stop getting sick ya'll!!! Would recommend!  "

												This is just for Lifeline DLC, since Steam won't let me add it right there.Do not buy Lifeline. It's utterly broken. Not only that, but some of the game mechanisms have been adjusted to be downright ridiculous. Original State of Decay was filled with bugs, but I've managed to get to it when most of that was apparently fixed. Unfortunately, as it seems, developers learned nothing and same thing happened here.- Game hands down cheats. Zombie respawn is ridiculous - you clean a room, then you turn your back and few seconds later they're back. I think they've wanted to make this DLC more difficult, but there are better ways to do it without making the player feel cheated.- Also, when you make your game harder, make sure you'll also adjust survavability of the friendly AI. They were equally dumb in original, but there weren't many situations where AI gets surrounded by 10 zombies. AI doesn't know the term running away, they're mindless drones. I've lost several NPCs just because all they understand is to attack and when they get overrun, there is nothing you can do.- In fact, NPCs have problems doing even the simpliest things, like running through doors or getting in cars.- Car physics, if you can even call it that, makes them very easy to flip over, because we're apparently on moon. Two times I've been launched in the air with my car without doing anything else than getting close to some object (pathway, building).- Due to map design, lots of it happens in quite close quarters and corridors, which makes it excellent for your character to get stuck in group of zombies without any chance to get out. You can just watch your character glitch through them as you desperately mash buttons to no awail.- Reloading weapons sometimes doesn't work and works only when you zoom in.- When I say this ♥♥♥♥ is utterly broken, I mean it. When siege happens, if you're in middle of saving someone, you magically can't talk to them, which forces you to leave them and come for them again, if they manage to survive. I don't know how long have they tested this DLC, but there are huge issues that anyone has to run into after few minutes of playing...- Last but not least, you would think that soldiers will be a little more competent with firearms than civilians, but no, your teamates can't shoot for their life, and they're more than happy to let their fellow soldiers to die and continue shooting like it's 4th July.The home defence system just doesn't outweight so many problems this DLC has, and it's not so fun as it might seem at first, because sieges usually happen when you least need it. Overall, this piece of rotten meat has brough me a lot of frustration.. Avoid it like a plague it is, play original game. I have lost a lot of hope that Undead Labs will release something playable in future, if this is supposed to be their standard now.			"

												State of Decay is an amazing survival hardcore open world game, that could have been even better, yet unfortunatly it isn't, and let me explain. Your objective in the game is to survive. You need to gather supplies, make sure your home is safe and that there is always enough food, ammo and madicine. You start the game as a regular character who finds a house with his friends, and make your way to the top until you are pretty much in charge of the house. Once you have enough influence you can make big decitions, such as moving to a diffrent place and such.While this is good, the game has one big problem. The characters in the game are very boring and dont really tell a story. You can't really communicate with them, but only with basic commends like ""Hi, come and follow me"" and such. The game does a good job at keeping you busy and giving you new missions all the time.In overall, State of Decay is a very good game, that could have been even better, which I see as a very big miss. I give the game 8.5/10, and with deeper characters and a better storyline, I think it'd deserve a 10/10. Big miss, but still a good game.			"

												I loved this game... I shelved it after a full play through. I came back after some time to find it unsupported and a discussion thread from the developer asking us to buy the game again as a newly remastered one year edition. How about a free upgrade since I already gave you money? I could understand if the game was no longer supported because it was a decade old, but it was only 1 FRICKING YEAR OLD and now unsupported.The current state of the game is BROKEN and will not run properly with NVidia drivers. You literally have to disable your Nvidia card in your device manager and run the Intel card. There is not a patch or support.Just an FYI, Undead Labs has done a great job deflecting this whole debacle by blaming Microsoft Studios saying it was a contact obligation so the new Year One Survial Edition could be playable on XBox 1. However, a little research will show that aside from the DLC and YOSE, all of their games are unsupported and no longer sold, some less than a year old. PURE CASH GRAB!AVOID UNDEAD LABS. They are scam artists. They will never see another dollar of mine and I strongly suggest you keep your money as well.			"

												Quite possibly one of the biggest D!CK MOVES a developer could pull...has been pulled!  You pay for early access version and now they make you pay AGAIN for a remastered copy of the pretty much same exact game and stop development on this title yet still can buy DLC for a broken game!  WTF is up with that!One of the biggest D!CK MOVES a developer could pull on their supporting players.  This developer/publisher just went full re.tard on us people!Considering ""Microsoft Studios"" is the publisher it doesn't surprise me that such a SHADY move was thought up like this.  I for one will not invest another penny into this developer.  It's an alright game too but such a ♥♥♥♥ing d!ck move by developer has made me give such a bad review.So basically they stopped development on this and still is buggy...I feel whoever purchased this game got RIPPED OFF.Do I recommend this game...HELL NO and do I recommend any future titles from UNDEAD LABS...HELL NO "

												9/10 !!!Probabbly the most enjoyable zombie open world game around ( at least for me ;p ) . yes its repetitive mission sometimes can make you bored to death also its too damn hard for casual or weekend warrior game but ..... the feeling and thrill of exploring and looting in this game is perfect for open world zombie killing rpg lover. Anyone who paid $60 for Dead Island or Left 4 Dead should feel pretty well ripped off by now. This game is $20 (sometimes 5$ on sale ) , .if you have $20 to spend on a zombie survival game, do yourself a favor and spend it here. but still the biggest dissapointment is the fact it has no CO-OP or multiplayer mode :( if  only they add it...... then its a dream come true....

												I would reccomend to play this game, but I wouldn't buy the original if they are willing to charge for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t year-one copy. The game is somewhat fun but it gets boring after a few hours and has many bugs. The devs seem to never fix anything, instead of a free patch, the developers decide to resell the game as a new version. BAD MARKETING, This company will not do well in the future if this how they treat game owners.I think its unfair to charge someone who already owns the entire game and all its dlc's for the year one edition for better performance. Microsoft can go screw themselves with this cashcow methodology. I would rather play Dying Light then re-buy a game for better performance. I should get a free patch or something since I have already payed for the original game with all the DLC's.Update for 2017.I stand by my original review for this game.I will add that the game had great potential, and I did enjoy the game with hopes of getting free updates.For those considering to buy State of Decay 2, I would hold off for a year to see if they decidide to come out with another YOSE. Just avoid giving these developers any of your money until they can actually provide a finished product that reflects what they promise to the public.I love Zombie games and like to play them all at least once It just saddens me that this game never had multiplayer to begin with. To hear thats what they are doing for the second only makes me assume that they are using the same exact game engine, with just updated graphics and multiplayer added (like they said they would try for in the first installment).You need to purchase with extreme caution, or not purchase at all in my opinion.

												Update: Was able to finally finish the game, took a lot of restarts and manually going to areas that seemed to potentially trigger the conitnuation of the story. Never got any of the remaining side missions though, like for the Wilkersens...but honestly idc anymore. Still a thumbs down. Hope they actually make an effort with SoD 2.Sadly, I have to give this a thumbs down, because it's a buggy mess. The gameplay in itself is nice, the story is ok-ish, nothing crazy...the game is more about building up your home base and interacting with your neighbours. So it's a 3rd person zombie survival simulator with perma death for your poor people if they actually die. You go around scavenging stuff, helping people, upgrading or relocating your base, setting up outposts, exploring the world, killing zombies, etc.In between that stuff you have quite a few story missions (rather short usually) that advance the overall plot. The only ♥♥♥♥ing problem is: There is no telling whether any mission it seems will actually spawn or not. And it seems everyone has these issues, yet the devs never fixed that bs...maybe in the Year One edition, but that's not even any ♥♥♥♥ing excuse to not fix THIS version of the game. So, sometimes restarting the game works, sometimes not (at the moment). I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to finish it. Some missions won't spawn at all, while the final missions have after a restart, up until now. Extremely annoying and that's why it gets a thumbs down.   Apart from that the ""off-line continuing world"" is pretty annoying. It's a SP game, so when I'm not playing it, please don't advance the game...thanks. Just annoying to start up the game and have several rescue missions queued up, because your people are just too stupid to survive on their own.DLCs are rather boring. One has you playing an endless game on the same map as the original game without any story missions, the other puts you in the shoes of a soldier, but also almost exclusively spawns random search and rescue missions. You're kinda supposed to just hold out and survive Zombie sieges. Not that interesting. After every siege there is a new story development, but nothing ground breaking. My GOD this game gets SO ♥♥♥♥ing boring. The same missions over and over and over again, pitting you against tougher and tougher opposition. Can't be arsed to finish the DCL...			"

												My initial impressians? This is shaping up to become the most satisfying zombie survival experience. . .EVER.This is where you will find gameplay elements that not only define the undead appocalypse, but are absent from any competing zombie titles. Excellent sandbox gameplay allow fellow survivors to die permanently and resting is achieved through closing the game and coming back to it, genius. The base building is also a great addition to this genre, and it is great to see it so successfully implemented here. Characters are well rounded and unique, they feel like they could respresent an actual human being, lending all the more to the sense of loss when one succumbs to death. This is a monumental title in the genre of zombie games.			"

												Was] not impressed with this game. I thought it was going to a little more free but I was bothered with the fact that every minute somebody needed help in some other town. Combat was not bad at all, I just felt over burdened with people needing help and supplies half way across the map, then by the time I get there they're dead or the mission is gone. Exploring and foraging for food was really cool and added a survival aspect, but gathering for the survivors was a bit of a annoyance to me. Left me doing too much for the Stronghold and not enough for myself. Felt like I couldn't enjoy the game and was forced to gather way too much. Some may enjoy this game but I didn't enjoy it alot.

												My favorite game in the zombie genre - 9/10It's got a lot going for it, I like the action combat and how ammo is scarce so you have to get good with the melee combat, but once you master it the melee is devestating and there are so many different weapons.  Plus there is RPG like advancement of your main character and the other 'party' members you recruit along the way as each has a variety of skills and each skill advances as it's used unlocking further skills and special attacks/abilities.  It also has a very nice open world which rewards exploration as pretty much any location you find out of the way will have some nice loot to scavenge (better weapons, backpacks, etc.).  You also build yourself a base/community and have to manage various resources and personalities.  Helping out strangers opens up trade options and if you help them enough they'll be friendly and ask to join your community, but it's still up to you whether you want to add them and support them through play or no.  There are also more things to do than you can possibly get done timewise so you have to choose who to help and what to put priority on; but I've found gives me that sense of just one more thing and then I'll quit... awww just one more...     If you like the game then the Breakdown DLC adds a new game type where instead of following the story of the main campaign you have a minor story just the framework of survival for the world but gives RPG like goals in accomplishing certain things like using certain weapon types, or other accomplishments which unlock hero characters you can recruit where they don't start with minimal skills but instead have special items and upgraded skills.The one complaint I have is that it's very hard to maintain a clear zombie free area.  Seems like more often than not you only get a few steps away from a building you've cleared and zombies are right back into since the zombies seem to mostly spawn right around where your current character is, and I wish I could just lock some of my party/community members in our home so they'd stop going off on their own and getting in trouble within minutes of my rescuing them from one thing they are back out looking for trouble again.  Also for some missions which have a limited time to respond it would be nice to know what those timeframes are or see some color scheme like green, yellow, red so that you'd better know which ones need to be prioritized without having to keep track of when they showed up relative to the other available missions.

												   State of Decay you say?   First thing's first. Let's get the bad out of the way.   The biggest issues I had with this game were frame rate drops in certain areas at high speeds, some texture pop-in here and there, a few times zombies getting stuck on fences, doors and such.   And now, the story.   The Story is nothing to get worked up about. 2 guys get back from a fishing trip to find themselves in a completely different world and it just sort of goes on from there. Nothing too spectacular or surprising really. I sort of figured where things were going before they actually happened. Let me be clear. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just nothing to write a bestseller or make a blockbuster movie about.   The graphics were not created to compete with Crysis or Metro. They did their job. It's not Borderlands 2, The Walking Dead or, as stated above Metro.    The gameplay is where the game shines. You get tossed in a bunch of small towns in Turnbull County. Minutes after you get past the whole this is what's happening and how you're supposed to play it part you make your way to the first safehouse. After that, it's all on you. To make it past that you have to break into houses all over the county to get what you need. Guns, materials to improve your house, meds, gas, guns, food, weapons, guns, ammo, other items and of course MORE guns to add to your storage and keep yourself alive and well.   Speaking of storage, State of Decay uses an interesting mechanic. You don't use money. I mean it is the end of the world basically. Instead, by completing story or side missions that pop up here and there once in a while you get to increase your fame. Fame is what limits the amount of influence you can get. Influence is won by looting items from said houses and dropping them in the storage unit and also by completing the said missions. The same influence is used to take items out of your households' or other survivors' storage. I know it sounds strange but I found out it works quite well.   The most important aspect of the gameplay is probably permadeath. In State of Decay you're not the hero. You start off with 2 characters of which one you control and quite soon you get to meet a 3rd which then makes the game reveal an important part of the game. Every person in the game has stamina and health, traits, skills based on traits and then unlockable skills once you get to a certain level. Your health goes down and die, you're done. Instead, if you have a good enough relationship with a character you get to select for that person to take charge and you get to play with the said person instead, in case you get hurt or get tired. You can't swap your charater if the relationship is too low, the game doesn't allow that in case of story-important characters or if that person is too tired or too injured. As such, even if you get over your loved (or skilled) charater dying, you need to keep your household happy, recruit other survivors to join your household by helping them stay alive long enough for your relantionship with that group to be high enough for them to want to join.   All in all, if I were to give this game a mark based on what it tried to achieve and what it actually achieved I would say a solid 8.5 / 10.			"

												There is some residual beta-like wonkiness this game never truly escapes, but I have to say, it is the closest anyone has ever gotten to the perfect zombie game. It's open world, you can pick among a variety of safehouses and fortify/upgrade them, and go rescue/recruit other survivors. The map is nice, the combat is fun, and the expansion pack adds a TON of replay value. Assuming it's on sale, as it so often is, and you can get both the base game and the DLC for $20 or less, it's a great deal, and you probably won't end up furious about the minor glitches you encounter along the way. It's also gotten fantastic support from its devs, with frequent updates and fixes, so it gets a little better every few weeks. I also give them points for having a lot of strong, fun, female characters, which far too many games ignore, considering it's now 2014, not the mid-1800s.			"

												Probably the most thrilling, suspensful, and eerie open world survivor game out! I've dreamed for a long time, about a game where you have to race against the clock and rely on your survival gaming skills, to hone the ability to progress in a game. Imagine how it would be for you in a zombie apocalypse. How you'd cope and contribute to the  community to ensure survival... how your actions influence whether the group lives another day, The feature of switching between different playable characters and how their varied personalities can affect the progress in the learning of skills, or emotional stability to see if they'll disrupt or benefit the morale of the group.

												State of Decay is a fun game, you get to experience how a community ""survives"" the zombie apocalypse.  You aren't just one person, once you've befriended others who you help or save, you can play as them and improve their abilities to further enhance your chances of survival.  Once your community is big enough you can strike out and take over larger bases (there's three base sizes, small medium and large) or keep it small and stay somewhere outside of the towns.It's not without its flaws, some zombies manage to clip through walls & doors either visually or physically, also executing them on stairs has issues and the vehicles are very floaty, it's amazing how high a truck can spin and flip.The end of the world is a dangerous place, mutant zombies and roaming hordes can seriously make a supply run turn into a really bad day.  Running is the best option or a car if you can to get out of there when tables turn badly.There have been two DLCs so far, Breakdown & Lifeline.  Breakdown is without story and you play till you're ready and have fixed up an RV to escape the valley.  This causes the game map to randomise & reset and also makes the game harder, you can also unlock heroes who can help turn the tide.Lifeline is a side story told around the same time as the base game, you follow a group of soldiers who have to hold onto their base camp while evacuating high value targets, usually those who have information/expertise with the ""virus"" and some civilians if you can.All in all for a console port of an xbox live arcade game, it's pretty good and fun, the melee combat can be quite fluid and ranged head shots are an instant kill for most zombies.  The game also has a permadeath system where if you die you're gone and have to move on without that person.  I'd give it a solid 8/10, you can play it many ways and the dlcs add a lot of different options.			"

State of Decay: State of Decay is a very decent zombie survival game, you'll manage a base, take care of survivors, find supplies, fight zombies both regular and special and most importantly, survive and that's about it. The game never breaks out of the routine of surviving; you'll experience all the game has to offer within the first few hours of the game. The overall style of the game feels very ""realistic"" if you're smart about surviving you'll do just fine, maybe losing the occasional survivor to extreme circumstances. The game isn't some impressive graphical powerhouse but, honestly they are well above average and decent; lighting during the day and night cycles are great and the special zombies easily stand out from the regular ones and overall the details here and there are great, especially for a $20.00 title. Music is the game is subdued but really great; it’s fun to have a successful outing and have some music set the mood. Voice acting is... ok, it’s not laughably horrible but, not some of the greatest and you'll also end up hearing the same actor for multiple characters fairly quickly. The game is an open-world sandbox, once you're past the initial tutorial area you're free to roam about as you wish for the most part, with main story missions pushing you to new areas with a wealth of land to explore and plenty of side activities and main story missions. Beating the main story took me roughly about 15 or more hours not counting the side missions I did. You’re mileage will vary with State of Decay, but there is plenty of content here for a $20.00 purchase. TL/DR; State of Decay is a fun survival game and nails down that aspects really well, but it will soon get repetitive and if you don’t love the game within the first few hours, chances are you won’t change your mind after 15 but, for $20.00 it’s a pretty darn good video game. -Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												I absolutely love this game as you can see from my hours played. I have the original and Breakdown. Breakdown really added a lot of replayability. There is a continuous amount of questing that can be done with consequences of ignoring them. There are several very nice mods available on their forums as well. If the game is too easy for you then you can make it more difficult, if it is too hard you can make it easier. I personally didn't like how you could just mow down everything with vehicles so I got a mod that makes vehicles more fagile. You are able to switch characters and get them higher in their skills of fighting, running, searching, etc. If you want to play the more sneaking around and avoiding zombies then you can very easily do that. It just really allows you to play the game the way you want to play it without locking you into one way of doing this. Highly recommend this game.			"

												Couple of key things then a few thoughts.Its a cosole port to the PC, but its really good.It actually is pretty memory intensive, so if you may have a crash if your on an AMD card, exiting and returning often clears this up, also if you run in Big Picture mode it runs smoother.A really good Zombie game, with a need to balance resources and people. Bad thing is zombies spawn way to quick, you can clear a street and walk in a house and a zombie is looking in the window back at you. The real kicker is the missions come fast. You have to figure out what is important to you. They time out after a while to, and whatever happens happens, and you have to deal with it.  You can take a little while to decide, but again, they do expire.Overall a good fun to play Zombie setting, with some good replay ability, you will always start at the same place, but you can choose differnt things after the starting round and find differnt people and things to get into.EDIT: Also recommend Breakdown, the DLC. It adds long time playability to the game. Gives you the chance to unlock and play heroes and changing difficulties. As far as Lifeline, its OK. A good time to play once, but it didnt hold my interest beyond that.			"

												It is hard for me to recommend or not recommend a game because I get the vast majority of my games on sale, and thus I weigh the recommendation on the price. Would I recommend State of Decay for full-price? No, but I would for a more reasonable one. Initially I had a great time with this game, but after a few hours hours its repetative nature is painfully obvious. You have everything down, the side-quests go in a circle, while you wait for the main-quest to advance. The looping AI voices become an annoyance. Unlike what the description said, you cannot decide what way the story goes. I still managed to sink quite a bit more hours into this because I enjoyed driving around and being in the world but the game kept trying to pull me back into the framework, and I tried a second time to see if I could change anything, but it was the same deal. If you have more money to spend than me and can't wait - buy it. Otherwise, I recommend waiting for another sale.			"

												This is a good zombie survival game.  You have to manage a community of survivors, scavenge for food, guns, ammo, fuel or materials to upgrade your main base or explore the map to find new places to establish. There are also storyline missions and secondary missions, like helping other survivors or one of your homies. But I can't recommend this version of the game.  The developers are making a new remastered version called ""State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition"" that contains new missions, weapons and characters, graphics enhancements and includes both DLC.  So if you are looking for this game, just wait and check the new version, which is cheaper than buying this old version + the DLC.			"

												I saw high reviews for this game for how deep the situations you find yourself in can get and got suckered in.  The ideas are good but the execution is abysmal.  Potentially heavy moments are ruined by clunky programming that suck you right out of the moment.  When one of the survivors who have been with you from the beginning start to get sick and you have to take them to an isolated area to euthanize them, the stage is set for a gaming moment you'll remember for years.However, when you shoot that person, loot their corpse, and radio back home that you're bringing loot (really, that's the part you want to announce to your group?) and the reponse is, ""Get anything good?""  the moment is so ruined it's hard to forgive the game, particularly when this is how every moment in the game goes.  Nothing has any weight.  Do a Google search for a Would You Rather game because it's essentially the same thing.Tell someone in your current group that you looted her father's corpse, led her to believe her father might still be alive, and used the group's resources in the meantime.  Uh oh, she found out?  Time for a big conversation....or she'll just say she thought something might be wrong with her father, thank you calmly, and walk away.It's baffling to me that the creators of the game went through the trouble of setting up some interesting moments in the game and decided on zero follow through.  The combat is very much a stiff and awkward button-basher and the RPG elements play a minor role.   Every mission and every action feels weightless.  I'm leaving the game unfinished because there's just no substance here and I am truly disappointed in that.			"

												In the genre of Zombies/Zombie survival, there are a lot of duds. Games that don't really live up to the genre's hype. Infestation: Survivor Stories, Dead Island, several others. This indie title does what no game has really done, made a great game out of the genre. Made an amazing game out of the genre, in my opinion.In this game, you start out as some random guy in the beginnings of a zombie apocolypse. You find a group of people, then it turns into more of a survival management game. You have to deal with problems in your group, such as anger issues and fear, you have to befriend and keep the morale of your fellow comrades up. And, of course fight zombies. Now while the combat in this game isn't amazing, its actually really fun. Its simplistic, it doesn't try to over complicate things. You wanna smash a zombies head in, right? Of course you do, and you can do that easily. With a gun or with a blunt weapon. I enjoy the combat, but it is still in my opinion the weak point of the game. Managing your community, building new training facilities, sleeping areas and medical stations, and recruiting other survivors are a large part of the fun in this game. Its so satisfying to run through a zombie hoard and save a group of people, then have them befriend you so you can switch to them.I really enjoy that you can't just use the same character forever. They will get injured, sick, and tired. Eventually you'll need to switch to other characters. That's why it is important to do things like anger management missions and afraid missions, to befriend people in your group so you may switch to them.The visuals are fairly impressive, but nothing amazing. It runs perfectly fine on my GTX 660 with everything turned up. it definitely looks better than the xbox version, but it will not visually wow you in any way. Although the zombie design is quite impressive. My one bugbear with this game is the ammount of stuff it throws at you at once, then puts it on a time limit. I can understand why you need to do things quickly, but when i still need to gather food and medicine for my group, and then I recieve 5 other messages about missions I need to complete quickly, it can get frustraiting. Really frustrating, especially when it makes me lose influence with my tribe. I think they should either cut back on the ammount of missions you get at once, or eliminate the timer. The former sounds better in my opinion. Reguardless, this game is amazing. And even when it isn't discounted, its only 20 bucks. So incredibly cheep for a game this fun. This game has raised the bar in the Zombie genre.			"

												See my full review with screenshots at http://misstoxia.com/review-state-of-decay/State of Decay brings a new style of gameplay to the zombie game scene, incorporating third person action, RPG and community/resource management into a nice open-world zombie survival game.In the game, you control a single character at a time and can switch to others when you become friends with them. Each character has their own inventory and stats and traits that may help your community. For example, some survivors might of been a vet or doctor before the outbreak and can use the communities medical supplies more efficiently.Your community is a collection of survivors who have banded together and found a defendable home to live in, you can upgrade your home base using resources you scavenge in the world and find new survivors to recruit into your community as well as help other established communities and organize resource trades with them.The game is entirely single player but the developers have tried to give the game a more dynamic feel by making events happen in your game while you’re not playing it. I’m not too sure how I feel about this, it does make things more interesting but I don’t like having that lack of control in a single player game.Lily, your communities’ radio girl, will advise you about current events and distress signals that are happening in the world. These may include; nearby hordes that need to be wiped out, a survivor in trouble, a community member that needs help with a task, a sighting of an infestation that needs to be dealt with or even a friend at home base that needs help with their depression or anger issues.While not completing tasks and story missions you will usually find yourself exploring and looking for resources to take back home. Food tends to disappear the quickest, especially when you have a large home population, so building a garden at home or finding a reliable source of food and building an outpost there is a must.Characters can also specialize in certain fields such as blunt weapons, edged weapons or rifles, etc. Some characters will naturally be better at certain weapons or abilities depending on their traits… the main character I used was an alcoholic and she could not increase her ‘Wits’ stats at all because of that.Cars are also a big part of the game, after a while of gameplay you will notice that you eventually run out of cars if you don’t start returning them to your home base after you use them. Vehicles can be an amazing zombie killing tool but can get damaged easily after running down a few hordes, so it’s always good to build a proper workshop at home and have a mechanic to repair the good cars you find.When your community gets too large you will tend to have more problems with survivors not getting along with each other and various mental problems some survivors are having, offenders can be evicted if you don’t feel like having to deal with them and sick or dying people can even be mercy killed before they turn. Finding a bigger and better home is always something that should be on the smart survivalist’s mind when exploring.The currency of the game is influence and can be spent at community homes to buy items out of their supply locker as well as support while outside of home such as artillery strikes and car delivery. A community with well built facilities will tend to produce more items in their supply locker each day.When your character dies, you will have to play another character back at home whom you have made friends with – if you have no other player characters you respawn as a new recruit to the community with a few starting items.My biggest issue with the game would have to be the graphics. It’s not the overall quality that annoys me, but in certain locations with certain lightning I find it very hard to see which was really off-putting for me. I also had quite a few bugs that made my game’s story behave very weird, luckily I was still able to finish it.The game also has a DLC called ‘Breakdown’ which adds a never-ending gamemode that allows the player a bit more freedom than in the original game, however it should be played after you have finished the main story.I enjoyed the originality of State of Decay, I felt like I really got attached to the characters I found in the game as well as my own which is rare for a sandbox-type game and I enjoyed being able to play with a community/home management system while also getting to play in an immersive third person action RPG. Unfortunately the graphics were bad enough to make me feel ill at times.			"

												It's actually differed from the ""other"" zombie games. That is , because there's a character progression. You character evolves, will level his fighting if you fight alot of zombies or other traits... Also, there's a community which is actually where the whole game is based.For example, when you're searching for supplies in a house , you can choose to radio home for them back at camp to come there and take the items you selected IF you don't have room for more into your inventory. Also, When you find survivors and save them , they join your camp and grow stronger as a defense to the zombie apocalypse. In the beggining of the game , you're given a piece of wood and your kicking as your sole defense. Although it's enough for you to not die. You can choose to go out with 1 other person to help you.The noise mechanics are adequate. I would not expect anything less-more since it's good. Using cars is not safe because if you rev high, the zombies ( Zeds as they are called in SoD ) will hear it and come after you.Cars have a storage. You can store up to 5 or 6 items into it's trunk which is really useful.Also, you can hit zeds with your door.There can be different types of zeds except your normal-like zombies. Bleeehhh . ( zombie growl? )There are 2 dlc's for this game. HAve NOT bought them yet. The only major error i find is the color of the game. What i mean , is that the saturation is wrong. I dont know if its me , but... it either looks bright and strange or dark and shadow-y . It can be overlooked . "

												Certainly a game wprth buying, especially if you see it for a reduced price. ""State of Decay"" is one of the rare gems out there which seems to be made by intelligent, thinking gaming enthusiasts for gamers. It's not one of those highly polished productions you play but quickly forget afterwards, but one of the games which will keep you smiling because you just found another great detail you've been longing to see because it simply made sense to put it into such a game.Sate of Decay doesn't bore you with dumb ""game mechanics"", applied because some marketing director wanted it so. No, it delivers you an open world designed with sticking to common sense. Furthermore, the designers weren't shy to incorporate features known from gaming classics like Jagged Alliance i.e.: Every survivor you find will have some unique character traits, which will make her or him someone worth liking - or loathing. You'll quickly single out your favorite protagonists, screaming in dismay when you are ambushed by a juggernaut zombie while you are trying to run the heavy backpack home. Another detail which reminded me of Jagged Alliance is the myriad of different weapons and ammunitions you'll find. From a trusty .375 revolver to a AKMS submachine gun - you'll enjoy outfitting your favorite guy with the best gun available.The story focuses on the way people are trying to deal with the situation - including a powermongering, aims-justify-the-needs judge going slowly rogue. With people somewhere between despertion and hope the story makes the whole setting way more believable than you'd expect. It allows you to blend in, to feel the immersion a good game has to create to make it on my list of games...worth playing! The few cons I experienced are mainly of cosmetic value:The controls are a bit difficult to get into and the lack of a real manual is leaving you to guesswork. Especially moving your home confused me: Yes, you need to do a few story missions before you are allowed to move it. Good to know, better if the game would have explained it further on.At some point of the game you are spammed by a multitude of very, very similar missions: Rescue a survivor, kill a special zombie, clean out an infestation, etc. It can be annoying, but only because you are feverish about accomplishing the next ""home improvement"" and thus having no time to rescue the next jaywalking zombie apocalypse survivor.A few minor bugs are still in the game: Zombie getting stuck in porches, zombies banging their head against thin air, instead of the wall behind them, survivors running against an obstacle instead of going around. Luckily all these are not frequent and  / or easily solvable by giving  a gentle push.			"

Pro:Solid zombie survival with ""Realistic"" needs bars.Cons:Flipped over cars despawn if you move 50-60 yards away from itAfter interacting with a container and exiting a menu you have to repress a movement button, so if you see a zombie out of the corner of your eye, you'll most likely be grabbed. The girl on the radio will remind you to do the timed objectives every time you aren't in combat, even if you are doing something like bringing very needed supplies to the settlement. 4/10			"

												State Of Decay is a superb, but sometimes buggy, game. You have to rescue survivors and provide them with food, gas, ammo and other stuff while finding new resources and completing (side)quests like killing hordes and special zombie enemies, and helping (fellow) survivors out, all in a big open world that allows you to go anywhere you'd like.The graphics are pretty, but it's all a bit dark so I think most of you will have to crank up the contrast in order to be able to see anything. A minor complaint that also conveniently hides some of the uglier graphics. The sounds get the job done, it's all bit minimal if you ask me, and the voice acting has plenty of variety and is all told in a convincing manner.Unfortunately I wasn't able to progress through the story because of a game breaking bug that stopped me from getting new story missions later on. I'm still waiting for a patch for this, because I desperately want to complete this game.And even with this bug still in the game I would still highly recommend it.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												State of Decay is an odd little game.Stnading alone in the wilderness, walking through the wheat fields towards your objective, moving towards a goal.And then you smack a horde of zombies with a shovel for five minutes because shovel noises are funny.This game has a lot going for it, a large diverse map, varied objectives, and fun ways to get around, from hiding on buildings and sniping, to ramming a sports car through a horde while playing La Cucaracha.But, it throws a few too many things at you, asking you to consistantly help your allies, who you keep in base, because every time they go out, their dumb ♥♥♥ gets stuck in a closet by a group of zombies because they walk around with tin cans strapped to their ankles. And the repeitive nature of the combat, with is mostly runny over and smashy the zimbie zambies, doesn't have much flow to it. You come, you smack, you get retard A, you walk away.In all honesty, this game could be great, but its dragged down by a combat engine thats just not that fun after 2 hours, and a grouping of AI who lick windows on a professional level.If you like to manage dumb ants, I recommend, if you prefer to enjoy your time running over zombies in peace without HEY FRANK GO GET THAT LADY OUT OF THE PHONE BOOTH every 10 minutes, you should look elsewhere.

												Apparently there's a $30 DLC for the game where all it does is increase the internal resolution of the game to 1080p?  You know, Dark Souls 2 did this and I guess these devs thought they could, too, except without putting any additional effort into remixing content, giving any discounts to owners of the original, or really any technical changes whatsoever.At least that's how it started.  By this point there have been some significant updates and patches to the new YOSE version.  Users that supported the original title and its continued development by purchasing DLC were apparently shafted, when the devs not only DIDN'T use that money for anything to fix the game, but they dumped it all into some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Free-to-Play puzzle game that has, by now, been completely shut down and failed as well as a graphical overhaul for an older game without any justification for purchase to those that have already completed the original.So now what?  What's next for Undead Labs, with their last two releases performing so miserably?  Their dev blog has been completely unrelated to game development for the past 9 months.  Probably nothing worth caring about, much like this game, which you can no longer buy and the DLC costs as much as the new game when it's on sale and doesn't support the game at all.  Who, in their right mind, could recommend a title you can even purchase?But let's extend this review to the company itself.  It has a track record of one really successful title that isn't sold anymore, an incredibly unsuccessful re-release of that same game, and a dead game.  What this only leads players to expect is either a game that isn't fun that they can't even play after some number of months or an actually good game that gets completely re-sold like a new product some time later with actual dev support behind it only the second time around.  Undead Labs is unreliable, skeevy, and unethical at best.  Watch from afar but don't touch.			"

I would add more to this  review if i wasnt so lazy, but on a last note this game might not be worth $15 and you should wait till its discounted.			"

												Can't manual save is such a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially for people who have the same obession with me, which is to keep Marcus and others alive. Other than that, the game did  awesome job creating a fantastic atmosphere of the post-apocalypse-walking-dead world. The combat is kinda challenging, but this is not L4D2 or other zombie-slashing game, the survival of the community is the main goal. The game mechanics could be more sophisticated, and also more maps/quests, but considering this is a indie game, I am still pretty content.			"

												This is a very well done zombie survival game for those too skidish to venture into the social experiment known as DAYZ. It plays offline, has some dark humor sprinkled about and will keep your attention for a bit. Can't beat the price and the developers are active in patches once a week.			"

												This game is good but I dislike the model they used to pay for it. It really feels like they broke the end of the game and the missions off the game and are selling it as ""DLC."" The end is extremly abrupt, and the DLC came out a couple weeks after the game did. Seems like a cheesy way to get an extra 7 bucks. That said, its a good zombie game. I like the home base mechanic, it makes it feel like you have somewhat of a safe zone without ever being truly safe. I agree with some of the other posters that the cars make things far to easy. It would be nice if the cars or other loud noises put the zombies into a sort of 'frezy' mode, where they did more damage or something. Despite the warning not to use cars, I usually drove everywhere in one, because it was not only the fastest way but also the eaisiest way. The story is decent but nothing really new, but then you wouldn't be looking at a zombie game if you really wanted 'new"" now would you?			"

												This game is tons of fun but a bit hard to figure out at first.  The first month of play was filled with new discoveries of how characters could level up and how clearing out zombies in some areas and building outposts would really help your runners claim ground.  This game is a good mix of action/simulation and will be enjoyable to any fan of the zombie genre.Pros- Lots of replayability- Huge Areas to Explore- Challenging Gameplay, especially with Expansion- Lots of different weapons, items, and resources for creative and interesting ways to survive the zombie hordes- Lots of different ways to build your survivors- Fairly Cheap- Customizable home base location and build, minor strategy elementsCons- No multiplayer =/  (Seriously, if this game was multiplay it would be amazing)- Story is meh- UI is non-intuitive and not well explained by the tutorial- Can sometimes be annoying to get other survivors to join you, early game is especially annoying- Game has a steep learning curve, especially in the beginning- Not enough map control/strategy elementsOverall, the game is a lot of fun and I'd recommend getting it if you're bored and looking for a fun zombie simulation experience with some RPG, Strategy, and action elements thrown in.

You can save and recruit survivors, built/change safe houses, and scavenge supplies that deplete daily as your community builds. THEY CAN DIE I need to add this because one of my main characters since the beginning died and I almost ragequit. Which speaks to the amount of work and caring you feel while playing this game. So much potential out there. I can't wait for more maps and more content. Go out there and see how long you last.  9/10			"

												It's a gem. Still a bit rough, covered in (some) dirt and might need some extra cutting and polishing but it is a gem nevertheless. It's not awesomely perfect on the technical side (could have used a little more effort on the controls/interface for the PC version, for instance) but Undead Labs delivered the almost-nearly-perfect Zombie Apocalypse experience you can have within a game world today. This is the zombie game I always wanted to play and to enjoy for countless hours. They tried to add everything the ""zombie genre"" has, cramming it all inside a gaming experience and they succeeded in that. In this game you have everything you want your zombie survival game to have: a persistent and open world (that keeps on going even when your computer is turned off!), facilities to build and manage, resources to gather, trust to gain, pep talks, scavenging, gossip, pills, vehicles to drive (and to break down to pieces), people to care for (or to abandon to their fate if you don't trust/like them or if you are that kind of survivor), a lot of zombie head-bashing, a wide array of melee and ranged weapons, skills to improve (including useless and funny ones!), tons (and I mean TONS) of inside jokes, easter eggs and homages to the genre (The Kirkman Residence? McDermott's Tavern?), and a (virtually) never ending experience if you play with the Breakdown DLC (in that case, you skip the main storyline but you go on as long as you have at least one character alive). Co-op is missing. Co-op would have been great but, even as a solo game, State of Decay is a lot of fun, which is reason enough to play it, but you also start to enjoy it a bit more and more as you discover all the little details that are revealed only with an extensive playthrough. You need food, sleep, meds, gas, ammo (and not just generic ammo, but the right ammo type for your gun) and you need to find a good place to call home. A defendable one. To be on the (relative) safe side you will also need at least a doctor or someone trained in medicine, tool experts, carpenters and someone who can cook a good meal once in a while! A workshop where to build homemade sound suppressors for your guns or molotov cocktails is a must! Keep an eye on the morale of your community too. Don't let them fall to their fears and always resolve their anger issues (shouting matches lower community's happyness!). You start with one character only (well, two, in the main storyline) but you can swap to other survivors as you bring them to your community and only if you earn their trust. Bear in mind: dead is dead. If your character dies, it's gone, no matter how much time you invested in him/her. No matter if he/she was the ""hero"". And they can die in a lot of ways, even when you are not controlling them. They can go missing on a supply run (but you are given a chance to go look for them), get sick or be eaten alive while you ask them to watch your back. And when you run out of characters... well... new game, I guess! If you love zombies and everything about zombie survival and that it's the end of the world feeling, this is the game for you.			"

												Fans of the Zombie Apocalypse genre should not pass this one up.  It is a good game despite its flaws.To me, this game feels like what Dead Island should have been.  Things like having actual resource needs for your group and the ability to build and upgrade structures in your home base really help the game stand out from your generic zombie slaying fair.  Also the fact that events can happen while you are not playing, while it can be annoying, makes for a fairly unique game.I also really like the fact that you can be overwhelmed by zombies if you are by yourself and you aren't careful.  You can't just run out in the street and start mowing down zombies with an unsurpressed assault rifle.  For one, you'll quickly deplete your ammo supply.  And the other reason is because all the noise will draw out all the zombies in the surrounding area and you'll likely be overrun.  It really helps to add some tension when you are a long ways from home on a supply run and you're low on health and don't have a ride nearby.Unfortunately, the game is not perfect, and there are a few particular areas I feel the game is lacking.  The first of which to me is the camera.  The views for when you are executing zombies can sometimes make it impossible to see whats happening.  Also, the fact that you are encouraged to use foliage to hide from zombies, but the bushes/trees don't dim and go transparent when close to the screen makes for more times when you can't see anything.Another feature I think this game could sorely use is some sort of weapon modding feature.  Coming off of playing Payday 2 with its amazing amount of weapon mods available, this game has none other than applying one of a few types of suppressor to guns.  It would be awesome if you found a weapon expert survivor and you could then mod your stocks, optics, foregrips and such but, alas, its not possible.And finally, perhaps the biggest ommission that could have really made this game a gem is its lack of a multiplayer mode.  While you can ask other survivors to accompany you and help out, you can't get them to pick up supplies or give them any orders when they are with you.  They also have a tendancy to follow you right up your butt and then block doorways behind you.  The AI just isn't a good substitute for a few good buddies.Still, despite lacking in some areas, this game is a fun single-player experience.  To me, it did a decent job of capturing the spirit of zombie apocalypse survival.  I'm hoping the game has a sequel with a bit more polish to put it into GOTY territory.			"

												I don't know how to describe the AMAZING quality of this game. This is ALL i have EVER wanted in a zombie game. It kinda reminds me of fallout. Anyway, the reasons i love it is:1. Free roam.2. Huge map.3. Has missions which you can do but are not obligatory.4. I love the fact that alongside the missions, you also need to find and recruit survivors, go scavenging to survive and also just generally look after your community and main base.5. I love the fact that you can set up outposts as well as a main base,6. The NPC survivors that you play alongside with are not stupid. they will go out on missions and scavenge on their own without you doing ANYTHING. Some will fall sick and die. And a lot usually get injured or merely tired. I also like that you can switch survivors to give the other ones a rest. All the survivors also have different abilities.7. It has cars. So it's basically just GTA with zombies in it.8. It's not JUST zombies you are fighting. The army also comes in, sets up outposts, and kills anything that gets in their way, wether it is a survivor or a zombie, they kill it.9. I love the building feature. You can select empty spots in your home base and build different facilities ike guard towers, medical facilities, fighting arenas and even farms. Of course to do this you need to find building resources so again, you need to scavenge a lot.10. The NPCs are really stong. If you're are going out on a missions, you can ask a couple of people to come and help you out. A group of 4 survivors could easily take around 200-300 zombies.11. And there is SO many more features taht are awesome that it would take ages to write them down.Anyway, if you have 20$ and like zombie games, this is the absolute BEST place to spend those 20$ and I guarrantee you will not regret it.

												This is not a bad game. It is a pretty fun game. But nor is it a good game. It starts out in a camping resort of some sort. The starting area is of course very easy and helps you out to get the hand on the controls and mechanics. It is much more of a survival zombie game than for example Left 4 Dead or all those other FPS zombie games. It is not as hardcore as DayZ although. But I still liked it and I just finished it after restarting. From my understanding it is a smaller studio backed by Microsoft behind it and I say they made a good job. I did not notice many bugs or glitches. Graphics are decent and controls not bad -IF- you have a controller. It is also nice that you can avoid zombies and try sneaking (Which I didn't do much). As said the focus is more on survival and gathering resources and survivors for your home base instead of wildly shooting cause that will have you dead if you are ill prepared. And a dead character stays dead. The characters you gather all have diffrent traits and ""personalities"". Which is interesting at  first but later on proves to be shallow. Non the less the more you gather the more room you need, the more food you need and so on.  Sadly the game do become a bit of a rince and repeat after a while when every mission is ""Oh no we seen a special zombie out here"" ""Create noise to make the zombies do this while I plunder"" or ""Oh no scavengers in need of help"". Also we got the ""Sadness, anger, fear"" traits where you just tell your friends that you and him/her are going to smack some zombies the old fashion way. This is one of the more annoying missions since they just about killing zombies and put you at risk just to appease some of the idiots in your crew. There is also missions to save or help other survivor groups. These could be so much more if they deepended the social mechanics and maybe added in more of an RPG mindset to the game. The map is pretty damn big too and I did not scavenge much outside of any of the  three settlements. The country side is not that appealing since it is mostly wastes of land you drive through to g et to your next objective. But this adds to the atmosphere since it is supposed to be a small county with a large farming community. This is a clusterf*** of a review but I still think the strong parts is the survival part, the less focus on action. The tiny bit of social interaction and dialogue (even if the voice actors where like 3-4? Least it beats the 2  guys making the voices for Skyrim! Hue hue) The atmosphere can be great at times and some vistas are nice.BUT. The game is bit to much of a repeat, there could been more interaction with your group and the others. The Wilkerson have some interesting missions but not much more than them being a bit of the Merle of State of Decay and then nothing happens. The game also would be much much much better with co-op or multiplayer where each player runs their own group. The special zombies are also kinda a pain the ♥♥♥. This must be some kind of thing from L4D. To end it, yes I do recommend it if you want a open world zombie survivor game and zombie movie lovers will see many references. Also! ♥♥♥♥ you Ed for being such a cry baby. God damnit.			"

												This game preface, idea, and game play is all cool. What can be uncool though is when you lose a character and you've invested so much time in them, you begin wondering how to turn off the auto save. Just a heads up before I start I couldn't believe when I was playing that this game isn't multiplayer - and that the idea of working with other people (or friends) would be awesome. I repeat : THIS GAME IS NOT MULTIPLAYER. Does that mean don't play it? Depends...The story goes you are a man who stumbled into town and upon exploring you find a church full of survivors. A bit later into the story, you hear the military has also set up an outpost in the town but on the other side. You go see them, and you find out that they really couldn't care less, and that they recommend you leave immediately. The gameplay itself is pretty good - consisting of a 3rd person view and being capable to control more than 1 character... but you can only control one at a time. You can tell other characters to follow you and assist you or you can tell them to come search a location that you've cleared. There are times though where you are faced against this giant zombie boss and all you have is two bullets and a broken machete hoping to take this guy out (so FYI if you hate a bit of grinding in games you may dislike this). The repairing can become a nuisance, but building repair shops or first aid centers (of a few things that you can do) add a bit of depth to the game and really make it feel like it's yours. Another cool feature is when you clear out zombies you are able to set up another ""home-base"". Cars, weapons, items and so forth are found while you free-roam the map. Look-out points can be discovered and climbed which makes identifying what's in the surrounding environment a little easier.I like this game, I would like it even more if it had multiplayer. I enjoy playing it but some would put it as a time killer. Either way though if your looking for an open world zombie game this may be for you. RATING : 7.25/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C Overall  B-EDIT : Just beat the game... once it's beat it's sort of bland. Yes there's DLC but if your like me and do not like DLC this game is a good 14-15 hour run. There's also those who like to run around in an open world and just shoot zombies. If you like that then go nuts. I found the game to be worth the purchase on sale, sort of found it short.			"

												TL;DR: Crashes, bad performance & glitchy controls - but good gameplay and nice feeling, worth discounted price!WALL OF TEXT:NOTE: Review of the base game only, didn't play the DLCs, which are basically separate games, you pick which game to play when you start it, which is also something I like, good proper DLC.But first, what I liked: gameplay! It's a nice game, it got me addicted and I finished it in a few days.It probably was too easy because I was overstocked on food and medicine most of the time, but that's probably because I didn't have many breaks in between plays (the game simulates time passing when you're not playing).And at certain locations it gets suddenly very difficult for some reason... that is, if you're packing light, but I suggest you get alot of ammo on you and two melee weapons just in case one decides to go all broken on you.Story-wise was ... ok I guess, it's a generic zombie outbreak.A.I. is good enough, sometimes they take some time to decide if they should get in the friggin' car.Cars are arcade and have nice effects on them, I like how the zombies cling on to your car =) ... but physics aren't really on their side, I had one incident where a guy was standing really close to a car, when I got in that car, the car got thrown into space, that was nice.Additionally, worst example of car physics on that bridge... when you have to cross it back, you'll know which one I mean, I strongly suggest you don't try to jump it with a car when going back and just grab an NPC backup and go down the river, with ALOT of ammo.Animations are kinda funny, not really realistic, kinda arcade, they're acceptable.Sound and music are ok, didn't pay much attention which means they didn't bother me.Now, performance, it runs really poorly, I had to add some tweaks to make it more playable but even then I have slowmotion issues and some stuttering, low FPS and all that... but that's not the biggest concern.The biggest issue with this game is the control:- Delay when you're able to move after exiting a menu/car/etc, never experienced this in any other game, it's very annoying;- Sometimes it makes you go backwards when you press W after exiting a car;- Really bad mouse control, can barely aim for some reason in this game, where as in other TPS games I have no problem;- One character of mine died because she wouldn't aim the friggin gun so I could shoot the swarm of zombies that was following me... I don't know what happened, didn't happened before or after that, she was stuck on attacking melee for some reason, even though I was only holding mouse 2 and clicking mouse 1... gotta be the ignore-controls-whenever-I-feel-like-it-glitch that I encounter in some other games as well, which is directly linked to performance :/Then there's the crashes, sometimes just crashes mid-mission when I scavaged alot of houses and have a trunk full of stuff (and the fact that I'm in a mission doesn't allow the game to save), so, gotta do all that stuff again.And it also always crashes when I quit the game for some reason, and it's the hidden message behind black screen kind of crash which makes you stand and watch a black screen with the game cursor moving around without knowing the game is actually frozen like that because there's a message behind it.... yey for focus priority.EDIT:Oh, and fire bombs are friggin' useless, use grenades or distractions instead.

Micro management, Permanent character deaths (important because you can switch to these people) permanent vehicle loss. You have to maintain everything. Little missions constantly pop up to distract you from the main incentive (pursuing these can save playable characters lives)Setting up a camp- deciding what buildings to develop (med, ammo, sniper nests etc)Talking to people that are depressed/have issues helps more than you realiseIf you send someone on a mission to collect resources they will physically go across the map and attempt to collect and return. You must kit them out well if you dont want them to die. If they die, any resources they collected will drop at the place of death.Few details like this make this game special.LOADS of weapons/ammo types/items. Shooting is perfect, the lighting is beautiful. Its a reminder of why we play games and where the medium is going.There's still a few bugs with the zeds. sometimes it can go through the walls and able to dmg the characters throught itThe start of this game does not do it justice. Keep on playing ^^ 9/10			"

												TL;DR: Crashes, bad performance & glitchy controls - but good gameplay and nice feeling, worth discounted price!WALL OF TEXT:NOTE: Review of the base game only, didn't play the DLCs, which are basically separate games, you pick which game to play when you start it, which is also something I like, good proper DLC.But first, what I liked: gameplay! It's a nice game, it got me addicted and I finished it in a few days.It probably was too easy because I was overstocked on food and medicine most of the time, but that's probably because I didn't have many breaks in between plays (the game simulates time passing when you're not playing).And at certain locations it gets suddenly very difficult for some reason... that is, if you're packing light, but I suggest you get alot of ammo on you and two melee weapons just in case one decides to go all broken on you.Story-wise was ... ok I guess, it's a generic zombie outbreak.A.I. is good enough, sometimes they take some time to decide if they should get in the friggin' car.Cars are arcade and have nice effects on them, I like how the zombies cling on to your car =) ... but physics aren't really on their side, I had one incident where a guy was standing really close to a car, when I got in that car, the car got thrown into space, that was nice.Additionally, worst example of car physics on that bridge... when you have to cross it back, you'll know which one I mean, I strongly suggest you don't try to jump it with a car when going back and just grab an NPC backup and go down the river, with ALOT of ammo.Animations are kinda funny, not really realistic, kinda arcade, they're acceptable.Sound and music are ok, didn't pay much attention which means they didn't bother me.Now, performance, it runs really poorly, I had to add some tweaks to make it more playable but even then I have slowmotion issues and some stuttering, low FPS and all that... but that's not the biggest concern.The biggest issue with this game is the control:- Delay when you're able to move after exiting a menu/car/etc, never experienced this in any other game, it's very annoying;- Sometimes it makes you go backwards when you press W after exiting a car;- Really bad mouse control, can barely aim for some reason in this game, where as in other TPS games I have no problem;- One character of mine died because she wouldn't aim the friggin gun so I could shoot the swarm of zombies that was following me... I don't know what happened, didn't happened before or after that, she was stuck on attacking melee for some reason, even though I was only holding mouse 2 and clicking mouse 1... gotta be the ignore-controls-whenever-I-feel-like-it-glitch that I encounter in some other games as well, which is directly linked to performance :/Then there's the crashes, sometimes just crashes mid-mission when I scavaged alot of houses and have a trunk full of stuff (and the fact that I'm in a mission doesn't allow the game to save), so, gotta do all that stuff again.And it also always crashes when I quit the game for some reason, and it's the hidden message behind black screen kind of crash which makes you stand and watch a black screen with the game cursor moving around without knowing the game is actually frozen like that because there's a message behind it.... yey for focus priority.EDIT:Oh, and fire bombs are friggin' useless, use grenades or distractions instead.

												I was a little put off that this game is 3rd person and the screen shots but I quickly found it to be an absolute joy.  Between scouting for resources, building your home (base) and helping / recruiting other survivors it is a zombie genre fans dream.   My only issue with it is that the main story is short but it can be replayed numerous times as it changes each game.  Breakdown isn't worth the price tag, although it is a good add-on to just have a pure sandbox mode.			"

												Above average to good game. Reasonable mechanics, but gets repetitive. Textures are pretty pathetic by PC standards; probably because the developers were too busy licking the boots of Micro$oft and kept things the same as (lame ♥♥♥) X-Box.Sad lack of competitors in the genre makes it slightly more acceptable than it should be.DLCs are a rip-off. Breakdown is what SHOULD have been in the original gam. Lifeline is simply crap and boring.			"

												State of Decay makes a lot of fun, it reminds me of The Walking Dead series with a touch of Dayz. but dont expect a creepy horror game and I think that it should not be. Fans of The Walking Dead series will like it.Supplies like ammunition, food or medicine are very rare, good gameplay and what I also like is that every character can die at any time. so be careful. i Only miss a Koop Multiplayer.8/10			"

												This is possibly the best zombie game I have ever played!I know I know... Walking Dead from Telltale studios has great story, Killing Floor is fun zombie smashing, survival, co-op game, Left 4 Dead gives you the opportunity to challange your strategies against other players in versus games. Dead Island is fun co-op storyline game with skill tree and weapons crafting. etc... But this one ... It's such a shame it is not a co-op game. It's everything you ever wanted in a game that puts you inside of zombie apocalypse (maybe not everything, didn't find out yet if you also fight other survivors, but I wouldn't miss that anyway). Things you gonna do in this game:Gather supplies, fortify (upgrade) your safehouse, help other survivors, kill special zombies, train your survivors community, make the areas safe (by killing zombies), drive cars (kill zombie hordes with cars), play more than one character (get eaten by zombies)...Despite the lil bit oldish graphics and the absence of co-op mode I recommend State Of Decay for every zombie games fan out there. ps. the absence of co-op is the main thing that upsets me about this game, 2 or 4 players co-op would put this game on the TOP of zombie games charts.  score: 8/10edit: if you have any questions about this game, feel free to ask in the comments below			"

												state of decay is an amazing game and a fresh addition to the zombie genre. this game is comparable to GTA but with zombies in it. the gameplay is very fun and the game can be unforgiving at times since your main characters can die and end up losing all their stats. the story is good however most of the time i just found myself roaming and trying to get supplies for my crew. another unique thing about this game is that it still keeps going afte yous top playing it. so you can stop anytime you want and come back and see youre population has increased or see you're almost running out of supplies.The DLC for this game is pretty good as well however not for everyone. while the main state of decay can be enough if youre looking for a more challenging experience Breakdown DLC is a must have since it takes place in the same map however each playtrhough makes the zombies tougher and the game becomes harder with scarce resources and more frequent zombie encounters.LIfeline DLC is another storyline and it takes place in a different location offering new characters, weapons, and map. again i would recommend this one since its very fun as well as Trumbull Valley was.overall i would definitely recommend this game. 8.5/10			"

												State of Decay is a open world survival game that will please fans of the genre with its own unique ideas and a focus on character permadeath.   --------Final Thoughts at the bottom--------GameplayThe gameplay is all about survival, it really makes you feel like you want to live. This is mainly due to the fact that if the character you are playing at the time is somehow killed, then they are dead for the rest of the game. Their is no way to bring them back to life, this makes you think twice about just trying to hack your way through hordes of zombies. Throughout the game their are moments, such as events or story missions that will pop up, about other survivors in trouble, completing these missions brings more survivors to your base. The higher your populations the more well defended you are and the more characters you have to switch out with to play. Each survivor has its owns traits and sets of skills. These skill levels can be raised by performing the activity related to the skill. For example your shooting goes up the more you use weapons, or stamina will increase the more you use the character to run around and loot with that character. However the more survivors you have at your base, the more supplies you will need to take care of them all. This means you need to go out and collect more loot.You collect resources such as medical, building and weapon supplies, by entering abondoned buildings and searching for cuboards, draws, boxes etc.. that are highlighted white. When a supply stash is found you put it into a dufflebag and take it back to base. This however limits how much you can take at a time, if you have a vehicle you can store duffle bags in the back but if you are without a vehicle you may also radio back to base and have another runner come out to get the rest. However doing this will put that runner at risk of attack by zombies and if they run into trouble you may need to go out to save them. You may also loot various other things in buildings such as weapons, medical supplies, and food. Different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses. The weight of some weapons will also effect how some characters can swing them depending on thier strength. The controls feel very well done and accurate, whether its swinging a weapon, shooting a gun or driving a vehicle, it all feels smooth. GraphicsThe graphics are nice, I wouldn't say they are amazing or anything, although their are some breathtaking areas within the game world. The zombies look well done and their are a decent amount of models that are used so it doesnt feel like your killing the same thing over and over, however their is only one model for each special infected. The animation is good and feels lively. Although sometimes I did feel like, for how fast my character was running I wasnt going very far distance wise. The swinging and shooting looks good and my framerate never dropped even while fighting multipul zombies and Im only on a medium spec PC.AudioThe sound in the game is good. When out in the woods you can hear the birds and crickets around you. When in town the lumbering steps of zombies can be heard all around you. The foot steps sound realistic for the type of platform your character is on at the time. Guns sound good and hitting zombies with melee weapons sounds satisfying.The voice over work is good, nothing fabulous or game changing, but its good. Their are multipul different characters taht are all voiced however some of them sound like they were voiced by the same person and didnt even try to sound different.StoryThier is not much to say story wise. There is a story that will eventually lead you out of the city and end the game. However the story plot is basic and it seems like it was just shoved in their to appease some people who want to complete it, but it is not neccesary. Final thoughtsOverall, State of Decay is a great game that is definetly worth the time for anyone whos a fan of survival or zombie games. It is a large world to explore and loot with many different survivors to save and add to your community. The game has some fresh ideas from other zombie survival games, and these ideas are portrayed very well. The visuals are nice and the animation is good. The permadeath may set some people off from this game, also if you are looking for a story, this may not be the game for you.In my opinion this is one of my favourite PC games and is fully worth the full price, however be aware that their is a remastered HD version coming out soon so you may want to hold onto your money for that one. (EDIT: After the release of the remastered version I would still recommend this version over the newer one. The new one just spruced the visuals up a bit but change very little in terms of gameplay. If you want to save some money, just get this version.)			"

I hope not...)... game 1 lost...Bought Microsoft ""Flight"" because it was going to revolutionize the flight simulator genre... even though it was going to be hundreds of DLC packs to get a proper map going, I was ""in""... ended up getting Hawaii and Alaska before they called it quits... I still have it on steam here but when Microsoft gave up on it, the multiplayer side of it disappeared over night and there is only so much of Hawaii and Alaska you can see before you want more--a meere fraction of the content that was promised, that got me to buy in... game 2 lost...Bought this game here on Steam... full of bugs, unresponsive controls, glitchy animations... and as you can read from other posts: instead of patching this game, they remaster it (addressing the bugs) and then sell it as a whole new game... I only played this game fewer than 10 hours but more than the 2 required to get a refund... there are much better games in this genre from much less unscrupulous publishers.			"

												Gotta be one of the funnest zombie survival games! The only thing missing is coop play.Give a feeling of really surviving and making decisions that can cost lives of people in the group. Can kick people from the group as well as allow people to join. Most people I had was 28 but could have easily went higher. managing food and other resources works well without being too much like a chore. if you build outposts around/near homebase and space them out right then you can make a safezone that keeps the home area pretty clear. if you want more of a challenge then move to a urban environment and leave unprotected areas near homebase. Ive had infestations right across the street from home and it made for a lot of activity to always clean or have it spill into he homebase. there are small issues with ai blocking doors sometimes and getting in the way of firebombs and traps but its not a huge deal.when you have looted an area items do not respawn so after a while you have to keep going farther and farther from home to get supplies. so it makes you feel like you really need to move to a different area to make things easier.

												It doesn't bode well when the first thing you see on loading a game is a screen trying to sell you other stuff.I found the controls and interface to be clunky. The third-person perspective was far worse than a first-person one - sometimes I couldn't even see my character because a bush was between him and the camera. They also made continuous inane comments to tell me if a room was empty or not. There are bizarre and overly-complicated systems. The best example of that - normally you might climb to a high point and look around. You don't need to make it more complex than that. But in this game there are special ""high points"" which then circle things all around - even if your character can't see them because the view is blocked by trees. Oh, I came to a locked car. I had a huge piece of wood, but couldn't break the windscreen to get in.I'm sure many could enjoy this, but I felt like the game was pushing me away right from the start. Hope you enjoy it more than I did.			"

												A ambitious survival game unfinished, like a beta version. Has good graphics and a wonderful sandbox mechanics but important glitches too: sometimes crush to desktop and every play one or two keys stop respond, among other programing bugs, as generate corrupted dump files. No solutions, only exit and restart the last saved game. Also, third person camera works really badly in close combat, little places and vehicles: a view in first person would be essential. Has a lot of good concepts but not fine implemented. You can develop structures, but not objects; items non exist out of containers. The inventories are based in slots more than the space and weight. The hand weapons wear out fast and the vehicles are weak and deteriorate quickly by outrages and collisions. There are ways to automatic repairing but are slow because depend on daily cycles.You cannot sleep ingame and act by night has more contras than pros, specially when sometimes foes can pass through walls or doors or appear in the air, all by graphics glitches.The survivors react very slowly against the most amazing zombies ever seen: are fast, strong and resistant. The close combats against a dozen or less are lethal, even if they do not attack at once, just by the loss of endurance. They have a great hearing capacity that restricts use of fire weapons, the sound attracts them quickly, with accuracy and in increasing numbers. They can open doors without breaking them and climb fences. Usually they appear by surprising just at side or behind the player, or only when exits the car. They attack the vehicles fiercely, smashing the bodywork and doors to push the people off. Definitelly are much more than zombies or infected.A downloable content lets to play infinite times with a increasing levels of challenge, but the difficultly soon becomes into exaggerated and game turns repetitive after few levels because always is the same map and way to survive to next level is same. Anyway, when characters reach max skills levels and have a lot of items, there is no motivation to continue, like an arcade game, but this is more complicated, generating a bad sense of frustration and waste of time.And after all, when runs fine proves to be very addictive for the most perseverant fans, but never advisable to normal players by the amount of bugs and defects of finished. A good oportunity lost, maybe by time exigencies and budget problems of an indie study based on crowdfunding. The result, a sum of mixed ideas from several mithical games, sure would have been wonderfull a decade ago, but lacks the technical finish and a adaptation of those concepts to the requeriments of nowdays. A pitty, but a second part will be better, if designers learn of their errors.			"

												This is one of those games that, when you think about it objectively is kinda monotonous but when you're playing it feels compelling and somehow manages to hit your reward centers. The problem is that it has bugs and general shoddiness coming out the ♥♥♥. It's a shame because the thought of a good open world zombie/survival game gives me chubbs.The main reason I recommend you don't buy this game at the moment is that it suffers from a serious but common bug where you stop getting new missions and so cannot progress through the game, you are relegated to just doing random side missions. Apparently this problem has existed since the middle of last year and still hasn't been fixed.			"

												I'm completely done with this game.  It changes the rules on you at random, it perma-kills characters basically out of nowhere, and it does that god-awful thing where if you don't play it for several days, you come back to find the NPCs have used up your stuff off-screen.That aside, the engine is buggy and inconsistant.  Zombies can jump fences that players can't, and only take damage sometimes.  Hit detection is mediocre at best and completely bonkers at worst, explosion radius' don't always take cover into account (which will absolutely punish you sometimes), and the meandering, mindless directions the game keeps trying to pull you relentlessly towards only serve to irritate.All in all, the execution is infuriatingly under-thought.  Never, ever, EVER punish a player right off the bat for not knowing rules that haven't been stated or shown.  Permakilling characters out of nowhere is the worst possible thing you can do, and these guys seem to love doing it repeatedly.There will never be anything that fixes this game.  Drop it, uninstall it, and avoid it forever.			"

												Zombies are NOT why I play State of Decay. The undead trope is wearing thin, but the reason to play this game is found in the group dynamics of the random survivors you encounter. For me, the draw was wondering who I'd meet next, and what skill they'd bring to my camp. In this way, State of Decay manages to foster a real sense of loss when a survivor dies. You'll genuinely miss what they brought to the table as all of their upgraded parish with them. That the combat, stealth and exploration are above serviceable is just extras on top of a great foundation.			"

Yes, there's a sandbox DLC (which quite frankly should have come with the base game) but ultimately the developers would have been better off fleshing out the core mechanics of scavenging, community recruitment, and base building rather than tacking on a campaign.Visually the game is an eyesore with incomprehensible levels of post processing and warped constrast filters -- fortunately there are some handy mods and configuration files out there that make it more presentable.

												A great entry to the zombie game market. Game doesn't focus on any single one character (As your encouredged to take out diffrent people from your camp via a fatguie system). Game does continue while your not playing, resources are consumed, events might be missed and so on. Though the effect of this decreses as time goes on. So missing a few months, is about the same as not playing for a week or so. Gameplay is alot of search, loot, return, run over a horde of zombies in your pickup truck going backwards. A good deal of fun. Breakdown (DLC) adds some replayability, but not too much new too the overall gameplay.			"

												Probably one of the best zombie games around, usually they're bland, boring, uninteractive and just the same thing over and over. Not to mention completely and horribly broken with poor voice acting, animations, movement, controls and optimisation (I'm looking at you, Dead Island)This, however, is the opposite. It's not only got a bit of uniqueness to it but it's actually good. Rather than write a wall of text I guess I'll do a list of pros and cons.Pros:- Well optimised- Nice, balanced combat- Not a zombie game that concentrates on firearms, rather a sensible mix of both melee and ranged- Makes the player use their brain, strategy is important in this game, going scavenging without a plan is a death wish- The AI is actually helpful- Pretty nice graphics and sound- RPG-like elements which're good for levelling each of your combat-able survivors at camp for different roles- Always something going on to keep you busy- There's other survivors in the world that you can get friendly with, the friendlier you are the more likely they are to help- No intrusive HUD, leaves the screen wide open for players to see everything they need- 3rd person games aren't usually terrifying, however this is. If you're stuck alone outside at night with hordes surrounding you, you'll be scared to move just in case they hear you. - The survivor you're playing as gets tired as they explore, or they get injured the more fights they get into, it adds realism to the game- Building on the above pro, character switching is seamless and easy.- It's just an awesome gameCons:- Voice acting isn't fantastic, but it isn't as bad as some. You'll hear everything survivors say after a few lines of dialogue before they start repeating themselves. However, this is an indie game and the gameplay more than makes up for it- An unfortunate lack of co-op play, I'm not sure whether or not the devs are looking into it for the 2nd expansion, I hope so because it would be a lot of fun!- It seems as though you're made to play round the clock, as one survivors goes to rest or heal up, you have to play as another and go out to explore. Whilst it does add more gameplay value, I'd prefer to run around in daytime more often- The addon - Breakdown - removes the storyline element from SoD, allowing you to do whatever you want to. You can do that in the base game, just don't complete the last story mission, however it's still worth getting- Sometimes zombies like to get stuck under things, making it impossible to kill them. It's especially irritating when they're an enemy you need to kill for a mission.I'm sure I've forgotten some things, but overall it's an awesome game, it's worth the £15 I paid for it.			"

												If you only have 20 dollars to your name, open this game's store page and willfully become penniless. Take part in a small town's Hell on Earth in from the perspective of a cast of haggard baddasses and wheezing lunatics. Learn how to pickle and can all the gummy worms you can handle. Repair weapons, bases, vehicles, and zombie teeth with a mouthful of monkeywrench. Level up your mind by digging through garbage, level up your body by focusing your chi for a no-holds-barred corpse confetti beatdown, or level up your heart by fleeing from every glow-eyed shambler who dares try to menace you.This game doesn't care if you have other things to do, and it will kill your friends while you're not looking.

												State of Decay is a marvelous well developped game, and replayable as hell. For the first hundred hours or so only. This game is a loop, where you grind for survivors, items and materials. Its devestating when you lose ANYTHING, especially a survivor. Although, after some training and good survivors (those hundred hours), you are essentially invincible. I am on Breakdown level 25, and I haven't lost a single survivor since breakdown 7. This is because the surviors I have trained, are like 5 Schwarzeneggers just running around merking everything. Juggernauts can't stand a chance. This game would be more fun if the campaign wasd actually a campaign, instead having 0 story, but many missions. I've given up on this game, Gameplay 9/10, Story 0/10, Replayability 5/10. Don't buy unless on sale. This is a positive review because the game is still good, but lacking.			"

												All in all,State of Decay is a really nice zombie-survived,sandbox,free-choice,third-person fighting&shooting game existing on the steam market for open selling.Maybe it has some obvious drawbacks,such as lacking multiplayer which can bring players extensive and various ways of fun like what the Day'Z did,only game controller plugged but no keyboard functioned during the very first pre-released period can get you feel annoyed,and not satisfied first-hand game experience cuz this is a transplanted  game originly from Xbox,not PC.BUT,after we rule out these disappointed or unfinished aspects,we would find many shining spots on this unique game which is full of creative and inspiring.First and the most crucial point I wanna talk about is the different characteristics and abilities for each unique person portrayed in the game.Every person appeared shows his differernt and outstanding parts from others,someone's good at combat skills and another's fond of life skills like cooking,etc.This helps them look like fresh creatures wanna stay alive during this unexpected chaos and interact with other people,environment and situation naturally.These's gonna have happiness and sadness,luck and misery,hesitation and resolution among devastated people.I have to admit this setting is awesome.Personally,I think the graphics and sound are good,too.It also contains highly freedom,open map,sandbox.You can consider it as a zombie version of GTA.Meanwhile,the cost for this game is comparably low.You have to spend more the twice money to buy Day'Z.I mean when you have extra money and dont wanna play with other players in zombie types.State of Decay is a good choice for you.

Its like a GTA with zombies and over 30+ playable characters all with different skill set. You can build a home base and outpost and upgrade your home base, you can search for other survivors which u can play after u saved them, you can search for supplies and weapons. For a 2gb download, this game sure gives endless fun, ♥♥♥♥ tons to do and tons of replayability with random events.

												One of the better realistic zombie survival games I have played. Everything is auto saved as you play so if that lone scavenger get ripped apart by zombies, sad day. This game uses the ""guns attract zombies in a 1 mile radius rule"" so you have to get silencers to use guns effectively otherwise you shoot two zombies and four more show up. This game also uses a base system for survivors so you can choose what modules for your base you'll need like beds for people to sleep and/or a medical tent for injuries. My negative experiences are when meleeing something the auto target will expose my back to other zombies who happily latch on and deal a lot of damage and the game won't let up with the missions most of which are time based as a survivor will need help. In addition, this game tracks your out of game time and reduces resources accordingly. Why? Why does this game need to function like ♥♥♥♥ing farmville in this regard? You're telling me unless the survivors have the player as their motivation they just ♥♥♥♥ around waiting to die? Totally unneeded mechanic.			"

												=-=-=-=-=TL;DR=-=-=-=-=• Single Player only, no Co-Op or Multi-player mode, still a great 1-player game• Good gfx, lighting and atmosphere. Spooky when looting houses• Play stealthy or reckless; Smash zombies with Car Doors!!• Addictive: I spent 12 hours with the game on first day of purchase!• Google x360ce if you want to use a controller other than the x360 controller. You'll be glad you did.=-=-=-=-=-=-=So addictive, State of Decay will keep you hooked if you are into stealthy survival, gathering goods, managing a community, zombie combat/survival-horror or just about anything else this game offers.Play with reckless abandon, charing into the fray with your Guns or Melee weapons, to achieve your goals, or stealthily sneak around the walking dead to search houses for food, water, ammo, building materials or other people for a greater chance of survival.My favorite things about this game are the gathering aspects, the building of the base-camp, building a community with NPCs and managing Food, Medicine, Building materials, Ammo and vehicles.My number one favorite thing about this game, in terms of play-mechanics, is quite simply; The awesome option of smashing zombies with your car door as you go careening by (or repeatedly slamming your car door into a zombie who fell over).The biggest and most obvious gripe about this game, is the complete lack of any co-op or multiplayer modes. This game is wonderful as it is, but it would be amazing as an MMO or at least LAN Co-Op. *** This Game is NOT Co-Op or Multiplayer: SIngle Player ONLY. ***Thankfully, the developer, Undead Labs, has another game in the works (currently known as Class 4) based around the ideas of State of Decay. State of Decay can even be viewed as a testing game for their Online version of State of Decay/MMO Survival horror.The graphics, spooky lighting and atmosphere are all in line with a game of this type and are done well. Many times I found myself turning off the flashlight becasue it kept attracting Zombies, so searching through abandoned houses for supplies in the dark (while hearing zombie moans ...somewhere close by) is a pretty creepy feeling and really adds to the suspense of the game.The audio sounds a bit quiet, on my rig anyways. I have to turn my speakers up a bit to hear the game at better sound levels, even with the audio sliders at max in the settings. As long as you don't expect any other sounds from your system while playing this game, it works just fine. If you get a message from a friend on steam (or other service) while creeping around a house being stealthy, with the audio up to hear this game, expect to jump in your seat!Overall, this game is really enjoyable to me. Open world Survival-horror with many RPG-style elements, building of communnities/outposts and NPC interactions just really help this game along. Again, it's not multi-player, but its a damn good game, in my opinion.			"

												This is a fantastic game. It really gives to all the reality of surviving a zombie apocalypse. It's not just about slaughtering hordes of zombies, which I do love, but this just gives a true sense of reality. Finding survivors and establishing a home base to survive. Scavaging for food, ammo and other supplies. Building up your home base. Building a medical station to heal your injured players, or a fitness area to make them stronger or give them more endurance. I just think that this game really takes the zombie genre to a new level that I really just love. I would recommend this game to anyone			"

												If you're a fan of zombies, exploration, some community management, violence, and survival, State of Decay will scratch a powerful itch. You're always on the edge of death and the one stupid mistake you make will be the one that does you in. It's not a hardcore simulation like Day-Z, nor is it at all multiplayer; nevertheless, the primary game is compellingly open-ended and you will make decisions  that allow some characters a chance to live and guarantee others will die. Sometimes, you'll have to make those decisions when your stamina is all gone, there's no cars to escape in, you're at half health because you haven't rested in days, you have 3 bullets, a damaged baseball bat, and a horde of biters moving to your position. Maybe you pop a morphine and hide in a bush until they pass, but you still have a long way to go to get home. While I am positively bullish on this game, temper your expectations. State of Decay is an indie game ported from XBLA. The controls are not tight, especially for mouse and keyboard. They are a little off-putting at first and you'll require time to adjust. The graphic style is fitting, but the graphic quality itself is not above average for 2013. It runs well enough, but you will not see a perfectly smooth framerate throughout; it'll drop at odd moments. Sometimes you hit a zombie with a finishing move and it'll be in slo-mo, but other times you wonder if the game is stuttering or if you're supposed to be seeing something awesome, but you don't know what it is. However, I predict that none of these presentation deficits will stop you from seeing the vision behind the game and getting immersed in it.This is a game that I would like to see a sequel for in about two years. I have not played the Breakdown DLC which removes the guiding storyline of the primary game and lets you just play the map. Though I look forward to trying it out next Steam sale. The developers had initially planned for the game to go multiplayer, but that effort has been canceled. Although, the developers promised that the sequel will focus on that feature. However, there are a lot of ways I could see the multiplayer game not being as compelling for me since I might lose the power to make decisions for my people. The comparison to Tell Tale's The Walking Dead are unavoidable and as with that game, I see this game gaining little from a full on multiplayer experience. Maybe if they made multiple maps and severely limited the number of players on each one so that each player could recruit their fair share of NPC survivors. Bottom line, if you see the game on sale, you might as well pick it up. State of Decay is all about risks and the ""fun"" you have taking them.			"

												Wow!  ""Open World Zombie Survival"" sounds like it'd be hackneyed, cliched, and basically a cynical attempt to cash in on buzzwords, but this game really nails it.  Big focus on building a COMMUNITY of survivors (which are procedurally generated, but feel real!)  Very fun to play.			"

												What can I say about this one? Other than it may well be the best zombie-survival I've ever had the pleasure to play. Especially when combined with some improvement mods available at the SoD Nexus. For example the possibility to transport supply-dufflebags in any pickup (thanks to modders adding physics to the said dufflebags), removing the zombies glowing eyes, and to top it off; only walking zombies, and a special infected-remover. Because let's face it... all zombie games with special infected is getting tiresome. What's wrong with a classic zombie experience?At any rate, I've spent a good chunk of hours in it. And the Breakdown DLC only improves with the new sandbox-mode. All in all... should you hesitate. Check out some gameplay in Youtube. I'm more than convinced that I'll be spending countless hours in this game in the coming year (if not years).			"

												This game IMHO is way better than TWD Game. I had so much fun killing zombies and ♥♥♥♥, Although at times repetitive... But at times it felt like Grand Theft Auto: Zombieland. I had lots of fun, Cars are easily flipped over with the handbrake, You get rushed a lot and when you're carrying too many things your stamina goes down fast as heck, Which may lead to being taken over by zombies as you attack way slower. Weapons break after a while, Tons of mini-missions although most of them are based on the same thing over and over. Had fun driving the sports cars though! One of the greatest features for me :)! Although I haven't passed the game, I greatly recommend this game based on the time I have played it so far.			"

												Aka ""Grand Theft Zombie"", plays like an interactive The Walking Dead episode. The lacklustre story, graphical & gameplay bugs, lack of first person camera, b-grade animations, sub-par voice acting and poorly constructed pacing are fortunately all outshone by the engaging atmosphere and scavenge-based economy which engage the player in base building and tower defense gameplay, along with character permadeath which elicits a real sense of risk versus reward.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

												A very good survival zombi horror game. And i DO recommend it to anybody specifically intrested in these three setting options of the process of wasting your free time (though i think it's not that much of a time-waster as my record says, i often leave a game paused while being busy).  Well, a little doubt on ""horror"", maybe i've just been killing too many undead in games and got used to see and hear and fight them with no proper emotions). But sometimes in tough moments the game  gives a feeling similar to fear, as you really don't wanna die yet know its quite possible or almost about to happen. To quit with the horror part - zombies look nice, especially those partly decomposed ones and the bloater.Maybe the biggest lack of the game is no first person view option available to take a closer look at these ugly bustards before killing them. The same about car driving, wouldn't hurt to have it in first person too. But all done well enough as the third person game.Survival is good to great, though most of it's components eventually get more or less repetitive and boring. But that's just like in any other game. The worst of unpleasant impressions i had was of those situations when you die because while you were killing three, five more came and while you were finishing them off there were seven more coming and so on until you've spent all your means of survival. When you get used to a game and start relying on your own honestly acquired skill more than on the character's abilities and inventory, it makes undesirable deaths inevitable too often, and leaves an irritating feelling of being trapped by developers in some preplanned different from the normal gameplay circumstances. I believe that's just what it is, but ok, it's all my personal impressions and unlike in many other games doesn't affect much the possibility to move on along the game's story and finish it before you feel you've had enough of someone's perverted imagination and can't afford wasting more time on it).Zombiez as i've already said are looking great, the same about the ways they move and act, they are intresting to deal with until you get too tired and there's too many more closing on you. So, fellow players - keep an eye on it in order to lose less characters, and keep in mind all the ways you find out (there are some)) to quit fighting and start saving your ♥♥♥ at the right moment.The game currently seems to be well optimised, there was no crushes or any other serious issues during my first playthrough. A few bugs spotted in the second which is not finished yet, but all rare, harmless, insignificant and not affecting the gameplay quality. And often looking funny btw, like a zombi, killed together with a group of others by the rear bumper of the slowly moving car, starting to turn somersaults after several seconds of lying on the road).To developers - thanks for the great game, it was and still is a really interesting experience. Sorry for buying it on sale, it's worth its price, and i'd pay it if the sale wouldn't have occured, as the game's screens, vid and description were looking promising.PS Apologies for my presumably non perfect english.PPS The new dlc Lifeline is finally working. Looking and playing good. And there's plenty of ammo from the very beginning, which was the most pleasant feature to me  for the first hour of playing! Along with the new locality and cars durable enough like in the original SoD (and unlike Breakdown's ones trying to break even before you start breaking them).			"

												This game is a great step in the right direction for Zombie survival, with its fortifications and reasource hunting. Even management of fellow NPC's.  The controls are barely servicable and even with my Xbox controller are not that great ether. You will often find yourself stuck on minor pixels and run into objects you cannot see due to the third person camera. You will also encounter a sluggish camera system so you do not have a responvie feedback when you need to turn to see something.Also the saving system is terrible. In my recent save I left the game with 25 ammo points in my safe-location, I load the save up again and it was set to only 1 point. And saving during the game appears crippled at best, I'm unsure if its from the BS console savepoint system or if its flawed by design to limit you from going through with-out mistakes. Thus encouraging failure. I realize this might be a thing for this game but leaving a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ saving system in place doesn't help the game or anybody. I still recommend this game though its fun as it is, but do not bother pouring much effort into it, just leads to disapointment.			"

												  Rarely have I experienced a game that is by turns so engrossing and yet also frustrating as State of Decay.    These designers at Undead Labs undeniably share the vision I've always had for the ideal zombie apocalypse survival RPG.  For all the potential this game offers however, it falls a bit short of perfection due in part to limited optimization for PC, minor design flaws and a hundred little moments that will have you doing /facepalm.  The primary features like base building & upkeep, character progression and the constant need to scavenge while fending off hordes are highly engaging.  The dynamic mission system, the relationship system for playable and NPC survivors and the decent pacing of the story guarantee that you'll always have more to do than time to do it in.  Decisions like 24/7 near-real time progression and permanent character deaths enhance immersion and tension.  Gameplay goes back and forth between pursuit of the main quest line and addressing challenges to your (and others) survival.  Smart choices and hustle are rewarded with a secure base and (relatively speaking) happy community while poor ones are compounded by a variety of repercussions.  Combat is fun once you develop skills enough to unlock handy special abilities and acquire some slightly higher quality weaponry.  State of Decay is a PC port, and in short it feels and looks like what it is.  The combination of features here is awesome but I'm left wanting more depth, quality and variety in them.  They should also do a careful pass of the experience from start to finish for convenience and user interface.  I'd also like to see a more robust story, more unique survivors with their own side quests, a vast improvement of zombie AI/pathing and an effort to balance special zombies a bit more.  In other words, bring all of the people and zombies to life more convincingly.  This game is destined to divide players into:1) A hardcore group who want a higher level of difficulty and realism and,2) A more general group of zombie and RPG fans who get riled up over that first death and the coming to grips with permanent loss of a useful character (who you're emotionally attached to, to boot).  I highly recommend State of Decay to any genre fan.  Temper your expectations reasonably and you will be thrilled with this fun game; I loved it.  I have not yet tried the Breakdown or Lifeline DLC's but reportedly the former provides a satisfying level of difficulty from the getgo and in the end a serious challenge.  Any sequel to this has huge potential and I will be keeping an eye on the future developments by Undead Labs.  Any successor needs a Cooperative mode.  Demands it.TIP: Don't let yourself feel safe or secure, because this game has a nasty way of either suddenly hitting you with a new mechanic or simply bugging out and getting you killed with some form of glitch.TIP: Cultivate more than one survivor so that when your starter gets tired or dies you have solid options to fall back on.TIP: Respect the Juggernaut, he needs his personal space.  Do not let your friendlies anywhere near that big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.TIP: Don't restart if you die, just take the hit and keep on truckin'.			"

Game playability and overall enjoyment would have been much higher with a cooperative mode.-Smaller map. Yes I know it was ported over from Xbox, but a larger map maybe with 2 more towns or so would have added a lot more. As of now, I feel like I am stuck wandering the same small little part of the world. JUst from town A to Town B and back.These are the main things that got me.

Don't expect any replay value though; the scaveging get's quite boring fast (just like the boat stuff in Assassin's Creed 4) but stays fun just enough to finish the game.7/10			"

												I played all kinds of zombie games but no game is like this one. In first days of early beta it was really bad full of bugs and didn't even had keyboard and mouse support. Now 1 year later it is like another game. Gameplay mehanichs are good but controls sometimes get unresponsive but nothing serious. As everyone know this game 2 DLC-s that are must need. And if anyone want to buy good open world zombie game he should buy this game. Hope to see more updates			"

												I've been playing this game for a few days now. I have quite a few zombie games. State of Decay's outstanding quality it has the best aspects of all the other games I played before. Basebuilding, resource management, great graphics, storyline, a map that's bigger than it looks and gobs of hidden loot. The fact the game persists whether you're there or not is quite a twist. I've failed a number of times already and am on my 3rd restart. While that's kind of tedious, particulurly with cut scenes, it proves this game isn't a pushover. You also notice that while the map may be the same the contents are not. Replayability is a plus, especially when you blow it often early on being a clueless clumbsy noob like I at first, one with a tendancy to overturn trucks into riverbeds causing a firey zombie-attracting clusterflub.

												This is the long awaited sequel to the hit game, State of Emergency. Although it veers strongly from the establish plotline of the State of Emergency series, it manages to stay connected, and even throws out oblique references. For example, the main character of the story mode is black. So was one of the main characters in State of Emergency, and they were both similarly named. Many parallels can be drawn to State of Emergency, such as The Law mission. However, this is where the review becomes negative. I was disappointed at how different the game felt and played from the original. The forumla for the first game worked pretty well, and there wasn't much of a reason to change it. This seems to be a total redesign in the wrong direction.Although open-world, there is now a resource-collecting and base-building sidegame, which adds to the confusion. Most of the additions seem tacked-on, and pointless. Zombies, while a welcome addition, provide nothing more than cannon fodder. Although cops served a similar purpose in the first game, in that game their A.I. was more advanced, and were generally more interesting to fight.Overall, I can't really recommend this game for State of Emergency fans. I was disappointed.			"

												State of Decay is one of the best zombie games in recent memory. However, I wouldn't call it perfection. In fact, this game has plenty of flaws.In the graphics section, I found it to be pretty nice for the most part. However, in the beginning of the game, the lighting is absolutely terrible and hurt my eyes a bit. Despite that, the visuals were extremely nice and I was itching to take a few nice screenshots. However, I can't call it the #1 best part. It's still very well done.The gameplay is heated, difficult, and in some ways, realistic. The gameplay is probably the best part to the game. When you think of zombie games, I assume that you would imagine some dude with a six-pack running around shirtless with shades on dual wielding sub-machine guns, right? State of Decay is NOT like that. These are just human beings we're talking about, not supersoldiers. In fact, if there's anyone people would consider cheap in this game, it would be the Army. But hey, we're talking about the Army here. Did you really think a soldier would be running around and getting tired quick and having a miserable aim? Anyway, running away from hordes IS NOT a good idea. I've tried to run several times, but I've only gotten out alive once or twice. The people who did survive had severe injuries, were extremely tired, or have no useful items left on them. The vehicles are simple enough to drive, and making them limited just makes the game even harder. Very good gameplay.The story is cliche, no doubt. Survivors are holed up in a certian place (In State of Decay, Trumbull County) and the Army refuses to help. However, it seems rather difficult to actually come up with a decent plot for a zombie survival game without realizing someone else did that already. The audio is above average at most. The voice acting is fine, at times weak. It sometimes sounds sarcastic or the mic is far away. However, some of the actors do provide some emotion. The music is great for a zombie survival game, and I usually rely on the music to tell me if the zeds are nearby. Although again, the music is a bit cliche since several zombie survival games (and even shows) use guitars or things like that for their soundtrack. But, the soundtrack is very good in this game and is better than lots of other games and shows that use the soundtrack like this.The replayability is very strong in this game. If you beat the game, you can play through it again once or twice. There's also the two DLC packs that were very critically acclaimed you can buy, too. I didn't get either one yet, but Breakdown looks extremely fun. It's actually number one on my wishlist right now.State of Decay does have a few other major flaws I'd like to point out: The AI in this game is absolutely HORRIBLE. One of my survivors stood there doing ABSOLUTELY nothing while getting eaten by a horde of zombies. Since my guy was tired, I had to run the zombies over. And because usually the survivors dodge the car, he just stood there, doing absolutely nothing. When I hit him, he stood there and I lost trust with him. It was even one of the trust missions where someone is feeling angry, sad, or whatever. He also took like half an hour to get all of his things while the houses next to him were infested when we rescued him. Still though, BAD AI. The dialogue is repetitive and there's not many stories when you're bringing survivors back home. That's probably about it in terms of major flaws.In the end, State of Decay is quite fun and there's lots to do, but the game has some very major flaws that can ruin your experience. Either way, this is a game I'd recommend for any zombie survival fan.Graphics- 8.0/10Gameplay- 9.0/10Story- 4.0/10Audio- 7.5/10Replayability- 9.0/10.:7.5/10:.+Great gameplay+Large world+Awesome soundtrack+Impressive job by some of the voice actors-Awful AI-Repetitive dialogue-Weak lighting early game			"

												If someone created a tetrahedron (just roll with it) of zombie apocalypse entertainment with Left 4 Dead at one corner, No More Room in Hell at another corner, The Walking Dead at a third corner, and DayZ in the final corner, State of Decay would be somewhere near the gooey, festering, dead center of such a divine tetralogy of terror. This is my first enduring impression upon completion of the main storyline after marathoning 26 hours game time over the course of about 36 hours from point of purchase. I have yet to try the DLC, so my review covers the basic game only. I will try to keep spoilers to a minimum.You and a buddy have gone camping and are on your way back to civilization only to find that the campgrounds have become picnic at the park for zed. Your job is simply to survive and learn to survive more successfully and efficiently. As you make your way in the world, you find yourself essentially trapped within a large valley of small communities and farms with a few souls and a whole lot of folks who’ve no longer any use for theirs. You’ll see a lot of tropes and types that are standard for the genre, but most of them are written in a way that downplays their commonness and gives them the dignity of a measure of individual identity and unique situations. You’ll find that vehicles work pretty much as you’d expect them to—often to your advantage and, now and then, to your sorrow. You’ll learn quickly that the world reacts to your decisions in mostly logical ways and that, among the precious assets that will remain largely too sparse for your tastes, human beings matter greatly to you and your prospects for survival. Influence will become your currency. Interactions will become your keys to more currency, technology, and even more assets. Your chances will depend solely upon your actions and choices, but your outcomes will almost always depend upon how your actions and choices affect others. For a relatively small solo game, I never felt that the world was hollow or empty, or that I was truly playing alone the way you feel if you solo some games. The Good: Options. High degree of player interaction with environment and characters which carries lasting impacts. Ambitious design. Homage to the genre. Moments of pleasant surprise and genuine anxiety. Humor that is often subtle. You will roam a mostly open world with some depth of detail that I think may pleasantly surprise you at times. You choose how you will play, where you will go, and what you will do. If you play smart, the game will reward you. If you take foolish risks, you may find yourself sorely punished—likely, but not a guaranteed always. On a single run through from beginning to end, I found myself still trying to figure out certain triggers for various spawns and events, and that’s a good thing. It promises a level of continued interest for future game sessions. If you tear up a vehicle, it will break down, and even possibly explode. If you toss a flare or firecrackers in the night, you will attract a lot of unwanted attention, but you will also be able, if you’re quick and quiet enough, to take advantage of the diversion to make an escape. There’s a lot more I’d love to share, but some things are more pleasurable discovered on your own. If you’re paying attention as you go, you may notice a good number of locales or situations clearly intended as tributes to the genre greats, both to creators and to the works they created, and it comes off not simply as a checklist but as an honest homage. If you get the game, take time to revel in the sensation of racing down a country road in the night with your headlights off while swerving slightly to the side and opening your driver’s side door to take out an entire horde of zombies and freaks. Take a moment in the twilight to look out over a field of crops to see shambling silhouettes against the outline of a rolling landscape under an open country sky. Savor the tremor in the dark as you explore a quiet shed only to discover that you aren’t alone in there after all. Thrill to the delighted frustration of attempting to run down that creepy thing that moves just too darn fast and vaguely spider-like along the edge of the road. Regret smacking indiscriminately into that just-one-more batch of zed that somehow left such a foul aftertaste.The Bad: First, the downside to being such an ambitious game that aims to honor and do so much is that it has its limitations. I found myself in a few spots just wishing the game would go farther in a certain way to take things further in certain options that just weren’t available sometimes. I wanted more management options for people. I wanted a better explanation at times for certain things, though I think that the hands-off approach to this game actually improved the experience overall for me. I found other limitations, which I won’t share because I don’t want to spoil the fun but you are free to discover them for yourself.  Second, there were some moments when I felt the actions or dialogue of characters in the game were completely transparent as vehicles for forcing my attention in some direction. I didn’t like that at all, but thankfully this did not happen too often. Third, while we’re talking about dialogue and actions of characters and game limitations, I found it strange that a game that places such a high emphasis on influence would present me with so few opportunities for deep interpersonal interactions. Conversations, too often, are limited to, “Hey, what’s the sitch?” and that’s it. Not even an option given to answer that question. Fourth, a few persistent glitches in the game. I noticed a change in the condition of vehicles where you pass by one time and it’s in good shape and the next time it’s dinged up, but then the very next time you pass by it looks perfectly fine. Some people showed up as having run away from my compound, but were actually still living there and were still available as controllable characters. Fifth, companions hit some trigger point where a mission, a conversation, or some other key like stamina tells them it’s time to go home, and they run off. Even if you’re on the opposite side of the map with a perfectly good vehicle and getting ready to get in and drive home, they will run off across the countryside full of wandering hordes and freaks, sometimes creating a hazard where you have to rescue them in the process. I think this is a result of the game’s having been developed to emphasize stealth over combat. However, I played using reserved force and stealth, and all-out Car Wars/Death Race 2000 driving mentality, and found I did quite well.The Ugly: The game is a PC port from console and it shows. It’s not nearly as bad as some games I could mention, but the console history of the game makes certain things awkward for PC players at best. Playing with keyboard and mouse worked just fine, but sometimes I would discover a move that I couldn’t quite easily reproduce and it makes me wonder if it was supposed to be triggered by a combo that I just haven’t figured out on K&M control. That being said, mostly, to anyone who didn’t know it was a console port or had familiarity with the differences in play and feel, I don’t think anything more than the autosave function and a few other clues give it away. That’s not too bad a complaint for the ugly. Also, and this is my biggest beef with the game, I found the best compound for my strategies in the game broken or nerfed (I couldn’t tell which) in an incredibly stupid way: The rest of my review (you're getting very near the end of it) appears in the comments section below because I've run out of room again.

												So here's the deal: a stealth-oriented game where the stealth kill option doesn't friggin' work half the time. Boy, aren't we off to a good start.The plot doesn't exist, the writing is so-so at best.Gameplay is convoluted. This whole affair with stealth kills not executing properly half the time really messes up the game when you're torn apart by the friggin' horde.This also has a gimmick where stuff happens to your base while you're not playing, which is unpleasant for those of us who have a life to live apart from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.Dunno. It had some promise, but I'm still to see a decent open-world zombie apocalypse game.3 TORN APART MARCUSES OUT OF 10			"

												State of decay is one of the best third person survival horror open world game. Graphics is good enough, story is fine. SoD is not a brainless zombie killing game, you are a member of a community stucked in Thumbull county. Player have to manage the community which includes doing favoures for survivors to gain trust to become friends later; scavenging for vital supplies such as food, medicine, building materials. In the game you have a ""home base"" which can be upgraded with 9 facilities, and also has  space for outpost to build. Outposts extends the safe area and have supply cache to restock your equipment. The game can be played id different ways, someone likes playing stealthy, others prefer brute force to complete missions. Ah, the missions; i found side missions a bit repetitive, but they are okay. Driving cars is useful but makes a lot of noise which attracts zombies. When you are at your base you can change the character you are playing if the other character is your friend. Changing is adviseable to let the used character rest to get their vitality and stamina back to maximum value. SoD is beyond my expectations, i recommended everyone who loves zombie games 9/10.			"

												Wat do you call a group of Zombies? Hmm, a pack of Zombies? No no, that is not it. Hmm, a gander of Zombies? Nooo. How about a pride of Zombies? Hell no! Aaaah YES. It is called a HORDE, a Horde of Zombies! And that is what you will be facing in State of Decay. Hordes and more Hordes of Zombies.But you are not alone. There is lots and lots of melee weapons to help you deal with the problem and there is lots and lots of fire arms to help you deal with the pest. You also have your characters that level in this RPG game. You can go stealthy, high cardio and run faster and for longer than them Zombies or simply go guns blazing and melee weapons swinging. But you will also need your own group, you need to band together and form a group. Work with other groups around the town/state and help each other out or simply let them join your group and become a bigger group. Your brothers and sisters in arms will help you with your daily life in the Zombie apocalyptic town.The larger the group the more mouths you have to feed, the more meds your will need and of course the more weapons/ammo you will need for your established base/group. On the other side the larger the group, the better the man power and better the protection. Your home is where you manage the group’s lives. Build a small infirmary, or upgrade your lookout tower for better protection and area coverage. However pick wisely, space in your walls is limited and you put people’s lives in danger every time you and your group go out for resources. On another note what would a Zombie Apocalyptic game be without the army? The army is also present but it seems they have their own agenda and could care less for the survivors on the street.But how does it all end? What happens to your band of brothers and sisters? I guess you will have to find out for yourself? Pros: -Fun Dialogue RPG Zombie Horde slaying game.-Story line is fairly good. Entertaining. -Weapons is fun and diverse, always fun to slay Zombies.-Your group can repair your decaying vehicles and weapons. -You don’t need to do the tedious runs over and over again, use your group to scavenge and deliver the goods you have discovered.-You have your group members at your disposal to help with runs and missions.-Setup more outposts for protection and ease of accessing the group stash.-Open world to explore.Con: -Graphics slightly out dated, but did not bother me that much.-Game was designed/created for Xbox 360/consoles and converted for PC.-Game feels a little too easy (however still challenging enough to be fun)-no Co-OP play.Conclusion:I feel this game is worthy of your precious time. It is worth mine. If you can pick this game up on the Steam sale for $4.99 then it is a no brainer (bargain). I would not feel cheated if I was to pay $19.99 for it ether, game is worth the cash. I noticed majority of the players finished this game (main story) between 16-18 hours. I usually play slower and discover every nook and cranny myself. This game would have scored beter if it had the co-op. I presonally would love to build a base and go slay some zombies with my friend. I bought the two DLC's on Steam sale too, but have not played them yet. My score is based on the main game only. I have played this game for 8hours already and is hooked. Very addictive game. Go ahead give this game a try. I recommend it and would give it a personal score of 8/10.			"

Im glad I can still play it because I have both dlcs and everything but still, the GOTY Edition is so heavy and pricey and what does it do? Some nicer textures. Screw you :)No thanks.I really love this game. If it had multiplayer even 2 Player Coop It would be the best zombie game Ive ever touched and I touched and played a few and saw some come and go. I love the action, the combat, the loot...oh god the loot.Whoever had a truck filled with 6 bags worth of materials and then drive a bit too fast, turn the car upside down and watch it explode and burn knows my pain...Having a car is great but when its gone.. its dangerous, creepy at night even and you really need to stealth or run out of breathe.I loved this game I will keep playing it but Since no one can buy it anyway, this negative review doesnt do ♥♥♥♥, since no one will read it :)Even if it sucks I still want to see State of Decay 2 with multiplayer...If it ever comes and doesnt ♥♥♥♥ on the players again.Overall, awesome game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ production team and poor choices on the cost of the community.

Is it another zombie game? Well yes. But that doesn't mean it's more of the same. I think State of Decay tries to do what games like DayZ cannot which is a survival zombie experience without the threat of being killed by a real player.It's not as agressive as DayZ in terms of surviving but the fact that you have to explore, scavenge and find ways of progressing makes it very compelling. You also take part as the guy in charge so whatever happens is on your own hands.			"

(хотя у меня лично проблем не возникло при использовании клавиатуры и мыши ) но после 20 минут проведенных в ней - я убедился что ролики не лгали .Незабываемая атмосфера суровых реалей в эпоху зомби апокалипсиса, насыщенный и глубокий мир в духе лучших лент зомбихоррора, и главное - непередаваемые ощущения присутствия в этом мире - где нужно бороться за каждую минуту проведенную на своих двух в вертикальном положении, а  больше всего  вышеперечисленного радует  - наличие выборана тему -того как это сделать ! потому лично для меня State of Decay это - игра о которой раньше можно было только мечтать, и видеть в несбыточных снах.. Выживание -за счет логики и выбранных решений, а не только за счет ловкого раша !Твердая 10 ! А вот когда появиться мультиплеер ........эта рецензия увеличиться в двое XD ну вы поняли !;)			"

												I dreaded to play this game. I was watching the alpha/beta development of this game for a little while, and while I liked a lot of what I read about it, looking at the content didn't look 'refined' enough.The gameplay is not anywhere as smooth as I had hoped and it's hard for me to get past the pre-rendered animations for literally every action. In the beginning I was watching my npc friend attack a zombie and you could see when each attack animation would create a 'stutter' between the next attack.Right in the beginning I watched a zombie trap it self climbing up a ledge, clipping back down, then repeating over and over again.The controls as a whole feel awkward to command and execute, with a lot of fine mouse sensitivity just to execute bulky, long animation sequences.The camera doesn't zoom out very far at all either. For an open world zombie game, your field of view  feels kind of narrow and your character takes up a good size on the screen.The gameplay is nothing like Left 4 Dead, but more like a more arcade gamestyle of Dead Rising with  a Dead Island feel.You do get vehicles in this game though, and they handle really nice. They drive with a good weight to them, rather than the sometimes glidy feel of running around in the game.My biggest gripe about the game is all the heavily scripted actions, which doesn't work when the combat generally tends to be just button mashing, making your character attack at nothing a few times to catch up with all the times you mashed the attack button.I don't know how much can be improved upon with patches and this first game is rather bumpy in a lot of ways and would only recommend to buy on sale, I could definitely see this turning into a worthwhile series. The gameplay is unique and interesting enough that it can definitely be worth expanding on.			"

												1/5 года ожиданий, наконец то оправдались.Пусть  State of Decay на данном этапе еще сырая, пусть в ней еще нет должного перевода,и  как скажут многие адекватного управления без геймпада. (хотя у меня лично проблем не возникло при использовании клавиатуры и мыши ) но после 20 минут проведенных в ней - я убедился что ролики не лгали .Незабываемая атмосфера суровых реалей в эпоху зомби апокалипсиса, насыщенный и глубокий мир в духе лучших лент зомбихоррора, и главное - непередаваемые ощущения присутствия в этом мире - где нужно бороться за каждую минуту проведенную на своих двух в вертикальном положении, а  больше всего  вышеперечисленного радует  - наличие выборана тему -того как это сделать ! потому лично для меня State of Decay это - игра о которой раньше можно было только мечтать, и видеть в несбыточных снах.. Выживание -за счет логики и выбранных решений, а не только за счет ловкого раша !Твердая 10 ! А вот когда появиться мультиплеер ........эта рецензия увеличиться в двое XD ну вы поняли !;)			"

												Ok so after about 30 hours I think I know enough to rate this one.   My first experience with this game was while it was an alpha and I am happy I waited to play for real until it was ""finished"".  For the most part the game is finished there are still some bugs that are silly and gamebrakeing.  (minor)   However what is broken in this game isnt really the game but the concept.  If you want your game to be hard as hell thats fine.  In fact its actually a really good thing as long as you follow a simple rule.  Either you allow the user to adjust the difficulty with silders, or if you still want hardcore to be the only mode you need to make sure that mode doesnt interefere with the fun.  And holy crap does that mode interfere with the fun.   Lets remember you cant really save in this game, you make a bad decision and too bad you now need to start over the WHOLE GAME!!  I could go on attacking this feature but I guess the fan boys would not understand.   If you buy this you will need to download the hack that helps to balance fun.  Even with that the game still kicks your butt with sending you on mandatory missions every minute or two.  Problem is that it can take 30 minutes or so to finish the first mission, so you are guaranteed to get screwed.   This isnt a game, its an attempt to **** with everyone who buys it.   There are good things about SOD, the game makes you care about the survivors and you can get into the game.   There is fun to be had here its just so impossibly hard to find and enjoy.   Graphics and color must be altered to create a look because otherwise it would be a crime.   I REALLY hope some moders get ahold of this one and make it playable.    My Score   30/100  Horrible			"

												If you use Steam on a regular basis, chances are you came across State of Decay on the frontpage, offering its tender body up to you, promising more ZOMBIES.If you think the gaming-world has had enough zombies as of late you're absolutely right. What is lacking, though, is an innovative approach to the zombie-genre. Something with more depth than your average Resident Evil. State of Decay (SoD) might just be exactly that.SoD starts you off in medias res, with only you and your buddy stranded in the midst of an already ongoing zombie-apocalypse. The gameplay comes along feeling a lot like Dead Rising at first, but quickly shows it tries to take on more than just that. As you hack and slash your way through Northern American forests and farmlands (on a fairly large, open map) you will meet other survivors (not actual people, mind you - this is a singleplayer-title). Some might not be too fond of you and avoid contact, others might be willing to join up. Soon, you will have a quaint little base to call your (temporary) home and you will quickly realise that not everything evolves around YOU and the character YOU play.SoD claims to be a Zombie-Survival-Simulator - and this goes beyond simulating how to best dismember the undead. You will have to keep an eye on all of your ""group"", as all of them have roles to play. There will be relations between characters, tensions, scarcity of resources and so on. Maybe most importantly of all: No one is safe. Every character can die, yet in return you also get to play as anyone who has joined you.Plan your adventures carefully, take only what you need, call for scavengers, answer the calls of your fellow survivors and occasionally plow through a zombie-horde with a car. This should sum up SoD in essence.All this glory does have its shortcomings, though. Missions will start to get repetetive due to their interchangable nature, many houses will look similar and the stuff you find in them is not very interesting. Being an Xbox-title originally, the game also looks a bit outdated and struggles with controls. An Xbox-controller is REQUIRED (quote from the store-page) to play this game, at least until they finish the mouse and keyboard controls in a patch.Speaking about patches, this game still is in early development, so a lot of changes will be made in the future. It certainly is promising, just not quite the Next Big Thing.--UPDATE (Aug 2014): SoD does no longer REQUIRE a controller to be played, it now supports mouse and keyboard controls, HOWEVER I still recommend playing with pad as using your mouse will give you some rather twitchy controls.

												Played over 340 hours, mostly on the edge of my seat! Great first person zombie slaughterer using all manner of weapons, vehicles and players, great relaxer due to limited resource management, leaves most of the time to get on with the business in hand, killing zombies!! Love it but need more DLC slated for 2015 hopefully.			"

												This is the game I have been looking for since the Zombie Hype following ""DayZ"". It combines a Survival Game with fun fights (nothing beats fighting zombies with wrestling moves), several home bases, which can be upgraded and customized for your way of playing and rudimentary role-playing elements. And it is all completely Single Player. For some this might be a reason not to buy, but for this player it was the argument that sold the game. The game has a permadeath system and adapted it perfectly for a SP game. The player does not start with ""his own"" character. You rather start the story join a group of survivor, all playable for the character. All the characters in the game get exhausted and get debuffs through this. The player than has to return to the home base and choose another survivor to continue. This system is extremely fun as you can develop several different characters and ways of playing the game within one playthrough.Another mechanic which makes this game great is the resource management. The survivors don't spend all day with slaying zombies and driving around town. Most of the time cabinets, crates and all kinds of storage stuff is searched and looted. The player has to do this as the home base needs four resources. Food, to keep everyone well fed; Ammo, with a lot ammo in stock the home base has a decent supply of ammo for every firearm; Materials, to build and upgrade the home base and outposts, and medicine, this act the same way as ammo does a lot of supply equals lots of drugs at the home base. The most fun part of the game is the fighting. The player can either fight with blunt, sharp or heavy melee weapons or several firearms. The range of melee weapons goes from table legs to sledgehammers to cavalry sabres. Melee combat is mostly used in the game as guns are loud and the zombies react to sounds. This review just touches the surface of the game but I really hope that it helped you in any way. With best regards Invisiblo			"

 State of Decay I am going to review the Base > Game  + the DLC later on, but i wanted to focus on SoD right now. There is a lot of Hate towards Undead Labs, over SoD being released way to early during Alpha, and it still being broken and or not finished! But they continue to apply Updates to the Base > Game  making it better each time. There are still a few bugs but I'm sure they will be addressed in the near future.I know there is still a lot of people not being able to play it because... Lets face it it's Poorly Optimized. Even a High End Rig can struggle playing it, but it's a Port from 360 and this may change in the future. I also experience a little lag from time to time, but it's not game breaking in any way for me. Usually when i enter Marshal it does it for a few seconds, then goes back to normal. For me it was an over all fun experience. I enjoyed it the first play though, but it does has those bugs that.  Well just ruin the atmosphere of the whole Survival experience, when a zombie falls through the floor during a mission and you cannot progress without killing it... (But you cannot hit it underneath the dang house) can be frustrating and take the fun out of it.There are Elements i wish they would have added or Left in as other people described from there experience on the 360 version. Like (Generators) i really liked that idea, and being able to (Load up your Truck) with Ruck Sacks when you find more than one. But don't base your judgment on (Should i Buy this? or Not?), merely based on haters in the forums, you should always form your own opinion while playing it your self. I love Horror/Zombie games, i gave it shot and I'm still here playing it :) (Love the DLC More) and I'm still unlocking Hidden Characters!Plus there are frequent Sales on the Store and you can pick up a copy pretty cheap, so really you have nothing to lose it  is worth the Price, some may disagree but to each his own. It has it's flaws and it also has it appeals, below is a list of my Pro's & Con's for State of Decay.Pro's of SoD:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 - Open world you can explore freely, at times. (Some Area's Require Story Progress) to access them.2 - Drive any vehicle you want, and run down Hoards of Undeads! (You know you want to)3 - Change your Home > Base (Several Potential Home Bases) to choose from all over the map.  4 - Build up your Base, to help you and your fellow Survivors... Well Survive lol.  Medical Tent, Sleeping Quarters, Garden, Work Shop, Sniper Post, Library. - I forgot a couple.  5 - Build Outposts, to better defend your Home > Base from random Hordes, and Zombie Spawns.  The number of Out Posts, is based on how large the Home Base is. It can be anywhere from 4 to 9.  6 - Interact with any Person (NPC) you meet, some are Neighbors. And some are just trying to Survive!  And some are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bags... Yes i am referring to the Wilkersons... When they killed Becca i wanted  to drive to there farm house and burn it to the freaking ground!!  7 - Enter/Loot any Building you may encounter, it's a large map so there is loads of places to Rob Blind :)  8 - Befriend Survivors, and have them watch your back while your out in the world Scavenging.  9 - Take part in Random Events that pop up, like Zed Hunting, or Besieged- odd name?  And gain trust with them, eventually they will join you.Con's of SoD:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 - Lilly Ritter... She can become quite annoying. While our immersing your self in the world of the dead, she will keep asking you to go here, go there, and just keep bugging you in general :( 2 - Vehicle Physics, are still not the best. They are still Floaty at times, and the smallest thing like a ""tiny Rock"" can flip over your 4X4 truck going 25 MPH. Even after a few Updates Tweaking this feature. /Facepalm. 3 - The Story is spotty and not really well done, at times if can leave you feeling lost and not sure what to next. And you can spend a lot of time just thinking WTF standing around... When it suddenly pops up telling you your next Objective to Progress the story... 4 - The Survivors AI is really poorly done, you can spend a lot of time back tracking trying to get Him/Her unstuck from behind a gate they could have just opened /Facepalm. That and they often just stand around your home base not doing anything but eating up Resources. They will get (Stuck/Lost) a lot making it harder. 5 - Looting a Building/Home, you will often find (Items/Weapons) you need but do don't have space for. So you will leave it in there and head back to base Unload and get side tracked. If you save Quit or Crash and load it back up they will be all gone, empty stash in the places you Scavenged... 6 - Optimization Issues, the game still needs Tweaking and Feature Updates. Hell it took forever before they finally allowed us to Pre-Define our damn Controls! But the Options/Settings are still lacking and will need to be addressed.7 - Boarding up windows... Ok i love the feature of being able to fortify my Base or Random House by Boarding up the windows keeping the Dead outside, but it was poorly implemented. It vanishes if you travel to far away from the place you boarded up, and when you Quit and load back up it was all for not... Now i can see losing some to Zeds trying to break in while I'm away but really? Just randomly disappears not cool.But that's always subject to change, like i said before they will be doing Updates to the Base > Game  and it can improve over time, but i like the game. Once i bought the DLC (Break Down) i just loved it because it removed the Story allowing me to really immers myself into the experince, i will do a review on BD next.I hope this helped some people, we all have different experinces when playing but overall it was a good game.

												1. Too small map to explore for anything. If it is an open world then better be a world at least. also everywhere seems so similar and anyplace you make a basecamp, it is almost impossible to stretch out after you reached certain point. I really look forward to see some other types of environments in bigger size.2. Max stamina or stamina itself is way too limited so you can't really have any fun. Yes, it meant to be a realistic game but it's rediculously SHORT as if the Z-virus in game clogged half lung of every characters in this game.3. The resources are way too short... also even when you found a bag of something, the actual contents in the bag is almost nothing. Hand full stuffs when you break the bag. You are forced to keep on scavenging resources all the time makes you worried about them even when you are on a mission and never have a fun of hitting a jackpot. NEVER.4. No story what so ever. Well, some of you may say the entire purpose of this game is only surviving... I know that but it could've been something more, something even better than TLOU.. who knows?5. Lack of vehicles, vehicle space for bags... and they are... made of soft cheese cakes. pretty sure.6. Scavenging noise = fire arm noise... really? of is that also part of the ""reallity"" part?7. lack of ammo.. really...awww... I thought the game takes place in US but the amount of ammo makes me feel like I'm in somewhere else.. it's f**** zombie game! I want to enjoy shooting at zombies...8. The size of inventory is too small... and only 2 kinds of bags???? R U ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me??? Well, I'm not even expecting some kind of... magic pockets but even Farcry you can carry more stuffs. And to some of you saying ""oh, you need to learn using more than one character"" ♥♥♥♥, listen, can you even play them when they all fuc*** dying on beds all the time???9. Overall contents are too small... after playing about 5 hours, there are pretty much nothing more to do... really. all just... repeating over and over and over again...10. Even though they have a character level systems and stuff but players can't really enjoy.... why? you will never really get much reward of making your character stronger.. just... too small...11. If you want to spend your time and money, well I would recommend you to play some other cool, fun games not like player-torturing Japanese ♥♥♥♥ (Japanese game makers love to torture players with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level systems and ♥♥♥♥ and they think player's love them too, so I said that) like this one.Last - I would probably think about buying later version of this game in the future BUT I will check out reviews, videos, player articles very carefully.

												Excellent and fun game. Unfortunately it's too short, but I enjoy games that go on forever. You'll have lots of fun collecting junk if that's fun to you, trying different weapons, and driving some fun vehicles. (Though not too many choices). It's open world (on a small map) so you can go where you want to with some urgency to submissions. Explosives and exploding environmental objects are fun too. Very few glitches and lots of hours to mess around with, esp if you buy the add on games.			"

												extremly good singleplayer (!) game. Survival-aspects are very relevant. Also: buy with Breakdown. SoD Storyline is pretty short.

												Spent quite a long time before giving up on this game. It had a lot of potential but I found it ultimately frustrating. Not hundred per cent stable, sometimes crashing mid mission . Apart from the early stages the game lacks continuity and development. Good setting good characters but overall clumsy and unforgiving. I was never confident that stuff done in one session was being carried on to the next.			"

												So lets start off with saying whats good about this game first. The gameplay is okay not to bad and not perfect but enjoyable. the graphics are nice and the driving is easy with a nice selection of cars.Now thats the good stuff out the way lets start with the bad stuff. The story doesnt really make sense as there is no real story as far as i can tell since you just get chucked in with endless missions. You end up doing the same mission pretty much all the time and gets kinda boring. The game feels broken as in some missions where there should be a cutscene there isnt, for expample someone dies who is important and theres no care about it at all its just like oh she died, how are you. Another thing is when the person is talking they always say the same thing like ""yeah whatever"" and other stuff and it just feels plain lazy.One last thing the zombies in this game just feels like its been ripped out of left for dead and retextured and dumped into the game, really dissapointed in this.

 Note: I deleted my initial popular review (March 30, 2014), in order re-write it and make sure the EDITED one (this one) re-appears again in the review section page.  Original Review (Short Version)  If you are obsessed with open-world zombie survival horror games, 'State of Decay' will give you an erection.  New Review based on the fiasco with the Year-One Edition I've become sick with the gaming industry, and this is perhaps one of the games that I'd never expect would go 'stealing' mode for a couple of extra bucks from people who ALREADY own their game.With their new edition of the game, they've added a 1080p quality with an extra car  (no fix for the ridiculous car physics though)  and an air-drop mission that sounds like a simple  grab-and-return-the supplies-home  feature and ask for customers who already own the original game and both DLC's to pay an extra 20 euro (with the -33% discount included) for this 'upgrade'. An 'upgrade' that  SHOULD BE FREE for owners  of the game, as is the case with all games out there (and especially the Indie titles). THIS IS A PATCH at best. It should be a PATCH. NOT A FREAKIN' FULL PRICE RE-RELEASE OF THE GAME.Moreover, the endless bugs of the original game were left unfixed, to be partly fixed in this new version, completely abandoning the ORIGINAL version... Funny enough, new bugs emerged so although some were fixed, the game STILL remains as buggy as it was, if not even more... Microsoft Studios  and  Undead Labs  are literally asking customers: ""You want some of  the bugs we abandoned fixing in the original game fixed? Pay 20 euro for them!""My answer to that is clear:  'NO'. I've paid around 30 euro for the base game along with the two DLCs. I am not paying an extra 20 euro for a 'remake'. And an  unecessary remake, to be precise, since the game was released no more than 1,5 years ago. Certainly, I'd understand such a visual upgrade if the game was a 2000's title, but doing so for a game released in 2013 is preposterous - clearly a quick cash-grab from the owners of the original game if you ask me. Why  Microsoft Studios ? Why?To me, unless owners of the game with BOTH DLC's have AT LEAST a -70% discount for this minor upgrade of the game, there is no way I am recommending this, and I'd advise you withhold purchasing  (especially if you already own the game)  because by supporting such moves from developers will only make things worst for  us  gamers... Just imagine every title, every game out there, after one year of the initial release, coming up with a hypothetical 'remastered' version of the game with slightly better visual quality and an extra 'car' or 'mission' that should be there in the first place and asking for almost the full price of the game AGAIN, from people who ALREADY own the full game. And above all, you are FORCED to buy it since the company no longer cares about the original (older) version, but rather ""focuses"" on the new one. Trust me, that would be a disaster... People are upset and this shows from the huge drop on the game's ratings (from 94% positive to 89% positive in two days), and the numbers keep dropping... Honestly, it pains me, because I used to like State of Decay. Unfortunately it's yet another game that fell in the pitfall of 'greed'.EDIT: As it turns out, YOSE is out and it is a complete disaster. People claim that they can barely tell the visual quality difference between the ""new"" and the ""old"" version and the new 'additions' are MODS at best and some of them already exist on the NEXUS!! I do NOT recommend it any longer   "

Ride around doing meaningless missions from one side of the map the the other. Didnt get any choices in my 9h of play apart from simple location changes, base building and characters are all basic and flat. No real impact anywhere.If you have nothing else to do and have played all the other zombi games maybe try but i am dissappointed, this was promising to be much better.If you are an Epoch player, this might be more amusing as a joke than a game.

												Let me just say this. I really wanted to enjoy this game. But after hours of playing it, I just can't.When it was announced, I was really hyped up and wanted to play it so bad. But once it got released and then I played it for hours, I was filled with nothing but boredom and disappointment.I'll start with the positives since good reviewers should always start with the good and then the bad. There's a lot of fun to be had here. The intense feeling of being chased by zombie hordes, finding supplies to keep yourself alive and fighting zombies. All whilst leveling yourself up so you can take on the hardest of things.Not only that, but there's quests that you get to do as well and some of these quests can repeat themselves too. So you're never short on never having anything to do except just running around.Unfortunately, here's where the bad comes in.The game plays like I'm playing a game on Facebook. If you had a stash of 35 food and then you quit the game to go do something else. Guess what? Once you come back to the game, you find out that your stash of food is only 10 and you'll have to spend all your hard work to go get some more. It ticks me off just to see a game that can play all by itself and then I come back to it, only to find that I'm doing worse than before once I come back on to play it. So it's either play this game after you get done with anything else or just stop playing it forever. Hey Undead Labs. This is Steam. Not freaking Facebook.Also, this is just personal opinion, but I hate the special infected in this. I encountered a big muscular zombie and then once I got too close to him, he grabbed my survivor with his huge hand and ripped him in two. This is an instant kill as well and it doesn't matter if you have full or near full health. I wouldn't have a problem with this if they would only appear AFTER I got a bunch of stuff and survivors. But they seem to appear too early in the game and it's just flat out unfair to the player in my eyes.This game can be unfair at times as well. For example, you'll be in a house with someone and you're trying to fight a few zombies that are attacking you. You are doing so great and you managed to beat them all. But then another zombie comes in and you're already out of stamina like you got freaking asthma. Hence, you can't fight as well if you don't have the stamina in order to swing a weapon. But the stamina drains like you're swinging a freaking sledgehammer when you're not even using one and it regenerates so slow as well if you don't level it up early in the game. The difficulty in this game can either be flat out frustratingly annoying or just total cheapness. Even so, they even promised and announced multiplayer on certain websites on this game too. But boy we're we disappointed when this game got released. This is another big issue to me. I hate developers who don't bring something they promise to their games. Undead Labs, if you needed more time to implement multiplayer into your games, I wouldn't mind. Just re-schedule the release date. I'm a patient man. But no, instead they decided to scrap the idea and just release the game anyway.Listen Undead Labs, you got a good game here. But unless you bring out a good game that doesn't play like a Facebook game, has challenge but, not at the very beginning and has something that you promised like multiplayer, I can't guarentee you're going to succeed as a video game making company. I'm talking to you as a gamer that knows what's best for the video gaming industry.Thank you and good bye. But please don't let this review take you away from buying this game. If you can handle this game playing it by itself when you're not playing it and if you don't mind it being singleplayer, go ahead at buy this. But I recommend buying it when it's on sale like it is now.			"

												State of Decay is one of the best zombie related games I've played. It has a strong focus on the survival aspect of the zombie apocalypse, but also includes plenty of action. I actually felt like I was part of the Walking Dead TV show.You are in charge of a group of survivors, although you don't play as one specific character. When you find and rescue people, they will often join your community, eventually becoming your friend. You can take direct control of any friendly character at any time. This is essentially a ""lives"" system, because if you die, that character is permanently dead, but you can continue playing as someone else. Characters also become tired after performing a few missions, so you need to switch control to a fresh character while the other one rests.Each survivor can endure a lot of damage. I only lost two people to zombie attacks, and only one of those was when I was in direct control. As long as you're sensible with the number of zombies you take on, and keep your inventory well stocked with weapons, ammo and health, the difficulty is reasonable.Combat is quite basic. You can use melee or guns, and there are different types of both, but they don't really feel different to use. Gunshots will draw more zombies from the surrounding area, so you only use them as a last resort. Melee is simply a case of bashing zombies till they fall over, then using a finishing move to destroy the head. There are some special zombies, very similar to Left 4 Dead's hunter and tank, plus Killing Floor's bloat and siren, but only the tank is difficult to kill, due to its high health.As you fight zombies, your melee and gun skills will automatically level up giving you passive buffs, which means its best to focus on playing as a couple of survivors, and getting them levelled up high. But if you lose a high ranked character and have to start again with a newbie, its not as punishing as, for example, Xcom.You also need to manage your community's home base. You start in a church, but have the option to relocate to one of several larger sites. You can upgrade the sleeping area, kitchen, storage, workshop and more, to support a growing population.You then have to scavenge houses and other buildings in the large open world, for supplies such as food, medicine, ammo, fuel, weapons and construction materials. The larger your community, the more supplies you need. You can carry resources back to base yourself, summon friendlies to assist, or set up outposts, which gives you ownership of the building and its contents. Fortunately there are plenty of cars available to help you travel around the map quickly. They're also very useful for running over zombie hordes.There are plenty of missions involving interactions with other groups of survivors. The story is pretty good, although nothing you haven't seen before in the zombie genre. Dialogue is well written and fully voice acted. I finished in just under 12 hours, which is pretty good value for money. Controls work great with mouse and keyboard, and most commands are fully rebindable. You can save at any time but only have one save file per game, so you can't reload to undo a death.The main reason I waited until now to play was because every time I checked the forum there were lots of bug complaints. It would appear that most of the major problems have been patched now, because my experience was very stable. I didn't crash at all, and although some aspects are a little rough around the edges, there was nothing that spoiled my enjoyment. I didn't have any framerate issues on high settings but I did get the occasional brief stutter while driving, which I assume was loading in the next area. The most common problem I had was I sometimes saw zombies and NPCs clipping through a building's door texture when the door is open. But I can forgive that because the rest of the game is fantastic.I very strongly recommend State of Decay, and a full price purchase is absolutely worth it.			"

												State of Decay is the stand-out game of the Summer Sale so far.  It is an open world zombie game that does a lot of things right. In each expansion you control a community who is trying to survive the zombie apocalypse.  You are collecting supplies, upgrading your home, and trying to stay alive.  You control one character at a time but can switch freely between the other members of your community.  Easily worth the price of the Steam Sale.  The expansions are stand-alone scenarios so if you are wary about buying the game then you can just start with the base.  The only negative points I'd give it are for technical issues.  I was crashing semi-frequently but I was able to sort the issues out and hasn't happened much since.			"

												Great zombie survival game. I love how you can grow your survivor community and fortify your areas. When I first bought this game I played it non-stop through the story and then bought the expansion and have since kind of stopped playing as much. As fun as it is, it gets repititious after awhile and you begin to feel the shallowness of the characters. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but I think it would be nice if the developer would add more of a backstory on the characters, more events and missions, and more safehouses/upgrade/fortification options as that is the best part of the game in my opinion.I kind of burnt myself out on this game for a bit but then started watching AMC's The Walking Dead and got back in the mood for it. It's a good simple game that you can pick up where you left off and play off and on as you wish.All in all I think SoD is worth $20. I just hope to see better expansions in the future. The current expansion, SoD- Breakdown, is just more of the same original game. Same locations, safehouses and zombies. Not worth the money.			"

												What it does is very interesting and well done.  I can't help but feel though that it's almost like a facebook game where it keeps drawing you back with bonuses you recieve over time.  It's pretty addicting, however, and allows for quite a bit of micromanagment in your home base which is where you'll spend most of your later hours in the game.  It's a sandbox zombie survival that delivers what it promises and keeps you coming back for at least 15 hours if not more.  Not for everyone but quite a bit of fun when you get into it.			"

												Surival horror with ressource gathering, base building and exploration - thats pretty much describe this game.There's some pretty cool features and new mechanics in this game, like sending people out to scavenge for materials, food or meds; improving your home base (or even set it up a new place); different traits in characters witch you can change between (provided that you have helped them so much that they trust you); trading and helping out other groups of survivors; zombies reactiong to sounds like gunshot, cars and even the noise you make going through a closet looking for items; and more.. There are clearly some new ideas here (for the most obvious, just never really done before in zombiegames) and for the most they are conducted good, so you really get the feeling that your choices influences the game. In the basebuilding there are some explanations to what impact the improvements will have to the game, but for most parts  you really just take a chance and hope for the best. There are some serious issues though, for the most related to basic controls, like viewpoint being a totally messed up in close quarters (and some times even in open spaces too..), small hills being impossible to climb some times, a very (to me at least) confusing menu and inventory that doesnt make much sense + a inventory system that doesnt allow you to do anything else but destroy items to make space if your bag is filled (not very locigal in a game, where ressource gathering are a constant theme!) but at the same time allowing you to put down and pick up your WHOLE bag (???)You get the feeling that most of the issues are due to a rush job, a month or 2 more polishing would definately had payed of.. It allso seems pretty strange to put out the first DLC only a few days after release, without attending to the technical problems but I gues thats just due to the business model of gamecompanies today (greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!)What it all comes down to though is gameplay and the game clearly delivers here. Its fun and engaging and even though many missions are the same thing over and over, just in new places, it never gets to be a dealbreaker. As said, some good new ideas and features that helps the gameplay in a positive way. Definately worth its price in entertainment.7/10(reviewed after 9½ hours gametime) "

												This is the best zombie apocalypse game I could ever dream of. I am f*cking serious. Seems like developers took all the best from lots of games and made an ultimate zombie survival sandbox. This game reminds me so much of GTA, Left 4 Dead, The Walking Dead, Dead Rising and even the old Jagged Alliance (probably because of team management and it's color spectrum lol)- open world (area is not that big, but you can enter and scavenge any place or building you want);- tons of weapons ranged from melee (from baseball bats and shovels to wakizashi and braid) to heavy guns and grenade launchers etc.;- tons of different combat skills and perks, which really bring diversity into a simple fight;- random character generation (apart from plot characters);- character leveling;- plot missions which lead you through the game but are not annoying and you can play them whenever you want (I've played nearly 30 hours until I decided to get through the story);- base and team management, building of different facilities for survivors, upgrading them;- great soundtrack (COUNTRY ♥♥♥♥ YEAH) and ambient which makes already thick atmosphere even stronger;And of course, dat feel when you slam passing by zombies with your car's side door – OMG 10 out of 10 GOTYP.S. I didn’t expect this game to be so cool when I first heard of it. Some say (especially the ones who haven’t played it or played on youtube) that it is too casual, arcade and console-like, but it’s not true. This game has great atmosphere which overcomes everything. Seriously, just give it a try. Yes, graphics is not that good, but it is not that important. Plus, the developers have fixed lots of bugs and problems with controls, thank God I didn’t play this game during the early access, it would kill the first impression for sure.P.P.S. This game does not need multiplayer or co-op of any kind. It would kill all the atmosphere.			"

												A decent play, there are aspects of play that make this game fun that being said the main game and its story is garbage (and you end up paying $20 to play this segment) with the new expac being $7 and promising sandbox play I am left wanting. Why should I pay another $7 for functions of the game that were promised pre release, especially when you did such a ""wonderful"" job with the vanilla version? My advice for the producer (or any up and coming producer) please just charge up front  for the game in its totality, don't nickel and dime players for features that are essential for making the game more than a post-apocalyptic grocery run.I cant in good faith give this game a good rating despite the fact it has potential, because of the way they structured their vanilla around the release of the ""breakdown"" expac. The producer's willingness to put forth a measly 12 hours of ""fetch me this"" into the vanilla version with no sandbox world is really the epitome of modern gaming, for the love of all that is holy please stop selling me functionality separate from my bloody game!

												One word. Actual survival. This isn't a standard ""Left for dead"" or even ""Dead Island."" you have to upkeep your home base as well as expanding. You can take over other areas. You have to keep your team's morale up. It actually has guns that you can get ammo for! Dead Island was a great game except the fact that there was no ammo. You found guns but never wanted to use them because all you have is 6 shots in the entire game. This game you have to manage resources as well. I have not played ""Dying Light"" because my computer cannot run it but this game beats all of other zombie survival games out there. I 500% recommend this. It is a great value for the price.			"

												State of Decay is a very good solo zombie-survival simulation. You spend your time building a community of survivors, managing resources, fortifying your hide-out and dealing with the groups interpersonal conflicts. Though it plays more akin to Dead Rising than DayZ the main draw of this game is exploring an immersive open-world, having to trek further and further each day to gather resources, deciding whether to drop your plans at a moments notice because someone on your radio is in trouble. The plot is bare-bones, you make your own emergent stories as you move around the world, having good and bad days, developing an XCom-like attachment to your characters because of the games permadeath system. Get past it's jankier elements in the early-game then it is a compelling experience and a lot of fun. Well worth a try.			"

												Unlike The Walking Dead, State of Decay’s title doesn’t refer to the zombies or the humans, but refers instead to how your leaderships skills fare against an onslaught of problems. As the executive director of survival resources, morale, zombie extermination, and people’s lives, a lot of weight is placed on your shoulders. Since State of Decay is an open-world persistent simulation that continues when you exit the game, you may find it threatening your real-world responsibilities.My adoration for State of Decay‘s open-world leadership simulation contrasts with my dislike for how much it tempts me away from real responsibilities. But it also draws out why I like leadership simulations where survival is on the line: I love people and want to help them however I can. This also reminds me that if I want to truly be a great leader, I have to be sure to keep my priorities where they truly matter most: on my wife, my work, and my real-world friendships.Read More: http://gamechurch.com/state-of-decay-the-cost-of-caring-leadership/ "

												What it does is very interesting and well done.  I can't help but feel though that it's almost like a facebook game where it keeps drawing you back with bonuses you recieve over time.  It's pretty addicting, however, and allows for quite a bit of micromanagment in your home base which is where you'll spend most of your later hours in the game.  It's a sandbox zombie survival that delivers what it promises and keeps you coming back for at least 15 hours if not more.  Not for everyone but quite a bit of fun when you get into it.			"

												For a zombie post-apocalyptic game this rates very high on my list, because it touches base on strategic survival rather than running-and-gunning. Supplies must be used wisely and overuse of a single character is costly. The game forces you to balance out decisions in order to survive. This game is one of the better single-player zombies games without a doubt.			"

												It has a lot of the good parts of DayZ without the difficulty of having to deal with other players. The way you manage your safe-house is well done, not too much micro. I've heard it compared to a single-player version of Left4Dead but that's not accurate at all. The map is extensive and the game is more about exploring and hoarding than it is about story. Speaking of story, just when it was getting a little bit tedious... the game ended. A little bit anti-climatic and predictable, but still good.The price was worth it at 20.			"

												This game may not be the prettiest or the most polished and is full of glitches but if you look past that it is a real gem. I had so much fun with State of Decay, more than I thought I would. Looking past the imperfections is easy. When there is a great experience just below the surface. The world is large and open and I have never felt the sense of freedom this game offers before. The very fact that you don’t have to be the same character or build the same way every time you play is very refreshing.The developer basically gave you a sandbox well worth exploring and told you to do just that. Get this game and you will not be disappointed. The story is not too long but even so just for the emersion of trying to keep your little community alive and not eaten this game is well worth your time and money. Have fun ^_^			"

												I have played a LOT of this game, it has some very addicting game play features. It is an indie game and was first released on the Xbox 360 as an arcade game, which means they had limited size constraints in building the game. This, however, did not stop them from making a very fun zombie apocalypse game where the goal is keeping your group together and alive. This is NOT a 'go kill zombie, atta boy' game, there is so much more to it than that.1. You do not play as one character. Everybody whom you have 'friended' in your base, you can play. 2. If your character dies, you automatically switch to another friend in your base and continue play.3. You can level up your active character by doing things that would logically enhance those abilities. Run a lot to build up your stamina. Battle zombies to gain combat skills. Shoot zombies to gain firing skills. Ect...4. There are a lot of guns to choose from in the game, over 100. There are a lot of melee weapons, but not quite the plethoria as the guns.5. Noise. Keep it quiet if you don't want zombies breathing down your neck. Feeling good about yourself, make some noise and take out the incoming zombies!6. Vehicles, take them for a spin. Unlike other games like FarCry, where the vehicles seem to have one center wheel, the vehicles in this game act just like real vehicles should, with 4 tires on the ground. It has been noted, however, that you sometimes get launched into space, or hit invisible obstacles. I only saw this when I had a slow computer, so if thats you, be prepared for it. You can also stash loot in the trunks for your scavanging pleasure! I especially like driving by zombies and take them out with the car door! Ha ha!7. The map is static, but the containers that might have loot, and the loot itself is random, every time you play the game. Its a good sized map. And you can enter 96% of the buildings on the map looking for loot to bring back to base.8. You can bring one follower along with you, from your base. There are other survivors out there looking for a safe place to stay, will you gain their trust enough so that they want to join you? Do those people have useful skills that you could use at your base?9. Your base. There are several locations across the map where you can setup your base. Each one has different requirements and has a different set of built in facilities, as well as open facility slots you can build on. Do you want the medical facility, or perhaps the kitchen. But then, the gym would help increase your stamina. Oh, the watchtower can be used to shoot zombies that get too close. But, a workshop could repair your weapons and your vehicles. Or a machine shop so you can build pipe bombs... So many things to choose from and you only have a limites number of spots.10. Missions? Lots of them from story missions to base moral missions, to helping other survivors in order to gain their trust. The game is frantic at times, with zombie hoards heading to your base that you have to take out before they arrive, to survivors in dire need of immediate aide!And there is so much more in this game. For the price, this game has a great deal going for it and will keep you busy for a long time. Its also very enjoyable and I think anyone who likes an open world, some base building features along with exploration and scavenging will also enjoy this game. "

												This game is definately one of the best zombie-based survival games I've played. Along with your standard goal of not dying, Stated of Decay goes further by implementing emotion and character attachment. Two of the main protagonists are brother and sister, and if you let something happen to either one of them, the other will chew your ♥♥♥ up and generally just make you feel like a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I also love the immersion in this game (though currently it still needs some polishing). Zombies here are a THREAT. Not just something that you kill help level up your character, but a huge_♥♥♥♥ing_threat. I don't think I've ever faced more than 4 zombies at once without getting some major and sometimes irrecoverable scars.Guns, the most sought-after thing in any zombie game save for the first Dead Island (where they were so weak and ammo was so scarce that they pretty much weren't worth it). In State of Decay, if you shoot as much as a .22 cal round without a suppressor, a horde of at least half a dozen zombies (read: 4 zombies gave me near-fatal wounds, your irresponsible shot will attract a minimum of 6). Ammo is also very scarce and valuable. You better make damn sure that every shot you make, silenced or not, is a headshot or at least enough to stun the zombie you shot at. Currently I haven't tried automatic guns such as the LMG and SMG (yes this game has a light machine gun), but I know for damn sure that I'm never gonna shoot anything with them without backup.Scavenging. The heart and soul of survival games. Without scavenging you have a mediocre shoot-em-up game. State of Decay makes scavenging very important with the use of random occurences where some food might go bad, a wall might crack, or someone getting critically ill. It's also sometimes dangerous to scavenge alone or in an infected area, and I can say that it's pretty damn nerve-racking when a zombie comes out of nowhere and bites the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.In State of Decay, you will have the opportunity to kill off members of your survival group. Sometimes it's a show of mercy, like if they've become infected (note: bites from zombies do not infect you), or they're so sick that they can't recover. Sometimes it's out of spite, like if the survivor facing death contaminated food supplies, or killed another survivor. And sometimes you can kill someone for generally just being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Finaly, let's talk about character skills. You can control several different characters in State of Decay, and they each level up differently according to how you play as them. You can max out general shooting and rifle skills to get them near-military level marksman training, or max out their fighting skills to let them smash every zombie head they see. You can max out their cardio (""#1: if you run out of stamina, that's it. Can't fight, can't run away, you're done."" - description of Cardio skill) to let them endure longer fights and still have the stamina to run away.Overall, State of Decay is amazing, and currently seems to be underrated.10/10 zombie heads.--Note--This game progresses even when you leave the game, so if you leave your party with low morale and supplies, when you get back ♥♥♥♥ is gonna hit the fan.--Note2--This game does not have multiplayer, and it is uncertain if the developers will eventually implement it.

												One of the best zombie survival games I've played.Managing the resources at your base, scavenging for those resources, vehicles.The things I don't like about it however is I wish there an easier way to ramp the difficulty up earlier on.(No difficulty options in Vanilla, on Breakdown you need to unlock difficulty levels by completing them.)I also wish there were more map selections and/or random maps.The default map is a decent size though, so i'm not overly picky about it, but it can get old after awhile.And also there's no multiplayer, though I've heard it might be added, that would definitely be a huge plus.Despite those negatives, anyone interesting in a good zombie survival game should definitely pick it up;I hesitated due to negative reviews and that was a big mistake, I'm very happy I picked it up.

												Just finished the campaign and i love this game, it adds very interesting features found in few zombie games, like building an actual base and surviving instead of shooting your way through hondreds of zombies with big guns. After a while it gets weary though and with other or even randomized maps(which would be awesome) this would end up in my top ten but unfortunately the map is set and building and upgrading your base which sometimes takes a ridiculous amount of real time and especially the scavenging gets weary after a while. Luckily the dlc are a good bargain for their money add that extra fun to keep you playing.The bad pc optimization which forces me to play on low settings with a very good rig, the awful campaign which takes way too little time and isn't worked out and the sad fact that there is sadly no random gen which makes replay kinda dull since you end up in the same places ruin the fun a bit.7/10 definitely worth to buy,you get what you pay for and Good and cheap dlc.

												State of Decay is probably on of the best Zombie simulators i have ever played.You have to manage a group of survivors, by scavenging houses, send them on missions and build your base to an extent where you do not have to worry about your survivors dying.The combat is very simple and satisfying when you get kills, not killed.Once a survivor is dead, they are DEAD, the game will then put you in control of another survivor.You have to watch carefully at your missions, before it is too late to save someone, get supplies or complete a mission.Alot of fun little things in this game which will leave you addicted for quite some hours.

												State of Decay is a very good solo zombie-survival simulation. You spend your time building a community of survivors, managing resources, fortifying your hide-out and dealing with the groups interpersonal conflicts. Though it plays more akin to Dead Rising than DayZ the main draw of this game is exploring an immersive open-world, having to trek further and further each day to gather resources, deciding whether to drop your plans at a moments notice because someone on your radio is in trouble. The plot is bare-bones, you make your own emergent stories as you move around the world, having good and bad days, developing an XCom-like attachment to your characters because of the games permadeath system. Get past it's jankier elements in the early-game then it is a compelling experience and a lot of fun. Well worth a try.			"

												With over 900 hours logged on this game, I can honestly say that State of Decay, and it's add-ons, is one of my all-time favorite games.  My wife, who isa casual gamer, kind of fell in love with this game, too.  From the brutal, Savini-esque gore, to the to the heart-breaking decisions of having to put a community member down, this zombie game has just about everything.  A character can climb into a vehicle and plow through a horde of zombies (which will ultimately destroy your vehicle), toss a pipe bomb over the shoulder into a window and clear out a zombie infestation, build structures in your base to aid your community, gather resources, call in artillery fire...for a game that only encompasses about 12 square miles, it is quite epic.  Add on the Breakdown DLC for some sandbox play with ever escalating difficulty levels and loads of heroes to unlock and you've got a LOT of fun.  If you're lucky enough to have the Lifeline DLC, you'll be introduced to a whole new set of characters, with new mission types, and a larger city that isn't Trumball Valley.Pros: Variety of zombie typesUseable vehiclesLarge assortment of melee and ranged weaponsRPG-style elements like leveling up skills, large areas to explore, character backgrounds to discoverExcellent graphics, very usefull 3rd person POVWell-made, moody soundtrack and eerie sound effects, especially in 5.1 surroundModableGamepad friendly (I recommend X-Box 36 controller)Cons:Missions can become repetitive, especially in sandbox (Breakdown) modeSteep system requirements for the highest quality settingsDialog can become monotonous, could use more custom linesWould benefit greatly from co-op, especially local co-op, modeOverall, I highly recommend this game, 4.5/5			"

												This is the best zombie apocalypse game I could ever dream of. I am f*cking serious. Seems like developers took all the best from lots of games and made an ultimate zombie survival sandbox. This game reminds me so much of GTA, Left 4 Dead, The Walking Dead, Dead Rising and even the old Jagged Alliance (probably because of team management and it's color spectrum lol)- open world (area is not that big, but you can enter and scavenge any place or building you want);- tons of weapons ranged from melee (from baseball bats and shovels to wakizashi and braid) to heavy guns and grenade launchers etc.;- tons of different combat skills and perks, which really bring diversity into a simple fight;- random character generation (apart from plot characters);- character leveling;- plot missions which lead you through the game but are not annoying and you can play them whenever you want (I've played nearly 30 hours until I decided to get through the story);- base and team management, building of different facilities for survivors, upgrading them;- great soundtrack (COUNTRY ♥♥♥♥ YEAH) and ambient which makes already thick atmosphere even stronger;And of course, dat feel when you slam passing by zombies with your car's side door – OMG 10 out of 10 GOTYP.S. I didn’t expect this game to be so cool when I first heard of it. Some say (especially the ones who haven’t played it or played on youtube) that it is too casual, arcade and console-like, but it’s not true. This game has great atmosphere which overcomes everything. Seriously, just give it a try. Yes, graphics is not that good, but it is not that important. Plus, the developers have fixed lots of bugs and problems with controls, thank God I didn’t play this game during the early access, it would kill the first impression for sure.P.P.S. This game does not need multiplayer or co-op of any kind. It would kill all the atmosphere.			"

												Before I brought this game I looked at the screenshots which reminds me of WarZ :S But after looking at the reviews it seems the game is worth the money :) I brought the complete game with all the DLC for 10 bucks and I wasn't dissapointed! It was a steal for this price. I was blown away from the Survivor/Zombie AI and all the things you can do in State of Decay which is really unique and refreshing. The survival aspect is amazing! You can get tired, sick and infected! You have to shoot your buddy in the head if he is infected...duh! cruel but realistic lol :S Ammo, materials, food, medicine and other resources are necessary for survival. You can create outpost in abandoned buildings against zombie hordes and choose your own base which is limited but there are quite a few spots that can be used as base and upgrade it with more buildings. You can let other npc survivors join your base if you earned enough trust. The combat system is solid and fun, depending on the characters you can choose different skills and try new things out so you don't really get bored if you are choosing other survivors to play. The world is big and looks quite good. Some cars lying around in the world are driveable. It feels great! A little like GTA if you drive around :D What can I say more. If you want to play an open world without storyline buy the dlc breakdown which is really fun and challenging. The are almost no bugs in the game and the archivements aren't broken which is good! Buy this game if you like survival! Thx for reading :3			"

												First thing about playing State of Decay. DON'T TAKE A LENGTHY BREAK FROM THIS GAME! No. Just don't do it. I'll bring out the spray bottle of water. This game will use resources on each actual day. Not only does this game only have a set amount of resources each playthrough, but your enclave will fraggin' perish if you don't gather them resources after a few days. Only if you have the truck depot or fairgrounds will you be able to gather enough resources for them to last more then a week. And that's if they don't die due to your walls turning to crap.With that out of the way, this is a pretty good zombie sim. You can do distractions, there are special types, the guns feel great, and the artwork is good if it's your style. There is a decent amount of drama, not enough to drown in, and plenty of things to do. As long as, you know, don't run out of resources in your sandbox. That cat poop is useful sometimes.			"

The game does tend to pester you with a lot of missions you dont really care about at once, and there is no real upgrades for your home encampments ( I raided a warehouse and invited one group of survivors and i was able to move to the best Base available an Snyder Trucking) It is extremely fun and definitely an improvement over a lot of the zombie games ive been playing. If you want one thats more authentic survival experience, I would try Project Zomboid, although it is a completely different style of game.9/10			"

												Nowadays, you haven't seen alot of unique zombie simulation games... these are one of them (including the upcoming Dying Light video game) the fact that it combines all of the survivor needs, community support, and trading shows you a different survivor perspective that other zombies games before did not give you. It is also changes that perspective by not only making one protagonist, but if you were to befriend a survivor enough, you could control them as well. So it has the same aspects of L4D but your working with not just your group, but with the world and other survivors as well...           In my opinion this is one of the best games in the zombie genre i've ever played			"

												Before I brought this game I looked at the screenshots which reminds me of WarZ :S But after looking at the reviews it seems the game is worth the money :) I brought the complete game with all the DLC for 10 bucks and I wasn't dissapointed! It was a steal for this price. I was blown away from the Survivor/Zombie AI and all the things you can do in State of Decay which is really unique and refreshing. The survival aspect is amazing! You can get tired, sick and infected! You have to shoot your buddy in the head if he is infected...duh! cruel but realistic lol :S Ammo, materials, food, medicine and other resources are necessary for survival. You can create outpost in abandoned buildings against zombie hordes and choose your own base which is limited but there are quite a few spots that can be used as base and upgrade it with more buildings. You can let other npc survivors join your base if you earned enough trust. The combat system is solid and fun, depending on the characters you can choose different skills and try new things out so you don't really get bored if you are choosing other survivors to play. The world is big and looks quite good. Some cars lying around in the world are driveable. It feels great! A little like GTA if you drive around :D What can I say more. If you want to play an open world without storyline buy the dlc breakdown which is really fun and challenging. The are almost no bugs in the game and the archivements aren't broken which is good! Buy this game if you like survival! Thx for reading :3			"

												Probably one of the best Zombie games put out in the last few years.The best way to describe this really is It's San Andreas with zombies, an easy, lesser focus on maintaing your base/resource management and some decent writing. Just don't expect TellTale's The Walking Dead here, as while it's not a game with a tongue in cheek tone, it's not exactly the most serious game in town. Think Dead Island at face value but a tad more serious. It's a bit of a rough game, it's not exactly the prettiest looking, the controls may feel a little wonky at first, but if you're up for a game about scavenging through areas infested with zombies, dealing with problems within your group, and every once and a while having some emergent moments like watching in horror as a runner gets litterally torn in half captain rhodes day of the dead style in the middle of the street after getting surrounded and downed by a horde. The melee combat is a bit like a stripped down superpower-less Arkham Asylum that makes fighting hordes feel just as difficult and tiring as it reasonably should. While guns are by nature as much of a liability as they are a reward, the gunplay's fine, it's just that the crosshair is a bit too large to be reliable on higher resolutions for which i'd REALLY reccomend the Widescreen Crosshair Fix mod found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/stateofdecay/mods/15/? . Cars are similarily very useful and a bit of a risk, although they are the best way to get around the map, the game does throw some roadblocks every once and a while on roads to make driving a bit more difficult, although you can use mods to remove those if they annoy you.There are a few mechanics that might ""tick you off"" a bit if you have seething hatred for them and so I'll list them below:-Character Permadeath, if a character dies/Goes down three times, they're dead. No getting them back. Even story relevant characters can die but it will never make the game unbeatable.-A persistent World aspect a bit like Animal Crossing although don't worry, you won't not play for a week to find everything in shambles. The longer you're not playing, the slower time moves and if I recall it caps at 3 hours. -A level of repetition very late into the game, and light annoyance at times. I've seen the game be criticized for this, but at some point parts of the tasks might start to feel a bit repetitive, but this is mostly stuff related to scavenging necessary items and helping characters through emotional states. The annoyance part I mentioned relates to stuff like having to deal with stuff rather constantly, there will very rarely be a moment that something won't need to be done for someone or around the safehouse. Someone might need saving(Outposts reduce the chances of this happening, increasing the area zombies won't spawn in.), someone might need help with their anxiety (Which always results in you killing zombies with them. It's a bit lazy and repetitive but with the amount of ♥♥♥♥ in this game already I can forgive it.), there's story missions to do all while you're trying to keep the safehouse running, everyone healthy and also trying to make towards your next goal and trying not to screw yourself further down the line.The story itself is nothing special really, but it is written competently and while not every character feels like more than just an NPC, it does it's job fleshing most of them out. I can't think of a main character I could really call ""bland and lifeless"".One last thing, but this game isn't amazingly well optimized for lower end systems. You should be fine if you have a moderate or high end rig, but if your computer lands more on the ""toaster"" end, you probably won't be able to tweak the settings too heavily to save your performance. Honstly, if something irks you about the game, look through the mods there's probably going to be something there to fix it. If you like zombie games just about at all, or what I described interests you, grab this game.			"

												First thing about playing State of Decay. DON'T TAKE A LENGTHY BREAK FROM THIS GAME! No. Just don't do it. I'll bring out the spray bottle of water. This game will use resources on each actual day. Not only does this game only have a set amount of resources each playthrough, but your enclave will fraggin' perish if you don't gather them resources after a few days. Only if you have the truck depot or fairgrounds will you be able to gather enough resources for them to last more then a week. And that's if they don't die due to your walls turning to crap.With that out of the way, this is a pretty good zombie sim. You can do distractions, there are special types, the guns feel great, and the artwork is good if it's your style. There is a decent amount of drama, not enough to drown in, and plenty of things to do. As long as, you know, don't run out of resources in your sandbox. That cat poop is useful sometimes.			"

												A decent play, there are aspects of play that make this game fun that being said the main game and its story is garbage (and you end up paying $20 to play this segment) with the new expac being $7 and promising sandbox play I am left wanting. Why should I pay another $7 for functions of the game that were promised pre release, especially when you did such a ""wonderful"" job with the vanilla version? My advice for the producer (or any up and coming producer) please just charge up front  for the game in its totality, don't nickel and dime players for features that are essential for making the game more than a post-apocalyptic grocery run.I cant in good faith give this game a good rating despite the fact it has potential, because of the way they structured their vanilla around the release of the ""breakdown"" expac. The producer's willingness to put forth a measly 12 hours of ""fetch me this"" into the vanilla version with no sandbox world is really the epitome of modern gaming, for the love of all that is holy please stop selling me functionality separate from my bloody game!

												One word. Actual survival. This isn't a standard ""Left for dead"" or even ""Dead Island."" you have to upkeep your home base as well as expanding. You can take over other areas. You have to keep your team's morale up. It actually has guns that you can get ammo for! Dead Island was a great game except the fact that there was no ammo. You found guns but never wanted to use them because all you have is 6 shots in the entire game. This game you have to manage resources as well. I have not played ""Dying Light"" because my computer cannot run it but this game beats all of other zombie survival games out there. I 500% recommend this. It is a great value for the price.			"

												This is the best zombie apocalypse game I could ever dream of. I am f*cking serious. Seems like developers took all the best from lots of games and made an ultimate zombie survival sandbox. This game reminds me so much of GTA, Left 4 Dead, The Walking Dead, Dead Rising and even the old Jagged Alliance (probably because of team management and it's color spectrum lol)- open world (area is not that big, but you can enter and scavenge any place or building you want);- tons of weapons ranged from melee (from baseball bats and shovels to wakizashi and braid) to heavy guns and grenade launchers etc.;- tons of different combat skills and perks, which really bring diversity into a simple fight;- random character generation (apart from plot characters);- character leveling;- plot missions which lead you through the game but are not annoying and you can play them whenever you want (I've played nearly 30 hours until I decided to get through the story);- base and team management, building of different facilities for survivors, upgrading them;- great soundtrack (COUNTRY ♥♥♥♥ YEAH) and ambient which makes already thick atmosphere even stronger;And of course, dat feel when you slam passing by zombies with your car's side door – OMG 10 out of 10 GOTYP.S. I didn’t expect this game to be so cool when I first heard of it. Some say (especially the ones who haven’t played it or played on youtube) that it is too casual, arcade and console-like, but it’s not true. This game has great atmosphere which overcomes everything. Seriously, just give it a try. Yes, graphics is not that good, but it is not that important. Plus, the developers have fixed lots of bugs and problems with controls, thank God I didn’t play this game during the early access, it would kill the first impression for sure.P.P.S. This game does not need multiplayer or co-op of any kind. It would kill all the atmosphere.			"

												Probably one of the best zombie type games I have played in a long time. Picture GTA with zombies but with more complex gameplay. Build up your homesite the way you want. Make sure you have a medical area and enough beds for everyone to sleep. Create a workshop for crafting and repairing. Upgrade it and find a mechanic survivor and he/she can work on cars for you. Want to turn your canned goods into a feast make sure you have a chef survivor. When this place gets too small move to another area with a bigger site to call home. Missions go on even while you are not playing.. your other survivors are always active. The current state of the beta is still very much playable. A little buggy at some points but there is no reason you cant fully enjoy it. Oh and I just found out that while you are playing as X survivor they do have the ability to die but the game goes on. You can switch and play as any of the survivors that have a high enough firend/trust relationship with you.			"

												Finally a zombie game that actually gets the point of zombies! It's not about shooting zombies - they're slow and stupid! No, it's all about the base - you know I'm right. You and your friends already know where your base is going to be if a Zombie Apocalypse happens - you've planned it in detail, worked out who you'd take, what to loot first.Yet Zombie games are all about wandering around on your own, shooting them. Until now. State of Decay places you in the midst of the Zombie Apocalypse and your onjective is primal - survive, by pulling together a team of other survivors with the skills you need, finding and modifying a base to fill your needs and keeping it supplied. To make this somewhat more difficult, you have zombies trying to eat you. You have your basic Ready Salted Zombie, slow, stupid, endlessly hungry and more than a little squishy, especially around the head. But just to make things a little more tricky, you have a cavalcade of Freaks - mutant zombies with different patterns of behaviour to normal. And they are NASTY.In any game about survival, it's important that however skilled you become, there is something that can kill you unless it screws up or you don't, and State of Decay provides these in a plethora of different ways. Zombies are attracted to noise, so fire your gun without a silencer, crash your car or have a companion who dies screaming and they will start homing in on you from miles away. The more zombies you're fighting, the louder things get and the more zombies come. The endless numbers can wear you down and as exhaustion takes its toll, the end is often close behind.If not through a steady trickle of reinforcements, you might instead fall afoul of a full-fledged zombie horde, wandering the streets looking for warm-blooded food. Your location might be surrounded by them and fall under siege and yes, you do get to board up the windows. It keeps you safe for a while, until some gigantic redneck farmchild too large to fit through the door punches it through, drags you out and tears you in two. Flee and you might be run down by a speeding deceased member of the armed forces or a SWAT team agent in full body-armour and helmet, or pounced on from out of the blue by the swift and deadly animalistic Ferals.Successfully combine your fighting and running and get clear and back to base? Don't worry, you'll probably still die from the Black Fever carried by bloated, ancient corpses in the mob - and by your companions, once they're exposed. Medicine is in short supply and medical know-how, even shorter - you either recover, or you die... and then come back for your friends.If all that's not enough, you have the armed forces up to dubious things in the area, a former judge attempting to enforce the rules of civilized society in a world where there isn't one, a redneck family one banjo short of Deliverance, a doomed love affair and a passel of mis-matched survivors steadily driving each other insane. Suicide, murder and run-aways are all risks you'll run, along with drug addiction from the amphetamines you're jamming down your throat and up your nose just to stay on your feet. Oh, and one of you might just be a serial killer. State of Decay gives a proper nod to all the tropes of the genre. I haven't found any chainsaws, which seems a grotesque oversight, but you can spot the zombies who've been chewed through the chest by a lawnmower a la ""Braindead"". Look closely enough at the magazine racks and grocery packaging and see the order to OBEY from ""They Live"", Hedge trimmers? Check. Oar? Yup. The faithful rusty pipe of Silent Hill? Aw hells, yeah. Can you knock a Zed's head off by opening the car door as you drive past it at speed? Of course!The base locations are also classics - a shipping warehouse, a posh walled manor, the local Church, a barricaded farmhouse out of town, an amusement park... all have their pros and cons and on the whole, are very well-balanced.The main weak point of the game is characterization, with little more than a few lines of insight into one motivation of some of the characters, which appears in a dialogue when the character is getting to know you. In a game where you're expected to lose a few characters and switch to playing others, a measure of emotional attachment would really add to the atmosphere. Game mechanics, however, provide a surrogate reason to get attached to characters - after all that time training their skills, the loss of a character can bring a chilling feeling of doom, especially if they were the only one in your band of survivors with an essential skill, and the moods of your fellow survivors crash drastically after any loss.While vanilla State of Decay's story mode is great fun, where it really comes into its own is with the Breakdown DLC. Breakdown sets the game to sandbox mode. You start with only your character (and Lily, your non-combatant radio operator) and build up a group and a base, accomplish certain objectives to unlock new characters or recruit other groups of survivors, play the level for as long as you wish, however you wish, then pick your six favourite characters, bundle them onto an RV with all your remaining gear and start the level again... only this time it's harder. And then you do it again, and again, and again. Your characters can become pretty experienced like this, but only if they survive. The ratio of difficulty to character skill is very well judged, so no matter how well you survived the last x levels and how godly your characters are, there is always a definite sense that you are in much more trouble this time... without it ever quite feeling impossible.The game has a few bugs, but they are mostly minor and don't crop up repeatedly, so they're not game breaking but you might lose a character or two to teleporting Freaks or your car suddenly flipping and exploding for no reason.If you're looking for a Zombie Apocalypse simulator, this is the one you've been waiting for while you plot your survival strategies in the pub with friends. Don't forget to buy Breakdown, because the story mode will have you aching for the sandbox during those moments when the plot is demanding your attention and you want to ransack just one... more.. cupboard.

												A single player game where you are a community of survivors trying not to die in a recent zombie apocalypse.Realtime Third person action/foraging game.SummaryI love the game but it has its flaws, well worth the price.The DrawPermenant character death (the gear/backpack is recoverable from a dead survivor) and you control an individual but can call out backup from home or other survivor communities in a fight or to cart the heavy cargo home (optional escort quest or let them solo the risk).Vehicles with decent variation (from sensible 4 door family wagons to 4 x 4 pickups and 2 door musclecars)suprisingly threatening zombies. The standard zombies are dangerous in packs, special infected need specific takedown methods (bullet immune, boomer, tank/charger hybrid, stalker), which can encourage you to take the risk and bring a friendly NPC with you (unless its the tank hunt mission in which case it is certain death to the somewhat sluggish NPC character)good map setup where after the campaign intro you can move to and fortify one of several base site options, the dlc provides an endless map escalation scenario (campaign map with an escape to make harder function), and a mode focussed on base defence and deep insertion rescue and harvesting missions.moving around is kept dangerous, campaign map resources are finite so each reload full of (noisy) bullets is important, damaged mele weapons need to be swapped out for fresh ones before they break so they can be repaired overnight, cars though numerous and powerful can start to become limited later on if you crash to many times or get caught offguard while mowing down a horde.the detrimentI had an issue with the storage box where it would force me ot take the 1st item selected whenever I opened the crate, gear is requisitioned by faction/fame points and taking an item out costa more than putting an item in. the bug lead to rare shortages of fame (when it pulled out a ranged weapon)The combat is functional but clunky, the special moves/passives earned by capping player traits help but the basic mele and gun combat lacks depth. distractions, firebombs, grenades, etc help but Lack of sneak options. Later on with a capable/levelled survivor I could manage a horde or 2 horde with manageable risk and careful use of a moltov, there were few opportunities where stealth felt like an option. quietly foraging a house in the middle of an infected area is one thing but every new house seemed to have 3-5 zombies you had to take out in the process, being quiet only prevents a roaming herd from getting in on the action (which tends to waste a sizeable portion of resouces to handle safely)core gameplay is similar to dead island, assassins creed (fixed world, unimaginative mele and satisfying stealth kills) and system shock 2 (there's you and an environment and the aggressive hordes out for your blood, resources are limited and you need to get stuff done)			"

												The story and gameplay was fun. I played without reading about strategy/tactics for the game before hand, and I think that helped. It was fun discovery while occasionally losing characters. Near the end of the story I did get bored with the repeat missions, only because I'd solved (for me) the most easiest way to do them.If you like scavenging, mini base building, and killing zombies you'll enjoy the game. The combat mechanics are also entertaining and (for me) just challenging enough to make it fun stress.			"

												What can I say other than the fact that this game is an absolute gem! I waited impatiently for it to come to the PC after reading about it on the 360 - so I jumped at the chance to play it as soon as it came to Early Access (a perfect use of that system too by the way, the game was perfectly playable and only needed a few months to get keyboard support going and to get it properly optimised)Anyway, the game itself is basic but extremely satisfying for the the cost and the fact that is by no means a AAA title. You start out coming back from some hiking trip, there a zombies everywhere, shizzle goes down and you get contacted by some survivors. From there you are pretty much free to raid the towns, camp sites, farms, trailer parks and just about everything else for resoucres to help maintain moral at your base (which you can move around from a church, to houses, a fairground, a warehouse...), make trades with other groups and upgrade your base and make a few helpful trinkets (molotovs, silencers and whatnot)  A minor irritation to me was everyone will speak to you as if you were the same person no matter which survivor you switch to, but it's not that much of a bother as generally you'll build up a preference for one or two of them you'll end up only using anyway! And that's the other thing - you pour time and effort into survivors, build up imaginary details about their lives (They are relativly bland in the ingame story, but give just enough to get a hint of personality in most cases) only to then slip up and be eaten alive - and it's over. Yep, it's perma-death, you're gonna have to find a new favorite because there's no going back when you loose a survivor. And that's it really, the story is decent, may be a little weak if it was AAA but it's not - it's a cheap zombie survival game that most AAA games could only wish to be (I'm looking at you Dead Island!) For the most part graphics are rather nice here on PC, the animations are pretty basic but completly forgivable. The fighting and sneaking mechanics are solid too. It make you fill in most of the story gaps and lets you create your own attachment to the characters as you wish through the threat of losing time and effort put into each person.If you essentially want the closest possible thing to a real ""The Walking Dead: The Game"" this is it!

												A single player game where you are a community of survivors trying not to die in a recent zombie apocalypse.Realtime Third person action/foraging game.SummaryI love the game but it has its flaws, well worth the price.The DrawPermenant character death (the gear/backpack is recoverable from a dead survivor) and you control an individual but can call out backup from home or other survivor communities in a fight or to cart the heavy cargo home (optional escort quest or let them solo the risk).Vehicles with decent variation (from sensible 4 door family wagons to 4 x 4 pickups and 2 door musclecars)suprisingly threatening zombies. The standard zombies are dangerous in packs, special infected need specific takedown methods (bullet immune, boomer, tank/charger hybrid, stalker), which can encourage you to take the risk and bring a friendly NPC with you (unless its the tank hunt mission in which case it is certain death to the somewhat sluggish NPC character)good map setup where after the campaign intro you can move to and fortify one of several base site options, the dlc provides an endless map escalation scenario (campaign map with an escape to make harder function), and a mode focussed on base defence and deep insertion rescue and harvesting missions.moving around is kept dangerous, campaign map resources are finite so each reload full of (noisy) bullets is important, damaged mele weapons need to be swapped out for fresh ones before they break so they can be repaired overnight, cars though numerous and powerful can start to become limited later on if you crash to many times or get caught offguard while mowing down a horde.the detrimentI had an issue with the storage box where it would force me ot take the 1st item selected whenever I opened the crate, gear is requisitioned by faction/fame points and taking an item out costa more than putting an item in. the bug lead to rare shortages of fame (when it pulled out a ranged weapon)The combat is functional but clunky, the special moves/passives earned by capping player traits help but the basic mele and gun combat lacks depth. distractions, firebombs, grenades, etc help but Lack of sneak options. Later on with a capable/levelled survivor I could manage a horde or 2 horde with manageable risk and careful use of a moltov, there were few opportunities where stealth felt like an option. quietly foraging a house in the middle of an infected area is one thing but every new house seemed to have 3-5 zombies you had to take out in the process, being quiet only prevents a roaming herd from getting in on the action (which tends to waste a sizeable portion of resouces to handle safely)core gameplay is similar to dead island, assassins creed (fixed world, unimaginative mele and satisfying stealth kills) and system shock 2 (there's you and an environment and the aggressive hordes out for your blood, resources are limited and you need to get stuff done)			"

												State of Decay: One of the greatest - if not THE greatest - single player zombie survival games.Here's a short summary:-Several NPCs, who you can eventually play as         -Various characters         -Short and sweet backstories-Zombie killing by hand, by gun, or by car. Blood everywhere.         -While driving, you can open your door as a 'door attack'. Hilarity and bloodsplatters.-Stealth kills and sneaking away from hoardes: intense-Loot all the things!-An abundance of missions in a fairly expansive world-Build-A-Base mechanic makes your survival a changeable experience-Don't die! Hardcore lives. You die, you can't come back. Only play as another character. The autosave feature enhances this, as you can't just go and select a save file. Be safe out there.The game, in my opinion, is fantastic. I've had so much fun in the short time I've played it, and it looks like I have a way to go.There are a few problems, though, but not any that ruin anything.-Small glitches in fighting, grounded zombie can suddenly stand up and attack you from behind-Some repitition (though wouldn't surviving like this be repetitive?)-Dialog repeating (can get annoying)-Very easy sometimes. The difficulty should be toggleable, as right now some 'hard'-type missions can be done easily.If you're on edge about getting this game, I nudge you towards buying it. This game is full of moments, which is something I look for. Sometimes you'll be barely sneaking back to your base through zombies, other times you'll be driving down the road in a rusted up pickup truck, opening your doors to whack a couple of hitchiking zombies. Absolutely marvelous as far as zombie games go.			"

												This game may not be the prettiest or the most polished and is full of glitches but if you look past that it is a real gem. I had so much fun with State of Decay, more than I thought I would. Looking past the imperfections is easy. When there is a great experience just below the surface. The world is large and open and I have never felt the sense of freedom this game offers before. The very fact that you don’t have to be the same character or build the same way every time you play is very refreshing.The developer basically gave you a sandbox well worth exploring and told you to do just that. Get this game and you will not be disappointed. The story is not too long but even so just for the emersion of trying to keep your little community alive and not eaten this game is well worth your time and money. Have fun ^_^			"

												State of Decay is one of my favourite Zombies games of all times. The focus on this game is not just to kill zombies, but to survive. Undead Labs have made an incredible game where it fills out every little thing that makes a great zombie game. There are Frame Rate drops and bugs, but that evens out with the perfect playstyle and great atmosphere. If you're looking for more freedom for your game, try and buy the Breakdown DLC. It is definietly worth every Zombie gamers while.			"

												For a zombie post-apocalyptic game this rates very high on my list, because it touches base on strategic survival rather than running-and-gunning. Supplies must be used wisely and overuse of a single character is costly. The game forces you to balance out decisions in order to survive. This game is one of the better single-player zombies games without a doubt.			"

												If you like bashing some undead skulls in while exploring a huge dynamic enviroment keeping yourself and other playable surivivors safe at the same time, this is one helluva ride with vehicles for travel and even home bases to fortify against the onslaught, however depsite the great fun and action, like all other games, it has some annoying bugs but nothing game-breaking and the devs can hopefully smooth out later on. The camera motion takes some getting use to though. The dlc gives it great replay ability and even supports modding, which I personally would love to see more of from those amazing modders out there! :) If your a zombie-♥♥♥ kicker or just  like to take your time with their play-through then this is one to grab, just don't let the Zees grab you alone in the dark...

												This is still one of my all time favourite zombie survivial games. Why? I hear you ask. To put it simply none of the other zombie survival games I have played quite give you the same apocalyptic atmosphere. In state of decay you really are outnumbered and are constantly surrounded by a feeling of impending doom. Survivors are thinly spread out so when you do come across them its a battle to keep everyone together. Death comes swiftly for the unwary and the zombies vary from slow to fast. They also pick up on any noise you make very easily making it truly scary if you accidently smash or hit something near a building full of the things. Rest assured they will waste no time pouring out and homing in on you. Fortunately there are vehicles dotted around which really can be life savers when you are cornered. Its not always possible to outrun a horde once you get spotted. You either have to try and find somewhere they can't reach or literally fight for your life. Also being in a vehicle just buys you time as the hordes in this game are more than capable of trashing your ride including ripping off doors! The map is fairly big with a ton of buildings to explore. Some just contain zombies while other may have useful gear, other survivors or can be turned into a base. The game does have a day / night cycle and believe me when I tell you its not a good idea to be lost in the woods just as darkness falls. You can hear the zombies but you can't see them. Terrifying stuff.Each survivor has their own story and personality. They won't sit around idle either and each day they will do something.The graphics aren't too bad but the controls and interface can be a bit of pain at times. The game does have flaws but they are minor and in no way break the game.I give this game 8/10 but only because of the minor faults. Perfection would have got it a 10.			"

Customize your survivors how you want, at least in terms of skills.

												State of Decay is really fun and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys zombie games. There are a couple of issues that hold it back from being 5/5 for me. But I still really enjoyed it.First of all, the game doesn't look great. Partly because its slightly older, but also because its lower budget. With ultra settings the screen can be oddly hard to read sometimes, like there is too much texture that is too pixelated. Overall, the game passes when it comes to visualsBase building felt lacking to me. I had a lot of fun scouting the city, bringing in new survivors, and then sending them out to scavenge buildings. The problem I had is that each base has a set number of building slots. Even the trucking co yard can only allow 4 tents outside while there is tons of extra room. Its unfortunate because I was really interested in building up a large fully upgraded base but this is actually impossible.The cars are problematic too. The handling is atrociously bad. That being said, it really raises the question why DayZ (still in Alpha at this time) still doesn't have cars.But problems aside, the game is really FUN! This isn't Dayz, this isn't 7 days to die, this isn't TellTale's the Walking Dead. Yet, it feels close to the TV show the Walking Dead. You manage a large group of survivors, switching between nearly any of them at any time. They can level up, trade gear around, etc. Its a really fun way of managing a population of people during the Apocalypse. The combat is fun too, its simple but clearly takes skill. Shooting is challenging as you really need head shots which makes guns like the AK47 somewhat useless. The shotgun based off of a Remington wins here hands down.The story isn't half bad either, although not completely developed. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this game its usually a reasonable price. Its just single player but its really enjoyable.			"

They won't sit around idle either and each day they will do something.The graphics aren't too bad but the controls and interface can be a bit of pain at times. The game does have flaws but they are minor and in no way break the game.I give this game 8/10 but only because of the minor faults. Perfection would have got it a 10.			"

												This game is brilliant. State of Decay is a game which is all about surviving a zombie apocalypse, but it has much more to it then you think. The game is a lot like the walking dead, meaning When you first start out you find a group within an hour of playing the story. Then to help out the group you can do tasks like fetching supplies, or even helping out neighbours for rewards. You can build utilities in your base, and even move bases later on in the game. If your neighbours trust you enough, they might even ask to join your group. You can also ask one of the main characters, Lilly Ritter to radio out to other survivors so they can join you, or ask if any other survivors know where food/weapons/ammo etc. can be found. Survivors will lose hope in the group's survival, because it's still a zombie apocalyse and they're dead people trying to eat you, so you can talk to them about it and get them to blow off their steam while killing zombies or boost their esteem. The weaponry in this game comes in different varieties, there's guns and melee weapons, but there's different types of them. for meleee weapons, there's blunt types, edged, and heavy weapons. For guns there's shotguns, snipers, handguns, and assault rifles (which are hard to find.)  Each survivor has their own pros and cons, for example one could be a good shot, but is an alcoholic, which would determine the survivor's stats. In the game, there are six slots for your character's stats. The four stats which every survivor will have is fighting, cardio, shooting, and wits. The other two can be for anything special about the character. For example, the first survivor you start out with, Marcus is a physical powerhouse, meaning you should have him using heavy weapons like sledgehammers, (my personal favourite combo) and he's also a born leader, making him one of the (best survivors in the game hint hint.) Each of those stats can be leveled up to a maximum of seven, but starting at four you can choose a perk that you can also level up seven times. Starting at level four of fighting/shooting, you can specialize in a type of gun or a type of melee weapon then level up that specialization up to seven as well. The fighting mechanics are pretty straightforward, if you use the rolling mechanic correctly you shouldn't actually have to use guns. There isn't that much of a story, but the game is mainly focused to surviving. The game can get kind of repetitive, but this game isn't actually in a completed state yet. This is one of my favourite games of all time, and I rate this 9/10.			"

												There are so many zombie games and so many open-world games coming out these days that it can be disorienting.  This is a rare gem among zombie games in terms of its openness, realism, and immerion.  That's not saying much, though.  Most zombie games are either empty bloodbaths or are stiflingly linear rpg or puzzle games.  In this game violence comes in short, ultra-intense bursts and can easily be deadly if you aren't playing the right character for that particular situation.  And though I really wanted a sandbox game, the linearity in this game doesn't seem quite as opressive as in other zombie games, and the level of player choice in problem-solving and resource control technique is impressive.7/10I am dissapointed by the lack of multiplayer.Then again, if the devs took these mechanics and put them into a procedural sandbox mmo, my life would end.Edit: If you don't play for a few days you lose resources.  Having these mechanics in a non-online game is ridiculous.  I don't appreciate feeling pressured to play every day.  Almost enough for me to take back my recommendation.  Buyer beware!			"

												State of Decay, and it's accompanying DLCs make up the best zombie survival game I've ever played, bar none.  Does it have it's issues?  Of course it does, just like every other game in existance.  Little things you'd change if you were in charge.  However, with easily the friendliest, most helpful and involved player community I've ever encountered, you can get a mod to make just about any tweak you can imagine.  The game has all the elements you'd expect from the genre  - thrills and chills - action - scavenging -  a bit of base building - and plenty of those moments where you're left panting with a huge grin on your face asking yourself the question, ""Holy crap!  Did I really just survive that!?!""  Breakdown is basically a replay of the main game, without most of the story, but with increasingly difficult parameters.  You'd think doing the same thing over and over again would get boring.  It doesn't.  At least not for me.  I've got many hours logged on this game so far, and I've never even tried Lifeline yet, although I've owned it for months.  I'm still just so engaged with the Breakdown challange.  You can't beat the price on this game, and after playing it for a bit, I'm sure you'll feel, just as I did, that it's easily among the best bargains I've ever received through Steam.  You honestly can't go wrong with this game.			"

												State of Decay is really fun and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys zombie games. There are a couple of issues that hold it back from being 5/5 for me. But I still really enjoyed it.First of all, the game doesn't look great. Partly because its slightly older, but also because its lower budget. With ultra settings the screen can be oddly hard to read sometimes, like there is too much texture that is too pixelated. Overall, the game passes when it comes to visualsBase building felt lacking to me. I had a lot of fun scouting the city, bringing in new survivors, and then sending them out to scavenge buildings. The problem I had is that each base has a set number of building slots. Even the trucking co yard can only allow 4 tents outside while there is tons of extra room. Its unfortunate because I was really interested in building up a large fully upgraded base but this is actually impossible.The cars are problematic too. The handling is atrociously bad. That being said, it really raises the question why DayZ (still in Alpha at this time) still doesn't have cars.But problems aside, the game is really FUN! This isn't Dayz, this isn't 7 days to die, this isn't TellTale's the Walking Dead. Yet, it feels close to the TV show the Walking Dead. You manage a large group of survivors, switching between nearly any of them at any time. They can level up, trade gear around, etc. Its a really fun way of managing a population of people during the Apocalypse. The combat is fun too, its simple but clearly takes skill. Shooting is challenging as you really need head shots which makes guns like the AK47 somewhat useless. The shotgun based off of a Remington wins here hands down.The story isn't half bad either, although not completely developed. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this game its usually a reasonable price. Its just single player but its really enjoyable.			"

												This is a fun game, especially for Zombie fans.  It starts out with a pretty unique atmosphere and interesting challenges.  The characters though are mostly not memorable except for their names.As you progress through the main story, you kill a lot of zombies.  I'm talking in the thousands!  For a small country town setting it doesnt make much sense.  Personally It got boring to me after a while.  After a little break before the final missions, I came back to it because it was interesting enough still just to see what happens in the end.I would have much rather seen a lower yet more dangerous Zombie population instead of the infinite amount literally all over the map. In the end though its fun and worth the money especially if on sale.  I recommend this for zombie fans and if you like open world games.7/10			"

												This is a very good game with zombies added to it.  You could replace the zombies with wild animals and the game would play the same. You could slap it around and turn it into Rise of the Planet of the Apes: The Game and it would still be fun. Every system working in this game works well, and comes together in a fine stew. Character growth? Natural and instinctive, no arbitrary levels and XPEnvironment? No painted on walls and doors. You see structure, you enter structure, you hope you can loot structure.Combat? Melee feels right, aiming feels right, I've never had a bad fight that made me feel the game was to blame.Structure? I've lost three characters on my most recent game and it hurt, badly.  They were different, they had unique skills, voices, clothes, it didn't feel like loosing a grunt in XCOM, it felt like loosing a real character. You know how on game of thrones, you know people are going to die but it still hurts, even though its just a story? Yeah, that's how I feel.  Except its usually my fault in tihs game.			"

												Amazing Open-World Survival type of Zombie game.It's not really about if you can survive with a single character. You are able to control different characters, equip them with weapons and such. Your characters get tired from running, killing and scavenging. So you have to be careful not to get exhausted while you are too far from home.It also comes down to having enough supplies for your community to survive as well. Make sure your 'Home' is safe and that everything has enough food, ammo and medical supplies.You can send out members of your community to scavenge places, but be prepared to come to their rescue if they get in trouble.Different take on the Zombie Apocalypse, not about killing as many zombies as you can or surviving for as long as you can with a individual character. But make sure your whole group survives and do as good as possible.I strongly recommend this game to anyone a fan of Zombie Survival type of games, and don't mind having to manage supplies and your playable characters, making sure they are not too exhausted.

												So, so disappointed. I was very excited about this game; I don't have a lot of money for games and usually only buy them on offer, sub-£5, but I couldn't wait for this game and all the hype I read sounded great.So I bought it full price and played it through. Whilst I can't deny having some enjoyable times - I was a fan of the way the game seemed to persist when you weren't playing, making a base was enjoyable and some of the missions were fun - I was overall very disappointed and felt kind of cheated by the critic reviews and the game developers. The game was just too easy; it felt as though there were no real challenges and that the game was designed so that everyone could finish it without too much trouble. I don't feel as though I am some elitist gamer; I'm happy that the game can be accessed and enjoyed by players of all skill levels but there really is no reason in the world why a game developer should choose not to include a difficulty setting in the game menu.. unless of course they were selling an expansion pack shortly after release which would advertise 'increased difficulty' as one of its selling points. I haven't bought the expansion pack out of principle and I stopped playing the game shortly after completion, which really does not take very long at all. I delayed finishing the game until I had completed all the side missions but the main story finishes very quickly - another selling point for the expansion. This feels like a rant, but one of the aspects of reviews which made me most interested was the idea of character permadeath. This turned out to be a huge exaggeration and I didn't lose a single character that wasn't scripted (one). To be fair, I was being careful at first, but before long I was wading into hordes with a golf club and coming out unfazed. There really seemed little need for stealth, which took away much of the gravity and tension of the game.Aside from that rant, another criticism of the game was the zombies themselves - it felt as though effort had been made to aim the game at a younger audience with cartoony zombies with glowing green eyes. In all, maybe buy it on offer but don't pay more than a fiver for it. Don't expect much and you might have a bit of fun.Tl;dr: can be fun but purposely designed way too short and way too easy, with no option to adjust difficulty. Also cartoon zombies. "

												SUMMARY: Its really fun and something no zombie and RPG fan should be without. I'm glad someone finally did a decent open-world zombie apocalypse RPG. (Red Dead Redemption's DLC doesnt count, although it was fun) However, the game seems a bit rough around the edges and unpolished. Ive encountered many minor-but-annoying graphical glitches such as clipping, pop-ins, twitching enemies, and weapons disappearing when wielded. I'm hoping that will be cleaned up in a patch or something. Overall, its a great game and I can see myself playing this one for hours.MAIN:Ok so where to start. This game is everything a single player zombie apocalypse RPG should be, although it is definitely not perfect. Ive been looking at it for a long time, but it was early access, and I generally don't buy e. a. games. I saw the e. a. tag was gone and it was extremely reduced for the summer sale, so I figured why the hell not.You start the game as a guy named Marcus on a fishing trip in the remote wilderness with his buddy, but later you get the option to play as others in your group of survivors. There are two aspects to this game, one is the open world run around doing random missions, story missions, collecting supplies and fighting zombies, the other (and what makes this game more than just an open world zombie-smash-fest) is managing your base's supplies and rooms and survivor's morale and trust. The base needs supplies such as food, ammo and medicine, which you can only get from raiding places. You can also build different areas inside your base, and upgrade them. Also, you can turn various outside areas into outposts which help you with the supplies, create safe zones, and set traps. Your survivors can go off on their own too, so you may have to rescue them. Random events happen, that can make survivors angry, or happy. The more stuff you bring back, the more you can ask for favors such as friends following you, radioing for certain supply caches, taking stuff out of the supply crate and so on (the mechanic in the game is your ""reputation points"").Personally, I think it sucks that even if you were the one who braved the zombie hordes to bring back gear, once you put it in the base's supply chest, it costs MORE rep points to pull it out then you earned putting it in. I understand why the devs did it from a gameplay standpoint, but it only makes me want to put items I am probably not going to need in there.Theres a LOT of stuff to do, just running around causes you to get random radio requests from your base. Things like clearing an infested house, helping a survivor (both strangers and ones in your group), hunting a dangerous type of zombie, raiding a certain building and many more. Helping people builds up trust, morale, and rep points, while ignoring requests for a certain amount of real-world time can fail the mission with negative consequences.Thats another interesting fact. The game is run off of a real world timer. So say a character gets ""hurt"" (worse than just injured, their health permanently goes down until they rest and heal) or tired (max stamina goes down), you have to take them back to base and let them rest. Also, the in-game clock and date is the first day you start. So say you started playing on June 9th. Your diary would start that day as well.The combat is simple to master and very fluid. It feels great to smash zombie heads with a lead pipe or other blunt object. There are various attacks you can do, as well as dodges(absolutely a must to master), finishing moves, and stealth kills. There is also many different types of firearms, with firing being relatively realistic. Not as much as a reality-based FPS army game, but more so then a typical 3rd person shooting game like GTA. The game also tries to be realistic with the sound of a shot drawing a crowd, so except for certain situations, sneaking up and bashing away seems a much better idea. The standard zombies are the running/jumping type for the most part, but generally go down easy as long as you arent swarmed. Not so for some of the rarer types, such as one bloated with poison gas and one that seems to act more like a werewolf.Sound is a major part of the game. As your character walks, a little blue circle surrounds him/her getting bigger or smaller the more or less noise you make. The zombies are attracted to sound, so things like banging around while searching, driving a car (always fun to plow through a horde) and shooting draw them. The zombies also make noise, and it is very important to make sure you dont walk up on one lurching around where you cant see it by listening for the sounds it makes.So, whats the bad points? Well. The graphics are glitchy as all hell for starters. Expect plently of pop-ins, clipping, disappearing weapons (even though your character still is rendered as if s/he is swinging away with it), enemies suddenly being on top of your car when you go to smash them and so on. The weirdest one I saw so far is a zombie laying down (some lay, then stand up and go after you when you alert them). I walked up and was about 5 feet away, and instead of getting to his feet, the zombie model laying on the ground did a jittery complete horizontal 360, and then suddenly disappeared, then popped-in standing and right in my character's face, where he bit me. Fun.Another is it doesnt seem to be optimized very well. It jacks my core temp up by 20c or so no matter what graphics setting its on. And its not pushing my gpu/cpu very hard at all. Its not a big deal, though, just smacks of a rushed finish.But even though its a bit glitchy and has rough edges, its still fun as hell. Anyone whose an RPG and zombie apocalypse fan should check this out.			"

												Game gives me mixed feelings. It's a good concept with poor execution.Things happen way, way, way too fast in the game for having it simulate itself when you're not playing. The survivors you rescue are basically like children and randomly wander off and get lost and die. Okay, I can buy getting sick. But these idiots deliberately seek out dangerous zombies on the auspices of making things ""safer"" It's no wonder people quit and come back and half their home place's population is gone. It's far less about foraging than about babysitting because of this and it's a real shame because it makes it feel more like grinding than survival.It's not particularly a bad game but it's not something I would recommend to my friends or anyone with a full-time job for that matter. It just needs to be fleshed out a lot more.			"

												State of Decay is thrilling. You're dropped into a zombie infestation and forced to manage your resources and survivors. There are various missions that pop up alongside to main story and if you ignore them your survivors can get injured or die. The zombies are easy enough to deal with, but if you're out on your own and you make too much noise you can find yourself being swarmed by all sides. A few lucky grapples by the zombies can leave you in an undead dogpile, slowly being torn to shreds. Once a character is dead it is gone forever.There have been times where I find myself surrounded and being beat down, and after barely knocking them off I stumble towards a car out o breath, zombies running after me and trying to grab me. One bite away from death I get into the car and drive off with several zombies hanging on banging at the doors. I can't remember the last time a game has made my heart race so much. There is so much character development and macro management in this game that you really feel like you're ""surviving"" rather than adventuring.Now for the flaws. The game is riddled with bugs. It's annoying to be heading into a dangerous area only to have your partner teleport back to base for an ""Angry resident"" mission. The zombies often clip through walls and into the floor. Sounds don't always play and cars can get damaged on invisible bumps. But none of the bugs are really gamebreaking and they're easy to shrug off. The resource management part of the game is too simple. There's supposed to be some sort of resource usage where some of your food/ammo/medicine are used up each day, but it seems like I'm always at max resources and the only thing I ever NEED to gather is building supplies for more upgrades at base. Because of this there's always more than enough time to do every side mission and there's no sense of urgency in the game.A few minor tweaks could make the game so much more difficult and so much more exciting. Side missions should force you to choose between saving a survivor or gathering necessary resources (think XCOM). Outposts should require a person there to be useful (instead of giving resources and killing zombies as an autonomous house), making you trade labor for safety. Resources should decay faster so you actually have to spend time scavenging inbetween or during missions. There are a limited amount of resources on the map but I haven't even come close to depleting them all. Before I moved my base to a new town I still had unsearched houses a two minute walk away.Overall the mechanics of the game are solid. THe game is enjoyable and exciting. With a few tweaks to make it harder could make it a game of the year. If you're thinking about buying it, buy it. If you'e not, buy it anyway.			"

												A solid Zombie Survival Title and worth its price. The game's Serious take on Zombie and Survival Put it in a place where many AAA titles fail to Push for, for reasons because you can actually Fail and or Lose, other games that praise survival do not do this and use mechanics such as unkillable Npc's, infinite ammo, Restart Points, Linear Plot devices Etc..  Though not a challenge at first the game will ramp up its difficulty slowly, but with some planning you can Survive without losing any of your characters, but neglect can lead to disease, sickness and having to execute and or leave people behind. The Game also Has Persistant Mechanics where Even if you dont play your Group of survivors still work, Buildings are constructed, Events happen, and Resources are consumed, a 24hr Game cycle.  Game mechanics come down to Characters learning certain Traits depending on how you play them, Sneaking Mechanics, Real time base building, Improving on peoples Respect and trust levels across not only your own party members but other Communities (conclaves, army, allies) as well. The Game's movement and crontols Handel very well, and nothing Happens where you call ""that a lod of BULL!"", If you mess up it is because you messed up and did not jump out of the way or bring the right materials Etc..(you know why you died). Along with a simple but yet convincing Story the game feels Fluid and allows you at the end to continue playing even after you have finished (without DLC)And now the Least important part, The graphical properties...The game is designed well but you can tell there was 1 model for all the females and 1 model for all the males, not very many models for Humans but the Zombies looked really nice, and the Game looks Great! if compared to its Xbox Counterpart.This Game is Extremly Replayable and immersive so give it a shot!CONS: from what makes this game Seem Perfect is the Feeling that BREAKDOWN DLC needing to be Part of the main Game and not DLC, it feels like it was supposed to be shipped with it and not seperate. The Main story line is short but not bad. Replayable other wise.			"

												So, so disappointed. I was very excited about this game; I don't have a lot of money for games and usually only buy them on offer, sub-£5, but I couldn't wait for this game and all the hype I read sounded great.So I bought it full price and played it through. Whilst I can't deny having some enjoyable times - I was a fan of the way the game seemed to persist when you weren't playing, making a base was enjoyable and some of the missions were fun - I was overall very disappointed and felt kind of cheated by the critic reviews and the game developers. The game was just too easy; it felt as though there were no real challenges and that the game was designed so that everyone could finish it without too much trouble. I don't feel as though I am some elitist gamer; I'm happy that the game can be accessed and enjoyed by players of all skill levels but there really is no reason in the world why a game developer should choose not to include a difficulty setting in the game menu.. unless of course they were selling an expansion pack shortly after release which would advertise 'increased difficulty' as one of its selling points. I haven't bought the expansion pack out of principle and I stopped playing the game shortly after completion, which really does not take very long at all. I delayed finishing the game until I had completed all the side missions but the main story finishes very quickly - another selling point for the expansion. This feels like a rant, but one of the aspects of reviews which made me most interested was the idea of character permadeath. This turned out to be a huge exaggeration and I didn't lose a single character that wasn't scripted (one). To be fair, I was being careful at first, but before long I was wading into hordes with a golf club and coming out unfazed. There really seemed little need for stealth, which took away much of the gravity and tension of the game.Aside from that rant, another criticism of the game was the zombies themselves - it felt as though effort had been made to aim the game at a younger audience with cartoony zombies with glowing green eyes. In all, maybe buy it on offer but don't pay more than a fiver for it. Don't expect much and you might have a bit of fun.Tl;dr: can be fun but purposely designed way too short and way too easy, with no option to adjust difficulty. Also cartoon zombies. "

												The way the tutorials during the game's opening hours lull you into a false sense of security while glossing over crucial gameplay mechanics is kind of a wonderful parralel to suddenly having to survive in a collapsed society and/or a Stanley Parable type commentary on gamers doing whatever you tell them to even when it makes no sense (I took my survivor out completely unarmed because a box popped up saying 'GO HERE!', with results that would be predictable in any situation other than the tutorial-heavy opening hour of a commercial videogame in the year 2014).Game's pretty good too! Way more management and procedural sandbox craziness in there than you'd initially expect. There are some rough edges like WHY WON'T MY CHARACTER JUST LIE DOWN AND SLEEP IN THIS BED INSTEAD OF STANDING THERE COMPLAINING HE'S TIRED (I have no idea, but exiting the game and then reopening it works) but with this much freedom and stuff to do it's definitely worth putting up with.

												I don't generally care for zombie games, but this one is a real gem.You control a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse, and are free to wander the (fairly large) map, killing zombies, looting building, setting up outposts, interacting with other survivors, etc. The kicker being that most resources are finite. Once you loot a building, it'll stay empty forever. When your trusty melee weapon wears down, it'll permanently break. And once a member of your group dies, he or she will stay dead. No going back: the game autosaves, and it keeps only the last one. While never being particularly hard, the game very effectively makes you feel that you are in a bad situation that can only get worse in the long run.To me, this game feels like a cross between Mount & Blade and The Walking Dead. If that sounds like a good thing to you, then definitely check it out!			"

												Buy this game if you like killing zombies, dynamic open world environments, don't mind sub-par graphics, and enjoy resource management.The game starts off shoddy and pretty awkward. I quit the game after 25 minutes, but after a few days I picked it out of my steam library to give it another shot. I don't regret that in the slightest.There is no main character really. You're going to be swapping through characters very often. There is a story and a plot but it's somehwat minor. It doesn't tell the details from just one characters perspective, and many dynamic set of characters cause the game to focus on the plot of other people around you, such as the various factions you can help or hinder, rather than the set of characters that you can have on your team.You might dislike the same voice acting from several characters, but their lines were voiced very well and it didn't bother me. The cast seems to have a unique design for the set of characters save for the voice acting.If Microsoft invested a bit more money to give it more polish, it could have recieved universal acclaim.

												This game mixes part zombie horror/survival with some city building and people management.  The game starts with you taking control of a couple guys coming back from a remote fishing trip to find out that the area they are in is now in the middle of a zombie outbreak.  You meet up with other survivors and try to get enough supplies and weapons to survive long enough to..... well I'm not sure to what end cause I'm pretty sure I screwed up somehow and wasn't sure what happened but I got to the end game screen.I recommend this game because it was fun to play.  I've played it on both Console and PC and both times the game was enjoyable.  That being said there was some design decisions that made sense for the game I guess, but just didn't sit well with me.  Slight SPOILERS ahead I guess.The game is constantly forcing you to do things, there is never seems to be a break.  There is always someone in trouble getting supplies, or someone missing or someone who wants to take out a zombie infestation.  While you are doing those misssions there are also story missions that are happening and this game doesn't care what else you are doing, if you don't show up for that story mission someone is gonna die and that part of the storyline is gone.  The problem with all these side/main quests happening ALL the time is it doesn't just let you explore the game.  The map is a pretty decent size with some neat areas to find and explore.  The problem is that you don't want to be on the northwest corner of the map when a story mission suddenly pops up on the southeast corner.  Maybe I just failed at seeing the options to tell the people in my little fortification to just sit there and don't leave but it was annoying to have these quests pop up all the time.  Made the game probably a little more of a realistic zombie game but from a guy who likes exploring, the way these  side quests worked just didn't work for me.I did really enjoy the way the inventory worked in this game, it was really well done.  You can get different sizes of backpack, though you'll pretty well get the biggest size pretty quickly and that is usually enough to get the job done.  You also get the trunk of the vehilce that you're driving (if you use a vehicle to get around).  In addition you can carry one bag of supplies (again the trunk of the vehicle can store multiple bags).  Anything that you find can be stored into the community inventory which gives you influence points (instead of using money), so you can trade things you find for other things in the community inventory(either things that were there originally or things that other survivors have made).  Finishing various side quests or main quests will also give you points to get additional items out of the inventory.  If you get the big bag and use the vehicles trunks/box efficiently you'll have enough points for pretty well anything you'll ever need.The Zombies were pretty standard zombies, they moved at about the same pace as your characters but could be out run with sprinting, however you can only sprint for a limited amount of time.  There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more.  But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way.  The fit the game really well.  As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part.  Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.You can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up.  Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable.  The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game.  You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest.  Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point.  One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.The one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable.  There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game.  Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.Controls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me.			"

There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more.  But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way.  The fit the game really well.  As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part.  Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.You can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up.  Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable.  The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game.  You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest.  Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point.  One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.The one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable.  There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game.  Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.Controls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me.			"

												Based on Early Access build 24/10.  This is a singleplayer storydriven zombie survival game.  It is a good, fun, if sometimes flawed and frustrating game.  If you want to play something akin Walking Dead in a early Resident Evil/Tombraider console style then get this.  However be warned that its far from a polished game.  Some mechanics will have you scratching your head and the graphics are of console quality.  Probably the worst aspect is the story based missions that force you to attempt missions even if you arent ready for them.  Combat is can also be unrewarding and repetitive.Best bits are the party and base management.  Driving cars into hordes and exploration is fun, while searching & finding loot is the most rewarding aspect of the game.  Probably better than killing the zeds.  In addition to searching buildings and loot equipment and weapons, you can establish outposts and setup bases which can be upgraded which adds to the immersion.There is some character customization and they can level in certain perks so that keeps things interesting.  Voice acting and music is also good and the dialogue exchanged between party members is well done.Replayability is fair through the use of randomized minor missions and party/base events that affect key resources such as food, medicine, ammo, materials, fuel and morale and influence which allow you to do things such as take out different equipment and people.  Of which there are loads of.After my initial reservations Id say this could be a fantastic game in time, esp. if the devs tackle the console-y stuff that remains: poor control system (for PC), inferior graphics and resolution and pace the story missions a little better.All in all not my dream game... but not far off.

												I fricken' love this game!  This is what I originally envisioned DayZ(sa) would be like - building outposts, home sites, supporting your community of survivors, meeting other groups of survivors, seemingly never-ending open world.I understand that this is a single-player game, and so the ""supporting your community"" and ""meeting other groups"" is just a bunch of NPCs, but still.Undead Labs has designed something amazing here!  And it's only going to get better!I was so dissappointed to discover that DayZ(sa) wasn't much more than a serial-killer-simulator.  I've been murdered so many times, for absolutely nothing (we're talking no gear - a flashlight and a battery is worth sniping over?) that it's amazing anyone gets anything done.  People don't team up?  Or I've just tried the wrong 100+ servers so far, I guess.Anyways, I am so addicted to this game.SoD is just a ton-load of fun to play.  Wanna follow the story/missions?  Feel free...  Wanna just roam endlessly and hoard supplies?  That's game too...  Swipe an abandoned car and plow through some zombie hordes, just make sure you don't open your mouth as you turn those zeds into bloody soup!  LOL.I've barely made it a fraction of the way through the story so far, but I'm taking my time.  Taking advantage of the open-world environment to just build up my home site, and increase my reputation with the group.I don't even plan on playing the Breakdown DLC until I play through the story at least twice, and there's another DLC in the makings.  Can't wait to see what we get in the next update!  The forums are talking about some awesome enhancements to the game.Undead Labs is certainly on the right track with this gem of a title...  If they eventually break into the co-op/mmo bracket, they're sure to do amazing things! "

												Got this after reading a number of positive reviews (albiet console reviews), however after having finished it I have to say it didnt strike me as being as good as I had read. For the PC it feels very limited compared to similar games, combat, scale, content are all average at best. Its not especially bad in any way, its just thats it gets VERY repetitve quickly, missions got boring early & are not challenging at all; goto point A & kill zombie type B repeat, go to point C & save person D etc, the main quest line really doesn't try to repair the issue either, way too easy & you dont really care about the survival of anyone at any point. Managing peoples moral is mostly taking them to a mission & killing zombies for them (goto point A & kill zombie type B), resources, weapons, ammo & vehicles are abundant which really reduces the whole survival feel. The whole presentation comes across as a GTA mod both in visuals (which look like they're from 2008) and play style, yet its missing the content that made GTA worth playing through. Base buliding isnt really what it says on the tin you get a pre-determind plot, within that theres a number of plots in which you can place various buling types you then can upgrade with adequate resources, meh. 6/10			"

												If you're into zombies, this is a great game for you. The combat is pretty solid, exploration and building your base is very interesting. The sidequests are different enough to keep you interested for a while.It lacks solid story and dialogue but that is forgivable. What is really bad is the lack of character customization. I mean, the whole point of this zombiekalypse fetish is seeing yourself there, being tough and heroic, and the game totally blows that.The day and night cycle, gaining trust with other survivors and finally banding together feel very imersive. But the inmovable and indestructable garden fences and car wrecks do their best to remind you that you're playing a game.If you can look past the bad animation, zombies going through doors and so on, you have a solid 30 hours of fun ahead of you. I feel that Breakdown does not add much because the map is very small and (sensible) homebase choice is pretty limited.			"

As such, if a Juggernaut gets a hold of you, just exit out of the game, unless it was your goal to get ripped in half and get ♥♥♥♥ed.

												I played through the single-player campaign and found the game to be a pretty enjoyable experience overall, even if whoever decided to not make constant zombie spawns toggleable (or to make ""persistent world continues even when you are not playing"" toggleable) obviously did not realize how much more versatile a game it could have been for less-skilled action gamers if those were included.  The fighting is usually pretty fun, the base management is simple enough to be enjoyable without overly hindering the rest of the game, scavenging runs feel useful, the vehicles are lots of fun to use--overall, lots of little fun elements working together as a cohesive whole.Interestingly, while I played and LOVED ""Lifeline"" (possibly because I am apparently so much better with guns than with melee that I found it surprisingly easy), I think ""Breakdown"" is about the least compelling possible version of this game, as there is no longer an actual end goal.  With ""Breakdown"" the game feels more like you are playing a 1980s arcade game to get the highest score, and, well, I think we have moved beyond that as a gaming goal by now, surely?  Ha.  But obviously plenty of people love it, as it sounds like the most fun version of the game for many.  But ""run around the base game map and do all the same stuff as the base game, and your reward in the end is to do it all over again on a harder map until you die and lose your save"" does not exactly sound appealing to me.BUT!  This is still a -spectacular- zombie game, and a pretty great game by any standards.			"

												Probably one of the best openworld zombie games to come out in a long time. A very satisfying combat system, unlike most other DayZ-esque games out there, which has more of a Dead Rising feel to it. State of Decay also has a lot of great features, such as switching between survivors throughout the whole game, all in which you can level up and progress individually. Each survivor has a unique story behind them, as well. Your safehouse is a base that you can upgrade with more defenses as well as things like weapon and vehicle repairs. Yes, this game has open-world vehicle driving. If there was an openworld zombie game worth checking out this year, it's definitely State of Decay, because instead of trying to ride on the rise of DayZ-esque games, it tries to do its own thing and does it well.

												SoD is the definitive zombie RPG experience. When I first started up the game, I instantly thought ""Oh ♥♥♥♥, did I just buy Dead Island again?"". The answer was no, I didn't. The first few missions and maybe first hour are pretty directed in terms of gameplay and missions but after that, it's a free universe. Gather survivors, supplies, weapons, cars, and influence through a series of life-threatening missions. Wipe out entire hordes of zombies so they don't attack home. Build medical tents, workshops, sleeping quarters, sniper towers, and much more! Drive around the graphically appeasing world but be careful! It might be tempting to run through hordes of Zeds but your car will take alot of damage! Here are some of the highest points of SoD:-Realism: melee weapons and cars all take damage after overuse. Nothing lasts forever!-Challenge: Zombies are actually dangerous and it is always better to avoid them. Don't rush into a fight, bullets are few and so is your energy-Immersive Environment: Witness the world fall apart around you. The military is not your best friend, niether is the established government in Marshal. Have the opprotunity to help total strangers or leave them for dead. It's the closest thing to a Walking Dead experience you'll get if you're looking for something like that. -Defensive Battles: Home is never perfect or completely safe. Zed hordes can rush in any moment if you don't control the population of them yourself. When they come, they come. They climb over walls from all directions and it becomes an Alamo-esque atomosphere. Hold or die, it's simple.-Death is a new begining: Since you can play as multiple characters, your death is not the end of the game. My first character, Marcus, I used to go out and look for survivors in the woods. I was surrounded by Zeds and torn apart. After one character's death, another one will give a quick eulogy and the whole camp's morale will go down. -Home: Make it your own and get involved in that well known zombie apocalypse drama. Keep the morale of your camp up by scavenging and defending against zed hordes. If one character in particular is saddened or angry, do a mission with them to boost their morale and keep them going. Random events will generate (gun misfire, arguments, etc) that all effect the morale of the camp. The Bad:-Not fully optimized for PC: This is obviously a Xbox game, using a mouse can give you sometimes a more glitchy feeling. It does not fully hold back gameplay though, it can make it harder to get the full scope of your surroundings though. -Invisible walls: In houses or other structures, it is common for invisible walls to pop out of nowhere and you will have to shake your mouse vigorously to be free.All in all, the game is great besides for those few bugs. 8.9/10!

												Amazing, if you like zombie survival games, then get this.I was so impressed with how much this game offered. You scavenge supplies, find survivors, help out locals, find bases and move to other bases, create items needed to survive, and have resources you need to keep stocked.The two other additions to the game, were also fun, Lifeline offers a new map and a new persona as you play the military who are trying to clear out the city before leaving it to the zombies to overrun.

												Probably one of the best openworld zombie games to come out in a long time. A very satisfying combat system, unlike most other DayZ-esque games out there, which has more of a Dead Rising feel to it. State of Decay also has a lot of great features, such as switching between survivors throughout the whole game, all in which you can level up and progress individually. Each survivor has a unique story behind them, as well. Your safehouse is a base that you can upgrade with more defenses as well as things like weapon and vehicle repairs. Yes, this game has open-world vehicle driving. If there was an openworld zombie game worth checking out this year, it's definitely State of Decay, because instead of trying to ride on the rise of DayZ-esque games, it tries to do its own thing and does it well.

												Hardcore zombie post-apocalyptic survival game. Third person perspective. Your characters get tired, sick, hungry, like real people. Supplies are limited, some people don't like each other (seriously? It's the end of the world and people gotta be all drama queenin' it up...). It's a good game with good depth. Cars are limited. Weapons break down, ammo is scarce. People have specialties and can suck at other things. People perma-die. You gather supplies and allies and build up your outpost. You survive, you look for help and other survivors and supplies. Oh and cars break down too. Plough through too many zombie hordes and your car will eventually quit from all the abuse. Feral zombies are evil. They'll tear your charcter in half. Literally. One of my survivors lost a fight and had his upper body torn off from his lower body. Yeah, brutal.Recommend? Yes.			"

												This game had a lot of potential but really fell short. The biggest issue for me were the bugs/mechanics. I was scavenging for supplies after having killed all the zombies around than out of the corner of my eye I saw a zombie appear out of thinn air. The other issue I had were the rucksacks, which you could only cary one of even if you had a car! This makes material gathering long and tedious. Also a big thing for me was how road signs respawned after you destroyed them, things shouldn't rebuild after you leave the game! I wish that this game was more like its name and you eventually start to worry about the lack of supplies and you need to be careful with cars because their are a finite amount of them. Also I wish you could have attacked other survivors for supplies. This game was okay but really was reppetitive and had major imersion issues for me.			"

												I would not recommend this game anymore, the reason being- the developers STOPPED caring, updates do not roll out fast at all, and when they do they are pointless updates. This game concept and idea are spot on and perfect and i feel that its the way some game producers should go, its just disapointing that these guys came up with it. It has much much more potential and even more potential for a sequel or even more DLC (breakdown by the way added another 20+ hours of gameplay).Overall don't spend your money unless its on sale.

												State of Decay is by far one of my all favourite zombie games.It's centered around zombies and not like alot of other zombie games these days where you must also fight humans. The main story of SoD is decent but nothing amazing. Don't buy this game if you're only in it for the storyline. You'll only be left very dissapointed as there isn't much meat on the story. The gameplay on the other hand is what makes this game so addicting and entertaining.The graphics are quite well and there is alot to explore. Ever wanted a zombie game with Sims elements? SoD is what you want. You and your community must survive and gather resources, with small events randomly being triggered around the community and game world. Each new community member that joins you is another someone you can play as. If your character dies you will reappear back at your base as one of your current members. The game itself is only in thirdperson, not that it's an issue, the characters are very detailed and interesting to play as and you almost never feel like playing the same one.As for DLC, Breakdown offers alot of new content such as weapons and unlockable hero's, characters from the main storyline and a few bonuses. Breakdown also makes the game less storydriven and more focused on sandbox style. Surviving or doing whatever it is you wish. Breakdown also has a level stage system. You can fix a RV and eventually, if you desire, leave Trumbull Valley only to reappear somewhere randomly in the game again, just on a new, reset game world with your previous survivors. Going an level up, surviving becomes harder in alot of factors. There are less items to be found, more zombies, harder to kill etc.If you've always wanted a zombie sandbox game with minor, sims elements, just in this case, community overall, SoD and Breakdown is defently a must buy for you.

												Although the game is supposed to be more of a simulation (compared to typical zombie shooting games), the almost constant limiting of the camera angles seems like a forced attempt at a cinematic experience. This frequently makes it hard to glance around and get a proper view of things, leaving you open to attack from places that you can't see--places you could easily look if the game would let you turn your head or body.[Update 2014-10-07: When playing with an Xbox360-compatible controller, there seems to be much more control of the camera angle than with the mouse. This removes my primary irritation with the game.] [Update 2014-10-12: When playin with controller, shortly after I got two people following me instead of one, the game very frequently popped up a prompt to Taunt/Cheer/Agree/Disagree. Nobody had said anything, so the last two don't even apply! The buttons to answer the prompt are the same as buttons you need to do melée, finishing strokes, searches, open/close doors. This means that I randomly was unabled to attack, defend, or close a door in time. Sometimes I could work around it be quickly pausing, unpausing, and immediately pressing the desired key before the Taunt/Cheer/Agree/Disagree prompt got in the way again.]You can control many different characters and improve their skills, such as with a particular weapon. However, they all seem completely unable to handle themselves without you present, regardless of purported skills. Keep in mind that when you close the game you are not considered present, so the next time you open it you may find that a nice situation has become dire, or that a desperate one has already been turned into failure. This is not a game you can play ""from time to time"", but rather one that requires you to frequently come back to make sure that things haven't collapsed while you weren't playing. And if you have to exit the game during an in-game crisis to deal with real life, you may have to do a lot of rebuilding, healing, and recruiting of new characters when you return. You may even have to start over.[More Update 2014-10-07: Although they did eat all the food and use all the other supplies in the months that I left this title alone (and the window barricades mysteriously disappeared without the window glass being broken), nobody died--not even the one supposedly in critical condition. Now wishing I could change my ""Not Recommended"" mark to ""Don't know if want"".]			"

												State Of Decay is brilliant! It's like Dead Rising in a large, open world, but with a more serious tone. It's also like The Walking Dead (TV series) with permanent character death, viscious and numerous zombies and a strong emphasis on survival.Set up an outpost, then venture out into towns and forests in search of food, weapons, vehicles, guns, ammunition, building materials and medicine to improve your home-base and keep your survivors alive. Lots of drivable vehicles, and every building is enterable to scavenge.Every character you find is fully voice-acted and can be played at any time. If they die, they're gone for good and you simply switch to another character. Very good, tense, addictive fun!			"

												State of Decay is a polished single-player open world zombie survival game. It requires you to take on the mindset of a survivor than just another player. After slowly taking my time and beating the single player campaign in about 25 hours (100%), here are some highlights from the game..Pros:- The game is not actually hard BUT the consequences are tremendous if you do ♥♥♥♥ up (you'll be instilled with a feeling of loss)- Resources are finite. It can be counterbalanced with resource investment into sustainability (for survival).- You don't just play one character. You raise up a community. The more time to take into building up the group as a whole, the greater your chances of survival.- Vehicles are considered a resource. If you take better care of them, you'll find that they can do more than just get you from point A to B.- 25 hours worth of content (main story and side quest included).- For a single player game, the NPC companions are quite capable. They don't take the lead but they don't fall behind either.Cons:- The story is quite average.- Vehicles are overpowered. They can kill everything except for one special infected.			"

												Dull and lifeless gameplay, not only do you repeat the same basic type of missions over and over. The way you complete them is the exactly the same as the mission before.

I didn't bother finishing the game after playing for awhile and realizing I wasn't enjoying it anymore.			"

												It is quite hard to write a review on a game like State of Decay, every run you make can be a tiny bit different, which makes it near impossible to write a review that is useful to someone who is looking to buy.Therefore I will do the next illogical thing...I'll tell you a story. [spoiler free]Once upon a time, in a forest far far away. There were two redshirts, who magically plopped into a campsite with no reason to be there.Generic redshirt one was very good at leadership!Generic redshirt two was very good at...well...nothing.Generic redshirt one and two both stumbled upon a small campsite, however the campsite had been designed and developed by the Call of Duty school of object interaction. And therefore redshirt one could only take items from BRIGHT AND PULSING ILLUMINATED PILES OR OBJECTS, redshirt one and two blissfully walked past the obvious packets of food around the barbecue as well as the backpacks laying around.Later they stumbled upon a park ranger station where they met many other redshirts, all who were as clueless and redshirted as them. They were then guided to a gunshot in the distance, where they recruited redshirt three. They all joyfully hopped back to the ranger station and found their fellow redshirts had lived up to their names and died.They all decided to leave on a suspiciously empty road that covered a good quarter of the map. Entering an American sedan with wood exterior. There was enough of them to turn on the radio to ""what is love"" and nod their heads in unison. But they didn't.After a while Redshirt one, two and three found another group, full of more redshirts. They were all sent on varying missions, taking it in turns to go out into the towns nearby and eventually as their kill count increased they began to become less redshirt-ish.I finally had a Picard, a Data and a Seven-of-nine.**The rest I never bothered with, my 3 main character choices were enough to keep me going for the whole gameThe rest of the group just sat about, complaining and taking resources while each of my characters in turn broke their backs bringing back mountains of supplies in their trucks each run. Aside from each character starting out a redshirt, there is no customization. So you are dumped with what are basically blank slates with a smiley face drawn on. Hell, where can I make my own face with a smiley face on?Maybe I would become more attached to my character and actually care if they got seriously wounded or sick?Soon after my band of redshirts moved to a bigger location, where was like the old location but I kept getting harassed to move by a fellow redshirt****State of Decay tries to make this atmosphere of ""you are doomed, panic!"". But it never fully achieves this. One example was when my group had one day of food left, everyone was panicking and harassing me about it. I casually walked across the street, found a rucksack of food from a store and walked back...Crisis averted in less than 2 hours in game, about 30 minutes in real time.Speaking of which, the majority of work you do in this game is simply busywork. It is ""go here"" ""help this guy"" ""look here"" etc. If you don't pull time out of the important stuff you are doing and go help this one guy in a group you never talk to then they will be angry when they return.I had to refuse a quest from a fellow redshirt because I was too busy to follow up on hunting a mutated zombie, since I was more concerned about starving to death. Naturally did the logical thing and decided we were no longer friends, simply telling me to ""get lost"" every time I went near them.******It is a lose-lose scenario where you grip and control slowly slips away and you can't do anything to stop it. It quickly becomes frustrating.Eventually all my redshirts survived, with only a few scripted deaths along the wayHooray and suchConclusionIn essence State of Decay isn't a game I would call ""bad"" or ""poor"", but more ""rough"". It has plenty of problems such as the logic behind the world it shows you. One NPC was talking about rioting in the streets and looting, yet in this town I could only count 4 looted buildings out of around 50. Many of them were untouched.Great attention to detail has been made for this game, if you are sprinting towards a window and press the action button ""E"", you will throw yourself out of the window to safety. Also the scavenging system is quite unique because you can ""rush"" a scavenge and make more noise, or maybe create a lot of noise that will draw zombies from everywhere to your location, a good risk-reward system in my opinion.There is no casual dialogue with anyone unless they have a mission, which combined with the lack of character customization makes the game quite shallow.However characters do comment on things such as zombies flanking you or meeting some NPCS.The skills are done D&D style. The more you use them, the better they get.After a while you can pick additional perks to enhance your combat ability. However many of these special moves require the use of the left shift/left control + another key, which you can imagine is very difficult on a keyboard. I strongly advise using a controller.As I said. Rough. But not bad. Get it on sale			"

Despite the reports of mouse/keyboard being implemented (it's utterly ridiculous that this had to be patched into a ♥♥♥♥ing PC game and still allowed to be sold), it's in an unusable garbage state.  For all intents and purposes, it still isn't implemented due to how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a state it's currently in.No graphics options, you have to edit configs which need to be extracted first, to actually turn off garbage like motion blur.Utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera control, with no way to disable things like camera auto-'correct', so you're constantly fighting the controls.  Oh and don't forget mouse acceleration, it would be silly to expect to be able to disable that crap.The utter audacity of the devs to be working on DLC right now before they even get the game into a releasable state is just the icing on the cake.Avoid this steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥, and this developer.

												Awful. Not worth the money even though I got it on sale. Keep looking for a good game and don't trust good reviews, not even totalbiscuit.pc optimization and graphics: Can't max the game at 1080p 60 fps on an overclocked r9 290. Turning the settings down I still see dips below 60 fps. The game also seems to want to lock itself to 50fps at certain points for no reason. The menu screens still have xbox buttons on them. This is the worst console port I have ever played. The worst. They didn't even add anti aliasing, just a quality slider and shadows options and that's it. I had to force AA with radeon pro because catalyst control center doesn't work for this game. The graphics are awful. I'm no professional artist, but I could make a better looking game than this. I would never have the audacity to sell a  product that looks like this. The graphics could have been for the original xbox. Actually, halo 2 looked better. The shadows/shading had to be fixed with mods so I could see during daylight. Tried other mods but held off because I read mods like the sweet Fx ones made the game even more buggy than it already is. The screen shots you see on the store page are BULL SHOTS, and even from the bull shots you can tell the game looks a bit dated. The game doesn't look as good as the store page screen shots  at all. It looks like they downsampled and added better shading or something. Sad how bad steam's quality control on games is. soundtrack: Forgettable is all I can say. I can't even hum one song off the top of my head. Once looking up some music on youtube, it was alright and set a decent tone.story: Hardly there, and not worth paying attention to any real progression. More of a survival game I guess. ♥♥♥♥ that, I want  a good story driven, open world zombie game. Instead I got this garbage.gameplay: A little better on this front but still nothing special. The pros include open world with some missions that pop up along side the ""main missions"" to keep things interesting. However, that's where it ends. The cons are plentiful and make the game worthless even if you are someone who can look past the bad graphics. The management is no fun. The resources are limited with unlimited zombies. Haven't run into the problem of people getting killed off while not even playing the game like some have reported, but I have had to deal with the infuriating save system. The saves are auto save only with no loading previous saves. The inventory system is dumb, with the largest backpack barely holding anything. Looked for a fast travel mod so I could atleast drop stuff off at base and couldn't find one. Half the time I can't even switch to another character or get another character to follow me, and there seems to be no reason.(glitch/bug not a matter of team liking me) As soon as the fact that  its open world wears off, which will be within an hour or two considering how small the world is, you'll just see the game as repetitive: go here, clear area/loot house/ hold off incoming zombies mission over and over. The world sucks to explore. Like really sucks. More shallow than an ubisoft open world game. If you're someone who thought skyrim was shallow, stop reading this review, cancel all thoughts about this game, and do something else. Guns are unsatisfying (probably due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse support) and all feel about the same except for maybe the shotguns having spread and less range. Silencers were poorly implemented and break for no reason after a set number of shots. The decision to include no human enemies with guns was a terrible idea. Look at a game like dead island, which I also thought was pretty bad, but atleast had decent gameplay pacing with the mix between zombie and human enemies. The AI of your team and zombies is horrible and makes the game even more horrible to play. Overall, this game is bad, even for an indie game. It won't hold your interest if you have some sort of standards for games, even if you are a zombie fanatic.			"

												I admit that I am coming in as a disatisfied customer in this review, but ultimately I feel it has to be said.

After buying it, and being super psyched to play it after seeing a few let's plays; I downloaded it and waited until everything was done; only to find that when I finally booted the game I was greeted iwht a message 'This game is incompatible with your graphics card, the game was not built to support onboard graphics cards' referencing the model my computer uses. All the while, I can play Skyrim or Xcom on medium settings just fine; but I got to see the menu of the game and if I tried to start a game was greeted with a black screen. I wouldn't have ended up upset or irritated at the game at all, which now just taunts me in my library view; if I hadn't picked it up and spent 15$ (Thankfully it was on sale) only to end up finding that it's paying that much for a game that functionally works; less than even a coaster. I'm glad the game is successful, but one thing I can only hope of indie developers, especially those who have went past the 'bug-testing stage' of their games; is that they follow the method of Paradox Interactive, and actually give support on these matters. While I want to believe in this game, I've basically been shanked for the belief.			"

												I was rather dissappointed in this game. They made it look open world but it really isn't so. It's too story-line based for what I was expecting. The gameplay is rather clumsy and doesn't feel fluid. It still feels like it's in Beta but it isn't.			"

												The game is very fun at first. The idea of being thrown in a zombie infested city and building your own fort/gathering resources is pretty awesome. After about ~7 hours or so the game begins to show its flaws. Missions are repetitive/annoying, resources are abundant, game combat is questionable. And although there's permadeath, an eager supply of victims are always ready to join your cause. This game is great for a short tryst; but for those who look for a longer, more immersive world should look elsewhere.			"

												I've been trying to get into this game for nearly 2 years now. I feel like I'm babysitting, not building a community of tough survivors. I leave to get some ammo to go town and destroy all the infestations. everyone is healthy and were going great on food and materials. I come back, two people are missing one is sick, food is all gone and a horde is attacking even though two of my people had assault rifles and all pistols and good melee weapons. And the ♥♥♥♥♥ on the radio wants me to be everywhere at once and harasses me every five minutes to help some random group I've never met for a reward of like 2 bullets for revolvers. This game is exausting to me.			"

												This game does not only incorporate zombie killing action, it allows the players to create a survival group just like the walking dead. If you are in love with the Walking Dead TV series, this game is for you! It has the ability to not only go out and scout for supplies for your home base but it also has a drama system inside and outside your home. The home is used for safety so save and quit and also to heal up and repair weapons. Melee weapons is the key to the survival of the game. The game has a sound system, zombies can see you but it is very rare and difficult, the sound is what drives them crazy and makes them run straight at you. I find for a early access game, this game has rarely any glitches but the screen is a little wobbly but you will adjust to it after awhile. Day Z and War Z are just no compare to this game. If you really want to experience a true zombie apocalypse this game has it all!			"

												Standing atop a water tower, the survivor scouts out areas that may contain much needed supplies while also making note of where the nearby zombie activity lies. This is Undead Labs’ “State of Decay,” and day to day life inside the zombie title constantly involves the search for materials to survive. It’s not just about getting the goods necessary for living another day as much as the situations gamers encounter while out scavenging for them.“State of Decay” may feel like several other tiles. It’s easy for gamers to look at the title and see that it’s an open-world game with vehicles and think it must be like “Grand Theft Auto.” Others may hear that it involves rescuing survivors from a zombie outbreak and think it might be similar to “Dead Rising,” or that the act of searching for supplies in order to outlive the undead must make the game some kind of single-player “DayZ.”The truth is, even though “State of Decay” may seem like all of these on paper, it all blends together to create a unique experience that gamers can’t find anywhere else.The survivors of Trumbull ValleyPlayers don’t have a single character to control inside “State of Decay.” In order to survive in the safest and most effective way possible, gamers must bring together a community of people. Rather than playing as a single survivor, the player represents an entire group.After earning any character's trust to become their friend, players gain the option to take control of that survivor and thus use them to go out and gather supplies or do missions.In Fact, “State of Decay” requires gamers to switch out which survivor they are playing as doing too much on one person will make them fatigued and much more likely to die. Speaking of death, when a character dies it is permanent. That person is forever removed from the group and loading a previous save isn’t an option as “State of Decay’s” auto-save feature ensures that both risk and choice matter in the game.Basically, gamers should get use to the idea that survivors will die. This is the zombie apocalypse after all.It’s the supplies that keep the group aliveTrumbull Valley features a rural setting that includes small town settlements as they would exist today if an uncontrollable zombie outbreak occurred. As such, the landscape is filled with houses, stores, storage sheds, warehouses, and more to scavenge through.In addition to finding weapons and other items that are for active use on a character, players must find packs of materials that are necessary for the home base. The group needs food, medicine, and fuel for obvious reasons. Ammunition helps keep the survivors at home alive as it gives them the means to defend themselves while the player is away.Another important resource the community requires comes in the form of building materials. These are necessary for the group to make repairs and additions to their home base by building watch towers, sleeping areas, workshops, medical tents, and more.The new structures allow the group to improve their base so that it can provide better protection, house more survivors, repair tools and vehicles, treat the injured, and even grow a daily source of food via outdoor gardens.There’s no place like HomeSince the home base houses all the survivors together, they will occasionally get in fights with one another. This will prompt players to escort these troubled individuals away from the base so that they can have a private talk in hopes of calming the situation down. Occasionally, members of the group will also end up in distress or turn up missing. Gamers are then tasked to come to their aid and help them back to safety.To help everyone out in the field, players may establish outposts away from the home base which provide relative safety while separated from home. Outposts allow missing survivors to find their way back, and create a safe perimeter around the structure which can be expanded by placing traps.This land belongs to the deadThe 16 square kilometer map of “State of Decay” features a couple of small towns, wooded areas, rivers, farms houses complete with fields, and even some lakes. Basically the game’s environments provide all the ingredients for a classic horror setting after scores of the undead are thrown into the mix.The living dead themselves are both varied and plentiful. There are standard shambling zombies, which travel either alone and in large wandering hordes that work as a single unit which can easily overwhelm lone survivors.“State of Decay” also features a few special zombie units that are more of a threat than the average walking corpse. These range from bloated zeds who leave a deadly toxic fume in their wake to armless zombies whose only attack comes in the form of a stunning scream which lets the nearby undead swarm the defenseless survivor.Most of these special units bear a resemblance to a figure that was once believably human with the exception of the lumbering Juggernaut. This behemoth towers as a giant above the other dead and bears the strength to send cars flying with a single swipe that would suggest that they aren’t merely the reanimated corpse of a deceased human being.An enjoyable harmony‘State of Decay” weaves elements of several genres together to create a new gaming recipe for fun. On their own merits, the game’s combat, resource gathering, survivor micro-management, and other systems are decent. When they are put together, however, they become much greater than the sum of their parts. Everything blends together in such a way that players won’t even care about the game’s few minor issues such as graphical tears, clipping, and framerate dips.When looked at as a full-title, “State of Decay” is remarkable. Considering the fact that this is an Xbox Live Arcade game, the results are phenomenal. This is definitely a must buy for any fan of either zombies or sandbox gaming, but this is the kind of experience that every gamer should at least try.			"

												In a world rapidly being filled with generic and increasingly boring zombie games, State of Decay is a rare gem that gets zombie survival right. It's that game that makes you a part of the world you wanted to play in after watching a good zombie flick.State of Decay is... just that zombie survival game I have been looking for. I was surprised that more people are not talking about it. Where some games get a little too caught up in humans fighting each other over resources in a post zombie-apocalypse world (like DayZ) or zombie slaughter simulation (like Dead Island and Dead Rising), State of Decay perfectly scratches that 'build a community of survivors and scavenge for resources' itch.You get to choose a location for your group to set up in, manage your resources by scavenging, building base upgrades, and helping people out in the world. Even though the game has a story - and that story is interesting to play - I found myself just exploring, scavenging, and killing some zombies.This is exactly the kind of zombie games I want to see in the future. Let's face it, the zombie genre is hot right now, and I am tired of the endless DayZ clones where you are in a zombie-themed minecraft world with the greatest danger being the other players. State of Decay gives you an open world that is exciting to explore. There are many buildings, and they are full of resources, and sometimes also full of zombies. The zombies themselves are trivial on their own, but in groups are quite deadly, and you have to take them into account when trying to figure out whether a place is worth raiding, or a route worth traveling down.Overall, I love this game, and I hope we can see a bigger, multiplayer version of it in the future.

												So i was looking for a game thats a bit different from the ""kill as many zombies as you can"" game and more like a duck and dive, try to survive the zombies sort of game. i was not dissapointed. From the start it is clear that this game isnt about zombie death count, its about surviving the Zombie apocolopse by gathering resources, befriending the local population and securing the best territory to enable to to live and survive in relative comfort.Firstly the bad bits about gameplay. there are quite a few bugs, casually looting some food and a zed decides to come through the wall and mall me. luckily only the one! the graphics are in no way next gen, which i kind of like in a way, it gives it a retro zombie authenticity lacking from some apocoliptic games. loss of stamina is annoying, especially when a horde of zeds decides to turn up! but in truth it adds a little more dynamic to the game, making you think about exit stratagies before searching a property, worth noting, check rooms and close doors behind you!I've found using vehicles to draw enemies out and run them over was a good strategy but you'll go through a fair few vehicles this way so ensure you are able to repair them, and also dont ram a juggernaught at full speed, nasty consequences as i found out when i lost one of the games first notable characters. Yes when someone dies they stay dead, no continues or respawns, there gone! Gonna wrap this up now by saying if you want something a bit different from the normal zombie game, this could probably be for you, with a price tag thats not too bad considering the other titles out there. not quite completed this yet but i'm around 10 hours in and im still hooked, i'll be downloading the dlc once the games complete for more action!

												Not an immaculate game by any means but a very addicting and fun game. This is one of those special games that gets you hooked enough to look forward to a sequel with improved game mechanics. The ambitions of this game is quite impressive. In gameplay, many times, all the elements will flow perfectly and the whole game will really feel like an exciting struggle for survival. Each time you go outside your compound with a character there is slight hesitation as you aren't sure if your character will survive a scavaging run, because when a character dies it is permadeath and they are gone from the game for good. Other times, various bugs will break that immersion and become frusterating. However, despite those buggy occurances, the game still shines. There is a problem where the latter half of the game will become easier as you start to horde more weapons and supplies but that is the natural side effect of becoming much better at the game. I would have liked to have seen difficulty ramp up a bit more as you go on. Though I have to admit it is satisfying nearer to the end of the game when you can just walk down mainstreet with a .45 colt and caution thrown to the wind because your characters have become survival badasses. Overall, it's an easy game to recomend to anyone who enjoys zombie beat downs and survival/horror. A final positive: this studio has been really dedicated in trying to resolve bugs and continue to improve their product which is a really nice thing to see.			"

Having full mouse and keyboard controls with remapping of keys is great.  Controls can be a bit awkward inside building but other than that no probs.  Guns are kinda weak, but may its engrossing trying to keep your survivors alive, having to go out on missions in the dark, etc.  Well worth full price, though a steal on its current daily sale.			"

It's fairly small areas like the camping ground, we're to believe that there are 50+ people up there turned to zombies? I'd also liked more options in crafting, and instead of premade safe houses, it would be better if the player could choose a random house and start making it safe, put up walls etc.			"

												After playing many of the other well received ""Zombie Survival"" games this one stands out. SOD provides the quintisential zombie experience mainly due to the open world enviornment. There is no build up or long boring tutorial, you are dropped inot a zombie debacle and the whole world is your bloody oyster.  The ""Home Base"" feature provides a lot of dynamic elements to the game including building constructrion and upgrades, group members realistically roaming around the grounds, protecting, sleeping reading, w/e always ready to take up the adventuring (if they arent out getting themselves killed already on a mission you sent them or otherwise...).  Time is always running and you have to delagate your duties between scavenging , side missions and story line mission very carefully if you want to maximize your materials and population.  You lose someone.....they are dead, get over it, they arent coming back and with the auotsave feature it is tough to cheeze your way out with alt-ctrl-del.  If you manage to keep them alive however, the level progression is surprisingly deep and rewarding allowing you to really customize the kind of zombie killing machine your survivors will be.  The engine and physics arent revolutionary but they are definitly fun (think Sleeping Dogs with the graphics and GTAIV with the moving , driving and shooting).  This game combines elements from some of the most fun and successful games I have ever played and uses them to truly simulate what it might be like to survive the Zombie Apocolypse.			"

If you're reding this you're probably wondering if you should buy this game or not?Well....to be honest i wasn't disapointed with the purchase of this game even though I'm not the biggest fan of zombie themed games/movies/books,...but i would recommend it getting it on sale (as most games on Steam). This game's got a pretty tense single player campaign in which you're trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. You start of with simple tutorial mission that introduces the basics of the game to you. After that...you're on your own.It's all about survival, gathering supplies, building outposts...all for your small community. What do I mean by small community? Well...if you think you'll be like f-ing rambo and go all out solo in this game you're wrong!The stamina is drained quickly and it doesn't replenish for quite some time if you're playing with one character for a long time, so you're kinda forced to play with more different characters. Mainly you can play with only one character and have some help in form of switching to other community members, while your main charaters' health or stamina is regenerating (unless you died :P ) . This is game is, like any other RPG games based on getting lots and lots of quest/mission/assigments (whatever you wanna call it). So you shouldn't be suprised if you get loads and loads missions trown at you wich will lead you running around (more or less) the whole map. And yeah, before you ask...it does get repetitive after a while!The combat system is really diverse...From fighting, slashing, whacking, shooting, drive thru-ing,...you name it, you got it! You get your adrenaline pumping when melee weapons gets destroyed , the guns gets jammed, the cars get wrecked and will explode after too much of ""abuse"" from all the zombie killing.I would defintly recommend this game for players who're seeking a lone wolf survival zombie game. Yeah it does have flaws and some bugs/glitches, but it is enjoyable experience. Also, the missing of CO-OP mode (wich this game should definitly have in my opinion) are the only 2 major things that can make you change your mind from purchase.The game's got 2 DLC's so far(Breakdown and Lifetime), wich can prolong your playing of this game.At the end of this review i would like to give a shoutout to Michael Jones from Rooster Teeth/Let's play youtube channel who made couple of let's play videos of this game that made up my mind about buying this game. Also a big shoutout to anybody rating this reviewP.S. :don't even bother to post insulting comments, cause I'm gonna ignore them :D			"

												It's a third-person shooter, sandbox, zombie survival game with roguelike and RPG elements. Stats and abilities level up from use, in a sensical way, and characters who die stay dead; you have to pick another survivor to play as if you die. Cars and supplies also stay permanently destroyed/scavenged. It's an interesting game, but I'll break it down quick:If you wanted a zombie survival game thats simply a sandbox where you try to survive and occasionally help others out and have little stories here and there, this is perfect. Don't expect a good story or characters though. They're flat as boards, as they're mostly randomly generated. Writing is okay I spose, few good chuckles and references as well as in the world. There's also not much of an ending. Felt dry. Gameplay wis it isnt bad though, fun to kill zombies, to scavenge, and play with the mechanics. A few missed opptunities for more expansive base-building, but still a nice leap from most 'strictly-shooter' zombie games. Still recommended to try out.			"

												Great game done RIGHT! The open-world zombie survival game you really wanted that also has a manageable base with facility upgrades, random misfortunes, and scavenging for stuff. Persistent world feature caught me off guard, but it was still fun knowing the world goes on without you. And a bonus! zombie references everywhere in this world. Have fun finding them c:The only glaring gripe I have for this game is that if you have a partner tagging along with you (from your base, not a story mission), you can't exchange items or anything really while they're standing a foot away from you outside of combat.I would love to see some multiplayer similar to what Left4Dead has done, with friends or something ""taking over"" a random non-storybased character from your base that isn't injured, on an optional  side mission, and/or past a certain community population (like 10 to 16 people or something).Otherwise this is an awesome game, go buy it if DayZ or Nether isn't to your particular taste.

												If you're a fan of zombie games even in the slightest, then this is the game for you. This game really hits home on how living in a zombie infested world should feel. If you don't forage for supplies, you die. If you don't keep up on your weapons, you die. If you are not meticulous about getting that last supply crate into the truck before the charging horde reaches you... You die. State of Decay is a wonderfully done game in the way that it doesn't quite feel like anything else. The idea is that you're on vacation when SHTF and you have to rally other survivors you find to build an encampment to combat the infected. You have to make sure it has good walls, ample food and shelter, and most important of all.. Quick, easy access to nearby supplies. Everything in this game is Finite. You WILL run out of supplies eventually. Blow up too many cars, and you won't have any left to drive. You really have to want to survive in order to get anywhere in this world and this game couldn't have done it any better. There were moments where I had a horde just behind me. I'm 50 yards from the truck. Do I run for it or dart off into a nearby building to try and lose them? Do I drop the bag of supplies I just collected, or hope for the best? Fire off some rounds at the risk of attracting more undead? The choice is yours. This game is entirely open world and completely non-linear. Play how you want. But you've been warned. How long will you fend off the State of Decay?			"

												One of the better ""survival"" type games that I've come across. It starts off a bit janky and crappy, but stick with it until you get out of the starting area. When you get a good idea of how the game works, it can suck you in completely. It's single player, which may be why it works so well, but there's undoubtedly some missed opportunity there. Maybe in a sequel. Regardless, if you're interested in a smallish open world zombie survival game where you round up survivors, gather supplies and construct bases, etc. - this is worth picking up. A definite buy if it's on sale.			"

												Not an immaculate game by any means but a very addicting and fun game. This is one of those special games that gets you hooked enough to look forward to a sequel with improved game mechanics. The ambitions of this game is quite impressive. In gameplay, many times, all the elements will flow perfectly and the whole game will really feel like an exciting struggle for survival. Each time you go outside your compound with a character there is slight hesitation as you aren't sure if your character will survive a scavaging run, because when a character dies it is permadeath and they are gone from the game for good. Other times, various bugs will break that immersion and become frusterating. However, despite those buggy occurances, the game still shines. There is a problem where the latter half of the game will become easier as you start to horde more weapons and supplies but that is the natural side effect of becoming much better at the game. I would have liked to have seen difficulty ramp up a bit more as you go on. Though I have to admit it is satisfying nearer to the end of the game when you can just walk down mainstreet with a .45 colt and caution thrown to the wind because your characters have become survival badasses. Overall, it's an easy game to recomend to anyone who enjoys zombie beat downs and survival/horror. A final positive: this studio has been really dedicated in trying to resolve bugs and continue to improve their product which is a really nice thing to see.			"

												While the game has lots of flaws, and monocyclic gameplay, it still provides replayability.I rightout bought it on Autumn Sale and have been hooked ever since.I went onto this games with not too high expectations, despite seeing its price and other critics.Some of the + :-RNG characters (except for few core ones)-Interesting RPG elements-Catching gameplay-A decent amount of new ideas-High Replayability due to the high amount of bases and RNG Events-Different and interesting story branches-You can choose to be the good, or the bad guy and your decisions have high impactSome of the - :-The quests are oddly repetitive ( Kill a Bloater, Kill a Feral Dude, Find this survivor, Inspect this Area since there COULD be a Scavenger in trouble)-The game suffers from very dull technics and Engine problems -The fighting system is very one-sided and does´nt provide much change even though there are 3 types of weapons-The game reaches its peek of interest too fast, after about 3 hours of gameplay it gets broken down to a few steps that you repeat until the next storyline-quest pops up-The DLC isn´t really worthwhile as it is basically copypasting the whole map and shrugs you into a new group of survivors which you need to carry on for a few lvlsI would give the game a 6/10 which is still in the recommendable Area, If you enjoy playing Zombie Hack & Slay with a few Strategic and RPG influences, go ahead, its basically Day-Z with bases.The game would get a 10/10 if the guys over at Undead Labs would have actually kept it in development for longer to implement and polish up already existing features, to make the game even deeper and overall a better experience.

												All I'm gonna say is this game ♥♥♥♥ings rocks. I don't so much wanna review it as just make sure new-comers know; I (along with many others I'm sure) greatly recommend poeple at LEAST try playing around with the George Romero mod settings, (just back up your save first. Things can get dangerous fast, don't wont that survivor you have been powerlevling for a week to get perma-ate) as far as mods ussually go in my opnion its pretty easy to follow. You can make the zombie population near impossible to survive, make them fast, make zombie attacks  more realistic and take surviors out in 1 bite, etc. Theres alot!

Because once you've completed the first couple of random missions, you will begin to see an obvious bland pattern. State of Decay is probably one of the best ""survival"" games I have played but shows just exactly why this genre won't ever really catch on.

												State of Decay is a great game. There is a great, open-world to explore, a church to upgrade, and yes, plenty of zombies to kill.  However, there are a few issues in the game, primarily the frame rate and zombie teleporting. The frame rate drops out of nowhere, stooping to rates of 5-10, though only for a second (long enough for you to get your neck chewed off).  Also, zombies to teleport and respawn almost instantainously, without your realizing. One for instance, popped right in front of me when I was barricaiding a room. Finally for the issues, there is perma-death.  That means, when you dead, YOU DEAD!!! But, none of these minor problems should stop you from playing one of the best zombie games in history.  Combat is fluid, and the ground take-downs are sick.  The amount of blood and gore also makes each swing of a spiked bat murderous and powerful.  Probably one of the game's highest strong points is the sound.  Each moan of a zombie and the shuffiling of the footsteps make your heart skip a beat and wonder where the heck that one (or two, or three) zombie is at.  All and all, State of Decay is an amazing game and an even better zombie survival RPG, witch shouldn't be passed up because of a few minor bugs.			"

												Great game for surviving a zombie apocalypse.  It takes a similar concept to Dead Rising when it comes to ""Oh there are various survivors around and if you ignore them they'll die"", but it's got a much more serious approach.  Noise matters, there are hordes that roam and wander, you have a base to upgrade/maintain.It's a blast to play, the story is nothing phenomenal but it is fairly interesting.  The most fun is setting up outposts, raiding for supplies, and just building up a strong base of survivors and protecting them.It's the zombie survival fantasy every zombie fan sits and talks about.

You are able to use guns, driving, crafting items and even building. But, don't go looting all resources in the beginning because they aren't infinite and try to make silencer soon as possible - any kind of noise will call more atention of nearby zombies.

												One of the better Zombie games I have played in awhile! Everything from the combat system to having to avoid large groups instead of trying to be a tank is what a post apocalyptic zombie survival is about. The game has cars loads of different items from wrenches to even kantas (one of my faves). there is skill progression so as you combat the zeds, your characters level up skill to help with running, combat, stamina, etc. The only thing that sucks is making sure to balance out characters because perma-death is a real thing in this game. build in character too much and rest will suffer when trying to scavange on their own and such.

Having full mouse and keyboard controls with remapping of keys is great.  Controls can be a bit awkward inside building but other than that no probs.  Guns are kinda weak, but may its engrossing trying to keep your survivors alive, having to go out on missions in the dark, etc.  Well worth full price, though a steal on its current daily sale.			"

												I don't know why this game was given such a low score, for an open world zombie survival game it is a LOT better than almost everything else out there.  It is true that it requires a little more polish (more survivers to potentially join you, more base upgrades, more manufacturing options, more gun types [melee weapon selection is pretty damn good], and maybe a few more possible areas for base locations), but that is just nick picking improvements on what is already pretty damn good.  The graphics are consistant and I haven't run into a glitch in the map yet, zombie types and general behaviour is great (the AI rarely does stupid stuff, unlike in many other games), and the voice acting (though somewhat repetative) is great.  I would definately recommend this game to anyone who loves zombie apocalypse survival games.			"

												This game isn't just another zombie survival game.  Although there are zombies, and quite a few main survival mechanics, the core gameplay is an RPG.  You use influence points in your community to build new things, take weapons and supplies from the storage chest, and even relocate to new bases.  All-in-all, not a perfect game, but it combines the scavenging and survival aspects that I love from zombie games and combines it with RPG aspects that are very well balanced.  The open world is beautiful and does a good job of not looking too repetitive.  Also for the price of just 20 USD, who can complain about what could be hundreds of hours of gameplay?			"

												One of the best Zombie Apocalypse game I've played so far, after ""The Last of Us"" of course, but I think it's a game worth having even if you play once in a while.It combines the adventure/fighting/shooting styles of various types of games, plus a sort of ""Sims"" society build and improvement based on the specific actions and quests you achieve, giving it a sort of RPG feeling to it.  It also offers the possibility to scavenge and retrieve items/meds and such or just go out there gather ammo/weapons and fight some zombies or just drive over them. Or just be stealthy and struggle for survival of the fittest.Therefor it's a game worth having as it offers various styles to have fun.			"

												Short Version Review:""Crashed a pickup truck into a guard rail, got stuck, got beset my 20 zombies pouring out of the nearest house and lived !  Thank you, sledge hammer!  Then rammed a junky little sports car into the truck over and over until it was off the rail.  Got the truck back, left the burning car .... Thumbs Up !!!""Slightly Lengthier Review:So far, so good !  To start, I'll begin with the disclaimer of ""I've never played a zombie apocalypse game before this one.""  Unless you count some of the Fallout Games ( mmmm ... a lot of those mutants were pretty similar to zombies ).  Anyways, after a couple of crash n' burns both figurative and literal, I'm on my 3rd run of this game and it's a pretty fun romp.  There's a whole steamin' pile of paranoia to be had exploring in the towns, trying to keep one eye on the stuff you're trying to scavenge, and another eye out the window for things that might be jumping through it, trying to eat you.  An ear to the ground also helps.  Screamers are no picnic.  And it also might help to drive a little better than me, b/c when I see a mass of zombies coming down the street at me, my gas pedal foot gets a mind of its own.  I've dented enough hoods, lost enough car doors, and blown up enough vehicles to fill a modest junkyard already.  Hmmm, and I'm still just barely into the storyline itself, b/c the act of survival from day to day is a story all on its own.Of course, no game's complete without at least a few gripes.  I wish some of the NPCs weren't so petty or inherently stupid.  Nothing says "" HEY, WE'RE OVER HERE !!! "" quite like the sentry on the tower wielding a shotgun instead of a high powered rifle and shooting multiple times at zombies on the fringe of shotgun range.  There used to be an ornery guy with a hat on the tower - he was a jerk, but at least he had a rifle - can't figure out how to get the girl with the shotgun to come down and put the sniper guy back up there .... or convince her to swap weapons ...The other gripes are fairly mild in comparison.  It's been a bit of a trick for me trying to figure out where the main storyline wandered off to after my original party stumbled half-chewed into this church compound.  We've been fighting to keep our sanity and our skins ever since.  Having a whole lotta fun, though - $5 well spent.			"

												7.5/10State of Decay is a lot of fun, but not without it's shortcomings. It plays a bit like GTA, but in a zombie apocalypse based world.It totally nails the feeling of holding back a never ending tide of undead, and slow looming desperation. The gameplay is simple, yet fun. Managing your base and survivors is cool, and you end up becoming attached to your favorites. (I actually restarted once because my ""main"" character got overrun by zombies.) Building up your base, and upgrading facilities was rewarding while not being overly in depth to the point it was annoying.The combat is easy to pick up, the weapons have variety, and the enemies have a decent amount of difference between them. I like how sound attracted enemies while scavenging for survival tools, and made it seem threatening to be out there, especially when alone. Gunshots attract anything in range of the noise as well (until you get a supressor), which made gunplay a double edged sword.The cons are: Random bugs with Zombie placement/walking through walls. Lack of quest variety, and being unable to do multiple quests at the same time. Overall, I was very pleased. While the game does get bogged down a bit in the late game due to lack of mission variety, it's a very enjoyable experience overall. It's the most realized apocalyptic world I've played in a game. No rails, you can go anywhere, and it's fascinating to see the world they've created. I'd totally recommend this to any Zombie game fan, or anyone wanting a solid gaming experience. Great bang for the buck!			"

												Zombies (l4d) + free roam rpg (gta3 ish in size) + wingman  + Carmageddon :-D  There are a few little frustrations in game mechanics around upgrades and moving stuff about (like baulders gate when it first came out) but you can get over this. My son said it is more like Shaun of the dead  than left 4 dead but there are still some fast ones and shocks a plenty even with the gamma up ;-) I have not progressed far enough but having a wingman/woman to hold a zombie while you blat it's head off can be really helpful. Finally probably my favourite bit of the lot is running Zombies down AKA Carmageddon. Getting your first door kill will make you feel like watching zombieland again :-) at this price worth a few hours of your life defiantly.			"

												Great game, while I shouldn't really compare this to a game like DayZ, it introduces many zombie survival mechanics that DayZ didnt. for starters the game has a simple but good combat system, LMB to melee, RMB to aim gun and RMB + LMB to fire, there is no need to go into your inventory to de-equip a melee weapon to equip a gun as both can be used at the same time. You can also perform finishing moves with Z and dodge zombie attacks with C. The game also takes a page from L4D and has unique zombies like juggernauts who are huge zombies that can deal a lot of damage and take it at the same time, you also have screamers which attract zombies and riot zombies which are like normal zeds except that are immune to gunfire requiring melee attacks. You are required to lead the group and can make important calls like setting up multiple outposts and improving and moving homes. You have to be very careful in this game and plan out things such as routes and manouvering around zombie hordes and special zeds, one wrong move and you can have your car tipped upside down about to explode with all of your rucksacks of ammo, medicine etc. inside or even have a whole horde chasing you while you have no ammo. Not much to complain right? Well no this game isnt perfect. The game is very repetive and can get boring when you are required to do the same mission in usually the same area over and over, however this hole can be filled with the other 2 DLC that you can download and the game still has loads of replay value. Also, I found that the characters were also boring as some even had the same voices and dialogue which is a shame as they could be more unique. This is still a great game that doesnt get the praise it deserves and if we could see a State Of Decay 2 with more improvements, then you will definitely see that on my wishlist. I am currently playing this game and would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap, singleplayer experience.Review 2:This game has only got better as I have played on. This game definetely makes zombies a huge threat unlike Day Z (sorry, I had to :0 ) and makes noise in the game have huge consequences. When you are searching containers you could make a loud noise, this causes a huge amount of zombies to swarm to your position; this is made worse by nearby hordes. I got cornered in a storage shed by 10-15 zeds because I reckless and tried to get everything quickly. My strongest character (Marcus) who has max shooting, melee and blunt weapons skills (backed up by a wrench and ak47 custom silenced) almost died from this and was seriously injured as the zeds kept attacking. This meant I couldn't take any out with my AK or wrench and had to find an small opening which was 1 door with 5% of Marcus's health remaining. This is true zombie apocalyspe survival, leaving you with near death experiences and adrenaline pumping. also, choices you make with survivors at the grange has huge consequences as Becca (sorry spoilers) died as I told Quinten she was a, oh how could I say this in the review?, an 'escort'. I now make sure I use quiet or silenced weapons as more powerful guns like the AK47 and River Snake generate a lot of noise (check the wiki for more details). Because of the noise made by the River Snake revolver, one of my group members died as zombies began to swarm us on a normal anger mangement mission. Play this game like you would with Day Z, with extreme caution and planning, as one wrong move can get you or your group members killed.Review 3: I am drawing near to the end of the game. I have actually got my chef killed at the hands of a feral which ripped him in half like a chocolate bar; now I am not sure if I want that achievment on my steam profile. I managed to build up an arsenal of weapons, which include 100+ melee weapons and 50+ guns (which include a few Automatic rifles and 2 50 Calibre rifles). fighting zombies is no easier with these guns as the ammo for my 50 cal guns are so rare that I only managed to collect 30+ rounds, this is further worsened by the guns stumbling recoil and extreme weight that can encumber a non powerhouse character. Since I am near the end I may as well just give you some tips for surviving the zombie apocalyse of State Of Decay. 1. When setting up a new home, always make sure you prioritise building a workshop and infirmary (and if possible a medical lab if you can get a library). This is because if you get injured or sick group members you can heal them back up to good health quickly, meaning they can hone their skills and do scavenging runs for you; having a workshop means you can repair your veichles which are very limited in this game aswell as make very important homemade supressors which benefit all of your characters. 2. Dont use inexperienced characters for tougher jobs. this is how my chef got killed. I sent him out to help an ally deal with a few zeds attacking her and what happens when I complete it? A feral an armoured zombies come after me and since ferals are the strongest and worst zed to face in the game, I was screwed with my 22. pistol and pipe wrench. The moral of the story is train you charcters, but always have an ally with you incase the freaks come knocking.3. USE STEALTH!!! Now yes stealth can be slow especially when scavenging, but it pays off as you will deal with less zeds and you will be less likely to get injured or killed. If there are zeds closing in on you while you are searching a container, then search it quicker and risk making noise as you will already have zombies trying to get through the doors and windows. If a horde spots you then either run away and find a car to escape or ram the horde, you could even (if you have the weapons and ammo) engage and destroy the horde so long as it doesnt attract more attention.

												First off; this is NOT a zombie killing game. It's a zombie survival game. There's a big difference in how you play.There's also Perma-death. As in ""I made the wrong decision, now that survivor is dead for good."" So don't spend all your time with one survivor. Because if they die your group will be left considereably weakened overall. That's right. Group. Think in terms of ""Group survival"" not run-n-gun and you'll be fine.Don't worry though, as the game's not that hard once you figure the mechanics out. Deaths usually involve people running around overconfident in their ""skill"" at the game, only to aggro several passing Hoards and getting torn to shreds. It's about sneaking. It's about survival. It's not about running about like an idiot, thinking you can take on the entire world alone. I finished the Story mode without a single non-plot related death, after thirty-odd hours. Change the way you play zombie games and you'll find endless enjoyment, especially with the latest Breakdown DLC. That adds a fully story-free Sandbox mode, with lots of Story mode ""Hero"" character challenges to unlock.Watch a few youtube Let's Play clips like I did. Then buy it!*Note: This game has been on 50% sale in the past, so watch out for them in the future. Highly recommended.			"

												Awesome apocalyptic-survival game. This game focuses more on gathering ressources, having good relations with other communities, survive as a group, than kill every zombie you see, and scavenge everything. For some, this is what they don't like, and other, what they prefer. In my case, I fall in love with the open world, the different communities all over the map, and the fact that you actually have to survive in GROUP. Anyone that liked The Walking Dead series on TV should love this piece of art. The only concern are the graphics (no advanced settings), and some zombies issues (they go through walls sometimes, they fall under porch, etc). Out of 10, I'd give it a 8.5.

												Not an immaculate game by any means but a very addicting and fun game. This is one of those special games that gets you hooked enough to look forward to a sequel with improved game mechanics. The ambitions of this game is quite impressive. In gameplay, many times, all the elements will flow perfectly and the whole game will really feel like an exciting struggle for survival. Each time you go outside your compound with a character there is slight hesitation as you aren't sure if your character will survive a scavaging run, because when a character dies it is permadeath and they are gone from the game for good. Other times, various bugs will break that immersion and become frusterating. However, despite those buggy occurances, the game still shines. There is a problem where the latter half of the game will become easier as you start to horde more weapons and supplies but that is the natural side effect of becoming much better at the game. I would have liked to have seen difficulty ramp up a bit more as you go on. Though I have to admit it is satisfying nearer to the end of the game when you can just walk down mainstreet with a .45 colt and caution thrown to the wind because your characters have become survival badasses. Overall, it's an easy game to recomend to anyone who enjoys zombie beat downs and survival/horror. A final positive: this studio has been really dedicated in trying to resolve bugs and continue to improve their product which is a really nice thing to see.			"

												State of Decay is a delightful game to play. It does have replay value when it comes to the main story, Lifeline, and Breakdown. Now I do have a few complaints, however, but my overall view on the game is still good.The first and foremost complaint would be that there is no co-op. Of course what they did do for it as a substitute is use the in-game AI characters as your partners (the player can ask another member from the home base/community to come watch your back). I do like that idea, but they could have had the option to also have 2-4 player co-op.My second reason would be that there's not really any sort of dynamic weather system in the game. It would of course add to the atmosphere a little and make it seem slightly more like a realistic world, but the overall game is, of course, not a simulator. I just think that, in my opinion, dynamic weather would make the game a little more interesting in a way. Like the rain could affect the zombies somehow or the rain could cause some flooding down in Marshall. Or perhaps some snowy, cold weather that affects everyone. And fog which affects how far you see, so you can't see your enemies (zombies) coming as soon as you want.And the final reason would be a gas system. You know, for the vehicles. And I know in Lifeline there is a gas system for the generator, but that's only until you upgrade it into a solar powered generator. You, as the player, probably will use cars a lot throughout the game, so why not add in a gas system? Because how I see it, gas looks like the last resource you'll have left over that you'll have the most of. Now that's all I have to say about this game. And those reasons above don't really ruin the game for me and make me hate it, I just think it'll add to the experience and make it better. (Well, perhaps not the co-op for some because some people might have some troll-ish friends that'll like.... bring hordes to you, or leave you to battle with the mutated zombies, or even make sure you have to go a long distance just to get a car.)

												There are a few good ideas in this game, but that won't save it.Good:-Zombie Survival, with an emphasis on survival (food/supply hunting)-Scouting ahead for camps/points of interest and planning where to go is fun!Bad:-Rough combat. It's just not fun or engaging. Hit zombie with board, board eventually breaks, rinse repeat, nothing new here.-Terrible story (To be fair, I didn't play for very long, but you feel nothing for these characters aside from the feeling that the game will be harder without them)-Pretty bad UI. Like, pre-mod Skyrim on PC with keyboard and mouse bad. I hear it's designed with a controller in mind though, so that may help.-Zombies feel too weak. They only pose a slight threat when there is a group, and even then you can outrun them with ease, or just smack them a few times with no real issue. While in the later game, this may change, but I don't want to stick around and find out.I feel bad because I didn't play too long to get a full feel for the game, but when the start of the game is so cookie-cutter and by-the-books, I'm pretty sure I'm not missing out on the rest. Hopefully a sequel will expand on their good ideas.			"

												Truly one of the best value for money games I have ever bought. If you want to go on a zombie killing spree, you'll actually have to plan escape routes, bring supplies and be very mindful of what's going on around you, because if you go ahead and facetank the horde, you're gonna get murdered pretty quick!It incorporates what I don't see enough of in general zombie survival games, the SURVIVAL factor. You need to gather and store supplies in order to keep everything running correctly. Strength is in numbers, but the more people you recruit, the more supplies you have to dish out to everyone. If you don't meet your daily quota of supplies, then your camp can fall ill, or your defences can be weakened, etc. However, supplies are not in such a high demand that you'll find it a chore to go and find them, they balanced the feature very well.All in all, this is one of the most perfect zombie games that I've ever seen, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's up for a survival game, and not just a mindless hack & slash.

												This is my dream game - SANDBOX zombie survival. Not only you kill zombies using everything you can fine (similar to the Dead Island), but you also manage your base, procure multiple resources (which you need to maintain the base, upgrade and modify it), trade resources with other survival groups, train your survivors, send them on exploration / resource gathering, build outposts, steal and drive damn cars! As someone called it - GTA with zombies. You can also change between almost all of your surivors and play for your favourite one while the others are resting or working at the base. Overall, it's sweet treat for us, PC gamers, who are still waiting for the PC version of GTA V. The only downside of SoD (State of Decay) is that currently you need to have an XBOX controller to play the game.As of 28/09/2013, the game is in early-access mode, but I've noticed only two minor bugs that do not impact the gameplay - zombies stucked in textures and a minor texture glitch when you look at the mountains.My score - 10/10			"

If you're reding this you're probably wondering if you should buy this game or not?Well....to be honest i wasn't disapointed with the purchase of this game even though I'm not the biggest fan of zombie themed games/movies/books,...but i would recommend it getting it on sale (as most games on Steam). This game's got a pretty tense single player campaign in which you're trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. You start of with simple tutorial mission that introduces the basics of the game to you. After that...you're on your own.It's all about survival, gathering supplies, building outposts...all for your small community. What do I mean by small community? Well...if you think you'll be like f-ing rambo and go all out solo in this game you're wrong!The stamina is drained quickly and it doesn't replenish for quite some time if you're playing with one character for a long time, so you're kinda forced to play with more different characters. Mainly you can play with only one character and have some help in form of switching to other community members, while your main charaters' health or stamina is regenerating (unless you died :P ) . This is game is, like any other RPG games based on getting lots and lots of quest/mission/assigments (whatever you wanna call it). So you shouldn't be suprised if you get loads and loads missions trown at you wich will lead you running around (more or less) the whole map. And yeah, before you ask...it does get repetitive after a while!The combat system is really diverse...From fighting, slashing, whacking, shooting, drive thru-ing,...you name it, you got it! You get your adrenaline pumping when melee weapons gets destroyed , the guns gets jammed, the cars get wrecked and will explode after too much of ""abuse"" from all the zombie killing.I would defintly recommend this game for players who're seeking a lone wolf survival zombie game. Yeah it does have flaws and some bugs/glitches, but it is enjoyable experience. Also, the missing of CO-OP mode (wich this game should definitly have in my opinion) are the only 2 major things that can make you change your mind from purchase.The game's got 2 DLC's so far(Breakdown and Lifetime), wich can prolong your playing of this game.At the end of this review i would like to give a shoutout to Michael Jones from Rooster Teeth/Let's play youtube channel who made couple of let's play videos of this game that made up my mind about buying this game. Also a big shoutout to anybody rating this reviewP.S. :don't even bother to post insulting comments, cause I'm gonna ignore them :D			"

												State of Decay is one of those games where you've decided only a few hours in you've already decided that you want a sequal, but have found the game only decently enjoyable. The premise is solid, survive the zombie apocolypse by creating a fortress from which you search for survivors, savenge supplies, and build defenses. Many actions, such as resource depletion and base upgrades, happen in real time, meaning if you queue up a hefty infirmary upgrade, you can leave the game and when you come back it will be closer to depletion. In addition, resources like food and mdicine slowly drain over time, requiring more careful managemnent. The real-time aspect is reminiscent of those free to play mobile games, except not a mind numbing cash cow. Some players have complained that mechanic unfairly punishes players that don't play often, but the develpors claim that not playing for a week or even a year will have only neglible negative impact on your game. Personally, I have not owned the game long enough to comment on this.While these core functions are mostly well implemented and enjoyable, the game is marred by poor and sometimes baffling develpoment decisions and details. The game allows the player to switch between any character they have become friends with as currently used players become tired or injured, but for no apparant reason there is no way to swap items between them except by selling them to the shop and buying them back at an increased price. Many of the missions are incredibly poorly designed, the most notable of which are the ""besieged"" side missions. These missions task the player with ""defending the perimeter"" of another groups house, but the awkward camera angles and inabily to melee through windows make the battles far drawn out than they need to be. In fact, the game seems to reward doing the opposite of your mission and letting them in to fight them inside the house. The other side missions all revolve around the same few mission types, none of which are much better than this one. The game also does a poor job informing the player of even basic game mechanics like adding recruiting survivors, something which would have required minimal briefing in game.Despite it's flaws, the game is still enjoyable. The combat is fluid and satisfying (though occaisonally the mouse and keyboard controls leave something ro be desired). The graphics look great for the most part, except when faced with long draw distances the ground textures are tiny and ugly. The voice acting is mostly solid, but repeated background dialogue gets annoying after a while. All in all This is a solid game, definitly worth a buy if the premise sounds intereting to you, or during a decent sale			"

Describing it with the hit name series is much simplier for me than to explain what State of Decay is about, but, lets get to it anyways. :)State of Decay brings you to a world with set objectives and has a storyline.

Infection is everywhere and the spawn system on the zombies can be you're dieing breath. Minor bugs do happen but overall the gameplay makes up for it.

												Besides the side missions getting repetitive, everything else is awesomely good. If you only going for the main mission, this game is relatively short. This is an open world game and it is really fun to explore and running around killing zeds. The graphic is fantastic for a start. Tons of melee weapons, guns, bombs, mines and medication, as well as distraction devices to use against the zeds. Setting up outposts, be able to move base, be able to build facilities, so many options of how you wanna play the game! Furthermore, you are able to find  survivors out there, so you would be able to switch between characters, as to level and upgrade them as you see fit. If one of your character dies, it will be gone forever within current playing game, however since you find new survivors, you will be able to switch to another character to play and it is never an issue to lose a character at all.

												If you like zombie survival games, you want this one. State of Decay is one of those rare gems that started out on the Xbox Arcade and was developed under that whole 2GB limit. I honestly would love to have seen what Undead Labs would have been able to do with this if they were not working under such restraints.The base game itself can play out in a number of ways. You have several bases to choose from, various weapons, vehicles that have their own set of stats (fast and flimsy or slow and durable). The main game has a storyline that can take a while to complete, an advancement system that lets you choose a set of skills to specialize for each person as you level them up (easy to miss if you're new, second tab in the character screen), and a colorful set of characters.The Breakdown DLC is the survival mode you want to play. This does have some drawbacks though; luckily it's not that expensive. Breakdown removes the story mode and puts you in the Trumbull map. After a while you'll find an RV, repair it, and move on to the next map. The next map is the same map but with harder zombies, more spawns, and a higher chance of being torn to pieces.Where my grievances come in with this DLC is the character parts were done a bit lazy. Most don't have their regular voices from the original game. Pastor Will has Ed's voice in mine and was once telling me how he got laid behind a park bench or something. So while minor, it's noticeable.(Edit: Adding in some new info now that I've had a chance to play Lifeline and the updates to fix things are likely finished) There are still some lingering glitches even after several updates, one of the most notable being that some zombies can at times run through the house and get stuck in the floor, Big'un zombies can sometimes glitch through doors and lead to mission failures or the death of a playable character if you're really unlucky. The Lifeline DLC is it's own map and introduces several new characters, weapons, and vehicles. While it's a fun little game with its own unique story to the SoD world, it offers less freedom than the original. In Lifeline you will have access to many new techs to help fight off the zombie hoards while you evacuate survivors. But as time goes on, you'll lose some of these advantages. Luckily you can get them back later, but the tradeoff is you'll have to sacrifice your outposts to certain areas to maintain them. You also work on a bit of a timer throughout the game. Hoards will periodically atack your base and you'll need to be back there to help fight them off or bad things will happen.All in all, Lifeline is a pretty decent story on its own, but I think the original game still stands as the better of the two.Overall, I can't recommend this one enough for fans of zombie survival and building games. With any luck Undead Labs will have a chance to expand on this one in the future and make something truly unique.			"

												This game is amazing. I bought it on the Xbox 360 and was dissapointed by the choppy framerate. The game could barely run at 30fps on console so I was really excited when I got State of Decay on PC and of course the game runs like butter on my rig. The game is a ton of fun and I have put about 40 hours into it and I plan on putting 40 more into it. My one gripe that I will get out of the way is that we had to pay for the Breakdown DLC (the sandbox mode) which was supposed to be apart of the intial release, but I got it on sale so I brushed that off. The story mode is a nice experience that you really don't have to follow, but if you want to progress, you might as well do it. It has a sense of urgency to it like the original Dead Rising (one of my favorite games) on the Xbox 360. You build a community, gather resources and help out other survivors while engaging in the main quest. However, do yourself a favor and buy the Breakdown DLC. This is where I put and will be putting the majority of my time in. This mode is fantastic and takes away the linear aspect of a main quest. You can play it for as long as you want or until you run out of the finite resources on the map. I love how you can play as a ton of survivors with their own traits and even have one tag along to help you. The permadeath feature is terrifying and getting attacked by more than 2 zombies makes you ♥♥♥♥ yourself. Every encounter is a white knuckle ordeal because you do not want your survivor to die. The survivors can be leveled up and specialized with adds some depth and personality to them. Minus a few glitches here and there, you can get passed them very easily. Plus, there is a decent amount of mods to help your State of Decay experience. For $20, you will get your money out of this game or $27 with the DLC. Must buy!			"

If you're into zombie survival genres, I would definitely recommend this (especially when its on sale).There are a few negative things about the game though - Firstly some of the animations look pretty bad (including sliding down ladders, combat) and the controls take a little getting used to. But overall, it's different to other zombie games - having to look after and care for a survivng community, and driving from place to place stocking up on supplies. I'd give it a 8/10			"

												Sizeable map, Large arsenal of weapons, and Infinte replayability(with the DLC). The three things to look for in any survival RPG are here.Scavenge for supplies while sneaking around zombies or, maybe if that isnt your style then just clear the area of zombies then loot without a care.Take back crates of ammo, food, and supplies to fortify your base and satiate the desires or needs of your group.With the promise of additional features to be added such as a true sandbox mode; this is truely worth your purchase.9/10 and two thumbs up (10/10 - if they had added drop in drop out multiplayer)			"

												This game is incredible.  The way it's setup makes it unique to all other zombie games.  You have the requirements to build your home that aren't quite realistic but they are to an amusing level.  The game makes you constantly with you could stay out to get more, or come home and switch characters.  You can add more people to your community through gaining their trust or helping them to your home.  The fighting is done well, frantic to not let them grab you, which is perfect.  A loose open rpg story lets you roam around and build up your home until you've exhausted the map's supplies.  The game is good, let's just leave it at that.			"

												(06/10) - GoodI actually just played the ""breakdown"" mode, so all i can say is based on that.Ever wanted to know how it feels like beeing part of the series ""the Walking Dead""? Well, here is your chance.This game captures the feeling perfectly and transfers you into a world of survival where every false move will be your last. From managing the survivors you are leading to prevent their after all inevitable fate over calculating the movement of zombie hordes while having to go on scabage runs which become more and more dangerous to making sure of your own safety.My stamina is low. Should i shoot that zombie running towards me so i can finish of the other one with my wrench? Should i throw something to distract the zombies in my immediate surroundings so i can simply run from those two? Should i run to the next building, barricade myself inside, sending a distress call to my group hoping i last that long?Yeah. If you ever wanted to actually play something like that, i can assure you: This game will not let you down!			"

												The game, while fun and enjoyable, does still lack some of the polish that is typically expected by a casual gamer. It can be buggy at times and some areas of the game, namely the missions, are in some need of clarification. The difficulty of the game is fairly balanced aside from the occasional buggy encounter with a zombie horde. Companion AI is decent, but if you're planning for your allies to not walk into molotov fires... well... then you'll have a problem. Also, as a pc port of a xbox game, the graphics are pretty painful if you're used to pretty sparkly scenery. Assuming a graphics enhancement comes out that point is negligible, currently though the biggest hurdle you will encounter is seeing whats going on. Still, it's a pretty solid game.  10/10 for concept and game elements, 5/10 for execution.   If they had more money/time to polish this game then it would have been perfect.			"

												This is a pretty great game. Nice little zombie survival; got a band of people, save more to add to your band, collect supplies to sustain them, find weapons to protect them, build a base for them. Its pretty addictive, and the achievements are pretty fun too.Some things you'll either like or hate: no save points (dead is dead, a destroyed car full of suppies is gone), time passes while the game isn't running. There are ways around both of those using external programs like Zombie Standard Time if they annoy you. "

												A (failed) experiment trying to bridge the gap between super realistic grimdark shooters like Stalker and sandbox games. It falls a bit short on both ends and turns into a tedium simulator if you don't just beeline to the finish. Haven't played the DLC so I can't comment either way about if those have improved upon the shortcomings of the baseline game.If you really like zombies and sandbox games, then you may get more mileage out of it than I did.

												Really enjoyed State of Decay, but thought people died way too easily in Lifeline DLC.  Lifeline has great deal more guns, some new base upgrades, but don't like the fact that people die so easily plus you gotta worry about threat level of zombie attacks on the base so frequently.  I know others will disagree with me, but hey, it's my opinion.  I like to explore and level up my characters.  It seems like you don't have that luxury so much in Lifeline DLC. Double thumbs up for State of Decay though.			"

												This game is amazing. For a smaller studio this is really a very worthwile venture. The game puts you into a familiar zombie apocalypse. Only this time, you not only work with your team to kill zombies... but together to survive for the long haul. Killing zombies may be a necessity at times but it is no way a major goal of this game. If you can collect food, fuel, materials, medicine and/or ammo without combat, more power to you. Build your base. Place strategic outposts. Then Outlast.The game has a fresh experience to a very familiar genre. I actually felt anxiety at the prospect of losing a favored character. (damn ferals!) For when they die, the are G.O.N.E. to great beyond. It's the ""one more turn"" sort of action that makes 4 hrs go by in a blink. The only major drawbacks is that to some the action may be to similiar sometimes. However, different characters can be affected by your decisions and the challenges you choose. Secondly, there is a big lack of a in game guide/help screen. This is the real short coming of the developer as this would be simple enough to fix.Overall, worth it's full price in my mind. This is what the Walking Dead should have put out as their game (aside from the TellTale which was amazing, this should have been Survival Instinct) I can't wait for a new map.			"

												The pinnacle of zombie games, State of Decay has raised the bar for any future zombie games. The mix of base building, driving simulator, and fighting comes together to bring a satisfying experience. My favorite, is the fact that zombies can only be killed with headshots. Add to that the fact that your gunshots will bring more zombies and you have a very finite amount of ammunition and you will end up slugging it out with a 2x4 and golf club. There are no such thing as electrified machetes or goofy weapons. The game has a good mixture of realism without forgetting it is a game. Another aspect is that you dont just play as one character. You can play as any of the survivors that are in your community. Each has there own set of skills and abilities. In the end, this is the zombie game we have been waiting for.			"

												""Puts the survival back in Survival Horror.""Honestly, if you are a fan of new experiences. Buy this game. If you have been waiting for a game in which allows you to fully experience a zombie apocalypse, exlpore a vast and intricate world, and survive by gathering a community and working together, buy this game. It's not just about death and carnage, it's about living.As for Compatibility, port, graphics, and etc, it is honestly not the best. The game is aesthetically beautiful and the lighting is fantastic, but don't go in expecting Crysis or Metro because remember, this was originally exclusive to Xbox 360. It runs pretty smoothly, but has noticable framerate issue when driving occaisionally and seems to have processing issues when you are fighting inordinate amounts of zombies towards the end.After playing so many Zombie games in my lifetime, I can honestly say that State Of Decay is the most unique. What I mean by that is that it's not simply a zombie killing simulator. This game allows you to build a community however you want, and spend your time making the community a better place and gathering resources for survival, all while a zombie apocalypse threatens to take everything you have. It's cheap, will give you a good 20 hours of satisfying gameplay during the main story, and has magnificent replay value. You won't regret buying this game.			"

												A game very different from L4D / Walking Dead series but it still provides a nice immersion about zombie appocalypse.In the game, you must take care of each other, gather resources, and search for new survivors. You are able to use guns, driving, crafting items and even building. But, don't go looting all resources in the beginning because they aren't infinite and try to make silencer soon as possible - any kind of noise will call more atention of nearby zombies. If you run out of materials, try to trade with neighbour survivors, always work.			"

												I had been following State of Decay, when it was known as Class 3. There was just a snippet of an announcement back in like 2010 or 2011.I was extremely glad the game to PC. Anways on to the review. I'll keep it short and sweet.The game is very, very fun. It offers something you really can't find in other Zombie games. The open world and the ability to do what you want, when you want, is fantastic. Graphics are alright, nothing spectacular but are still good. Story is pretty decent, as this iteration of the game is mainly story. The DLC Breakdown, will allow full sandbox, and it will get progressively harder. Gameplay mechanics are not bad. The game can be arcadey with driving which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it can be very entertaining to mow hordes of zombies down. Probably one of the most important aspects of the game is saving survivors and building a community. You'll have preset locations where you can set up your base. You'll be able to build building modules into for example: Kitchen, Watchtower, Storage, Infirmary, Bunks, Workshop. They modules will you give you bonuses for various things.You'll need to go out and collect supplies to get the community running, and the game keeps track of time, so if you come back the next day, there might have been some developments. However, if that's a turn off, there are ways to shunt it so you don't have to worry about losing everything you worked for.I've spent nearly a hundred hours in the game even though my review won't reflect it, but I can say there is a lot of replay value in the game! In my humble opinion, this is the best Zombie game I've ever played. It scratches an itch that I had for so long!			"

If you don't forage for supplies, you die. If you don't keep up on your weapons, you die.

You have to make sure it has good walls, ample food and shelter, and most important of all.. Quick, easy access to nearby supplies. Everything in this game is Finite. You WILL run out of supplies eventually. Blow up too many cars, and you won't have any left to drive. You really have to want to survive in order to get anywhere in this world and this game couldn't have done it any better. There were moments where I had a horde just behind me. I'm 50 yards from the truck. Do I run for it or dart off into a nearby building to try and lose them? Do I drop the bag of supplies I just collected, or hope for the best?

												I really enjoyed this game, bugs aside. This was a great survival game, about collecting resources, survivors and fending off hordes of zombies. Although, the original and the DLC Lifeline have a general storyline, the game is fairly open world. You can choose who you want to recruit and how you want to train them. You can design your own home base, or select from different locations around the map. The bugs at time can be a little frustrating, most irritating is how the AI will stand around and do nothing while you get pulled apart by zombies. Sometimes AI quests won't trigger, or when they do, the AI will run off into oblivion. This is where I get frustrated with the no-save aspect of this game. I don't mind losing a crew member if I honestly did something stupid, however, I hate losing a crew member due to the lack of AI intelligence.			"

												This is an absolute treasure.  The future of open-world zombie survival is HERE.  A delight to play, it's approachable to open-world and linear fans alike.  Get pulled into the vast gorgeous atmosphere, learn about the different quirks and backstories of your fellow survivors, uncover the mystery behind the zombie outbreak!  You can play the way YOU want, hand to hand, firearms, blunt weapons...it's all up to YOU.  Gather resources to strengthen your community, decide what's most important to your survival from a kitchen area to a library, customize your safe haven however you see fit, and GOOD LUCK in this world where everyone is expendable!

												If Infestation left a bad taste in my mouth, then this game really clensed the pallet. The arcadeyness in this game really gives it a fresh feel, and not just another Day Z clone but single player. I love how the game puts you right in the action from the get go, and the hand holding is minimal, I have been learning as I go which is a nice suprise. Definitely a gem and well worth the Steam Sale price. "

												Truly one of the best games of it's time and genre.State of Decay is a unique game with its open world gameplay and numerous custom features, combined with the ability to fully control all your survivors and their quirky antics and you've got a great game in the making.Once I start playing it's hard for me to turn the game off, it defintely immerses you into the whole zombie apocalypse aura.

												One of the best zombie games out there for sure. The only problem about this game is that it only has a singleplayer. If the developers of this game would make an multiplayer in the same style this would be a very good game I am sure.			"
