												How to solve a puzzle in Infinifactory:1) Look at the output and think, ""That's not so hard, let me put this here and that over there.""2) Run your experiment.3) Swear because it's nowhere near what you thought it would be.4) Swear again.5) Come up with a rickety solution that works under one use case but falls apart on others. (This is exactly like some real-world programming!)6) Marvel as your friends come up with more elegant, faster solutions.7) Realize that you're having a tremendous time.I don't know what Zachtronics has against the human brain or why he wants to punish it so, but I encourage his behavior. Great game, they've been very good about expanding it and refining puzzles. Recommended.			"

												It's straightforward.  The mechanics are simple.  The purpose is clear.  There's no confusion as to what you are expected to do and what tools you have to do it.  It's diabolical.  The puzzles are sometimes bananas, requiring some pretty twisted logic and lateral thinking.  While you strive for a solution, there's a constant nagging feeling that sometimes your solution is just inelegant and you need to do it better.It's oddly darkly humorous.  There's a strange undercurrent of defiance against your alien overlords, from listening to the audio diaries of the project managers who came before you, from resenting the food pellets that drop into your cell when you complete sections of the game.It's also gorgeous - not so much in graphics, which are perfectly adequate, but in the efficiency of the presentation.  No main menu.  No weird visual effects cluttering up the screen. No unnecessarily ostentatious setpieces.  No splash screen! On load, the game drops you right into where you left, so you can literally load the game and get building.  There's a gorgeousness to seeing your machine, your factory do its work, and the satisfaction that comes with it makes the effort all the more worth it.It's one of the most interesting puzzle games I've ever played, and I'm enjoying it hugely despite not being great at coming up with particularly creative solutions.

								If you haven't tried zachtronics games you are missing a great deal of puzzles. This time they come back with mindtwisting manufacturing puzzle. Although it's called ""Early access"" the bugs are minor (haven't got a crash, but some options are missing) and developer is actively involved in both puzzle tweaking and further development.As for the game itself? It's very polished. Puzzles are start out easy enough and involve some that are easy but not obvious (a thing that is missing in A LOT of other games) until they get harder and harder. Each level (probably while it's in early access) features a questionnaire asking for your opinion of this level. All in all this is very good and game for all puzzle lovers and constructive mind people.			"

								This game is freaking awesome. Don't let the Early Access tag scare you, because it's pretty far off, and it's already worth every full-priced penny in it's current state even if the developer decided to walk away tomorrow (which I'm sure Zach will not do)The best thing about this game (and SpaceChem before it) is the awesome feeling of ""♥♥♥♥ yeah, I'm such a badass for doing this♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, that you get after each level completed. And in a way you are, as this game is a lot harder and smarter than most games out there.Pros: - ""I'm such a bad♥♥♥♥♥quot; feeling- Great tutorial/intro- 3 solution slots per level- Spacechem pyramid dangling in the rear view mirror in the intro- Learning curve is very well balanced- Stable and polishedCons:- No in-game recording and sharing tool (ok, this shouldn't be a Con, but we got spoiled...)- No or too few data points to compare performance (this will turn into a Pro later, as this feature is awesome)Graphics are functional but nothing to write home about, neither Pro nor Con, but certainly good enough.I recommend you pick this up at full price if you can, as this is one developer that deserves more money so he can make more good stuff like this. The fact that H1Z1 is topping the top selling list while people put this game on their wishlists waiting for a sale just makes me want to cry. So go ahead and pick this one up sooner rather than later. "

												Infinifactory does this thing I love. It makes you earn your enjoyment of it. You load up your next task and take a look at what you'll need to produce and what materials you'll have to produce it with. Immediately, some ideas start popping and you think, ""Okay, I know what to do."" Ten minutes later, everything's wrong and you realize you were being naive. But you keep building and trying things because that's just who you are. An hour later, things start to click. You still feel dumb as bricks but you're at least smarter than you were ten minutes ago. Then, long after you began, you have a working production facility. You are a genius. The smartest of the smart. Nothing can bring you down from this high.Then you get to see how your solution rates against everyone else who's finished that same factory and it turns out you're actually pretty much middle-of-the-road. But maybe you can go back and adjust some things and score better? Or maybe you've learned some things and maybe your vision and clarity has leveled up and just by starting fresh you can shave your score by half?Whatever the case, you have had a blast. You've been challenged for the first time in who knows how long. You've had fun and by all the things that you might even consider swearing on, you've earned that fun.____SpaceChem is one of my favourite puzzle games of all time. I adore its design and its open-ended puzzles. I was interested in Infinifactory because I liked SpaceChem. I was also skeptical. I didn't like the idea of doing puzzles in a 3D space. I didn't like the aesthetic. I didn't like the whole factory concept. I needn't have worried. Infinifactory is actually probably better than SpaceChem. Which hurts me to say. But it doesn't hurt too much because I'm busy having tons of fun. "

												I can be very brief about this game:If you like Zachtronic's SpaceChem, you will like Infinifactory.If you love SpaceChem, you will love Infinifactory. If you hate SpaceChem, you will hate Infinifactory even more.If you think SpaceChem is too hard, you will find Infinifactory undoable.If you never played SpaceChem, what are you waiting for? There is a free demo available. And if you enjoy it, rest assured that you will enjoy Infinifactory too.Heartily recommended for all those who love tough puzzles and enjoy building complex machines.			"

								Spacechem in 3D -- Still in space, and still one of the very best puzzle titles you can play. It is one of the elite that can occupy your mind long after you shut the game down. I find myself in conversation, or trying to work, or watching TV with the family, but my brain is ELSEWHERE, dreaming of new algorithmic design patterns and potential optimizations. Even when I'm sick of this game and abruptly close it out of frustration, more than once I have booted it immediately back up.You will emerge from the other end of this tunnel, bloody and blackened with industrial soot. And you will be the better person for it. THE END			"

												I should've made a review for Infinifactory some time back but I kept putting the time off, waiting for the time when I could make a review worthy of such a fantastic game.  I fear I will never be able to do the game justice, so here goes with a short review as ideas simply pop into my head!As you can notice from my first parapgraph I think extremely highly of Infinifactory.  For some time I was searching for a puzzle game with great replayability.  I heard about and played Spacechem, which is an impossible game not to mention when reviewing Infinifactory.  Both are developed by Zachtronics and both employ identical mechanic, but Spacechem is in 2D and Infinifactory is 3D.The essence of the game is to take some materials as an input and manipulate them via building a machine/factory from different types of blocks to conform to the required output.  So you may have to rotate and weld two different types of blocks together or receive a broken item, remove the broken parts and replace them with good parts.  The variety of puzzles is very good and you don't feel like you're repeating the same processes during your progression.The beauty of both games is that each puzzle can be solved in maybe an infinite variety of ways, so once you have made a solution you can go back and attempt to streamline various factors of your machine : footprint, cycles and blocks used.  Very similar to engineering projects in the real world!  Hopefully some of your friendlist will also play the game as in game leaderboards are included for each puzzle to further the replayability.  There are slots to save three of your machines for each of the puzzles, so you can purpose build a machine for each of the scoring criteria e.g focus one machine solely on having the smallet footprint possible even if it is at the expense of being less efficient and having an increased cycle count.I'm approaching 60 hours into the game and I am half-way through the second campaign of the two.  I've gone back and fine-tuned a few of my older machines and completed a couple of the community made puzzles.  There are literally hours and hours of gameplay available.  I'm generally not a ""sandbox"" type of guy either so Zachtronics have definietly managed to include the magic ingredient with this one.A lovely feature of the game is to be able to export animated gifs from a static camera point of your working machine, which will loop infinitely.  It can be very satisfying to construct a particulaly nice process within your factory and watch it loop over-and-over.The game has a slightly comedic and quirky story that holds the levels together and they progress in difficulty at a nice rate.  The levels get a bit easier when you start the second campaign and then begin to ramp up again!  There are some tough levels which may put off a few people that don't enjoy a mental challenge.  I found myself trying to solve some of the puzzles in my head whilst at work!!This is one of my favourite games of 2015 so the question of whether I recommend it is not a tough one at all!!  It's easily worth the full price, I bought the game in a sale and feel a little ashamed for doing so!			"

Early Access Review
								The best way to describe Infinifactory is that it is a more accessible version of Zachtronic's previous SpaceChem. It's still about using tools to assemble and disassemble block-based assemblies, but because it is in 3D, and is much easier to visualize the pathways things will take, it is much easier to grasp how to construct machines to do the various tasks.The puzzles currently included in the game are still hard - this is not a walk in the park and once you get past a half-dozen puzzles, the challenge bumps up greatly.  However, the game gently introduces new block types - with minimal instructin but obvious application, so getting your mind around these puzzles can be easily done.  And like SpaceChem, all you are trying to do is get a working solution to start, but then using the histrograms of friends and other players, try to go back and improve your scores. And as you process, you'll learn new tricks and means to tighten up and reduce production time on earlier puzzles.Add that, like Spacechem, the game includes user-made puzzle support through Steam Workshop, and this has a very long playability. The price might seem a bit high compared to Zachtronics' earlier games but it definitely has great value for that.Further, one should not be afraid of this being Early Access. Zachtronics has polished this entry to be near-final form, planning on only updates in user experience, content, and other non-essential but beneficial features to be added with Early Access feedback.

								OMG!  After I passed the initial training rounds I realized very quickly this is EXACTLY what I wanted.  If you loved Spacechem you will love this game.  Once a level loads and I see what my objective is I have to stop and think about my solution... then I build it... realize my errors and make corrections.   Seeing your solution work is very satisfying but while watching it you will probably be thinking, ""I wonder how I can optimize this.""			"

												Infinifactory is the best puzzle game I've ever played. It takes something truly compelling for me to spend hours, sometimes days at the end, perfecting a single puzzle, and yet I have never felt frustrated.  This is a game that truly earns the description 'engaging.' Everything that happens in this game is because you made it, and you need to have your brain firing on all cylinders to make it through. But fear not, any new players considering this game: the mechanics are easy to approach and you'll be hooked in no time.  Players who have enjoyed any other game by Zachtronics (like Spacechem or TIS-100) or who like similar games with similar mechanics (Factorio, Big Pharma,  even the city-builder games by Impressions) will absolutely love Infinifactory, but I think anyone willing to giving Infinifactory a chance will love it too.In this quick review, I'll discuss the gameplay of Infinifactory, it's aesthetics, and try to answer why I've been unable to put this game down. The gameplay is simple: from a certain point at the start of each stage, a series of inputs regularly pop out a component-usually a single box, but other times a more complex shape.  From there, the goal is to simply combine these inputs to meet at the output area, and repeat this ten times.  The player has a number of tools at their disposal, from simple conveyor belts and welders, to parts that push and destroy.  With these parts, all sorts of advanced operations may be performed- advanced techniques even allow players to build 'circuits' from these simple parts.  A later level may resemble a factory made by a mad scientist, full of pipes and blocks, with piecies whirring and whizzing by, only just avoiding disaster.Infinifactory has pleasing visuals, notable for its sturdy blocks and the orange and blue color scheme of its factory parts.  The environemnts are colorful, vidid, and distinctly not of this world. The screen shots do a better job describing what it looks like than I can, but as you can see, there are a great number pleasant and varied stages, and for the most part, there feels like a good variety of factory components, too. There is an interesting story being told, usually through voice logs and a handful of scripted sequences that set the stage for Infinifactory's otherworldly visuals. In many puzzle games, even those that do try to tell a story, the gameplay has no relation to the story. Here, there's a reason why you're building things- and you may not exactly be doing it of your own free will. The story's tone is quirky, with a grinning undercurrent of black humor.  There are a few twists and turns along the way that delighted me.  I found that a nicely written story like this helped ground the events and kept me interested.Puzzles in this game have a wonderful quality where the final output seems simple, yet constructing it from its individual components can be deceptively challenging.  There's a smooth difficulty curve, with tools introduced gradually and new techniques being learned organically as more challenging puzzles are introduced. By the time I'd beaten the game, I found that I could go back to puzzles that took me 90 minutes to solve and beat them in 20 minutes, with a much better score as well.  At the end of each puzzle, the player is ranked according to three criteria: how fast the puzzle was, how many blocks it took to build, and how much space it took up.  I like the way that this scoring encouraged me, because it was rare that I hadn't done well in at least one category.  This system encourages different styles of play-those who (like me) enjoy sprawling, messy solutions that strive to be as fast as possible, or those who favor a more restrained, elegant design.  The game comes with a capable level editor that's integrated into the Steam Workshop. Already, tons of user-made levels are available for play. In my experience, though, few have stacked up against the levels in the campaign.  Most are based around gimmicks or some other novel use of the mechanics.  Sometimes this is successful, but overall I haven't found it as satisfying. That said, I can't claim to have explored the workshop throughly, or to have attempted to create any levels of my own.The true joy in this game comes from the sense of owning each solution you make. There's no single way to solve each puzzle-there are hundreds.  After completing a particularly challenging puzzle, I've often looked up how others have solved theirs- not once has my solution resembled someone else's. I never had the feeling, like I often do with puzzle games, that I was fighting with the developer to find the 'right' way to solve the problem.  Instead, Infinifactory simply gives its players a handful of tools and asks, ""Why don't you build something interesting?""I think it's the mark of a great puzzle game that I have enjoyed my failures as much as my successes.  I have looked back at puzzles that took me hours to solve, and even though the final result was a swollen, creaky machine, I can remember all the hurdles and struggles it took for me to create my solution and think, ""Yeah, I built that.""

Early Access Review
								What can I say about SpaceChem that hasn't been said already? If you follow the indie scene even slightly, I'm sure you heard the ample praise and acclaim for Zachtronics' chemical puzzler. After a foray into card-game strategy with Ironclad Tactics, the developer has returned to  the world of meticulous planning and systematic construction with Infinifactory. You might have heard it described it as ""SpaceChem in 3D"", and while that's an apt description, it doesn't exactly detail what makes Infinifactory an awesome evolution of the SpaceChem formula. Infinifactory takes everything you loved about that game, on a grander scale and with new depth, wrapped up in an alien industrial aesthetic. Forget about bonding elements and creating molecules. Infinifactory leaves the microscopic world of SpaceChem behind for the world of alien engineering. The enigmatic story puts you in the shoes of a person captured and forced to build extraterrestrial constructs. Audio logs and notes allow you to gradually piece together the overarching tale, but let's be honest: you're here for the puzzles. ""SpaceChem in 3D"". Introducing the third dimension adds so many tweaks and new complexities. Having to remember that items take time to fall when you're trying to sync up blocks across multiple levels. Working out how to maneuver pieces across multiple axises so that they all eventually meet. Having to build objects with height and width and depth. Getting the mess of energy conduits and welders and pushers to work and timed correctly...all without Spacechem's sync command to fall back on. On top of all that, Infinifactory has the most seamless, intuitive, user-friendly control scheme and interface I've seen in a block building game. You can effortlessly rotate and place blocks, easily create long conveyor belts or delete unwanted sections in seconds. It's the meticulous construction and pursuit of perfection and optimization you love. The hypnotic rhythm of seeing your complex sprawling mess of moving pieces and parts actually work properly after countless failures and tweaking. The challenge of learning how everything works and functions, and using that knowledge in new ways that makes you feel like a damn genius when it all comes together in the end. It's all that, in a 3D world of sky docks and armories and spaceships and missiles. Six hours in, and for me, Infinifactory has already eclipsed SpaceChem, due to the presentation and polish and the spatial depth that offers new challenges in ways that SpaceChem never could. The price may seem steep, but for the amount of polished content already here, and the content to come, it's well worth the asking price. While Infinifactory may be in Early Access, the current version is literally the 1.0 release version, with a feature-complete finished main campaign. Mini-campaigns and new blocks and mechanics will be added in future updates If you enjoyed SpaceChem even in the slightest, you won't be disappointed by Infinifactory. It's everything that made that game great, on a grander scale and literally with new depth.			"

												Zachtronics is the king of puzzle games. Although Infinifactory is a lot easier than their Spacechem or TIS-100 games, it's still a lot of fun and there are plenty of interesting and challenging puzzles to solve.It's really rewarding seeing your factories grind out products after building them up from scratch. And there's new mechanics introduced in practically every world, which keeps things fresh the whole time. And the steam workshop integration means there's practically endless puzzles to play.If I had one complaint it would be that there's no way to increase the fast-forward rate. You need to test often, but there's a lot of downtime holding the F button, waiting for your factory to play to the point you need to actually test. This is only really a problem in the later levels though.Overall, I highly recommend it.			"

												Infinifactory is my favorite puzzle game I've played in a long while, maybe ever. It's all the programmy goodness of Spacechem (and Zach's earlier browser games) but in a beautiful 3D environment with some cool storytelling mixed in.Infinifactory is a puzzle game, but different than what you may be used to in this genre. You're given a set of input blocks, and must maneuver, combine, and reconfigure these blocks to match a specific output on the other side of the map. It's incredibly open-ended in how this is accomplished, allowing for some brilliantly simple, or horrifyingly overly complicated solutions to the same problem.Difficulty curve is nice and smooth, reaching a peak difficulty that will require some serious time and thinking to work through, but was never hard enough to get me to give up entirely. Adding a bunch of folks to your Steam friends to compare scores with adds an extra level of replayability by giving you the opportunity to optimize your solutions to get a few cycles under your buddies.Infinifactory was further reviewed by myself and my good friend Gary in episode 38 of our podcast Check it Out, Comrade!

												An outstanding puzzle game by Zachtronics which poses a great danger to your free time.Your objective is to build assembly lines to build specific products for alien overlords. This gets increasingly harder as you progress through the levels, as you have to choose the right tools in the right order and with the right timing.There are many ways to solve a level, so you can build your contraptions to your liking. This gives the game a lot of replayability, because you can always optimize your solutions to be just a few cycles faster, or to be a little cheaper, or to use up less space.While later levels can get really hard, this is still a very accessible game, especially when compared to other titles by Zachtronics. If nothing else works, look up a guide. This won't spoil the fun too much, because you might learn some methods for future levels, or you could try to improve on the design.Summary:If you like puzzle games and / or building contraptions, then do yourself a favor and get this gem.

								A very solid game from Zachtronics, as usual.  It's hardly fair to call this ""Early Access"".  The game appears to be feature complete and the puzzles are great.  The graphics are clean and polished, and the game runs very smoothly.  Like SpaceChem, there is a zany storyline to add some atmosphere, but it's mostly about the gameplay.As many people have pointed out, it has similarities to SpaceChem, but is very much its own concept.  The complexity of manipulating, exchanging and combining basic elements is mostly gone.  The addition of a third dimension adds a whole new challenge.  True to its name, the puzzles feel more like a factory, constructing 3D objects from various primitives.The interface is simple, but easy to use.  The game loads quickly, without any annoying splash screens or movies.  You can exit the game at pretty much any time and then resume right where you left off in seconds, with no hoops to jump through.If you loved SpaceChem, chances are you'll love this too.  If you enjoy any kind of puzzle game, and the thought of 3d manipulation doesn't seem too daunting, you really should give this a try.  Highly recommended. "

Early Access Review
								For years I have watched crazy Minecraft videos of people using redstone to build microprocessors and all kinds of impressive feats of recreational engineering, but every time I tried to play I just came up blank on ideas.  Plus, if you want to build things in the context of your own game, you have to spend hours mining for the components to begin with.  I've always felt that Minecraft genius was just out of my reach.This game is the precise answer to my problem.  It gives you a problem to solve and an infinite toolkit to solve it with.  It's been a long time since I've felt absolutely gleeful playing a game.  You look at a puzzle and think ""this is literally impossible.""  Then 2 days later you'll be talking to someone and just shout ""THAT'S IT"" in their face and run away mid conversation to go home and solve it.  Every puzzle makes you feel like a moron until it makes you feel like a genius.My only suggestion to the developer would be, stop calling it Early Access!  I avoid Early Access games as a rule, I only caved this time because the consensus in the community is that it is a fully fleshed out game and calling it Early Access is mere modesty.  I have yet to come upon a single bug or crash.   "

Like all Zachtronics products, Infinifactory is just outstanding in every way. This game reminds me alot of my extensive time playing with redstone mechanics in Minecraft. Alot of people will compare this to SpaceChem, which is not entirely off-base, but it is much more in every way. Its much more polished, easier to control and deal with, and IMO a bit more enjoyable.For those unfamiliar, this is a hardcore spatial puzzle solving game that involves manipulating voxels in certain ways to create or build an intended product.Pros:+Music is excellent (reminds me of Donnie Darko theme - Mad World)+Graphics and artwork are beautiful and appropriate+Controls are SOOOO tight - spot on and perfect+There is a meta-game and story which was refreshing to see (its not extensive, I don't think, but its cool none-the-less)+Puzzle difficulty starts reasonable and ramps up from there+Nothing is really that confusing - its clear what the goal is, and what you have to work withCons:-Your brainy will hurtyIts pricey, but worth every cent. This is a must have if you enjoy puzzle games at all. In fact, I highly recommend checking out and buying any game created by Zachtronics.			"

												Let me qualify this following statement by saying I have played a LOT of puzzle games in my lifetime, and the majority of ones I liked I completed. I can wholeheartedly say I have never felt more rewarded beating a challenge than solving even early levels in Infinifactory. This game will take you from bemused, to frustrated, to maddeningly angry (at yourself) to ELATED in the course of anywhere from ten minutes to an hour at a time. It's bewildering how you can miss easy techniques or make things unnessicarily complicated for yourself, without the puzzle itself asking you to do anything particularly challenging. The majority of times I solved puzzles I felt brilliant, followed by feeling like a moron seeing how I could have simplified my solution drastically.I cannot recommend this game more if you like puzzle games.

												I loved SpaceChem. I like world exploration games and physics puzzles. I should like this game. I do not. It is hard to navigate physically. The rules for how pieces interact have some bizzare edge cases (like when a piece larger than 1 square behaves when over rollers of multiple directions, or how a pipe running next to a button causes the button to become stuck so it cannot be moved by a pusher). There's not a good debug mode to let you wander through walls or see through bricks in order to see what has become stuck deep inside a machine. All in all, this is more frustration than fun for me. Your mileage may vary.			"

												This is the greatest game I have ever played. The difficulty curve is perfect. When you first see each level, it looks impossible. As you break the problem down, you begin to see the glimmer of possibility. Finally, you solve it. A week later, you go back to it, and not only does it seem easy, you can see much more efficient ways of solving it too. The game is very long - there are tons of puzzles. Each one will shock you all over again. The interface is great. The mechanics are perfect - simple on the surface, but allowing infinite combinations.			"

												This is a 3D programming puzzle game with a mini-story added on for fun. Care was clearly put into every aspect of this game. It looks amazing, and it's fun to play!I can't think of a single negative thing to say about Infinifactory. The puzzles slowly build up from blatantly obvious to extremely challenging, teaching you along the way how to use the tools you're given. Every so often you get a new block type that will allow you to take more control over how your machines work. The scoring system shows how well you do compared to everyone else in terms of number of how quickly your factory produces the output, the footprint of your factory, and how many machine blocks you used, but there is nothing wrong with making an overly complex or inefficient machine so long as the final product is correct. This makes the game accessible to a wide audience since it doesn't matter if your solution uses 20 blocks or 2000.The key to Infinicatory's success is that it layers a bunch of simple mechanics that enable you to build complex and open-ended solutions to each puzzle. The blocks you have at your disposal are equivalent to a basic programming language. The puzzles are only as challenging as your creativity allows. There are nearly an infinite number of solutions, and all you need to do is come up with one that works.Do you like logic puzzles? Do you consider yourself creative and capable of abstract thought? If so, do yourself a favor and buy Infinifactory right now.			"

Early Access Review
								Spacechem was my favorite puzzle game of all time - Infinfactory ties it, if not beats it.The game is conceptually similar to Spacechem: You're given a goal to construct, you're given a supply of various parts, and you're tasked with making a contraption that can mass-produce the intended product. Both games share a similar creative element that makes them great. Since there is no ""right"" way to solve a puzzle, every solution you come up with feels like it's uniquely yours, and you get a massive sense of satisfaction from seeing your creation in action after a long period of head-scratching.Difficulty wise, I found it slightly easier than the previous game, but still an extremely challenging puzzler. I've heard complaints about it being too obtuse, with tutorials too hard to understand, but I found that the game had a great sense of discovery and experimentation that would have been ruined by less subtle guidance. The puzzles themselves offered some great brain-straining, though I ultimately found myself running into less frustration and fewer dead-ends than I did with Spacechem.The scoring system deserves mention for being unusual, but brilliantly designed. In addition to the obvious scoring of solutions based on how fast and efficently they complete the goal, the game also scores you on your ""footprint"". What this means is, looking on the solution from the top down, how many squares are covered by machinary or have moving parts passing over them during a run of the solution. So, ten machine parts only count as one footprint if they're all stacked on top of on another. This is different than Spacechem's scoring of how many parts (symbols) are used to make a solution. In addition to creating a different way of thinking for those looking to get the best possible score, it allows a surprising amount of creativity that would have been lost if it simply counted the parts. For example, a large assembly can easily be moved by one conveyor belt, but it looks quite strange. A floor covered in multiple conveyor belts would look better, and would have the same footprint score as the more basic solution. This even allows some artistic freedom, as you can construct roofs and other shapes above your moving parts without penalty.The game features a humorous, but very dark story of alien abduction and enslavement, most of it told through audio logs found on dead bodies, holding their last words before they died trying to solve the very puzzle you're trying to solve. They range from funny to heart-wrenching, and I found myself getting far more invested in the lore than I expected to. Cool-looking factories would have interested me enough, but instead I was making cool-looking factories at the behest of my evil alien captors and questioning just what I was making and why. Even the puzzles themselves had humor and personality, eventually making me feel like I was constructing actual products, not just assemblies of cubes. If I had one complaint, it was how the ending left me hanging. Obviously I don't want to spoil anything, and this may be the only ""Early Access"" part of the game, but it seemed like there was a LOT more story to tell after the last puzzle.Speaking of Early Access, this game is probably the most complete early access game I've ever played. I ran into absolutely no bugs or crashes, no missing or placeholder content, and a campaign that lasted me well over a dozen hours. Infinifactory could have easily been released as a finished game and I'd have no critisism about its current state. I hope for and look forward to the potential additions in its early access development, such as new parts, continuations of the story, and of course, new puzzles.I'd highly recommend Infinifactory to anyone who likes a challenging puzzle, as well as those who like creative production games like Factorio or automation-based mods for Minecraft. And of course, for people who liked Spacechem, I would call this a 100% must buy.			"

								Do you...Enjoy doing something 'constructive'?Like a good puzzle game?Appreciate space.. and aliens.. and spaceships.. and alien technology?Savor the flavor of food pellets?Excel at serving alien overlords?If you answered Yes to one or more of these questions then Infinifactory might be the game for you!Infinifactory is a 3D block puzzle game where you are given some 'part' blocks, and you must assemble the parts to appear like the final required product to progress through the levels.Use Conveyor belts, Pushers, Sensors and Welder plus much more to assemble a mass production machine to create the required goods demanded of you by your alien overlords.Simple controls, easy to play and understand early on but challenging as you progress and are required to assemble more advanced devices / technology.I was hesitant at the price at first, and revisted the game a number of time, but after playing it, I thoroughly enjoy it and would encourage others on the fence to take the dive, the game plays well, and is enjoyable but frustrating at the same time, which is a good thing when it comes to puzzle games.

								The moment I fired up the game, I was impressed by the graphics.  It's not a AAA game, but it has a crisp, clean look to everything.  It looks amazing.  Then I started the gameplay - it's rock solid.  I've played about 1/4 of the puzzles in a 4 hour binge on the game - it reminds me of spacechem but it's got completely different pieces and rules/limitations.  It also has the humor of Spacechem - when you are reviewed by your alien overlords, and they give you some food pellets and some kind of reward it's epic in it's own way.  If you liked Spacechem or modded industrial Minecraft, you'll love this game.  You'll also like it if you enjoyed Factorio.  I'd say this game is more challenging than Factorio because the puzzles are more constrained.  I don't know why this game is listed as early access - the day 1 release version is rock solid.  It would be perfectly acceptable as a full retail release.  So far, the only negative is that for some inexplicable reason you can only put 6 blocks in the hotbar instead of using all 10 keyboard keys - I suspect the developers will be fixing this promptly, I just wonder how they ended up with this limitation in the first place.

												This is one of the best ""puzzle"" games I've ever played and is one of the best games overall I've played in a long time, certainly in 2016. I put quotes on puzzle because it is basically a 3-D programming game, you have stuff, you need the stuff to be arranged in a certain way at a certain endpoint. You use the tools you have been given and the methods you have learned to make the stuff fit what the endpoint wants. And it's all you, thats why this game is so great. Any frustration comes from you not yet getting the desired result yet. But it never feels like you're out of things to try, there are always more approches you can take, and so it might take an hour to solve a stage, you're trying new stuff and refining that whole hour, not sitting there stumped. Also there are little nuggets of story to be found that make the world you're solving these puzzles in more intriguing. 9.75/10, because I havent finished it yet and dont know where the story is going, so I dont know how satisfying the conclusion is yet. But if you enjoy puzzle solving at all, in any way, I'd recommend picking this up right now without hesitation.			"

												This is the best puzzle game I've ever played. It is similar to games like Back to Bed and SpaceChem, but is considerably more interactive than either and is, in its own way, as involved as SpaceChem. I am only on the 4th stage (Training Routine 4) and already the game has much to consider and ponder. There are multiple solutions to every stage. In fact, you have to come up with multiple solutions in order to get the best score in 3 different metrics (Blocks Used, Footprint and Cycles).The game shows you the best scores (in each of the 3 metrics) of people on your friends list as well as a graph plotting the scores of all players on Steam for each metric and where you fall on those graphs. It's fun to see if you can beat the scores of 99% of all other players and satisfying if you do without looking up solutions online. You can time attack it and try to finish as many stages as quickly as possible or you can take your time and try to perfect solutions to beat the scores of others. I've unlocked only 3 block types out of the 20 or so that are revealed thus far in the game, but already the game has much to consider. I look forward to playing this again.			"

												Sometimes I spend my lunch break at work playing games. I spent one of those precious hours last week building a factory in Infinifactory. For the full 60 minutes I was engrossed in testing layouts and aligning conveyors and wiring sensors, only to discover at the end that my design was flawed and simply wouldn't work. Instead of falling to frustration, my brain kept churning through solutions until it struck upon one, and it stuck with me for the entire day until I could spend hours more that night constructing it.This is the crux of what makes Infinifactory so amazing, that even failure is an engrossing and enlightening experience. And you're sure to fail now and then as the game asks more and more of you, from moving boxes from one wall to another all the way to breaking down starships and building cannons out of the pieces. It's the kind of puzzle game that presents you with a seemingly insurmountable task, and through only the basic systems presented it helps you experience that delicious eureka moment when everything clicks. I'm getting ahead of myself here, but it's hard for me to contain my admiration for everything Infinifactory accomplishes.You play an unnamed human who gets abducted Fire in the Sky style by aliens. Instead of probing your tender orifices, however, they just task you with building factories for them. Every puzzle takes place in an exotic location with hatches that produce objects, and a platform that demands a finished product made from those objects. Your job is to use your infinite supply of factory blocks provided to combine, separate, and rescramble the input into the appropriate output. As I mentioned before, this can be anything from linking three boxes together to constructing a missile to breaking down a whale into packaged meat.The beauty of this setup is that you have simple tools that can be spun into factories of infinite complexity. Your basic work blocks are things like conveyors and rotators and welders that get the job done. Added to this though are sensor-controlled pushers and blockers, destructive grinders and lasers, and even programmable counters once you get far enough in. The combination of these elements allows you to create meticulously-timed networks of shifting lines and presses that can produce satellites, starships, and even fully-furnished rooms. And consistency is important as well, because every puzzle requires you to produce not one but ten of the requested object. The amount of combinations possible also means that there is no one solution for any puzzle, but a vast array of elegant or brutish layouts to experiment with.Discovering the full potential of your blocks through the campaign will take well over a dozen hours, spread across upwards of thirty puzzles that gradually ramp up in complexity. As you progress so too does the story, conveyed through audio logs, meetings with your alien overlords, and some quality environmental storytelling. I won't spoil what happens at the end of the campaign but I will stress that it is one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in recent memory, especially in the additional content it reveals. On top of this is a wide-open testing mode, a custom puzzle creator that lets you set up your own scenarios, and a fully-integrated Steam Workshop that lets you share and download user-created puzzles of surprising quality.Honestly I would be in love with Infinifactory if it had even a quarter of the content. There are few things as satisfying as watching a sprawling industrial complex churn out rovers or tanks in perfect rhythm, complete with hearty whirrs and clanks. The sound design deserves some special mention for the perfect effects and incredibly chill soundtrack (included free with the game!). And there's even an element of community with your solutions being rated against those of your friends on criteria like how fast they work and how much space they take up. This is a puzzle game that leaves nothing out, combining rock-solid design with excellent story, presentation, and spread of features. Infinifactory has easily claimed a place as my favorite puzzle game of all time, with a perfect balance of challenge and satisfaction.			"

												Infinifactory is the best puzzle game I have ever played, bar none. Period. In my opinion, a good puzzle needs to meet three conditions:1. It must require hard thinking to solve 2. It must not be frustrating when no immediate solution can be found3. it must make you feel smart when a solution IS found. The first point is pretty obvious, since most people play puzzle games  in order to think. point 2 is the reason I don't like puzzles as a genre; almost all puzzles can only be solved in one exact way, and if I am not thinking in the super unorthodox and particular way the author deems to be correct, I cannot solve it, and that is frustrating to me. Point 3 is the most important. I can accept some frustration if I end up feeling good when I finallly solve the puzzle. However, again almost all puzzles I have tried make me feel like an idiot for not seeing the solution quicker, when in fact the solution was by design arbitrary and for the lack of a better word, ""stupid"".Enter Infinifactory. 1. Infinifactory is hard! I have sat at a single puzzle for literally 3 hours scratching my head trying different solutions only to be foiled by something. It requires three-dimensional visualization and thinking. It requires both hard thinking and creativity in order to solve. 2. The aforementioned puzzle I tried for 3 hours didn't feel like 3 hours. I decided to play the game for 20 minutes one night before bed, and 3 hours later I realize it has not been 20 minutes. I then continued for another 3 hours (I didn't need sleep *cough*). Infinifactory lets you constantly make progress towards a solution, even when I largely have to start over and delete what I did. It does this by naturally building off of previously done things, and requiring you to combine many small solutions into a coherent whole. Finally, 3. Infinifactory makes me feel like a ****ing mastermind mechanical engineer and PhD in quantuum mechanics that just solved nuclear fusion when a factory I built works and works beautifully. I have  never rage quit this game once, since even failing is fun. Seeing the factory being built as it becomes more and more complex is satisfying and inheritantly lets you want to continue and not get frustrated. I would recommend this at 5x the price. TL;DR: It is fun to struggle to a solution even when it takes hours to get there.			"

								Infinifactory is definitely worth buying if you were a fan of Spacechem, or just like puzzle games in general. You will get about 10-15 hours out of the game, but can easily get more if you try to perfect levels or mess around with custom puzzles. Compared to Spacechem, Infinifactory is easier and the game actually felt easier as you progressed through it, since you learn how the game works faster than the rate of difficulty increase.Video showing the game and some puzzle solutions:

												I love this puzzle game because it gives you complete freedom in how you go about solving each level. Every challenge gives you a set of building blocks and asks you to build a factory line that puts them together into a specific structure. The different factory parts at your disposal are so multifunctional that there's tons of ways to go about it. This doesn't make it easy - on the contrary, it's all about combining simple parts to perform complicated procedures! You feel like a genius engineer every time you solve a level.The learning curve is exquisite. It starts off really gentle with a few levels just to get familiar with the mechanics, and slowely introduces new blocks throughout the game. It nudges you slowly towards realizing how the simple parts you're given can be combined to form incredible contraptions to solve even the most complicated engineering challenges. The later levels really challenge you and will have you spending multiple hours on a single problem. You'll size up the challenge and decide it's best to divide the puzzle into puzzles, assembling parts of the final structure on several separate conveyor belts so you can tackle one problem at a time and put it all together at the end. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of getting your own idea to work and then watch it go in a beautiful harmony of interlocking mechanisms of your own design.Took me 50 hours to complete every single level, and I haven't even started on the Steam Workshop content. Plus, if you like, you could go back and try to improve on your old solutions (you can compare your score with other players).This isn't a game for people who like to fill in sudokus - this is a game that challenges you to find your own solution and think like an engineer. If that sounds like your cup of tea, this game will keep you busy for a considerable amount of time.			"

Infinifactory is an animated 3D puzzle with simple controls and addicting game play :)You  have parts and you have a target how to combine them. Find a solution how to comibe, with several tools...You know the game Space Chem? This is even better: a third dimension, more space to build, easy way to move around and build, more possibilities to solve... Altough it's hard to compare with Space Chem.... sometimes it feels like a Space Chem 2.0, but sometimes it feels just like a great game... just try it :)After having played the ""tutorial"" levels I really enjoyed building the things that are the target, this is really well done,After a few levels you get a new tool, you use it, afterwards you think about how to use it in another way.... and there are may possibilities how to use it.Yes, I watched several solution-videos on youtube to get other ideas ;)Now I'm playing all the puzzles the second time and it's great to see that most of the levels have a better performance now that I know about the game mechanics betterAs for Early Access:this game is more complete than some other ""official released"" games I played. I did not see any bugs so far. And the price? It's worth it.I sent mails to the developer with feedback and ideas and within 3 days I got an answer. A very good answer. And I really felt great when some of the improvements where realised in the next update. Of course I wasn't the first to tell the developer some ideas but they really answered my mail and each single question I had. That's really great :)Please give me more levels...

If you're under the impression that this is a supply-and-demand factory game like Factorio, it absolutely is not. It's pure puzzle solving. And, once again, it's very, very difficult.It's good at what it does, though. Very clever and great presentation, but unless you have a particular talent for Spacechem or love intensely difficult problem solving this game is probably best avoided.			"

												Like SpaceChem, this is a puzzle game that implicitly allows you to choose how much you want to challenge yourself.Normal difficulty is just trying to solve every puzzle in any way that works, which, for those who haven't tried Zachtronics designed based puzzlers before, can still be a challenge.Hard difficulty is when you start itching to find an elegant solution that doesn't have a giant snarl of pushers and sensors each trying to fix some unfortunate stall or collision that popped up the first time you built a solution.Obsessive difficulty is when you decide you want to find a ""best"" solution that absolutely minimizes cycles or size with no waste. Even some of the tutorial levels turn in diabolical puzzles at this level. If you go here, you will dream Infinifactories after hours of fiddling. You may even start scouring the web to see if someone somehow did it better (which will, most likely, make you cry or curse profusely). You can, quite frankly, devote as many hours of your life to this game as you wish to without running out of mental challenges if you set the bar high.Rarely will you ever find a puzzle game that has the depth to admit such rewards from obsessive analytical thinking, if you are the sort of person for whom that holds any appeal.

								Zachtronics has taken an engineering simulator and disguised it as a puzzle game. You start off building simple constructions and transporting from point A to point B. Before long you're constructing separate sub-assemblies simultaneously and piping them to various juntions to be fitted together in a vast labyrinth of conveyor belts, power conduits, welders and blocks, then when you finally step back and look at your masterpiece, you wonder how the heck you got it all to work. The game also has tremendous replayability, challenging you to craft more efficient designs; a smaller overall system footprint and seamless manufacturing processes. You can compare your design efficiency with the general public and with your individual friends. If you're the patient, problem-solving type that loves to think outside of the box, this game is a real treat. I've had many a laugh testing out a system that I nearly perfected, watching my creation come together, only to have the boxes piling up at input 3 simply because I forgot to wire one of the pistons.

												This is a game I thought I'd at least get a couple of levels into then end up hating from the difficulty spike.  For the first hour playing I really didn't get it, as the intro sequence compared to the game levels didn't fit together for me and I found using the basic bricks problematic.And somehow it was a few hours later, I had advanced the first series of levels, and had forgotten to cook dinner.The game is rather challenging, yet has something to it that keeps me from rage quitting and uninstalling in frustration.  This is all done to slowly building up a solution, bit by bit, deleting what does not work and extending and improving on what does work so that you can eventually watch the production counter drop down to '0' with a huge feeling of accomplishment while you marvel at your creation.  Then you have the act of going back to earlier levels with knowledge on what you have learnt on others (and unlocked blocks) and tweaking the solutions efficiency to a fraction of what it was before the first go around while wishing you had someone to fist-bump your success to.I love this more than I thought I would and have forgotten to cook dinner many times since I started playing.

												Fantastic game and well-worth wrapping your mind around it. Even if having experience with Space Chem or other games of this kind you may feel like you've already played this, you'll still get challenged and embarassed for how little this experience helps here.Beware though, if you have slightest problems with sleeping, that this thing gets seriously into dreams....

												I'm sorry, I can't bear seeing this game with a ""Mixed"" recent review.Ignore the barely-literate negative reviews. This game is spectactular. It's the best puzzle game I've ever played in my life, although perhaps it's more accurate to call it an ""Engineering"" game instead. Stages are open-ended tasks using a few simple block types, and you're scored on how well your solution performs across a number of categories.If you have the slightest interest in automation or problem-solving games, you should definitely pick this up. Enormous amount of value for the price. Just don't be confused by the superficial similarities to Minecraft.			"

												Easily belongs to the top 10 puzzle games of all time. And if the word ""puzzle game"" might not sound like your cup of tea, don't worry, this game knows how to keep you glued in for another level to solve with its story and dark humor.The first levels might seem a breeze, to a point where you'll go ""pfft, this isn't that hard"", But gradually you'll be confronted with challenges where your brain will start melting. Once you do find a solution that works however, the feeling is really satisfying.The further you progress in the levels, the more the solutions become ""yours"" because there's more than one way to solve a puzzle. If you're curious how well you did, at the end of each level you can compare your score with other players.Dare I even say that this game is analogous with programming. Every programmer's brain works differently and will have a different approach to each task, eventually their code will do the same operation, but one will be more efficient and/or shorter than the other.To sum up, it's a fun puzzle game that will probably make you cry from sadness, frustration and happiness all at the same time.

								3D spiritual successor to Spacechem except it's more about automation and assembly lines as opposed to abstract programming. Even with the early access tag, this game is finished in the sense that it is a completed game from Zachtronics and there will be more content coming in the next 3 to 6 months after its release. The only minor knock against it is that moving in 3D space is a bit clunkier compared to the isometric 2D view from Spacechem but that's not enough to hurt it in any way.If you played Spacechem and found it too daunting, while Infinifactory is in 3D, it's a lot easier to follow since you're able to view your entire line and figure out bottlenecks from that and there are no overly difficult boss fights this time around. Definitely a must for puzzle fans and anyone who enjoyed Spacechem.			"

Great stuff.  The puzzles are already a bit challenging to me, and I'm only on the third puzzle.  I will be spending a lot of enjoyable time with this game.			"

								I must point out, if you don't enjoy difficult problems and solving those problems, this game probably isn't for you.  It's not instant gratification, it's grueling visualization and planning, only to watch your brilliant idea fail miserably and need many revisions and modifications before even working correctly, and then further modifications to actually optimize a build.Still, it's not nearly as difficult as making a real assembly line, but that's basically what this game is, assembly line simulator.That's not why I am giving this game my recommendation though.  While it is a great assembly line simulator, it goes above and beyond that in thoughtful design and detail.  It could have easily been a game that was purely solving puzzles, but they instead opted to include a story line, one with many subtle implications, both dark, terrifying and humorous.  These story parts are sparsely distributed between small cutscene like performance reviews by terrifying and confusing aliens, and other dead humans that came before you.Probably the most intriguing thought that came to mind for me was after the story picked up a little, and after thinking for a bit on how the ones before you dealt with their predicament...  I thought it was funny how many of them saw their prison as horrible torture, and how the charcater you play is obviously some sort of engineer.. I had a good laugh at the idea that it was torture for everyone but an engineer, who must surely find it to be the greatest thing to ever happen...No intrusive troglodytes to obstruct your work, no bosses that don't understand engineering, no stupid monetary constraints.  Just you, the problem, and the machine.  An Engineer's wet dream really...  Also abducted by a giant Alien mega-empire...  Just to stroke the Sci-fi fanboy deep down inside every engineer.I love these little touches, it brings the game to life in a way that a menu and empty room never could.  And the game could have easily been just menus and bland puzzle rooms, but instead you are transported to various alien worlds...  You see the failed attempts of those that came before you, and you listen to the intriguing storyline that plays out as you play the game.  It gives reason to the puzzles, and that makes all the difference.All that being said, it is a fairly difficult game.  I don't think I've played a game before that required this much cognitive excersize in order to advance...  You really have to be able to see the machine working, step by step, in your mind, long before you place the blocks...  For me personally, that's one of my greatest joys of being a sentient being.  I love using my imagination to create working devices, and I especially love it when I finally manage to bring it into the game world, and it works perfectly...  Brings a tear to my eye...So if you're up to the task, pick up this little gem and see if you can get a better cycle score than me...  Just remember, I pretty much start all the puzzles now by switching input to max and working it out from there first, and taking away input as needed.  I've noticed it actually doesn't make much of a difference, and in many cases makes it much easier, to just do max input.  It's a bit overwhelming at first, but all the same rules apply, just with a much smaller range of error...  But often times I can make it work with very few sensors and a few well placed conveyor belts...  Definitely much easier when you're thinking about the whole thing moving and going at the same time...  Also it's quite deceptive... You'll get most of the way through a problem, switch the machine on, and realize that every 7th manufactured part causes the whole assembly line to back up because one block moved into the right place at the wrong time....So... be ready for ragequit.

This takes what I love about both and SpaceChem and puts it into one Perfect package.7 hours in and I am most likely half way through or less. They are getting harder and take more time. Also finishing the main game gives access to the workshop levels. Also when you get to level about fixing a ship you need to know about the new blocker block that makes the level much easier.			"

												More i play this game, less i feel like a clever or at least average. In fact i feel like a re-tard Einstein. Well this game requires some patience and brain usage for sure which is i do not have. I get annoyed mostly and quit the puzzle. I am thinking basically, that's another problem.  This game will give you some frustrating experience and brain damage but in fact you will be happy when solve puzzles and complete your first chapters. Hardtimes awaits you :p Even in the first or second chapters, you can get frustrated and after 3/4 it becomes ever more complexity game. (There is a lot of chapter so... I can say that i quit at around %10 of the game) Since this is one of the most complex puzzle game with such great musics and ost also gameplay mechanics, I would recommend this game to all puzzle lovers and hard thinkers. I grabbed this game from Humble Monthly so it's a shame that I am not one of these (Still, I've played and manage to beat Antichamber,Portal,Talos Principle etc. lulz) Since i can feel like a retard, i will cry in my empty dark place. But there is a thing that makes this games almost perfect. The gameplay and mechanism. It's easy to make levels with creator (cuz the gameplay is pretty simple actually. It's all about the blocks and some pipes.) and share it via Steam Workshop. You always can play other players' level and get even more brain damage.  Another thing is this game has Steam cloud and your save files will be pretty safe. Leaderboards, achievements and great level editor support is so nice for a game like this. Although gameplay is simple and great it's complex in itself. Some puzzles could require high amount of time. Some are seems like easy but you still spend more than 1 hour. There is no actual bugs, clean gameplay and clean 60 fps. Graphics are not the best but looks quite nice.Since spacechem is super-hard, this game is no surprise at all. I hate you Zachtronics #_#			"

												This game is all about visual factory logistics using an inventory of blocks that you use to manipulate the materials given to you. You use these materials in wild manners to construct some pretty intense mini assembly lines.Learning curve is really gradual. You slowly work up to the really difficult puzzles in good pace. UI/controls/building is really easy. Very similar to some factory minecraft mods in a way, just much more complicated in function :D I feel that vive/vr support could make this game even more interesting too.There is A LOT of content if you want to finish all puzzles possible with a lot of room to optimize where you wish with what you learn in later campaigns.So if you like visual puzzles in which you interact in a FPS manner this is one of THE best games for it.GET IT! :D			"

												This is a gem of a puzzle game. If you enjoy building contraptions in block-based building games, then you'll absolutely love this. It even has a surprisingly decent story to boot with a satisfying ending.The relatively simple building blocks are set up to allow for pretty impressive emergent gameplay.There are a few things I would like to see improved however. Blocks can only be rotated in the X/Y plane, which means that a lot of the functional blocks have two variants for side/top (but no bottom) which leads to some annoying building restrictions (Why can't my piston push up? Why can't my welder weld from below? Why can't my laser/eviscerator aim down?), but if full 3D rotation was present these extra blocks could be removed, and we would have a lot more options for building things. Also, the tutorial is pretty much non-existent, and there's a lot of advanced building techniques that the game doesn't even hint about. Some players enjoy the trial and error of discovering this on their own (I do to some extent, but eventually it just got to be annoying when some of puzzles expected you to know an advanced technique, but didn't actually give you any hint whatsoever on what it might be), for everyone else, there's plenty of online guides.The only real flaws I've seen are some performance issues (stuttering) and occasional crashes. The autosave system saves frquently enough though that I never really had any problems with losing anything.Overall, despite a few small issues, this is a great puzzle game and easily recommended.

												This is probably my #1 puzzle game of all time, and was very suprised when I realized I havent written a review for this game. Anyway, there is a very good reason this game is #1 for me, and its that this game realizes people are different, and think different. Because of this core theological stasis that relies in this game. There are so many ways to do the most minute of processes, and sometimes, you can get crazy overboard an make crazy factories. But its even more extreme when the thing you took the whole room the game gave you, you see someone else do it in 2/10ths the space. But then you go back to your giant factory and see it working, and remember you made it. And this repeating satisfaction factor makes you never lose fuel on this game. Its fun until the end. (If your smarter than me and can get there ;_;) The logic is pristine, being thoughtful of every possibility, and this gives crazy smart people the ability to go wild. This game is amazingly string pulling for the whole spectrum of intelegence. A lazy person could have fun, trying to make and improve the easiest way to do something. In short, this game is near perfect, made amazingly by great developers.Infinifactory is to Puzzle as SMB is to Platformer.			"

												This may be my favourite game of all time. I like puzzle games. I think other games by these guys were too hard. Certainly spacechem was too hard. I think TIS-100 will last a long time for me because it is just on the limit of my puzzle solving abilities. That being said, this game isn't easy. It provides a good challenge. But the game isn't just good because of the puzzles, it has an amazing story which just gets better and better. As an Aussie myself, there is a slight problem for me with a fake Austrlian accent in the voice acting, but other than that, I love the way the story unfolds. (There maybe a total of 10 minutes of fake Aussie voice acting.) The puzzles really fit well with the story.I didn't reasearch how long the game was before I bought it. I thought I'd nearly finished the game, but it turns out there's more... more game which makes the puzzles fit in even better with the narative.I guess this type of game isn't for everyone, and if you don't know if it is for you, then you are taking a risk buying it, but if you think it does seem like your type of game, you should not hesitate.

												Infinifactory is a game where you build machinery (like an assembly line in a factory) to transform blocks you are provided with into goal objects.  As with other Zachtronics games, you are scored in several ways based on your solution: cycles (the amount of time your solution takes,) footprint (the amount of floor space your solution takes up,) and blocks (the number of blocks you use.)You are provided with various blocks to move objects, attach them to eachother, or destroy them along with some blocks for logic operations.  Put them together, and you can build some pretty complex machines from these simple parts.  It's a very intuitive system, and never overwhelming.  Problems can be broken down into small parts which are easy to solve (and these segments are often quite similar between puzzles.)  There's always something you can do to try to make a machine work if it's not quite there yet, no walls you run into where you feel like you can't continue.  When everything does finally come together at the end of a complicated and lengthy puzzle, it's very satisfying watching your solution run to completion.I'd also like to personally thank Zach (the developer.)  I was having issues with random crashing and when I sent in a bug report, he responded with a couple hours with a solution (turns out it was my cloud storage software causing a conflict with the save file, not a bug in the game.)Back to slaving away building factories for the alien overlords!

+ Extremely fun gameplay / puzzles to solve, essentially you are a builder who's job is to build assembly lines to combine and transport various materials for some mysterious alien race+ A large variety of blocks that completely change the way you solve scenarios. (conveyor belts, welding blocks, pushing blocks, sensors, etc.)+ Interesting lore / story elements, essentially you are abducted by aliens and assigned to work for them. Many other people were apparently abducted in the past and died,  you can listen to audio logs which explain more about what's going on. + Challenging but very rewarding to see your fantastic contraption come to life and  accurately solve the puzzles+ Visually the game looks great with some breathtaking backgrounds+ Great relaxing soundtrack- I wish more was explained early on, and I wish it would show you what you were making or delivering and why.- Later on when new blocks are given to you to use, there's a very vague board that shows you how to use them. I wish there were descriptions under each one that told you what each did as it can sometimes be confusing as to how to use each one. "

												Zachtronics always have programming-esque thinking puzzles that have an immense amount of depth. Infinifactory takes the positional-logic problems found in Spacechem and renders them in a minecraft format (the guy did make Infiniminer, precursor to minecraft). This was significantly easier to digest and solve than his other games, but just as complex and rewarding.			"

From the creators of another favorite, SpaceChem, Infinifactory combines the ideas of ""programming"" like redstone in Minecraft with a goal-directed production system, while still giving you plenty of freedom and sandboxes to explore.

 A very intresting, challenging and enjoyable game! You can spend 1 hours on a puzzle and in the end realize how easy it actually was. Some I can spend 10 minutes on because I can see how its supposed to be done in my head!  Me playing Infinifactory Its a lot of fun and you can go back to machines you have completed and do them better/more efficent and see how much better you have become. The only real negative things I can say about this game is the lack of a more fleshed out graphics menu and no Multiplayer/co-op. (they have the basics in the menu, but I would enjoy some more options over all) I recommend this to people who enjoyed Portal, SpaceChem and other puzzle games alike.			"

You will be incredibly frustrated in places after thinking ""this should be easy enough"" before reasising that you will need an IQ similar to that of a Steven Hawking-Albert Einstein hybrid to complete this game.Now don't get me wrong this game is hard, I spent most of the time feeling like my brain cells were being blasted my microwaves. But that just increaces the reward from finishing a really dificult puzzle.To all those who are looking for a puzzle game they can sink hours into all the while thinking your brain is going to explode, this is the game for you because it is rewarding "

What I liked: Zach back at it again with the insane and free style puzzles 3D makes it easier to find the problem when the solution isn't working than compared to his other games The most diverse and fun ""puzzles"" that will hurt your brain for hours to finishWhat You Need to Know: Again, this is not a typical puzzle game, no developer solution, it's what you want it to be, no matter how messy, clean, or efficient This game is hard, harder than any puzzle game you've ever played, unless you played SpaceChem, which is his other game. The game has every level giving you blocks of different types and shapes to make the final product, basically an assembly line You start with an empty space and must use your brain to make up a solution, their is no correct one You are scored on 3 factors, how fast you do it, how many blocks you use and the footprint of your solution. You can't get all 3 to be great, just like in business Most levels will take an hour or 2 to finish depending on how smart you are. My longest time to finish a level was 7 hours. I felt stupid, but after finishing it, felt like a genuis My only gripes with the game is: no variable speed for the longer levels, to speed the process up. The fact that it's 3D with lots of blocks, means	your solution can get complicated and getting deep inside them means you need destroy a few blocks to get places or makes it hard to see whats going on The difficulty gets insane once you get to the massive builds, I bet most will quit at that point, it takes time to figure them out due to the complexity and sizeMy Score:A+Price:$13Completed in:66 hoursGames similar:  SpaceChem ( harder to learn and more programming designed than this) Factrio ( designing solutions to problems) A Gif of one of my most stupidly insane solutions "

								There's a Stanley Parable joke in the first five minutes. 10/8.After thinking of ways to solve one of the earlier problems and playing around with things a bit, I realized that I was considering creating a factory capable of introspection and self-modification - essentially, a factory that would think about itself and then change the way it thinks in order to change the way it thinks.This isn't just SpaceChem in 3D; this is, in a lot of ways, the purest expression of what those computer science guys are talking about when they speak in hushed tones of the Church-Turing hypothesis or the simple elegance of homoiconicity			"

												I saw many people said that Infinifactory is like Spacechem in 3D, so here is my opinon. The goal of every level is quite the same with Spacechem, in which you take the input, and produce the output. However, a big different between them is the extra dimension: it gives more freedom for arranging your factory, but also open up many possibility of verious kind of chellange. And like Spacechem, it also have ""Test zone"", kinda like Sandbox in Spacechem, where you can build whatever you can as long as it can fit in :)Overall, I recommand this game. If you enjoy Spacechem, other Zachtronic's game or somthing similar, you will also love this game.			"

								As the game information says, ""LIKE SPACECHEM… IN 3D!"" (from looking at current reviews, looks like it's mandatory to point that out).TL;DR - If the idea of the game interests you (and/or you're a SpaceChem fan), you're going to love this thing to death.Although the game is (as of this writing) Early Access, it's not EA in the usual sense. Zachotronics has mentioned that this is actually what they would normally have released as a first full version, but they decided to go the Early Access route so that they can take player feedback to fix any critical issues that crop up post-release. A prime example is the game not having view inversion support for the mouse on launch but being added just hours later.The production ready quality really comes across in the game. Except for the button to record your solution (as you could in SpaceChem) being disabled and marked as ""Soon"", the game does not come across as a work in progress at all. Everything works fluidly and smoothly, and looks great (or as great as something in this visual style CAN look, at any rate). No blocky minecraft textures here. It's simplistic, but somehow exactly what a game of this nature needs.There are a couple of minor issues with the controls currently. You can't scroll through the hotbar with the mouse wheel, and the number of slots is not big enough, but these are apt to be coming in a very near update.[EDIT: The day after release, an update was pushed that makes the hotbar bigger, although you still can't scroll through it with the mouse wheel (yet)]Gameplay wise, the game is (as mentioned) similar to SpaceChem, with the exception that instead of programming a reactor with constantly moving Waldoes, the inputs come out at set intervals and you must use a connected sequence of things like conveyor belts, welders, sensors and so on to shuffle things around and attach them as appropriate. The different elements are introduced slowly before being combined to help you come to grips with how to use everything. I would say that in this regard the pacing is spot on.There is a built in level editor, although there is no access to it until you finish the main campaign. Steam workshop support allows you to share your levels with others, which is a great thing for the longevity of the game. Only a day after the initial release, new levels are already showing up in the workshop.The back story of the game is handled well, and the setup for the story as a whole (being abducted by aliens so that you can build factories for them) is used as the setup to  explain the core mechanics of the game, which works very well. The initial levels start with simple puzzles to get you used to the concepts needed before starting to get dastardly. As mentioned, the pacing seems to be spot on (thus far).With this being an EA (for now) title, there is a small survey at the end of each puzzle regarding whether it was fun to solve and how hard it was, allowing for them to tune things if needed.I leave you with this: after initial training, you get dumped into a cell and are provided with some food pellets to munch on while you ponder your next move.

												It's fun early on, where the puzzles are of acceptable complexity and length, but as soon as you reach Resource Site 265.81: Small Excavator, the difficulty curve rams through the roof at an exact 90° angle.To make matters worse, you have to complete either that OR Cargo Uplifter, which is even more complicated, in order to actually progress and unlock the remainder of the game.It simply gets frustrating to a point where I've reset my entire solution multiple times in a fit of rage even though I was as close as I could get to clearing the puzzle.MAJOR EDIT: Through the help of a friend of mine, I managed to clear Small Excavator, and all I can say is the later levels are by far not as difficult as that and Cargo Uplifter.In fact, I've managed to clear some of the later levels with a footprint of 37 within 200 cycles.What the hell, Zachtronics!?Aside from these two particular levels, the game is very fun. Just make sure you have a friend to talk to while you play it, otherwise it gets frustrating.			"

												If you dont like putting your brain to work then you will hate this game.  If a serious mental challenge sounds like tons of fun to you then this game is exactly for you.  This is a real thinking persons game.  Not a button mashing shooter where the most you have to do is aim your mouse and click, click, click, nor is it a game within which you get by by simply spaming a key sequence for your most effective skills.  You have to consider complicated 3d spatial relationships and make systems work using certain tools with which you are provided.  You must think vertically, horizontally, laterally, unilaterally and inside out!  But dont worry!  You have all the time in the world.  You can sit there and ponder each scenario for days if you like-and figuring out some of the puzzles may just take you that long!  So yeah!  All you brainiacs out there who enjoy putting their smarts to the test, get this game!  It will help keep you sharp.  Lazy brainers need not apply.			"

Early Access Review
								Update Feb 2, 2015I've completed the game, made a couple of puzzles for the Steam Workshop, and am now working other folks puzzles from the Workshop. The game was a lot of fun, about the only downside was that I felt the official ""campaign"" felt a bit short. However, the number and more importantly, the quality of the puzzles being posted in the Steam Workshop has more than made up for this.The following was posted Jan 26, 2015I'll throw my review of the early access version of Infinifactory in here as well. If you've looked at the other reviews you'll see that pretty much everyone is very positive about the game. I agree with those folks. However, a lot of people have been saying that this is SpaceChem in 3D. I played a lot of SpaceChem and I have to say that Infinifactory is really a lot better than a 3D version of SpaceChem. Primarily, the reason Infinifactory is better is because SpaceChem was always rather space limited in it's format. There was only a set amount of 2D space to work in and once you got past the early SpaceChem puzzles I would be conscious that I was having to compromise my creativity to keep my designs in that rather small space. While there are limitations in the 3D space available on some Infinifactory puzzles, I've felt that I'm really being able to be creative (and perhaps a little sloppy in my designs) without that constricted feeling I would get in SpaceChem. Certainly, you can tweak and tune a solution in Infinifactory to get it as near perfect in Cycles and Footprint, but it's not required. And that makes it fun.Another reason Infinifactory is very good is how the 3D environment is structured. Except for a few folks in North Korea, pretty much everyone has at least tinkered a bit with Minecraft. Infinifactory uses the same presentation so you can start solving puzzles right away without having to understand how all those nodes worked like you did in SpaceChem. Blocks stack together, right click removes, left click adds, it's all very straightforward. Most folks will be able to grasp the concepts pretty quickly.The final reason Infinifactory is so good is another fallout of the 3D environment, specifically that your avatar is actually inside of the game. Want to know why your conveyor belt doesn't seem to be doing what you want? Walk or fly over to it and look. Want to be sure that there's clearance when your swinging around a large assembly through a gap? Move your viewpoint into position and fire up the process, then observe. You can start and pause at will, so you can actually look at what's going on at any point at any time during the process. It's amazing helpful when you're trying to troubleshoot.OK, there's another reason I can really recommend this game as more than just a 3D version of SpaceChem. Infinifactory is fun. There's so much satisfaction and enjoyment when you can build your own assembly line and watch it work. And, really, there is just as much satisfaction and enjoyment trying to figure something out, being stymied, scratching your... head, looking at it from all different angles, starting, pausing and restarting... then suddenly getting a true epiphany on how to make it all work. It's a great feeling.			"

My only real issue is I can't seem to find out how to reset the game and start from the begining again, or if that's even possible. Could use an intro screen and multiple session manager like space chem had. But other than that the game is a great amount of fun if you like puzzlers.			"

												Another sublime ""programming"" game from the mad genius who brought us SpaceChem. This time you've been kidnapped by the alien overlords who have set you to building them factories.Basically, you get given one or more ""inputs"" (usually single blocks of different types) and (usually) one ""output"" that's built from those blocks. You have to build a production line out of conveyer belts, welders, pistons, sensors, etc that can repeatedly turn the ipnuts into the outputs. All this is done in a Minecraft-like world of cubes (and the guy who created this game also created Infiniminer, which was a major inspiration for Minecraft).Once you've solved the puzzle, you get three little graphs that show you how your solution compares to the solutions of all the other players in terms of how quickly it produces the required output, how many blocks you used, and how much space it took up. Then (if you're like me) comes the fun part: optimize, optimize, optimize, and try to get the best possible score in each of the metrics (most likely with three different solutions). The great thing about the graphs is that because nobody can see anyone else's scores, there's no real incentive for anyone to cheat, and because it doesn't show exact scores, You can aim for the slightly softer target of the top score bracket rather than being tormeted byt that one guy who has an insanely good score...My new favourite pure puzzle game.

												This puzzle game is all about assembling, manipulating and delivering blocks in the right way to their destination. To accomplish this you will set up increasingly complex networks of fully automated conveyor belts accompanied by blocks that weld, rotate and more. The real fun lies in that you get to see how well your friends as well as everyone else who played did, giving you an incentive (beyond that of certain achievements) to keep optimizing your solution. The first person view and 3D environment really call on your spatial thinking. While the earlier levels can be done relatively fast as soon as you get the mechanics, the later levels will have you break down problems into little steps and iterate upon your work as you go. And as you advance you also get to know more of the story you got thrown into.			"

												If you dont like putting your brain to work then you will hate this game.  If a serious mental challenge sounds like tons of fun to you then this game is exactly for you.  This is a real thinking persons game.  Not a button mashing shooter where the most you have to do is aim your mouse and click, click, click, nor is it a game within which you get by by simply spaming a key sequence for your most effective skills.  You have to consider complicated 3d spatial relationships and make systems work using certain tools with which you are provided.  You must think vertically, horizontally, laterally, unilaterally and inside out!  But dont worry!  You have all the time in the world.  You can sit there and ponder each scenario for days if you like-and figuring out some of the puzzles may just take you that long!  So yeah!  All you brainiacs out there who enjoy putting their smarts to the test, get this game!  It will help keep you sharp.  Lazy brainers need not apply.			"

												I got this game from the Humble Monthly thing basically on accident. I played it briefly, not expecting much. What I got was a phenomenal journey. The puzzles were challenging but fair, always teaching me new ways to do things. When I went back to get better scores on old levels I realized all the things I had learned, just playing the game. I felt brilliant every time I solved anything.			"

												The game is quite a lot of fun. Zachtronics has significant experience making puzzle games and it shows. The game difficulty ramps up smoothly, adding just enough new tools and scenarios to keep your interest along the way. The story is amusing, fluffy and light. My only real issue is I can't seem to find out how to reset the game and start from the begining again, or if that's even possible. Could use an intro screen and multiple session manager like space chem had. But other than that the game is a great amount of fun if you like puzzlers.			"

												Many people compare Infinifactory with Spacechem, here's my opinion:The goal of the game is to take input, make output, same concept as Spacechem, but in 3D and more graphical.The ability to change input rate and build in a large space gives it more freedom.The main campaign puzzles are easier, difficulty comes when trying to optimize them.Overall, it's a satisfying puzzle game.

												Another sublime ""programming"" game from the mad genius who brought us SpaceChem. This time you've been kidnapped by the alien overlords who have set you to building them factories.Basically, you get given one or more ""inputs"" (usually single blocks of different types) and (usually) one ""output"" that's built from those blocks. You have to build a production line out of conveyer belts, welders, pistons, sensors, etc that can repeatedly turn the ipnuts into the outputs. All this is done in a Minecraft-like world of cubes (and the guy who created this game also created Infiniminer, which was a major inspiration for Minecraft).Once you've solved the puzzle, you get three little graphs that show you how your solution compares to the solutions of all the other players in terms of how quickly it produces the required output, how many blocks you used, and how much space it took up. Then (if you're like me) comes the fun part: optimize, optimize, optimize, and try to get the best possible score in each of the metrics (most likely with three different solutions). The great thing about the graphs is that because nobody can see anyone else's scores, there's no real incentive for anyone to cheat, and because it doesn't show exact scores, You can aim for the slightly softer target of the top score bracket rather than being tormeted byt that one guy who has an insanely good score...My new favourite pure puzzle game.

								A great game if SpaceChem left you wanting more. It's by the same dev and has a very similar feel to the gameplay and the amount of time you can spend going back to optimize your older solutions. I'm not going to go as far as to call it ""SpaceChem in 3D"", as I feel SpaceChem was a masterpiece and Infinifactory in comparison is rather lacking in story and flavor. ResearchNet is also sorely missed, and the Steam Workshop integration doesn't really make for a good alternative in my opinion.Still, the vertical dimension and the different ways of doing things definitely bring something new to the table, and as its own thing Infinifactory is a very good game that no fan of SpaceChem should miss out on.

												This game is, in my opinion, nothign short of the greatest puzzle game ever made. Rather than the linear, single-solution puzzles of most puzzle games (and even the venerable Portal) it invites the player to discover and hone their own ingenuity by offering open-ended design challenges that can be solved in any number of clever ways. Spacechem is similarly excellent in this regard, but it features a monstrous difficulty curve that may deter all but the most tenacious engineers from stickign with the game, whereas this one is MUCH more accessible, while still offering impressive challenges for budding and seasoned innovators alike. 10/10			"

												Have you ever wanted to feel both incredibly smart AND incredibly stupid? This is the game for you!Much like its predecessor SpaceChem, WHAT you need to do is always fairly straightforward. HOW to actually achieve it – and, moreover, manage to do it repeatedly – is the part that’s going to haunt you.I must say though, after spending what seems like forever getting things just right, watching a factory endlessly turn out missiles (or satellites, or whatever you’ve been tasked with doing) fulfills that ‘reward’ center of the brain like nothing else.

								Zach has been making logic based games for a while now and this is arguably his best yet. I loved Space Chem, but struggled with a lost of the puzzles because of the space requirements to solve them in. Infinifactory takes the idea of SpaceChem and moves it into 3D space and largely removes the space constraints on solving puzzles. Each level has the player place blocks in a desired arangement into a goal area. The blocks come through from block shoots or spawners and it is the player's job to move the blocks into the goal arrangement, and then move the arrangement of blocks to the goal with the use of very basic, translate, rotate and switch blocks. This is a game you can take your time with, and solving puzzles feels very pragmatic and craft based (you get better at solving them over time). Arriving on a new level to find something new and different was always delightful.Other than the ending, I loved the subtle story, even though that isn't the game's main focus I found it very intriguing and left me wanting more.In its current state Infinifactory feels like a complete game and I will gladly play through it again when it is complete if only to improve on my previous solutions to puzzles.5/5			"

								I love this game.Infinifactory takes the torch in 'programming' style games; where the goal is to create or affect starting conditions of a simulation, then run the simulation, and adjust the starting conditions until completion. There's a ton of room for creativity, and the devs are listening to feedback from players (recently they reached out to the reddit community for the game). Every blog post or video about this game will talk about the pedigree of Zachtronics, but this was the first game I've played by them, and I'm hooked. I'm going to be buying spacechem as well, which seems to scratch the same itch in a slightly different way.			"

												This is an excellent puzzle game that provides a very accessible visual analogy to writing a computer program (something I do for a living). The premise is that you are a human who has been kidnapped by a malevolent alien race. In each scenario you face, you are compelled by your new masters to design a factory process by piecing together machinery components about the size of minecraft blocks. You are given input blocks that spit out of magic holes at a pre-determined frequency. You are given a goal of what the end product of those input blocks should look like after rolling through your little factory. Often there are many different ways to skin the cat presented to you, some being more efficient then others. It's really neat to skim the forums and see all of the different ideas that people come up with to accomplish the same goal.The game doesn't distract you with alot of filler. It's presentation is very straight forward and simple. The solutions you come up with probably won't be, which is alot of the fun.This is a solid, fun game that makes you think and create. It's also not all that expensive. Definately recommend it.  "

								For the love of God, please read the early acces details (or just ignore the fact it's early access) and buy this game now. Zachtronics, if you read this, please do yourselves a favor and take the early access label off of your finished game! I hate to think of how many sales you'll miss from people who completely write off EA.If you haven't played Spacechem, one of the best games of all time, buy that too! It's kind of like training for this game. I've been rating all the levels ""just right,"" but I'd bet they're pretty hard right off the bat for people who didn't play Spacechem.Hard to say after only playing an hour but this might be better than Spacechem. The asthetic and storytelling alone are a billion times better (every game has flaws, and story was definitely one that got in the way in Spacechem).Only request so far would be to make the level rating optional/opt-out; I think it's a good idea and a lot of people will probably be happy to help you... but again, remember that your early data is going to be from Spacechem vets, and we're insane!

												Another remarkable release from Zachtronics!Puzzle games come in many different forms nowadays, and they make you think in different ways. The part that I love about Infinifactory is that I can imagine, in my head, the parts of the output contraption coming together in a certain way, and then eventually getting all the movements timed and positioned correctly to make it happen. Or whatever gets the job done.On the more difficult puzzles, the magnitude of what is required by the puzzle can make solving it take over an hour, easily. There is a certain threshold of patience, that if you can commit enough time and thought to that problem, you should be able to get it done after a while. Once you get the mechanics of the game down it's just a matter of that. I find that sometimes I am in that mood, and I'll solve a couple more problems, but most of the time it's hard to get motivated to solve some of those problems.The game doesn't require you to solve every problem as you progress, however, so it's a blast as you're first going through it. I think that's a sufficient offset to the inherent difficulty of Infinifactory that I'll recommend this to the puzzlers out there. Due to the spacial nature of the game, if you like manipulating things in 3D, this is much more likely to arouse your interest. Of all the Zachtronics releases, I feel like this is probably the most accessible.			"

My friends and I had even more fun competing to optimize the solutions to the earlier puzzles than we did actually playing the rest of the game.If you enjoy building giant automated mining machines in the Minecraft mod ""Feed The Beast""; or building robots with Lego Mindstorms; or optimization puzzles like http://www.pathery.com, you will probably enjoy this game.

								You build constructions by snapping blocks together Minecraft (or Lego) style. Except the goal is not to see what you yourself can create, but to build an assembly line that can autonomously build other macguffins. The end result is a unique and interesting puzzle game; or at least unique if you haven't played SpaceChem.You see, this idea of building assembly lines stems from Zachtronic's previous puzzle game, the spirtiual prequel to this one. Don't worry, you don't need to play that one first, and Infinfactory is my personal favorite; But if you're on the fence, why not give it a try? SpaceChem has a free demo, so there's nothing to lose. If all you're looking for is Minecraft block building though, this is the ticket.			"

This game is prime example how good puzzle game is supposed to be made; it's fun, challenging, has good learning curve and most importantly, once you finish each level, you feel proud of you self :) And nice thing is that there isn't single universal solution to each level, witch gives it nice replayability and extra challenge. I haven't finished it yet, but I have been playing it for 8h now, and I had a lot of fun with it.			"

												One of my new favorite puzzle games.  You place down conveyor-belts, welders, and other tools to create machines which build things for you.  As the game goes on, new tools unlock (rotators, lasers, etc) and the objectives become increasingly more complex.The game is not multiplayer, but there is a multiplayer-component in that the game shows the ""blocks used"", ""space used"", and ""best time"" of the solutions for each of your friends.  My friends and I had even more fun competing to optimize the solutions to the earlier puzzles than we did actually playing the rest of the game.If you enjoy building giant automated mining machines in the Minecraft mod ""Feed The Beast""; or building robots with Lego Mindstorms; or optimization puzzles like http://www.pathery.com, you will probably enjoy this game.

												In infinifactory, you solve puzzles using factory equipment. Blocks like conveyors, welders, detectors, pushers etc. Each levels purpose is made easily clear, all the tools you need to solve the level are there. It's just the solving that's the tricky bit. This game is the most fun puzzle game i've played in years. The sense of achievement you feel when you solve a level and you see your machine in full action building the structures required is really rewarding. It has quite a lot of puzzles in the main story that really melt your brain and when you complete them (if you complete them) the game has integration with the steam workshop. So you can download puzzles other people have made too. Seriously, really great game. If you're into any type of puzzle game like Portal for example, you'll love this.			"

OverviewReally fun and interesting puzzle game with familiar yet somewhat unique mechanics.The player takes the role of a human who has been abducted by an alien spaceship and is tasked with constructing a variety of different production lines (for lack of a better term) to make equipment and machines for the aliens across a variety of levels. The player will unlock more machine parts and mechanics as they progress.The games interesting story is initially told through tape recordings that the player will find in different levels.The levels seemingly easy but quickly get more difficult as the game progresses. There are many different ways in which to construct the different production lines in each stage and the player is rewarded for making their factory as efficient as possible. This game is sure to frustrate any player but they will be rewarded for their determination.This game has elements from, and can be compared to, other games such as Factorio and Minecraft, but it is also very different from those games in other ways and is more than capable of being considered independent from those games.Positive Aspects+Fun and interesting puzzle mechanics.+Excellent soundtrack.+Freedom to solve puzzles in different ways, with more efficient ways being rewarded.+Good story, however, the story does not at first have a central role in the game.+Very relaxing, yet difficult gameplay. (opinion)+Workshop support for creating new levels.+Nice aesthetic.+Good learning curve.+Longer that it seems. The player will unlock a whole new set of missions involving solving puzzles for a rebel alliance when the main story appears to be complete.Neutral Aspects~Online functionality limited to leaderboards and the workshop.~No performance issues.Negative Aspects-Levels may get repetitive after a while.-Players may get bored of the game's mechanics.-Some players may not like the games linear progression.-Price is perhaps slightly too high.ConclusionOverall, I like this game. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes puzzle games. It is a very good puzzle game and it is relaxing and fun to play. The game will require alot of determination to complete and I would not recommend it to people who are looking for an easy game or to those who are not interested in puzzles.			"

								My favorite game of the last few years, and Zachtronics' magnum opus, Infinifactory is basically a very beautiful, creepy and accessible version of SpaceChem, their underground optimize-em-up puzzle hit from a few years ago. The Minecraft-like interface will be familiar to many, and the different metrics of success provide enormous replay opportunities for competing against your friends for more and more convoluted and/or efficient solutions. Highest recommendation!!			"

								Highly recommended for those who love problem solving. For an ""Early Access Game"" it plays like a complete product and after several hours in, I have not experienced one bug. Great puzzles, and just when you think the next level is going to be more of the same, they throw in something new and interesting. I just got through all the levels and am now starting to build my own, and I look forward to what else this game has to offer.			"

												Infinifactory is a very open-ended puzzle game. You are presented with a bunch of input parts, and it's up to you to move and weld them in order to match them to the desired output. The factory that you put together to accomplish this purpose needs to synchronize the movement of all these individual pieces such that they interact cleanly, and don't accidentally push a piece one tile off and suddenly you have a massive traffic jam. Unlike some puzzle games, you're not stuck bashing your head trying to find the one and only solution - you're finding out how to make your own solution work.For those who have played SpaceChem, you'll be right at home with these concepts. For those that haven't, I highly recommend you try the free demo for SpaceChem and see how you like that.I find the difficulty in Infinifactory to be much more forgiving than in SpaceChem. You will never run out of room to come up with your solution - you have all the room in the world to make your solution as inelegant and bulky as possible if that's what it takes to make it work. Of course, the major appeal is still optimization. There are 3 categories to optimize for - complete the desired output in as little runtime as possible, use the least amount of vertical real estate, or use as few factory blocks as possible. The beauty of those optimized solutions is really what gives a great feeling of accomplishment to the players.As detailed, the gameplay is extremely solid. The engine runs and loads smooth - there is nothing in the way of getting to the gameplay. There's a goofy story that entertains some, doesn't detract from the gameplay at all, but I would hardly consider it to be a major draw of the game. Graphics, sound, and music are all decent (music is a definite downgrade from SpaceChem).			"

												I got this on May's humble bundle and was intrigued by it...ironically enough despite it being by the makers of Spacechem. You see...I didn't like that game. It had potential, but had lots of things dragging it down. And with the premise here being somewhat the same but in 3D (take this input and build this), I was cautious: would this suffer the same fate?I can be blunt: absolutely not. Infinifactory is IMHO much, MUCH better. In what way? I'm glad you asked... :-)-despite it being 3D, building and placement is intuitive and straightforward. There's a minimal time between the ""I want to build this"" and actually placing it. At first I thought this game would work better in an isometric perspective (think the first rollercoaster tycoons), but I'm not sure anymore. In any case: it works for the use you want to make of it.-much more aesthetically pleasing, even to the point of too much. Someone certainly had fun creating beatifull skylines and wide open floating space platforms. Why are we building a production line of missiles on a sharp mountain top? No reason other than ""Because We Can!!!"". But hey: video game.-nice soothing music. And for puzzle games like this, this is a huge plus.-decent difficulty. In spacechem, I felt like being thrown into the deep water soon after the intro levels. Thus far, the difficulty progresses much better (though don't kid yourself: levels remain challenging)-interface is clean and simple-perhaps due to things already mentioned, but I really feel like ""just doing stuff"" in this game. I like to try, see what works and even love to see how my own best-laid plan turns out completely wrong due to me not understanding e.g. how conveyor belts handle larger block chunks. There's no one single solution, but this game enables you to just trow things at the wall and see what sticks. :-)On the story, I'm not completely sold. Despite audio logs and occasional performance reviews by aliens who captured you, I just don't feel really engrained in it. It's in no means bad and occasionally funny, it just doesn't connect to the actual gameplay. Then again, there are hardly games you play just for the story to begin with. ;-)I could name a few other nitpicks (like no toggle fast(er) forward button, or the jumping which is useless with infinite jetpack ammo), but that would only distract from the message that this is an absolutely great puzzle game.

												Now that I've completed the campaign of Infinifactory, I think it's time to get my full thoughts and feelings down about it.Gameplay wise there's nothing wrong at all. You're tasked with building factories that must move, weld, rotate, lift, and destroy input blocks to match an output, and it must do this 10 times. The puzzles are all fun and challenging to solve, with a great learning curve as you progress. Each new set of puzzles adds a new block or game mechanic for you to work with, and so the game is kept interesting and fresh, and the feeling you get after completing a puzzle you've been stuck on is euphoric. The game also grades how well you did after you complete a puzzle against other players, making you want to improve your solution until you're better than everyone else.The design of this game is fantastic and each setting for the puzzles manages to pull off a terrific atmosphere of loneliness and isolation. The factory blocks you build with are all very nicely designed, as are the input and output blocks. If I had one complaint about the design, it would be the information boards occasionally put in the puzzles to help you with how to use a new block (like in the 4th screen shot). Sometimes there's ""human"" symbols on them, such as a ""?"" or ""3x"". I mention this because your abductors clearly have no interest in learning your language, so why would they use symbols that you'd understand? I also want to mention that I love the soundtrack in this game.The story. Hmm. Well, as I mentioned, you have been abducted by aliens, and they are enslaving you and putting you to work building factories that make useful things for them, and I really like it. Much like Portal, the story is more like a framework to give an excuse to solve puzzles, and not the other way around, and it works really well. The story is told simply. You meet your abductors at the beginning of the the game, and then at the end of each set of puzzles to recieve a reward from them, and each time they garble opressive sounding nonsense at you and then send you to your cell. The story is also told through failure logs on corpses you find scattered throughout the levels, and gradually this builds up the bigger picture of your overlords. The tone of this game reminds me most of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy: funny but with an looming sense of tragedy. The humour is very subtle, and I love it. BUT...[Spoilers after this point, scroll to the bottom if you want my conclusion] (I would do the black out text thing but I have no idea how)This is ALL ruined when you get saved. Yes... I know... Being rescued is just the worst isn't it?After the last set of puzzles you're put infront of the overlords, and they present you with a reward as usual, but this time it's a bomb that a resistance group planted, and you are saved by them and put to work building ship parts etc.. needed for them to rescue more and then eventually go home. The puzzle quality doesn't drop, but the atmosphere and humour certainly does. That atmosphere of complete loneliness and isloation and opression that was created by the overlords is totally destroyed. The dead corpses and failure logs are gone, and are replaced by recordings from the resistance leaders, almost all of which I hate. The only tolerable character for me is Ortis, and you don't even meet him. The dark underlying humour is replaced with generic banter between the leaders and ""I'm so glad that you didn't die from that explosion when we saved you"" jokes. It's so difficult to say this but I hate the second half of the story. If you'd stayed under the opression of the overlords, but kept the same puzzles from the resistace campaign, you'd have a perfect game in my opinion. Maybe it could've been that the resistance did start to attack, and the overlords started forcing you to build things that would destroy the resistance trying to save you.Maybe the story bothers me a bit more than others, but it still remains that it annoys me.Regardless of this, I still highly recommend this game for the gameplay. It's a fun, challenging puzzle game and I guess that's all it really needed to be.			"

												Infinifactory is the most enjoyable puzzle game I've played in agesThe premise is fairly straight forward, you have one or more input hoppers that provide you with a steady stream of different blocks, which you must then manipulate, assemble and transport to produce a finished product, using a variety of tools such as conveyors and rotators to move them, welders and cutters to join or split them and sensors and pushers to act as basic logic.Sound simple? In theory perhaps but in practice it's devious, dastardly and downright mind boggling at times. There are many ways to approach each puzzle, forcing you to think laterally and often creatively about how you'll tackle it. I've been taking it slowly, doing one or two puzzles a night and my brain has been loving every minute of it. As the levels progress the puzzles become more complex, forcing you to think up new and better ways to perform parts of the overall task, and gradually increasing your arsenal of available tools to do it with.What really puts the icing on the cake is the great sense of accomplishment upon solving each puzzle. Obviously this is the case for most puzzle games but watching your awesome contraptions manhandle the blocks into submission in an elegant symphony of cleverly planned motion and manipulation of your own design is immensely satisfying, far more so than most puzzlers I have playedIf you enjoy giving the ol' grey matter a good workout then don't hesitate to buy this game, it's an absolute joy.

								I like this game but the physics don't always make sense. For example, if you allow a pile of cubes to fall, creating a stack, then try to move the entire stack onto a conveyor with a 'pusher' cube at the very bottom, the stack will come apart, cube by cube, rather than move as one tall unit, as would happen in real life. Also, the developers should not make it possible to fall off the platform; just let players 'float' all the time. Finally, the 'story' is frankly pretty silly. The puzzles alone are plenty -- and that's why I'm giving it a thumbs up.			"

The puzzle and your surroundings don't realy gel that well and you quickly discover that is is just a puzzle game with some flair.Granted the little details are great but they are unfocused.A must have for puzzle people, as it is a very good puzzle game, but for the general people who like just a little puzzle in their pasta (like me) this isnt the one.UPDATE:Changed my recomendation based on @MCFrosty Its all about the ""i recomend it"" but in truth its perceived as ""Is this game crap or not"".

								Zachtronics is bringing us another cerebral masterpiece!If you enjoyed SpaceChem, then it's a pretty safe bet you'll love Infinifactory. But there's another old, free Zachtronics game that's even more like Infinifactory. It's called Manufactoid, and if you don't mind some ugly graphics and (very, very light) programming, then you should absolutely check it out if you're on the fence about Infinifactory.The goal in Infinifactory (and Manufactoid, and SpaceChem for that matter) is to build specific objects from the inputs you're given. You have conveyor belts and rotators to move blocks around, sensors and pushers to move them around in a smarter way, welders to fuse blocks into the larger objects that you're tasked with building, and some other kinds blocks that I won't spoil. In Manufactoid (seriously, go Google it if you like this sort of thing! I'll wait...) you had to write tiny little ""programs"" to run your factory. For example, you might have to write some code that said (translated to English), ""anytime sensor 5 is activated, also activate pushers 3,4, and 7"". In principle you could write much more complicated programs (the language is Lua), but in practice this is what it ended up being. Infinifactory takes out the programming completely, but the third dimension makes up for it by giving us much more flexibility to hook up our sensors, pushers, and so on without them interfering with one other.As others have said, this isn't your typical half-baked Early Access title. These guys are doing it right. The graphics are appealing, performance is good, controls are tight, and there are 30 well-designed puzzles already. Anyone who has played SpaceChem knows that 30 puzzles (okay, maybe 20 since the first few are necessarily easy) can last you a long time. And there'll no doubt be a lot more coming along soon.Just buy it. You'll get your money's worth, and Zach deserves to get rich.			"

								This game, though made by the same creators as Spacechem, is quite different. Though they are both puzzlers, their mechanics and quirks are different to suit the style. I would recommend if you are either a fan of puzzle games or want to support Zachtronics.			"

								It's like this game was specifically designed for me. I was kinda into minecraft for a while until it dawned on me that the only thing I really cared about was making redstone contraptions. This game is nothing but contraptions, and ones that require exact planning. Even after solving a puzzle, there's always more efficiency you can squeeze out of it to make an even better solution.

												One of Zachtronics' previous games, SpaceChem, is probably my favorite puzzle game ever. I was reluctant to try Infinifactory, as I thought it surely couldn't be nearly as good as SpaceChem, and at least the controls would definitely be awkward. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. The game is smooth and introduces you to new concepts little by little, just like SpaceChem. The optimization challenges are still there, too, so you can compete against your Steam friends. If you liked SpaceChem, you'll like this one as well, no question about it. :)(Also note that during the Steam Summer Sale 2016, right now, SpaceChem is on a -90% sale, so it's a steal!)			"

												I thought I was 20 minutes in... and it's been hours. Super-duper recommended; it's seemingly simple puzzles with complete freedom in solving. Not like, a couple of possibilities, but total liberty to make the most efficient and simple building machines to giant overly-compilcated craziness. Controls are straight forward, the only tool missing is the ability to copy/paste/rotate sections that you create. There's a bit of story to progress the game which is nice, but the satisfaction of seeing you're assembly line pump out the thing you intened is extremely rewarding. Get it!			"

												Infinifactory is all about production in the best way possible. Captured by your alien overlords you're tasked with making factory lines to produce goods from small boxes to towering space craft. The puzzles are awesome! And the ideas you can come up with are pretty darn crazy at times with so much content and custom content to jump into there is tons to get addicted too!.

Early Access Review
								This is a very clever and intriuging game. Essentially, you have a Minecraft-style building interface, except instead of using blocks of raw materials the blocks represent machinery, and the goal is to build a factory to transform inputs you're provided with into specified outputs. While the building interface can be a bit fiddly from time to time, the puzzling is fascinating and addictive. The only concern I have is that some of the later puzzles can be HARD - it may take an hour just to build them, let alone solve them. At that point I was sometimes left wondering why, if you would want to play a programming-style game this hard, you wouldn't just actually program - especially since there are games online based on real programming which don't leave you cursing that there isn't room to build the function you need! But at the same time, building factories does have a very visceral and effective feeling which brought me back to the game several times.			"

												Reminds me a lot of Spacechem, but 3D. You've got a fairly limited set of blocks and you've gotta' figure out how to make them do what you need them too. Each level has a goal object/objects, and you have to take the individual parts that come in, form them into that object/those objects, and then move them to the output area. It's really satisfying when you finish your machine and you watch it working perfectly, not wasting a single piece.It also shows you some graphs at the end to compare your performance to everyone else's, so you can see if you made a big, slow, bulky and wasteful mess or a 100% efficient and compact machine.If you're the kind of person who likes to tinker with stuff and make things do stuff, you'll like this game.

Interesting game: it reminds of The Talos Principle, but certainly no where near as developed.  However, the openness and creativity given to the player is incredible.  The game is challenging.There is nothing to brag about on a technical level.  The graphics are sufficient, though capped at 60fps.  The music is very dull, unoriginal, and boring.  Even the game's aesthetic is tedious and boring; it looks like it was designed by an engineer.  The system of letting you save and compare 3 solutions on each puzzle is wonderful.This is certainly a fun game if you really enjoy building systems.  If you are the sort of person that enjoys building a daftly-intricate redstone line in Minecraft you will be right at home.  You will get a brain workout.  I felt like an engineering genius after solving the first 3 puzzles; then things started getting much much worse for me.  I can't for the life of me figure out how to delay one conveyer belt by one turn when needed.  I guess my character is still in his cell eating dog pellets.			"

												Where for some reason I could not into Spacechem, Infinifactory has got me by the short and curlies. It's a genius example of puzzle design, really, in a style somewhat reminiscent of The Incredible Machine. You're given a specific input and output, sometimes a few special pieces in the middle, and set loose to design your madcap assembly line. There's no right answer, just whatever produces the desired product without causing a broken pileup along the way. You are then given a numeric breakdown of your carbon footprint, blocks used, and cycles (length) taken, on a bar graph showing average global player scores for that level. I think that's also brilliant, because you aren't competing for any specific ""S Rank"" conditions (although there are some achievements to that effect), you're just shown how you stack up to the player average and left to decide for yourself if you want to try to go back and optimize things just that little bit more...Levels often look daunting at first glance, but as prodded at will usually unravel gradually as you work out where to put piece buffers, delay gates, and so on. Failing that, you can always go look at some other player builds, which in recreating you will come to understand the fundamental components thereof. Even by cheating you're learning to play the game better.There's also a more sandboxy set of levels available, and a built-in GIF recorder for showing off your solutions. Fantastic puzzle game that basically does everything right.			"

												Amazing puzzler. Every stage asks you to create you a certain structure from basic blocks using conveyors, welders and other special blocks. Very challenging and allows for many different solutions to every puzzle.			"

								About halfway through, and Zachtronic's done it again... Excellent game, it's SpaceChem but made more accessible with a lighter narrative and more intuitive Minecraft (or Infiniminer) metaphors. If you wanted to like SpaceChem but stopped after a few levels (or when you reached the boss battle) then try this, the developer has learned a lot of restraint. Masterwork in puzzle and systems design.			"

												Infinitfactory, the game equivalent of being a programmer. You're given an input and have to use that input to create an appropriate output.Any roundabout method of creating the desired output can be taken, but if you want to compare yourself to others who play the game (I suggest you don't), then you can always try and make your machines as efficient as possible.Creating any old maching to solve a problem is fine in terms of game progression and pleasing your evil alien overlords and obtaining delicious food pellets, but if you want to prove yourself to the world, then you're going to have to make the most efficient machine possible. A machine that does all the actions in the least amount of time, with the least amount of blocks, with the smallest possible ground space taken! You're going to expend every single braincell trying to come up with the perfect solution! You're going to have to study programming efficency, engineering design, advanced maths, and possibly highschool geometry! This is not a game! This is the life of a programmer! Forced to make abritrary machines for your dimwitted but somehow technological advanced overlords!Anyway, good game, 10/10 would eat food pellets again.			"

One of the features I like best is that it shows you how well you did compared to everyone else's results so you can see if your solution is in the ballpark or where you could improve. That alone adds replayability as you try and figure out how to use less blocks, have a smaller footprint and complete the task in fewer cycles. Great fun!			"

								Remember when you played Monkey Island, or Portal for the first time, and you solved a puzzle and it was JUST hard enough to be impenetrable at a glance, but JUST easy enough that you never got to the point where you just gave up? Remember how, at the completion of each puzzle, you felt like the smartest person alive?This game does that.It's interesting enough to play many levels at a stretch, but nicely chunkable, so that if you're busy and just want to knock out a single puzzle, you can get it done in 20 minutes and come back for more at another time.

												This game is one of Zachtronics' engineering/building games, which also includes SpaceChem and TIS-100.  Although all three games are great, Infinifactory is in my opinion the best of the three.  The big difference is the three-dimensional aspect of it (Zachtronics' slogan is ""Like SpaceChem, but in 3-D!"").  The 2-D nature of SpaceChem and TIS-100 sometimes leads to situations where it's very hard to see how to proceed to a solution without completely gutting your existing one. In Infinifactory, because of the third dimension, you can usually kludge your way to a working solution if you put in enough time.  And that's where the brilliance of the game shines through: once you finish a level, you will get three histograms showing where your solution compares to other peoples' solutions in terms of speed, number of blocks, and total footprint.  If you've done a kludgy solution, you won't score well, and it will bother you to the point that you will eventually come back to make a better solution.  Elegance counts in Infinifactory, just like in real engineering!  (Sometimes I come up with better solutions while sleeping, and I have to rush to try them out when I wake up.)  So this game has massive replay value, more than any other game I've played.  Also, I find that TIS-100 and SpaceChem feel kind of dry and abstract after a while, but the more tangible nature of Infinifactory doesn't seem to have this problem.  There are only a small number of block types, but one of the delights of this game is that you are always finding new ways to combine blocks to form functional groups, which you then will use over and over again (starting by redoing all of your old solutions to use the new trick).  If this sounds like programming, it is!  If you're a programmer or an engineer, this game will be like crack to you.  It has the same ""feel"" as programming, but the actual tasks are sufficiently different that it's still new and exciting.  Pretty much the only negative thing I can say about Infinifactory is that you can spend way too much time on it if you're not careful.  Oh, and if you're an expert and manage to get through all the levels, there are also community levels to continue to torture your brain, or you can create your own.  So if you've liked any of the other Zachtronics games, or other building games like Factorio, you should give Infinifactory a try.			"

								OMG the best puzzle game I have played since Portal! It's amazing but can be too challenging at times and may confuse people 8.7/10. One thing that I think may make the game better is by being able to create levels easier. Another thing is being able to create objectives in which you have to make ACTUAL parts like rocket ship parts.			"

												When I loaded the game and realized it was made by the same people that made Spacechem I knew I was already in love. 20 hours into the campaign so far with plenty left to do! Plus the steam workshop has some awesome challenges! If you think ""atyppicaly"" for solving problems then this is your game.Oh and also cudos to the team for that delightful nod to genders. It really made the game that much more worth getting to that point. Never before has a game been actually on par with what I has a transwoman could for as humor. That got me laughing then crying once I realized so few might get the joke. So again thank you.Sorry to do a second edit... but I mean what more do you want from this game other than someone to tell you more about it because of how much they enjoyed it? The soundtrack is so nice and relaxing that it actually feels like it makes you solve the problem faster and more efficiently. 10/10 would buy again... but please no... Im poor... Soundtrack was worth the extra buy tho...			"

I had no idea what was going on with the story. The puzzles were allright but it would be nice if there was some kind of prompt for some of the puzzles, something to get you thinking. The graphics weren't that good eiether for a game released in 2015.Overall, the game added nothing to the puzzle genre and it doesn't really have a selling point or something that would amke it stand out from other games.

												Since everyone is rating the game so well, I have to conclude that my brain simply cannot process the puzzles in Infinifactory to a degree that I feel like I've really deduced my way through the levels. I mostly just did a bunch of trial and error until it looked like I was close to having what I needed and finally got it, but didn't really have any satisfaction from it. While I could logic my way through the Portal games and had a great time with them, this title just leaves me staring listlessly at the puzzle I'm supposed to solve, then trying with horrible results at getting my machine to do what I want.I'm quite terrible at this game and do not feel like I've really learned much at all when I complete a level. It looks like there are 6 or 7 different ""sets"" of levels, and just the second level of the second set had me give up. If I didn't like puzzles, I wouldn't have played through Portal and Portal 2 multiple times. Some people ""get"" this game when it comes to making the machines work. I just don't despite having tried, and any ""git gud"" mentality directed at me isn't going to change the facts that some people just can't improve at certain things. As such, I cannot recommend the game as it is statistically impossible that someone will lack the spatial comprehension of how these machines function simultaneously to do well and have fun, and that portion of people, even if it's small, deserves representation.

												Doesn't conform to industry standards to allow SKIPPING cinematics to go straight into gameplay. When you first buy the game you'll be stuck watching a terrible cinematic that may make you think a 3rd grader came up with it.  It's a simple concept game, that provides problem solving challenges which some may find difficult, but for the most part if you think the options/routes through you'll fly through the game. However, this game is NOT worth $24.99, until a skip cinematic is included and the price comes down to a reasonable price for what this game is, I won't change my review. Save your money, do NOT buy this game unless it's on sale for well under $10.			"

												It's a little on the nose to set a game this boring in a forced labor camp.I'm not going to fault Infinifactory for trying so hard to look like Portal, and I have to assume that they are: It's a first person puzzle platformer with a dark sense of humor, a villain with an odd way of motivating you and a story mostly related to you through what is left by those that went before.  It's a good formula with a lot of room to move around in.  The problem is that each time you build and transport something (ie the primary mechanic of the game)  it takes a ton of time and experimentation.  You don't come to understand the world or your character or your enemy.  For 99% of the game you're just working, and that's just, well, not fun.  ""A"" for effort though.			"

Moving things from point a to point b just doesn't equal a fun experience to me. If you have always imagined having a room full of conveyors moving things from one hole to another this might be the game for you though.			"

I do not find itt difficult, I am sure it gets harder as it goes but why would I want to punish myself through hours and hours of boredom to get to a challenging level?- This is my opinion, if you do not like it, too bad.

												The game equivalent of soylent; barren of any story, warmth, characters, joy or happiness connected with a great or heartfelt experience. It's tasteless nutrition destilled in a laboratory and plays like doing spreadsheets for a living. I died a little every minute I stayed with it.If you like this, you're probably a savant-sp3rging grognard, frying ants with a magnifying glass in your spare time and struggling daily with the urge not to fold your socks for optimal drawer storage. You never understood the point of ""hugs"", the concept of ""feelings"" or the joys of ""friendship"". From your safe little work cubicle, middle-manager Glengarry Ross has long since discovered that even a pat on the back is too much human contact for you too handle; just letting you do your job of making corporatism billions for companies ""too big to fail"" is for the best. You can find the square root of any number in existence, but wouldn't recognize a human heart if it was fed to you.Your days are spent working on the next algorithm for all and any evil powers to market, upsell, and £uck over the world even more. Because empathy and heart have no meaning for your one-sided brain; only ice-cold logic matters. Every efficent way you develop to make factories and processes better goes to feed the already filthy rich and r@pe the rest of the struggling population. For you, cubes, formulas and optimalization are more important than empathy, psychology, and other people writhing in pain because of your work. The evils of the world thrives on piggy-backing your pure intelligence outlook, that never pauses to think about WHY you do what you do, only that you CAN do it.And the world is less for it. Because - never the wiser - you're happy being a drone in your own bubble, chipping away at making the world better for rotten bankers and other psychopaths, while the rest of us wither and die under the machine you engineer, maintain and drive for them. As a tool, albeit a finely tuned intelligent one, your high IQ is part of the Big Ethical Problem for Most People, while solving all the Profitable Ones for The One Percent People.You would be ashamed - if you could grasp the concept.

Early Access Review
								I was misled into thinking this was a game about factories where you'd have some freeform interpretation of how to solve problems, create different things, and improve on the efficiency of your factories. Wrong.Just like SpaceChem (which I played), it's just a left-brained nerd's wet dream- brain-teaser puzzles that really just revolve around spatial reasoning and working out the ""timing"" of various pieces of conveyors to make sure that they arrive at the same time and that the moving parts don't intersect.Wow can you optimize your factory by solving the spatial puzzle in fewer ""cycles"" or with fewer blocks!?  WOW!I was hoping for a production and logistics game.  I either misunderstood, or it was improperly advertised to me.If I want to do something like this I'll write code, thanks.  Because this is just basically an exercise in writing code.  With a lot less freedom.			"

								This game is good and well done, but holy hell, you need a degree in mechanics or asperger's in order to get anywhere meaningful, the difficulty curve is extremely steep after the training campaign, and the game doesn't explain many of the needed mechanics to make semi-successful factories.Unreccommended until it gets a better learning stage and eases down the learning curve a lot.

												Did you play SpaceChem? Did you like it? Just skip the rest of this review and buy Infinifactory now, you can thank me later.Everybody else: this is a game for programmers, engineers, puzzle addicts, and generally anybody who enjoys using logic to solve, or create, problems. Kidnapped by a Vogon-like race of aliens, you will be forced to create machines that automatically assemble (and sometimes disassemble) an increasingly complex variety of objects. Your tools are a collection of cube-shaped building blocks - conveyors, welders, pistons, sensors, etc. - of which you have an infinite supply. There are no time limits or resource limits, just a set of inputs and a target output. The feeling of satisfaction you get when one of your creations finally works the way it's supposed to is only matched by the feeling you get when you suddenly realize how to get it working even better; shaving a few cycles off your assembly time or eliminating a handful of extraneous blocks. And if, sorry, *when* you get frustrated, there's something oddly rewarding about deliberately monkey-wrenching the works and watching the garbage output pile up to the sky. In the end, you're free to settle for hackish stupid-but-it-works solutions, or to go full ASME and devise mechanical logic gates and suchlike to produce fine-tuned precision assembly lines - each level has three ""slots"" for you to work in, so you're free to copy over designs or work on alternative solutions without throwing away work you've already done. There's even a Steam achievement for creating exceptionally inefficient solutions, which is a nice touch.The plot, such as it is, is mostly there for seasoning and is at first just dribbled out in the various atmospheric touches like your spartan quarters (containing only a bed, a food pellet dispenser, and a bathroom-like facility clearly designed by somebody who didn't know much about human anatomy, and didn't care to learn more) and the aliens' curious and misguided attempts to provide motivational rewards. Details start to emerge as you progress, mostly in recorded ""failure logs"" hidden throughout the levels, and finally things start to be spelled out in considerably more detail, after a plot twist which I guess I shouldn't give away here. There's humor, tragedy, and intrigue, all of which is really just a bonus as far as I'm concerned - like any good puzzle game, the puzzles themselves provide all the motivation needed to want to press on, and I found the difficulty curve to be just about perfect.There's a few glitches in the version I'm currently playing - occasionally you'll fall through what appears to be solid ground, for example - but fortunately your character is equipped with a jetpack so this is merely an annoyance, and not really game-affecting. The graphics are simple and clean, and this should run fairly well even on low-end or outdated PCs. I should also mention the ability to automatically record looping GIFs of your creations, which is a nice touch.This is definitely not for people who prefer their games to mostly consist of problems that are solved by shooting at them, but if the concept behind Infinifactory appeals to you at all, I can all but guarantee you're going to have a lot of fun here.

												Very cool game, though I can`t play it anymore, due to a crash no one else seems to be having.So, basically, you're captured by aliens, and you have to build factories. The catch is: It's not as easy as it looks.You'll get access to new things as you progress in the game, and then you'll be able to complete even more tasks.This is essentially a 3D Programming Language, and a 3D version of SpaceChem. Pros:  - Very addictive - It won't hold your hand, like most other puzzle games - Acctualy Hard puzzles Cons:  - A crash didn't let me playRating:Gameplay ( 9 / 10 ) [ The jetpack down button is just horrible, so this is why it's not 10/10 ]Story  ( 7 / 10 ) [ This isn't very important in a puzzle game like this, but it's still there, so I'm gonna rate it anyways ]Graphics ( 8 / 10 ) [ It's not using super-mega-ultra-modern-graphics, but they're still nice. ]Overall ( 9 / 10) [ It's very close to Game of the Year for me. ]			"

												This ranks alongside Spacechem as one of my all time favorite games. Challenging puzzles, engaging story, overall a well-oiled and ingeniously-designed game. Well worth the money for programming/engineering types and anyone who enjoyed Spacechem.GameplayPretty straightforward. Given parts, build a factory which assembles the parts into a final product. New tools are introduced one at a time, and there is just enough help given to the player to get them going. Obstacles and pitfalls arise naturally forcing the player to think of creative workarounds. I found the final puzzles very challenging, but neither frustrating nor insurmountable. Solving the finale was pretty satisfying!StoryUnlike Spacechem, whose story was as cold and unforgiving as space, Infinifactory's storyline includes some subtle humor, as well as voice acting and interaction with physical characters. To me, the introduction of humor was a bit awkward at first, especially since it still retained elements of the same grim tone as Spacechem, but it was easy to get used to. Overall, the story branches out in tone rather well, and remains in the background and never distracts.OtherThe achievements and the workshop provide some extra challenges, and the nature of the game makes it very suitable for user-created puzzles. Gotta make my own soon...			"

												Never thought building a factory could be this fun. Infinitely recommended! If you like Portal and Minecraft redstone circuits you'll be at home! Makes me think about the old contraptions games too.Only negative point is the graphics. They are intuitive and simple but I would have liked them to be more advanced/detailed especially shaders and lighting. The game is compatible with older hardware though and runs butter smooth, which is always a plus.Keep up the very good work :)			"

												Infinifactory is very different from almost any other puzzle game you can find. Primarily, it is not a game about finding the goal: what you start with, and what you end with, are both given to you. It is up to the player to turn the input into the output, and to do so, they must design a machine to solve the level. It is not a game about building things; in a very abstract way, it is a game about programming. Just like SpaceChem and TIS-100. And a few Flash games, mostly made by the Zachtronics themselves. It's a very barren market; you owe it to yourself to play at least one of them, if you like puzzles. And Infinifactory is, by far, the easiest to recommend.""Like SpaceChem, but 3D"" is not an inaccurate description. It is very much about taking a collection of parts, each with a very simple job (move a block, turn a block, detect a block) and stringing them together to make outputs. But Infinifactory demonstrates a key difference to SpaceChem: it's not as aggressively difficult. It is impossible to understate just how difficult SpaceChem becomes at the later levels; so difficult, that it's hard to even find enjoyment from the frustration. And you can take the developer's word for it: in the postmortem, Zach Barth described SpaceChem as having ""an oppressive 40+ hour difficulty curve that only 2 percent of players reach the end of.""Infinifactory manages to provide all the satisfaction of SpaceChem, without the progress-denying difficulty. And it is not due to a lack of difficult levels; the game introduces many new mechanics at a regular rate, and it makes use of all of them. The more forgiving difficulty comes as a result of more subtle design choices; there's the obvious increase in player options by having a third dimension, but Infinifactory also never forces the player into a confined space. The actual construction zone in SpaceChem was always tiny, but you are never at a loss for space in Infinifactory. Combined with having a lot more tools, this means the player can solve any level using a vast number of approaches, and will almost certainly be able to make that method work if they keep at it. I would posit this as a very good thing.The story of the game is dissimilar to SpaceChem and TIS-100 in that it is surprisingly straightforward. Both of their other games dabble in a Lovecraftian-esque sense of mystique, stories that tease you with the unknown, often even making the player uncomfortable even as they desperately want to have the answers. Infinifactory's story has its twists, but I must say I missed the sense of discovery their other games have provided; I feel that has always paired very well with the gameplay.The last levels of the game were far more disappointing (minor spoilers to follow). The difficulty curve of the endgame is very well done; each of the final areas are easily distinguished by their mechanics alone. However, this breaks down at the second to last level. This level introduces an entirely new mechanic: instead of turning inputs into outputs, you have to build a machine to control the firing of weapons, and target your enemies. At the same time, it introduces a new block - a toggle, to allow you to control the machine in real time. The level itself is also fairly difficult, with failure always only a few seconds away. To throw all of these new mechanics at the player at once, and require such aptitude from them, is quite off-putting; while I did enjoy most of the boss levels in SpaceChem, I felt this was poorly executed. The final level itself was also incredibly underwhelming. Not that it was easy - it's an alright final level - but it was a bit disappointing that none of the mechanics introduced towards the end of the game were actually implemented. I believe the final level would have been much more interesting if the inputs were organized in a more forgiving way, and all the mechanics such as paints and metal were somehow implemented in it.Another, much broader issue is the implementation of the Steam Workshop. Namely, there is no in-game way to really interact with a level, other than just playing it. It would mean a lot if the game would offer for you to rate/comment on a level after you've played it - while you can always open it up in your browser, you clearly can't expect others to do that, and most of the community levels for Infinifactory have no ratings or comments. The real issue is that browsing for levels is affected by this lack of information, and the game itself does not encourage anyone to provide it.But that's the last two levels out of a game containing a few dozen. Those two paragraphs basically contain all of my complaints for the game, but I can't fit all of my praise into this entire review. Seriously, Infinifactory is great, you should buy it.			"

												Wow, this game blew my mind! It is in a way like Minecraft. And i mean not because it is block based but much more because its built around a genius idea and delivers this incredibly fun and immersive game experience. It was a boring summer morning when i decided to give this game a shot. I'd just refund it if it was bad, right? Well after two days i already had 32 (out of 48) hours of gameplay (when i ate dinner i left it on so it might ""only"" have been 30 hours)! That leaves 18 hours. Minus 14 for sleeping (7 hours a night) and we have 4 hours for 6 meals. You could say i had a blast playing this game...+ Superb game idea+ Unbelievably satisfying to solve a puzzle and watch your factory working so perfectly (seriously this is a huge plus. every gamer will get a boner from watching this)+ Creating your own level is so abnormaly easy that it takes you about 3 minutes to create a level you can then solve yourself (and share in the steam workshop)+ the story makes it even more fun (not that the story would be good but it gives you a ""reason"" to build the factories and makes everything funnier)+ Everything elsethe only negative thing:- there are no upward welders (and generally the welding of large objects) (you'll understand when you've progressed a bit into the game). The problem is that you have this genius idea in your head that you want to build and then you realize that you have to rebuild everything just because you need upward facing welders.IS THIS GAME FOR YOU?Did you not hate Protal / Protal 2? If yes then you'll adore this game!If no then you'll buy it anyway because you can jut refund it if it sucks.			"

												tl;dr - great game that will keep you awake and keep you interested. 10/10Fantastic Puzzle Game.  You'll want to beat your friends' scores. You'll want to go back to each puzzle after a while to optimise and streamline.  The game rewards creativity and logic as well as just fudging solutions and some happy accidents.  The production lines themselves are simple to build (especially if you're used to minecraft) and the interface is really easy to use.The story is great as well (no spoilers), and speaking of spoilers, I haven't gone searching the internet for solutions or tricks as that would kind of spoil the fun.The only annoyance is I keep hitting the 'stop' button instead of pausing, and troubleshooting/bug hunting can be a little long winded if you're factory is almost finished.  Fortunately, you can speed up time or pause whenever you want.			"

Posted: December 8, 2015
												I’ll start the review this way: Infinifactory is up to now (Dec 2015) my favourite game all times. So this review might be a bit biased, but I’ll try to be as objective as I can.Ok, first off: what is Infinifactory?In Infinifactory, you build a factory out of blocks around input blocks, which you combine, wield and modify in order to obtain the output block (or structure) that you have to move to the output pad. This description doesn’t give justice to the game, I think other Steam reviews are way better at explaining the core of the game, but I’ll expand on more detailed elements of the game.Infinifactory is better described as a puzzle game, because of the way the game is structured: you have a problem, and you have to provide a solution to it. But it is a puzzle game in a way you have never seen before (at least if you didn’t play another Zachtronic game, such as SpaceChem or TIS-100). In the sense that you don’t have a unique, inelastic solution that you have to figure out by trial and error or logic: you build your factory from the ground up, with as much (if not more) freedom as if you were playing Minecraft, but with only functional blocks. This is why I love this game so much: each puzzle have literally a near infinite ways to be solved, and each solutions has its flaws and advantages. You can strive for the most elegant factory, or maybe you want something compact and minimize the footprint count, possibly, you can go for optimisation, or you just want to get done with the puzzle and unlock the next one. Each one of those building style will lead to drastically different factories and unique dynamic problems and challenges that you create for yourself, because you are masochistic and want to be higher ranked on the leaderboard.Many people compare this game to programming, because the way problems happens and how you solve them is comparable to programming. As you progress into the game, you’ll have to remember technics that you learned on easier puzzles and use them in combination with other new technics, or adapt them to the new terrain and the new parts you are presented with.When you build a factory, you can test it with the “play” button and easily figure out where your factory goes wrong (if it goes wrong, which it will, unless you are the incarnation of God on earth) because the game mechanics are based on 3D space and very simple predictable physics. It leads to you being able to judge what happens in the factory and build it based on your visual representation of what could happen.Ok, now I won’t talk too much about the rest of the game, because the puzzles are where the meat and body of the game lies. In terms of graphics, it is good enough to be pleasing to the eye. In terms of story, it is good enough and minimalistic enough to not be distracting, and the music is soothing. All of that is the perfect storm to build a calm atmosphere which let you focus on the puzzles and building your factory 100% without losing your mind or being annoyed at all. Which is probably what puts this game over the top for me.There is Workshop support: that means you can download custom puzzles made by other people and solve them in your way. There is some really good ones, and it would be a shame to miss on them. You can also build your own maps with the in-game map editor. This one is basically a Minecraft on steroid, since the game style is voxel based, so it is easy enough, once you get how to reach your favourite blocks, to build your own puzzles.So why is this game so little popular? My guess is on the price tag: it seems a lot for an “indie” game, and people just don’t buy it. But look at my playtime, I have played Infinifactory for about 67 hours. The game is ridiculously great and has a lot of content, without for the least being repetitive or padded. There is about ten minutes of cutscence grand total, which means 99% of your playtime will be enjoying the game, and that’s without counting when you are thinking of the game not logged in, because you just thought of that cool new way of solving a puzzle in the bus or at work.So here you have it, let yourself be convinced by this review, say goodbye to your 25 bucks and say hello to 60 hours of untold fun!

												Very addictive puzzler. There are many ways to solve each puzzle so you also have some replayability trying to optimize either for footprint (least pieces required) or speed (fastest factory output). If you liked SpaceChem, this is from the same creators, except this game is a 3-dimensional puzzler instead of 2-dimensional. The challenge ramps up appropriately, but never feels impossible.			"

												This is, by far, the best puzzle game I have ever played. It requires you to think ahead and mind timing, recources and building all in one. You will end up building crazy big machines and it is very frustating a times, but when you finally get that solution right, then you realize how amazing and clever this game actually is. Must-have for anyone that likes puzzlers, machines and/or wants to be busy for a while			"

												I really like the pacing and style of these puzzles. The easy early ones give you a chance to develop generalized techniques to apply to the later ones, as it should be in a good puzzle game. Unlike some games, the puzzles don't rely on ""gotchas"" that only the developer would think of (i.e., I've been able to solve all of them without spoilers so far).The levels tend naturally to break down into clearly divided sub-puzzles, so it's easy to jump in and start making progress. But you won't get bored, as there are frequent twists that can wreck your initial plans and make you consider a reset; sometimes the pieces don't fit together as you expected. When a new mechanic is introduced, expect to spend some time figuring out the nuances. Best of all, as you solve the sub-puzzles of a given level to your liking, your sub-solutions will play and re-play in the background as you continue working on the remaining pieces, which can be oddly satisfying. The score statistic histograms add some replay value for optimization.You can't die. Timing matters for machines but not player actions. Small mistakes are easily fixed for no penalty. The UI is nicely polished. There's a darkly comedic backstory that intrigues without getting in the way (warning, includes mentions of harm to animals). It's got very well thought out voxel editing tools (I never expected to see a usable drag and drop in 3D). It might be my ideal puzzle game, and it's making me want to try Infiniminer.			"

												Have traded off sleep to play this game. Building a factory is in itself rewarding, optimizing it to get better production statistics is very challenging. I would love to see statistics on factory efficiency in % of population and perhaps a way to view solutions the top ranking people had.Without all of that, still a very worthwhile game.			"

												Really well made puzzle game, one has to think outside of the box for some (if not all) sollutions.Quite a challenge at times, love it.Contains a good save system so one can store a sollution (or partial thereof) and try to improve on it for challenges or try something completely new next to it to improve scores.Story is quirky but well fitting. I do recommend it if looking for a good puzzle game. Got it on a sale and am loving it.			"

								Excellent game for anybody who likes specifically problem solving; in a lot of ""puzzle solving"" games your goal is to find the answer intended by the puzzle maker, while here you can make any solution you want with a lot of room for finding an elegant solution, a fast solution, or just the first solution you come up with.Overall the game has a very smooth learning curve, I started having to think about the puzzles very early in the game but never got to a point where I felt lost or unable to make any progress on the task at hand. The pseudo-leaderboard statistics encourage replaying to find more optimal solutions, also enabled by the game saving your past solutions and having multiple slots for each challenge so you can keep your successes while still trying new things from scratch. While I may have blown through the entirety of the included levels in a single day due to my immense ability to obsess for very short times, I have yet to try any user-submitted content or attempt any interesting creations of my own. The quality of the level creator and community support will go a long way toward increasing the longevity of the game... And all that without even being fully released!That's not to say the game doesn't have any issues. Several blocks have multiple types, such as clock- / counterclock-wise rotators, horizontal/vertical sensors and welders, which take up the limited space on the hotbar. Fortunately the block selection menu can easily be used to select blocks not on the hotbar, but I'd rather have the virtually identical blocks simply become completely identical blocks to free up some space.On a related note, rotation. The reason that some of those duplicate blocks are needed is because there is only one axis of roatation available, and being able to place any block vertically would provide a lot of more appealing solutions compared to what is actually available. Maybe this was intentional in order to make the Lifter block acquired late in the game more relevant, since it's literally the only way to move anything ""up"", but even the lifter is frequently awkward to use especially on large composite objects making vertical space management very important when planning construction.The only other thing is that the levels which have ""meat"" in the title are very disturbing, especially the second one. They are skippable, so do so if you consider yourself the least bit squeamish. I held myself together, but on the second one in particular I couldn't even bear to watch the machine I created; once I knew it would work I literally stared at the wall instead, and refused to do even a second of optimization. I would be happier if those levels simply weren't in the game at all. They don't ruin the experience though, and as mentioned they're skippable.Update: After playing a little longer I found a control which is only mentioned in they key bindings list, block mode (or something like that). This shortcut lets you switch between the horizontal and vertical versions of a block that has them, as well as pushers/blockers and counter/clockwise rotators. With this shortcut it's possible to have access to every block on the hotbar (other than one block which is only available in the free-build mode).			"

								If you like puzzle games (and who doesn't, really?), you'll like Infinifactory.  There isn't really that much of a story here per se, but the puzzles are challenging (after a gradual ramp-up, then a steep jump after you've gotten the basics), and the concepts in the game are unique.  I really enjoy playing, and I would recommend everyone at least try this out.  I'm sure it will only get better before it leaves Early Access status and is released Gold, but frankly, the core mechanics are solid in this game.I have found that some puzzles were rather challenging later in the game, but I prefer my puzzle games to challenge me to think creatively instead of being a snore fest.  I really liked the Portal series as well, but those puzzles were WAY too easy and linear.  This game requires you to think ahead, and can be especially challenging if you are trying to find an optimal solution in terms of cycle count and foot print.  There were quite a few that I completed thinking ""Wow, I think I have this just about perfect"" only to find that many people found MUCH better solutions! It makes me feel like I have much to learn, and at the same time enjoy the learning experience.10/10, would buy again.			"

								I found this game utterly absorbing.The introduction and tutorial are a little rough at this stage of the beta but once you get the hang of things its very rewarding to see your sprawling gravity defying assembly line spring into life and deliver a finished product to your evil alien overlords.The puzzles are challenging without being overly frustrating and as each stage consists of unlocking a half dozen problems at a time if you get stuck you can move to anouther puzzle and come back later rather than loose your patience. A simple but wonderfully effecive way to cut down on the keyboard punching.The game permits you to find your own effective designs and favoured ways of going about taks as more components are unlocked and you will feel like a mechanical genius each time you find a new way to use them.In short the game combines the free form building of mine crafts sandbox mode with challenging and intriguing puzzles of portal and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a building or puzzle game.

								Do you enjoy puzzle games that will result in you getting stuck on a level for hours on end, but make you want to strive to complete it, knowing that what you learned in the current challenge will apply to all the ones to follow? If so, then this game is for you!Infinifactory is by far the best puzzle game I have played in years, though it can be very tricky at times. Since you are basically creating a space factory of sorts, you have to pay close attention to the timing of every individual part of your machines. Having one single element of your design slightly off in timing can throw the whole thing out of whack, and will cause you to loose levels. Fortunately, the machine only runs when you tell it to do so, and you can pause it in action for a closer look at what exactly is happening at any time. The learning curve is decent and starts out fairly simple, but it does ramp up the difficulty quickly. Infinifactory gives you just enough hints to get started, and leaves the rest for you to figure out on your own. This is the sort of game that will force you to think spatially, and have a tendency to throw complete curveballs at what you though you knew about how to complete a level. Later in the game, when you start unlocking new components, you can return to your previous levels with the new components, and try to improve your score using them and any new techniques you have figured out.As an added bonus, the music is very well done. It is very relaxing, but not to the point that it will put you to sleep.Overall, If you love challenging puzzle games, then I absolutely recommend picking up Infinifactory. It is very challenging, but also very rewarding, and should keep you busy for quite some time.			"

								Another great game from Zachtronics.If you're a fan of puzzle games, and have played other games from Zachtronics (such as SpaceChem or The Codex of Alchemical Engineering), then you're definitely going to enjoy Infinifactory.As customary for Zachtronics games, it's a very challenging puzzler, though I feel the difficulty is much more balanced than in previous games like SpaceChem, for example.The game mechanics are solid, the puzzles are very well designed and the challenge increases at a steady, but fair pace.It also features a nice little story, but with some pretty decent voice acting, and quite a few funny moments.And, just like in SpaceChem, there's no feeling quite like the one of solving a very hard puzzle after an hour or two struggling with it. It's just a testament to how well designed the game and puzzles are, that you can spend more than an hour on a single puzzle (the hardest ones), without feeling frustrated.Given, it's still a very hardcore puzzle game, which is really not for everyone.But if you're a fan of hard puzzles, like thinking, and want something to challenge your mind, you definitely wanna buy Infinifactory. You're not gonna regret it.			"

								Think SpaceChem's puzzles mixed with Minecraft's Redstone.There are endless ways to solve the puzzles, and this game doesn't hold your hand.  Which is terrific because that also means it never gets in your way.  You truly can piece together a solution to a puzzle however you see fit.  If your friends play Infinifactory too, you will find endless surprises as you compare your factories and marvel at how completely differently each of you went about a particular puzzle.  The feeling of finishing a puzzle that you’ve been working on for over an hour, and finally getting to sit back and watch it go, is euphoric.  You really feel like you created a factory.  Taking into account the game’s beautiful art style, fun mood music, ingenious gameplay, and an overall perfect execution of an incredible concept; Infinifactory is what I call a perfect game! 10/10 "

												This game is 3D Spacechem. For more details, please see my Spacechem review.I still think Spacechem is the best puzzle game ever made. I haven't played enough of this to decide if this ursurps the puzzle game throne, but it looks like a good possibility so far.These games are hard to describe and intimidating to watch without having played (especially Spacechem since its just a bunch of weird lines and symbols). The best way I can think to describe it is, think of programming a loop or a method. You know what the inputs and outputs need to be and you know a few other functions/methods that you can use to take the inputs and make the outputs. These games are all about designing a repeatable process that won't fail under a heavy load.Besides the 3D, one of the main differentiators Infinifactory has is a humorous storyline that follows the ""Show, don't tell"" school of writing. I remember Spacechem being pretty wordy and not funny, but Infinifactory is the opposite!Buy Infinifactory....or Spacechem.UPDATE: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the difficulty escalates pretty quickly.			"

												I'm really not a big fan of puzzle games. But I can't deny the complexity and variety that Infinifactory offers. And best of all: It is fun and entertaining to experiment.But one criticism I have to mention: The game lacks guidance. Often enough there is a complete new approach or twist required to solve a task. Complete freedom is a disadvantage if it results in endless ways to fail.Don't let that stop you though, it's still a 9/10.			"

Early Access Review
								A fantastic puzzle game. It's rock solid stable, looks good and has lots of content as well as an interesting storyline. If you liked SpaceChem then you'll love Infinifactory.As others have said It's basically SpaceChem in 3D, concepts of reactors and piping are more or less combined, with conveyers taking the place of the latter, and the entire level being the reactor. The same concept of optimising cycles (time), number of components used and now overall footprint of components is present. Finding a solution, and then tweaking to optimise is a dream come true for us OCD types out there! The game will rank your solution for a given challenge against the population playing the game, so that you can see where you score. It's difficult, and sometimes impossible to rank highly in each area. Decreasing cycle time will increase block count for example. Improving one of the three scores will usually come at the cost of one or both of the others.Zachtronics stands out for me as a real leader in modern puzzle games. Great challenge, lots of replayability, user created content and a sandbox mode! For those that like their puzzle games, I can't reccomend it enough.			"

								Not since Portal and Portal 2 has a puzzle game gotten me hooked like Infinifactory has.  I stumbled upon this game after researching the origin of Minecraft, and discovered Zach's work.  This game really feels like if Minecraft and Portal had a baby.  It's such a simple, elegant game mechanic and if you enjoy building and you enjoy solving puzzles, this game is simply not to be missed.  He's adding content all the time, and to top if off, if your game crashes or you have any kind of bug report, it goes directly to the man himself, and so far in my experience he responds and releases a fix the same day (no pressure, Zach).  Well worth your money!!!			"

								SpaceChem in 3D would be a fair description of Infinifactory. Infinifactory is a first person block placer along the lines of Minecraft, or any Minecraft clone really. The draw of the game is really in the puzzles. They're as close to an ideal problem as you can get. A well defined objective, with well defined constraints, and huge latitude to execute a solution. Playing through so far, I've found the game to be much easier than SpaceChem was at a similar stage, though it may well be me being more familiar with the genre.The game does have some early access problems, like unclimbable staircases and the inability to look around while walking, which are annoying, but the core gameplay is still highly entertaining.

								It's a great puzzle game, with elements akin to minecraft and factorio in that you automate a production line to meet the demands at the outputs. A lot of sequencing and thinking required to get the best efficiency per block used. Feels pretty polished and the difficulty increases as you progress. You can also revisit past puzzles to try and make them more efficient or beat your friends in the two categories by making a superior 'factory.' Great little game that should give anyone's brain a tease.			"

								Well, hard not to reccomend a game that you 'start for a while' at 10 PM and you ask yourself 'what the ...' at 5 AM next morning... especially if you're supposed to go to work at 9.  Core concepts are easy to understand, core puzzles are for now slightly too easy, especially the later levels, but given it's early access I am certain puzzles will be adapted in overal.Then again - these puzzles are not strictly based on 'how to solve a predetermined sequence' as it is in many puzzles, it is problem solving game - where your choices are meaningful, and countless methods are viable in every puzzle. That is where Infinifactory, as earlier - spacechem excels - it is not the true challenge to make it work; it is a true challenge to make it work fast, or in small factory.All things considered - I had some doubts initially about the price, for early access, but now I am quite sure it's a steal, especially knowing how other game of this developer expanded over the months after initial release. And key thing is - it's not released yet.			"

The 3rd dimension introduces new options and optimizations without adding too much complexity.If you enjoy any ofSpaceChemesoteric programminghardcore puzzlesfactoriesengineeringoptimizationcreating better systems than othersblowing your own mindand you're ready for the challenge, Infinifactory is a unique game you do want to play.

								This game lets you feel really great when you solve really complex puzzles. Even though there's not that many maps in the game, I've managed to spend 18 hours before I completed the game. For the small amount of money you pay, that is a lot of game for buck ratio.And if you get stuck or can't solve a puzzle, hundreds of people on youtube have a solution ready, and you will certainly learn something from their build style as well.The only down side I can think of is that falling blocks move in the same speed as a block on a belt. This creates some irritating desyncs in the factories you create.The game can also be played how you want. Make the most efficient and smallest amount of cycles as possible, or make the fastest factory with less material. After each map completed, two graphs are shown with how you compete against other peoples' solution.The developers of this game is also the developer of Infiniminer, one of the games that inspired Notch to create Minecraft.Apart from being an addictive and satisfiying game, the game engine is Unity. Ever since Kerbal Space Program released, I've never really had good performance in Unity with my computer. I'm not going to blame the developers, but I wish they could fix the small fps drop everytime I stop the preview of the factory.			"

								Highly recommended.I've found this much more accessible than SpaceChem, but still extremely satisfying and challenging. I liked the idea of SpaceChem but didn't play it much in the end as aspects of it seemed unintuitive to me. (I meant to go back to it, and figured I just needed to learn how to play it, but never did.) Not so here. Everything is clear from the start and I was instantly hooked.This is one of those puzzle games that gets inside your head and makes you start interpreting other things you look at as if they were in the game. Like how Tetris makes people dream about blocks, or instinctively work out how to slot everything they see in the real world together, just in case, because part of your brain has started doing that automatically.I am not usually a fan of Early Access but it's fine in this case. I can see there are some slight UI improvements that might be added to the final version (already being discussed by the devs) but that's about all you might gain by waiting. I usually dislike EA because I only want to play most games once, so I'd rather play them in their best form, but with this game you're solving puzzles which are so open-ended and free-form that you can solve them again another day in a completely new way, using new techniques you've learned and pieces you've unlocked, and still have a blast. And the game is already in a very good state. So this is a rare case where I can recommend an Early Access game.Infinifactory doesn't suffer from the problem of some ""build a thing to solve a puzzle"" games where the solution is either so simple or so restricted that you are not really having to think, only to work out what the designer wanted you to put where (except one or two levels which are obviously tutorials on new pieces, which are understandable a bit like that, but even then encourage experimenting). It's very open and you're generally given a large 3D canvas in which to invent methods of solving things. You can go for elegance, simplicity, or audacious complexity. Whatever you choose often turns out a lot more complex than you thought, which is part of the fun.Price wise, it seemed a bit high at first for what I thought might be a simple puzzle game. Having played it and become hooked, and seen the depth and replayability it has this has, the price is well worth it. I have spent literally hours on some puzzles, and even once they are finished the desire to improve the solution or just experiment remains. You will more than get your money's worth with this game.Congratulations to the devs, you knocked it out of the park and created a classic. In a world where ""puzzle game"" has started to mean ""match three in a generic grid of gems"", a game like Infinifactory is refreshing and inspiring.			"

Early Access Review
								I suppose that one should say that this is 3D SpaceChem, and that you should get it if you liked SpaceChem.  I suppose, to some degree, that is true:  Those who loved SpaceChem will most likely enjoy this game, but I think it is important to make it known as distinct from SpaceChem.  So, with that, I'd suggest going to the next review if you want actual reasons on why to get this game, since I'll just discuss the mechanical similarities and differences between Infinifactory and SpaceChem.SpaceChem was a game of constraint - given one more Waldo, more bonding, or grid space, and every level becomes easy.  I imagine most people knew how to beat each level in SpaceChem, but they couldn't manage to fit in their solution to the allotted space, since symbols can't be placed on the same spot, or an avenue couldn't be found to move the molecule through.  SpaceChem was also precise - you told each molecule when they could come in, and you did what you wanted to them (except for randomized inputs, but the idea holds - you planned for accounting for inputs) before sending them off to the next reactor. You had Syncs and slightly more involved ways to make things happen when you wanted them.  The key to solving a SpaceChem puzzle was generating something manageable - once you had that, you had the level.Infinifactory is still an open-ended puzzle game.  Your solution was the one that came to your head, not the single reduced possiblity that could win you the level.  You'll still have different solutions from your friends, but the breed of how this is accomplished is different.  You see, in Infinifactory, inputs come out at fixed intervals, and while you can modify that interval, the fact of the matter is that you can't do things when you want to, you must react to this constant push of inputs, or else one input will mess up the one that came before.  Indeed, that is the fundamental difference between SpaceChem and Infinifactory:  In Infinifactory, you deal in reacting to incoming blocks, with a fair ability to do anything, while in SpaceChem you plan on how to use your scarce resources to achieve the result.  It's a subtle difference, to be certain, but I think it is rather necessary.  I guess people will be thoroughly enticed by ""It's 3D SpaceChem"", but I'm not seeing any Waldos in space!			"

								Being a student of computer science, I really enjoy puzzle/problem solving. That is why I really enjoy games that really come down to actually solving puzzles, and it should not be a surprise that the company that brought us spacechem (and earlier: kohctpytop, the codex of alchemical engineering (I and II), manufactoid, ruckingenur (I and II), the bureau of steam engineering and more) have once again produced a puzzle game.While this game admittedly is easier than Spacechem, its seems to be focussed more at optimising your factories as opposed to simply building factories to solve the puzzles, as the later levels in spacechem often came down to.Clearly I would recommend this game, but not only to people like me that like to optimize and take shots at the ever-growing collection of levels in the steam workshop, but also to the people that have never touched a 'game for engineers' puzzle game in their lives; as these puzzle games with open solutions are often a good way to train the brain.Finally, I would like to take the last paragraph of this review to recommend some other good puzzlers to people that enjoy infinifactory: spacechem (of course) (as it is slightly harder and made by the same, brilliant company); manufactoria (found online for free) (a game with completely different mechanics, but still a game for engineers); and fez (while not an open-solution puzzler, it is still a puzzle platformer with unique mechanics and some pretty good brain-crackers)			"

												TL;DR: Not as good as SpaceChem, but still a fairly good puzzle game.Mainly my problem with Infinifactory is that most of the puzzles just seem too straightforward.  In SpaceChem you had to worry about running out of room to place down instructions, and making sure the waldos could loop properly.  In Infinifactory you just have to make sure things get done reliably and the parts don't get in the way of eachother.  You won't even have a problem with the latter issue in most puzzles unless you increase the speed.  Most puzzles are not complicated enough to even have to think hard about how to get things done.The plot is alright, but it likewise seems a bit too straightforward.  In SpaceChem you had huge plot twists, escalation, and the feeling of being some kind of secret super-chemist fighting against an unknowable foe.  In Infinifactory, it just feels like you're doing your job.			"

								Mechanically a 3D Spacechem and while there are ups and downs to that, it is easily a worthwhile game. Has plenty enough content and difficulty for people who haven´t completed Spacechem and is well balanced for people coming into the production-puzzle genre thing, but at least for now pales in comparison to Spacechem in variety and amount of puzzles at the hard end of things. The game for now ends aprubtly and seemingly in the middle of the story but I imagine the promised to-be-added-during-EA content will fix these problems.All and all the mechanics are there and I am intently waiting for more. :)			"

Early Access Review
								I was skeptical when I heard about this game, but Zachtronics has absolutely been able to replicate the success of Spacechem with Infinifactory. It's very well polished in its present state (It looks like the game is practically done and is just using early access as a means of human testing), though you might still get a slightly smoother experience if you wait until the full release. Really, if you've played Spacechem your experience with this game will probably be exactly like your experience with that. The only negative that I have is that some of the specifics of the game mechanics make certain tasks harder than they should be. Rotating single blocks, or welding things vertically, for example, are a lot less intuitive with the current mechanics than rotating large pieces or welding things horizontally. That might be one of the things that gets smoothed out in the future.			"

								I have been a big fan of Zactronics puzzle games from the start. SpaceChem ia one of THE most thought-provoking games I have ever played and now comes InfiniFactory....This is another absolutely amazing game which I have seen described as ""SpaceChem 3D""...this is true, up to a point, but trust me when I say that you will not regret getting this game.Simple Ideas well executed...a joy to play!!!

								This game has broken my brain in multiple ways, and then made me feel like a genius when I finally beat the level, or at least get close to solving it. Constantly challenging, the curve in this game is very solid. Whenever a new block is introduced it gives you a rather simple puzzle in order to learn how it works, and then in the next level you want to scream at the game because that new block is making this already puzzling game even more puzzling.Pros: - Amazing puzzle game. Open-ended solutions allow you to brag to your friends that your solutions are faster then theirs'. - Fitting and varied graphics. Every major ""section"" has a different planet design, and they always look great. Amazing skybox/background images and looming ships watching you really fits with the 'story.' - Story. Speaking of the story, there is one. I haven't finished the game so I don't know what kind of ending there is (or if there is one) but various elements in the levels (which are totally optional as to whether you investigate them or not) reveal how you got to where you are. - Almost a full fledged game already. Even though this game is in Early Access, it is basically a full game. Even if it was released this moment, I would not regret buying it.Cons: - No graphical settings. This will hopefully change since the game is still only in Early Access, but this is big for me since my computer isn't that amazing, and the game feels sluggish for me because of the various effects that are rendered (completely playable, I just feel like I'm snail in neck brace). - Some of the puzzles can be a good bit more difficult than others in that same section, but since you don't have to complete every single level to progress to the next section (in the first few sections you can do all but one to progress) and since the Early Access features a mandatory feedback system on how difficult and fun the puzzle was, I am sure any overly difficult levels will be reworked as the game improves.Overall, this is a gem. Who knew building factories on alien planets could be so fun, even if it makes your brain melt.My score for Infinifactory as a Factory building and Puzzle solving game - 9/10Oh, and I can't leave out the best part...My score for Infinifactory as a Food Pellet eating and Memorabilia collecting simulator - 11/10			"

								First Impressions:Loved the intro, very humorous.  I can only hope that the rest of the game develops on the story and finds ways for you to deal with your unfortunate predicament (like the ""Portal"" series did).  The puzzles start out easy (thankfully) but are still incredibly enjoyable.  It's similar to ""SpaceChem"" (same developers), but there's a bit more here from a physical standpoint in that you can actually walk around your environment and interact with it a la ""Minecraft"" (placing/removing blocks).  I'm really enjoying this so far and the quality is top notch for an Early Access game.  Easy recommend for puzzle lovers who like a challenge!

								Excellent puzzlegame. Solving the puzzle, sure anyone can do that. But the magic really happens when you need to complete  your objective as fast as possible with least amount of resources used. Comparing your completed puzzles to see how you fare against others is also pretty awesome. One objective but with nearly an infinite amount of ways to achieve that objective.I just beat it and now I want more.Excellent game to play while lighting one up.			"

												Infinifactory is the kind of game that only a certain type of people will enjoy. I can say that I fall under that category, and I thought it was fantastic. Due to its logical nature, Infinifactory is a game geared toward the same kind of people that enjoy programming; while playing, you'll likely find yourself using a lot of the same practices you might use when coding, such as building machines in ""sections"", optimizing, and debugging. It's also a great way to know if coding is something you'd enjoy or not; if you don't like this game you probably shouldn't try programming either. The game has plenty of content, and as an added bonus, if you have friends who play the game you can compete to see who can build the smallest and/or most efficient machine (which really adds some good replay value).Besides the fantastic and unique gameplay, the game has some pretty solid graphics and good, relaxing music. However, there's one thing about this game I find questionable, and that's the story. You've basically been ""captured"" by ""alien overlords"" who are forcing you to create these machines for them. Any story that uses those terms is very clearly cliché and uninteresting. Of course, no one is going to play this game for the story, but I think the game would be a lot more polished if the story were to be completely overhauled or even removed entirely (I do in fact like the space setting of the game worlds, and I think the game would work out just fine without any story whatsoever).Don't let the stuff I said about the story turn you away from playing Infinifactory – it's still an amazing game, and I highly recommend it if you think you're up for the challenge (especially if you enjoy or are looking into programming).

								This may be in early access, but it is one of the most interesting pure puzzle games I have played. The basic mechanics are extremely intuitive, with hidden depth in how you use them, creating an enjoyable and engaging learning curve, where the process of learning and experimentation is one of the major aspects of the enjoyment from this game. Each puzzle presents a unique aproach building on what you have learned in previous puzzles and every puzzle has an almost infinite number of solutions, ranging from smartly designed and effiecient, to extremely hacky and conditional, but what's great is that both of these ideas are valid solutions. This game surpasses the already great Spacechem in almost every way and comes highly reccomended despite the fact that is in early access.			"

								Oh my god! They did it again!I mean, literally. Infinifactory is just another SpaceChem.So why would you pay for it once again? (If you gifted SpaceChem to all your friends, relatives, acquaintances and hated enemies, aside from having bought it for yourself on every platform imaginable, you may skip the following. In fact, just buy the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game already.)Well, aside from ""new levels from SpaceChem"" being an altogether good thing in my view, there are a few *minor*, almost inconsequential differences from SpaceChem.For one thing, Infinifactory is 3D. And I don't mean it like ""OMG, they render everything in glo-o-orious 3D"" -- no, it's the puzzles that are genuinely three-dimensional, which adds a completely new layer of complexity to the game.For another, the game features an entirely new story, of which I've seen but a little so far, but which I already like a lot.The rest of it is just good old SpaceChem -- with emphasis on ""good"", because it seems that Zachtronics kept all the good parts, from free-form puzzles admitting zillions of different solutions (which doesn't mean finding a solution is easy -- OH GOD, NO!) to subtly soul-destroying difficulty curve, and from zany sense of humor to online histograms readily showing you just how much does you cherished soltuion suck compared to true masters.No, wait, they did drop one good thing -- you can no longer automatically upload videos of your solutions to YouTube. But since the game is in Early Access, there's still time to fix that.I should probably mention that I had some reservations before buying the game, and that, in particular, I was worried whether the first-person perspective would turn out to be a huge annoyance. I'm happy to report that it's not -- your in-game avatar is equipped with a blatanly unrealistic jetpack, which allows you to roam around the puzzle about as freely as a free cam would. I do think that controlling the jetpack through mouse wheel would make the experience even more smooth, and I'm not sure there's any point to ""dying"" -- momentarily -- when you fall off a cliff ohdamnforgottoturnthejetpackon, but all of that doesn't really add up to a genuine ""annoyance"", and may be fixed in the future.Lastly, if you tried SpaceChem and *didn't* like it, I think it's a sure sign you're not gonna like Infinifactory either. The two games really are very similar to each.			"

								Extremely good game. It has a ""3D Spacechem"" feel to it, but it's still considerably different. I feel that this game is either slightly easier, or more engaging (probably this) than Spacechem. Something about being able to walk around your factories, watching how stuff gets transported, rotated, and welded makes it very engaging.The campaign is surprisingly long and varied. Lots of different tactics go into play. Whenever I thought ""oh, I'll just solve this the same way I solved that other puzzle"", I ran into a unique challange.The production value seems pretty high. Every block, scene, background, cutscene, and sound has a lot of polish to it. The background story gives the game a pretty amazing feel to it. There's a lot of flavor to the game, from the cutscenes between puzzles, easter eggs that can be found on each puzzle scene, and even the products that your factories are supposed to make fit into the general lore of the game.10/10, you can't go wrong with it.

								Scratches the same puzzle itch as spacechem, but slightly differently. The main difference is that Infinifactory is a bit more straight forward, the puzzle solution does not need to effectively ""reset"" after each completed item becasue there is no waldo equivalent. This means there is less need for cicular thinking, making the game arguably easier overall. The only criticism I have is that it would be nice if there were different speeds available instead of just ""fast forward."" Sometimes it would be helpful to be able to bring the entire operation to a crawl to watch the action in slow motion. But then, of course, this is still in early access, so that may be comeing yet.

								If you like puzzle games (and who doesn't, really?), you'll like Infinifactory.  There isn't really that much of a story here per se, but the puzzles are challenging (after a gradual ramp-up, then a steep jump after you've gotten the basics), and the concepts in the game are unique.  I really enjoy playing, and I would recommend everyone at least try this out.  I'm sure it will only get better before it leaves Early Access status and is released Gold, but frankly, the core mechanics are solid in this game.I have found that some puzzles were rather challenging later in the game, but I prefer my puzzle games to challenge me to think creatively instead of being a snore fest.  I really liked the Portal series as well, but those puzzles were WAY too easy and linear.  This game requires you to think ahead, and can be especially challenging if you are trying to find an optimal solution in terms of cycle count and foot print.  There were quite a few that I completed thinking ""Wow, I think I have this just about perfect"" only to find that many people found MUCH better solutions! It makes me feel like I have much to learn, and at the same time enjoy the learning experience.10/10, would buy again.			"

												Real puzzle games, and I don't mean cheap match-3-tiles or the weird dream logic of point-and-click-adventure-games, are rare. Zachtronics continues to be the leading, if not only, producer of fantastic, fun, and brain warping puzzle games.Sadly I must admit that I delayed buying this because I was scared off by the reviews calling it too difficult. Spacechem broke me and the thought that Infinifactory was harder put me right off. After getting this game from a bundle recently I was pleasantly surprised to find it completely accessible. People call it hard but it's not at all, every puzzle in the game can be easily brute forced to solve. If the abstraction of Spacechem scared you away I would definitely recommend this.The real challenge, and fun, comes from trying to be as efficient as possible. Build a factory that works then go over it cutting out the fat and speeding it up. Or maybe try building a vertical compact factory, it might be slower but you'll have a much smaller footprint. Each level conviently gives you a chart that compares your results to the global stats. One factory I built is an order of magnitude faster than the global average which made my day! It also gives you a list of your friends who play the game showing you how your factories match up to theirs.Alternatively it can also be fun to build a factory as obtuse and whacky as possible. Why weld things the boring way on the ground when you can toss them in the air and weld them as they fall? My favorite is to move all of the single blocks as close to the output field as I can and weld everything at once before it gets picked up. Did you know that you can build your factory to look like dickbutt?! You can and should.			"

Solve the level with the most half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hacked together contraption that barely works or create a beutiful simphony of machines working in perfectly timed unison.

												I'm just going to say this now,This is one of the best, I repeat BEST puzzle games I have ever played.Although it is a fairly difficult game, every single time you complete a puzzle the game gives you a reason to keep playing (new parts, new levels, and challenging yourself to have complete mastery of the given challenge.) And the feeling you get whenever you finish the puzzle is complete and utter satisfaction. Puzzle games aren't for everyone, but if you have a bunch of free time, I'd suggest this one. Infinifactory has been one of the best uses of my money and I think that if you buy it, it will be the same way for you.Oh, and don't let me forget the soundtrack. The soundtrack from this game must be one of my favorites from all the games I have ever played. It goes perfectly with the tone of each puzzle as the story unfolds.I'd recommend this game, let’s leave it at that!			"

												This game is fantastic and it has both enough content and variety to justify the price.Now that the summary is out of the way let me talk about the difficulty of the puzzles because that's really not so easy to summarize. Basically a great deal of the early puzzles can usually be solved by using the same solutions over and over with a few tweeks each time. But unlike other puzzle games where the point is just to solve the puzzle and how you do it isn't very important, Infinifactory asks you to get creative with your solutions. You are judged on how quick, efficient, or costly (number of parts used) your solution is and how difficult each puzzle is or much fun and enjoyment you get out of the game (especially the earlier levels) is based on how much you try to optimize your solutions. You can never optimize all three categories and the game doesn't expect you to since the categories aren't comparable. Is making the solution take 20 cycles longer worth reducing the power cost by 5? Who knows and who cares. You choose one category and try to max it. You'll also find that solving for one category asks you to solve completely different problems than solving for another so you can try switching it up if you ever feel like your solutions are getting stale. But more importantly is that when you try to maximize for something the specifics and layout of each level become much more relevant to your solutions. This change can the solution for each level drastically and will require that you do something different each time.There is also a fourth category you can optimize and it's creativity. The game doesn't judge you on it but chances are if you're interested in Infinifactory you probably like the idea of building contraptions. Many times during a puzzle I would think to myself, ""I wonder if I can do this"" or ""Would that even work"" and I'd end up ignoring the categories and just building something that looked cool or was super intricate. With completely open ended puzzles and millions of correct solutions the game always lets you build the solution that you want to.			"

												One of the best puzzle games i've ever played. If not the best. You get some resources, some machine parts and a delivery portal. Your goal is to create a machine that assembles the resources and deliver the resulting object to the portal.Easy at first, it becomes more and more difficult but without getting unfair.Each puzzle is evaluated by 3 different scores:- Footprint: space usage of the solution- Blocks: the cost of the solution- Cycles: the speed of the solutionWhen you solved a puzzle, the resulting score is compared with the scores from other players solutions. I really like this feature. It keeps me motivated to try solved puzzles again just to figure out a new solution that optimizes in footprint, blocks or cycles.			"

								Like SpaceChem, every level in Infiniactory leaves you feeling like an all powerful being who can make and produce anything... Then the next level involves almost the exact same thing but turns out to require a totally different solution and you have to go back to the drawing board and start building a new thingamajigger. And after you finish it and fix all the ""bugs"", your magical spinning pushing pulsing factory of doom starts purring. It's mesmerising to watch.It's not (yet) as hard as SpaceChem, I suspect because there's a lot more open space to work in, or perhaps because some of the ""tricks"" for optimizing in SpaceChem work fairly well here too. (or I got smarter :D?) That said there's plenty of new ideas here - you can tell it's related, but it's also a whole new bag of tricks, surrounded by the great infrastructure of histograms and ""hacks"".I recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles or making stuff or tinkering about, though I warn you, you might start dreaming of conveyor belts and wondering why your food doesn't slide out the fridge and cook itself when you open the fridge door.

												The best engineering game I ever saw. It's not 'sandbox for children'. It is hardcore engineering in it pure manifestation. There is only best practices, premature optimization, refactoring, space/time tradeoffs. As system administrator, devops and (bit) a programmer I really understand that game. It is a real life. My daily work. All those crazy hacks that allows to finish project regardless of the 'grand design failed’. It's striking me to the depth of my soul - because in this game there are no excuses (if only you give me five more people to the team and five years I will finish this project!). There is only task and you own engineer. And you are against the task.<s>This CAD has nice UI</s> Game interface is brilliant. There are undo/redo functions, select-and-move for large set of the blocks, hotkeys and excellent 3D navigation.Story is intriguing but weak. Portal has way better storytelling. But it is just a decoration for the main part - to build and run complex <s>cluster of server applications</s> machine.			"

								Not since Portal and Portal 2 has a puzzle game gotten me hooked like Infinifactory has.  I stumbled upon this game after researching the origin of Minecraft, and discovered Zach's work.  This game really feels like if Minecraft and Portal had a baby.  It's such a simple, elegant game mechanic and if you enjoy building and you enjoy solving puzzles, this game is simply not to be missed.  He's adding content all the time, and to top if off, if your game crashes or you have any kind of bug report, it goes directly to the man himself, and so far in my experience he responds and releases a fix the same day (no pressure, Zach).  Well worth your money!!!			"

								Another great game from Zachtronics.If you're a fan of puzzle games, and have played other games from Zachtronics (such as SpaceChem or The Codex of Alchemical Engineering), then you're definitely going to enjoy Infinifactory.As customary for Zachtronics games, it's a very challenging puzzler, though I feel the difficulty is much more balanced than in previous games like SpaceChem, for example.The game mechanics are solid, the puzzles are very well designed and the challenge increases at a steady, but fair pace.It also features a nice little story, but with some pretty decent voice acting, and quite a few funny moments.And, just like in SpaceChem, there's no feeling quite like the one of solving a very hard puzzle after an hour or two struggling with it. It's just a testament to how well designed the game and puzzles are, that you can spend more than an hour on a single puzzle (the hardest ones), without feeling frustrated.Given, it's still a very hardcore puzzle game, which is really not for everyone.But if you're a fan of hard puzzles, like thinking, and want something to challenge your mind, you definitely wanna buy Infinifactory. You're not gonna regret it.			"

								Think SpaceChem's puzzles mixed with Minecraft's Redstone.There are endless ways to solve the puzzles, and this game doesn't hold your hand.  Which is terrific because that also means it never gets in your way.  You truly can piece together a solution to a puzzle however you see fit.  If your friends play Infinifactory too, you will find endless surprises as you compare your factories and marvel at how completely differently each of you went about a particular puzzle.  The feeling of finishing a puzzle that you’ve been working on for over an hour, and finally getting to sit back and watch it go, is euphoric.  You really feel like you created a factory.  Taking into account the game’s beautiful art style, fun mood music, ingenious gameplay, and an overall perfect execution of an incredible concept; Infinifactory is what I call a perfect game! 10/10 "

												I’ll start the review this way: Infinifactory is up to now (Dec 2015) my favourite game all times. So this review might be a bit biased, but I’ll try to be as objective as I can.Ok, first off: what is Infinifactory?In Infinifactory, you build a factory out of blocks around input blocks, which you combine, wield and modify in order to obtain the output block (or structure) that you have to move to the output pad. This description doesn’t give justice to the game, I think other Steam reviews are way better at explaining the core of the game, but I’ll expand on more detailed elements of the game.Infinifactory is better described as a puzzle game, because of the way the game is structured: you have a problem, and you have to provide a solution to it. But it is a puzzle game in a way you have never seen before (at least if you didn’t play another Zachtronic game, such as SpaceChem or TIS-100). In the sense that you don’t have a unique, inelastic solution that you have to figure out by trial and error or logic: you build your factory from the ground up, with as much (if not more) freedom as if you were playing Minecraft, but with only functional blocks. This is why I love this game so much: each puzzle have literally a near infinite ways to be solved, and each solutions has its flaws and advantages. You can strive for the most elegant factory, or maybe you want something compact and minimize the footprint count, possibly, you can go for optimisation, or you just want to get done with the puzzle and unlock the next one. Each one of those building style will lead to drastically different factories and unique dynamic problems and challenges that you create for yourself, because you are masochistic and want to be higher ranked on the leaderboard.Many people compare this game to programming, because the way problems happens and how you solve them is comparable to programming. As you progress into the game, you’ll have to remember technics that you learned on easier puzzles and use them in combination with other new technics, or adapt them to the new terrain and the new parts you are presented with.When you build a factory, you can test it with the “play” button and easily figure out where your factory goes wrong (if it goes wrong, which it will, unless you are the incarnation of God on earth) because the game mechanics are based on 3D space and very simple predictable physics. It leads to you being able to judge what happens in the factory and build it based on your visual representation of what could happen.Ok, now I won’t talk too much about the rest of the game, because the puzzles are where the meat and body of the game lies. In terms of graphics, it is good enough to be pleasing to the eye. In terms of story, it is good enough and minimalistic enough to not be distracting, and the music is soothing. All of that is the perfect storm to build a calm atmosphere which let you focus on the puzzles and building your factory 100% without losing your mind or being annoyed at all. Which is probably what puts this game over the top for me.There is Workshop support: that means you can download custom puzzles made by other people and solve them in your way. There is some really good ones, and it would be a shame to miss on them. You can also build your own maps with the in-game map editor. This one is basically a Minecraft on steroid, since the game style is voxel based, so it is easy enough, once you get how to reach your favourite blocks, to build your own puzzles.So why is this game so little popular? My guess is on the price tag: it seems a lot for an “indie” game, and people just don’t buy it. But look at my playtime, I have played Infinifactory for about 67 hours. The game is ridiculously great and has a lot of content, without for the least being repetitive or padded. There is about ten minutes of cutscence grand total, which means 99% of your playtime will be enjoying the game, and that’s without counting when you are thinking of the game not logged in, because you just thought of that cool new way of solving a puzzle in the bus or at work.So here you have it, let yourself be convinced by this review, say goodbye to your 25 bucks and say hello to 60 hours of untold fun!

												tl;dr - great game that will keep you awake and keep you interested. 10/10Fantastic Puzzle Game.  You'll want to beat your friends' scores. You'll want to go back to each puzzle after a while to optimise and streamline.  The game rewards creativity and logic as well as just fudging solutions and some happy accidents.  The production lines themselves are simple to build (especially if you're used to minecraft) and the interface is really easy to use.The story is great as well (no spoilers), and speaking of spoilers, I haven't gone searching the internet for solutions or tricks as that would kind of spoil the fun.The only annoyance is I keep hitting the 'stop' button instead of pausing, and troubleshooting/bug hunting can be a little long winded if you're factory is almost finished.  Fortunately, you can speed up time or pause whenever you want.			"

												Wow, this game blew my mind! It is in a way like Minecraft. And i mean not because it is block based but much more because its built around a genius idea and delivers this incredibly fun and immersive game experience. It was a boring summer morning when i decided to give this game a shot. I'd just refund it if it was bad, right? Well after two days i already had 32 (out of 48) hours of gameplay (when i ate dinner i left it on so it might ""only"" have been 30 hours)! That leaves 18 hours. Minus 14 for sleeping (7 hours a night) and we have 4 hours for 6 meals. You could say i had a blast playing this game...+ Superb game idea+ Unbelievably satisfying to solve a puzzle and watch your factory working so perfectly (seriously this is a huge plus. every gamer will get a boner from watching this)+ Creating your own level is so abnormaly easy that it takes you about 3 minutes to create a level you can then solve yourself (and share in the steam workshop)+ the story makes it even more fun (not that the story would be good but it gives you a ""reason"" to build the factories and makes everything funnier)+ Everything elsethe only negative thing:- there are no upward welders (and generally the welding of large objects) (you'll understand when you've progressed a bit into the game). The problem is that you have this genius idea in your head that you want to build and then you realize that you have to rebuild everything just because you need upward facing welders.IS THIS GAME FOR YOU?Did you not hate Protal / Protal 2? If yes then you'll adore this game!If no then you'll buy it anyway because you can jut refund it if it sucks.			"

My only (minor) complaint is the dead workers you find from time to time that each have a recording you can listen to and hear their final words or whatever. The whole ""story"" mechanism seems like an after thought and it's uninteresting. They are not needed and you can safely play the game and just ignore them.

								If you like puzzle games (and who doesn't, really?), you'll like Infinifactory.  There isn't really that much of a story here per se, but the puzzles are challenging (after a gradual ramp-up, then a steep jump after you've gotten the basics), and the concepts in the game are unique.  I really enjoy playing, and I would recommend everyone at least try this out.  I'm sure it will only get better before it leaves Early Access status and is released Gold, but frankly, the core mechanics are solid in this game.I have found that some puzzles were rather challenging later in the game, but I prefer my puzzle games to challenge me to think creatively instead of being a snore fest.  I really liked the Portal series as well, but those puzzles were WAY too easy and linear.  This game requires you to think ahead, and can be especially challenging if you are trying to find an optimal solution in terms of cycle count and foot print.  There were quite a few that I completed thinking ""Wow, I think I have this just about perfect"" only to find that many people found MUCH better solutions! It makes me feel like I have much to learn, and at the same time enjoy the learning experience.10/10, would buy again.			"

								I found this game utterly absorbing.The introduction and tutorial are a little rough at this stage of the beta but once you get the hang of things its very rewarding to see your sprawling gravity defying assembly line spring into life and deliver a finished product to your evil alien overlords.The puzzles are challenging without being overly frustrating and as each stage consists of unlocking a half dozen problems at a time if you get stuck you can move to anouther puzzle and come back later rather than loose your patience. A simple but wonderfully effecive way to cut down on the keyboard punching.The game permits you to find your own effective designs and favoured ways of going about taks as more components are unlocked and you will feel like a mechanical genius each time you find a new way to use them.In short the game combines the free form building of mine crafts sandbox mode with challenging and intriguing puzzles of portal and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a building or puzzle game.

								This game lets you feel really great when you solve really complex puzzles. Even though there's not that many maps in the game, I've managed to spend 18 hours before I completed the game. For the small amount of money you pay, that is a lot of game for buck ratio.And if you get stuck or can't solve a puzzle, hundreds of people on youtube have a solution ready, and you will certainly learn something from their build style as well.The only down side I can think of is that falling blocks move in the same speed as a block on a belt. This creates some irritating desyncs in the factories you create.The game can also be played how you want. Make the most efficient and smallest amount of cycles as possible, or make the fastest factory with less material. After each map completed, two graphs are shown with how you compete against other peoples' solution.The developers of this game is also the developer of Infiniminer, one of the games that inspired Notch to create Minecraft.Apart from being an addictive and satisfiying game, the game engine is Unity. Ever since Kerbal Space Program released, I've never really had good performance in Unity with my computer. I'm not going to blame the developers, but I wish they could fix the small fps drop everytime I stop the preview of the factory.			"

Would Recommend, Very funReally fun and clever. Every problem has many solutions.I got this game because I watched someone I am subscribed to on Youtube play it. I decided to get it after he played the first 6 levels. I thought to myself ""Well the first 6 levels of the game are pretty much spoiled, that sucks"". However when I got into the game I found myself solving puzzles in completely different ways. Even though I had already seen them be solved. This just shows how many possibilities there are. The game also controls very nicely and the puzzles are not to hard, but at the same time not to easy. The solution is not immediately obvious and when you figure it out, you feel really smart.The variety of blocks you can use to solve puzzles really makes it a fun game.			"

Early Access Review
								I suppose that one should say that this is 3D SpaceChem, and that you should get it if you liked SpaceChem.  I suppose, to some degree, that is true:  Those who loved SpaceChem will most likely enjoy this game, but I think it is important to make it known as distinct from SpaceChem.  So, with that, I'd suggest going to the next review if you want actual reasons on why to get this game, since I'll just discuss the mechanical similarities and differences between Infinifactory and SpaceChem.SpaceChem was a game of constraint - given one more Waldo, more bonding, or grid space, and every level becomes easy.  I imagine most people knew how to beat each level in SpaceChem, but they couldn't manage to fit in their solution to the allotted space, since symbols can't be placed on the same spot, or an avenue couldn't be found to move the molecule through.  SpaceChem was also precise - you told each molecule when they could come in, and you did what you wanted to them (except for randomized inputs, but the idea holds - you planned for accounting for inputs) before sending them off to the next reactor. You had Syncs and slightly more involved ways to make things happen when you wanted them.  The key to solving a SpaceChem puzzle was generating something manageable - once you had that, you had the level.Infinifactory is still an open-ended puzzle game.  Your solution was the one that came to your head, not the single reduced possiblity that could win you the level.  You'll still have different solutions from your friends, but the breed of how this is accomplished is different.  You see, in Infinifactory, inputs come out at fixed intervals, and while you can modify that interval, the fact of the matter is that you can't do things when you want to, you must react to this constant push of inputs, or else one input will mess up the one that came before.  Indeed, that is the fundamental difference between SpaceChem and Infinifactory:  In Infinifactory, you deal in reacting to incoming blocks, with a fair ability to do anything, while in SpaceChem you plan on how to use your scarce resources to achieve the result.  It's a subtle difference, to be certain, but I think it is rather necessary.  I guess people will be thoroughly enticed by ""It's 3D SpaceChem"", but I'm not seeing any Waldos in space!			"

Early Access Review
								Being a student of computer science, I really enjoy puzzle/problem solving. That is why I really enjoy games that really come down to actually solving puzzles, and it should not be a surprise that the company that brought us spacechem (and earlier: kohctpytop, the codex of alchemical engineering (I and II), manufactoid, ruckingenur (I and II), the bureau of steam engineering and more) have once again produced a puzzle game.While this game admittedly is easier than Spacechem, its seems to be focussed more at optimising your factories as opposed to simply building factories to solve the puzzles, as the later levels in spacechem often came down to.Clearly I would recommend this game, but not only to people like me that like to optimize and take shots at the ever-growing collection of levels in the steam workshop, but also to the people that have never touched a 'game for engineers' puzzle game in their lives; as these puzzle games with open solutions are often a good way to train the brain.Finally, I would like to take the last paragraph of this review to recommend some other good puzzlers to people that enjoy infinifactory: spacechem (of course) (as it is slightly harder and made by the same, brilliant company); manufactoria (found online for free) (a game with completely different mechanics, but still a game for engineers); and fez (while not an open-solution puzzler, it is still a puzzle platformer with unique mechanics and some pretty good brain-crackers)			"

								Mechanically a 3D Spacechem and while there are ups and downs to that, it is easily a worthwhile game. Has plenty enough content and difficulty for people who haven´t completed Spacechem and is well balanced for people coming into the production-puzzle genre thing, but at least for now pales in comparison to Spacechem in variety and amount of puzzles at the hard end of things. The game for now ends aprubtly and seemingly in the middle of the story but I imagine the promised to-be-added-during-EA content will fix these problems.All and all the mechanics are there and I am intently waiting for more. :)			"

												I'm enjoying this game quite a bit.  The key skill in this game is visualizing and manipulating objects in 3d space, and arranging all the inputs in the assembly process in proper orientation and sequence to complete your project.  Some of your tools are conveyer belts, pushers, sensors, welders, rotators, elevators, and demolishers, and I know there are some more, but I'm only 31 hours in so there's a couple blank tools I haven't seen yet.  Up to this point I've eagerly approached each puzzle, and only really had a couple major setbacks that required complete rebuilds.  You are able to optimize on different vectors including speed, # of parts used, and something else that I can't recall presently ;-)Compared to Zachtronics game Spacechem (which I also enjoyed), I think the puzzles in this game play out in a bit more ""fun"" way than the puzzles in Spacechem.  In Spacechem I found myself staring at the screen trying to find a devise a solution for a long time - and then ""bang"" the moment of enlightenment would come.  Infinifactory is different in that its more a series of small steps that gradually lead you to completion, although you do have to plan holistically the entire way.  The third dimension also provides interesting flexibility in builds also.The levels are beginning to get a bit difficult for me - I've stalled out on one of the meat preperation levels (the one with the whale) - and this is the first one that I've been hesitant to go back to because the solution looks a bit messy to me so far, it's sortof difficult to see what's happening,  and I have to carefully plan out my cuts on paper to maximize yield.  It's the first level that I haven't been drawn back to so far, but I'll get back to it soon enough.Anyhow, yes I recommend this game.  It's one of the best puzzle games I've played.   My one suggestion is that I wish there was a straightforward way to insert a logical ""AND"" into the sensors to require multiple conditions to be true before an action is carried out.  That can be overcome vie less straightforward means usually dependent upon timing, but its seems in several places I was wishing I could insert an ""AND"" condition and not worry about it so much.Yes, I recommend this game.

												I stumbled on the game randomly on my monthly humble bundle, and when I saw the Zachtronics stamp on it I knew it was going to be good, and yeah i was not disapointed. It's essencialy Space Chem meets Minecraft. I'm not too far into the game and the puzzle are starting to get tough, the though process to solve each puzzle is really rewarding, thinking  how to build the differents bits of the target piece, making a quick proto, then integrating it in the chain,  synch with the other line, weld together and BAM!  level is done! No wait I'm sure I can tune a bit to save blocks, or footprint.And all of a sudden you have the breakthrough about that previous puzzle you solved in a wonky way, you want to go back to redo it with this new elegant chunk of production line that avoids that very long winded triple rotation and pushing module you were proud of but was, admit it, massively ineficient.The handling is A-OK, it works, does what it says on the tin but sometimes the ergonomy is not as good as it can be. The efforts for the story telling are nice, small ""easter eggs"" etc. As for most Zachtronics puzzle the difficulty increase quickly, so don't get scared once you finish the tutorial.I wish there was a way to capture in game video / sharing on social media, some pieces of machinery are just so satifying I wish I could show them around.

												One of the greatest puzzle games of the decade. Its brilliance and challenge is that there are a myriad solutions to any of its problems, which means that it is accessible to almost any player, and challenging for all. Like many gamers, I solve most puzzle games fairly quickly and thoughtlessly; this game had me scratching my head on the first level. I found that at the start of almost every level, the problem seemed really daunting, but once you start working on it, you realize that it's just another problem. The game also has great replay value because there is almost always a better way to arrange your factory. Put it down for a month, a year, and you'll probably have forgotten your own solutions to the puzzles. 8/10			"

Infinifactory has similar logic puzzles as SpaceChem but now in 3d and featuring minecraft like building blocks. If you like logic puzzles such as Spacechem then this is a must buy.			"

												Great game. Was a little concerned it would be too short to justify the price but I was proved wrong as the game progressed. I wish the puzzles were a little more challenging and complex with unlimited space they could have really been more interesting. Also the puzzles are for the most part not that difficult it would have been nice if they had upped the dificulty.			"

												Probably the best puzzle game i have ever played,it's really hard but fun at the same time.you really have the think good on how to solve the puzzle, there are multiple solutions to all puzzle's and the sollution is driven by your creativity.when you have finished the game you can redo it and it will still be fun, you can challenge yourself by making everything as small as possible and as efficient as possible and that is hard to do but really funoveral rating 9.5/10			"

												This game is an assembly line simulator, such as SpaceChem, but in 3D. The story is not as good and not as interesting like in SpaceChem, but the gameplay is much more complex and fun, so basically compensates this. There are a lot of puzzles, or missions in it and the basic walkthrough (without WorkShop puzzles) is 8 or 10 times longer than in any AAA game. I have 29 hours in it and I'm at around the half of the story (the missions are more and more complex, so I think it'll be around 70-80 hours 'till the end). There's a lot of WorkShop puzzles for the game. Also there are achievements for optimizations (certain amount of cycles or footprint), so you can run for those too. It is a must have game if you like to use your head!			"

												This is an amazing puzzle game. The building blocks you have are simple with no special tricks, yet you can build some very elegant yet complex solutions to each puzzle.Each puzzle gives you a rating comparing how you've done with everyone else who's done the puzzle too on a nice bell curve. The farther to the left on the curve you are, the better. There are three different metrics too (cycles aka time, blocks used, and footprint (how much horizontal space your blocks and the materials need to move to reach the goal). All of these metrics are only governed by what you've built, so you are free to try to improve your score, and often improving one score may come at the expense of another. However you have space for three different solutions to each puzzle so you can try multiple approaches to try to improve your best score in different areas.The game feels like programming/engineering where you need to test your creations at each step of the way to make sure that they are behaving as you expect as well. You can adjust some input parameters like how often materials are provided to you (and at various speeds different materials may come out at different rates, changing how you need to build your solution).If you liked Spacechem (by this same developer) you'll love this game!

The levels also get very difficult, but still make fun. I have spent 23+ hours and i even haven't completet the story.

												Another game from Zachtronics that I cannot recommend enough. Many people are calling it ""SpaceChem in 3d"" which is a fair description, but doesn't really capture the fun of finally guiding your blocks through twists and turns to get them synced up and in the right position at exactly the right time to have your construct output correctly.The overarching storyline is a bit minimal, but the real fun is in solving the puzzles in new ways. There's that sense of accomplishment when you see your machine completing the task, especially when your results compare favorably with the global statistics. There are audio logs from previous solvers scattered throughout the levels which add to the world, but are not needed to enjoy the game.As with SpaceChem, on occasion, I find some puzzles to be immediately obvious even at later levels, while others I sometimes have to think about for a while before a possible solution emerges. There are also some quirks of which control block takes precedence that you will have to work around and/or exploit to get the jobs finished.Community created puzzles are available in the Steam Workshop, but prepare to be challenged by them. The community seems to pride themselves on devious puzzle crafting. Overall, one of the most fun games I have played all year.My official game of the year for 2015!			"

Pros-  Very well designed puzzlesUnique conceptGreat graphics with low system requirementsDark Humor(pro for me, may be a con for others) Oddworld-esqueDecent V/OsEasy to understandBlocks are place-able from large distances. Cons-  Some logic is hard to understand, however it adds to the complexity of the puzzles making it more enjoyable.Price seems a little steep, I got it in Humble Monthly. From what I've played I'd say $15-$20 is a fair price, but if you enjoy puzzle games, you are impatient, and this looks good to you, $25 isn't unreasonable. Steam version has issues opening at random, DRM free version(from Humble Bundle) does not have this issue.  All in all, this is a wonderful game I can see myself sinking hours upon hours into. I recommend either waiting for a sale, or getting it on GOG since, oddly enough, Humble doesn't offer the DRM free version, even though that is where I got my DRM free+Steam copy from. "

												I really like the pacing and style of these puzzles. The easy early ones give you a chance to develop generalized techniques to apply to the later ones, as it should be in a good puzzle game. Unlike some games, the puzzles don't rely on ""gotchas"" that only the developer would think of (i.e., I've been able to solve all of them without spoilers so far).The levels tend naturally to break down into clearly divided sub-puzzles, so it's easy to jump in and start making progress. But you won't get bored, as there are frequent twists that can wreck your initial plans and make you consider a reset; sometimes the pieces don't fit together as you expected. When a new mechanic is introduced, expect to spend some time figuring out the nuances. Best of all, as you solve the sub-puzzles of a given level to your liking, your sub-solutions will play and re-play in the background as you continue working on the remaining pieces, which can be oddly satisfying. The score statistic histograms add some replay value for optimization.You can't die. Timing matters for machines but not player actions. Small mistakes are easily fixed for no penalty. The UI is nicely polished. There's a darkly comedic backstory that intrigues without getting in the way (warning, includes mentions of harm to animals). It's got very well thought out voxel editing tools (I never expected to see a usable drag and drop in 3D). It might be my ideal puzzle game, and it's making me want to try Infiniminer.			"

												Very addictive puzzler. There are many ways to solve each puzzle so you also have some replayability trying to optimize either for footprint (least pieces required) or speed (fastest factory output).

												I can already tell this is the kind of puzzle game you hate and love and can't stop playing. It doesn't force you to beat the puzzles with record breaking efficiency - so long as you complete it, that's fine. What gets to you is the knowledge that if you'd just tried a little harder, you COULD have built a better machine. So you go back, and retry, rebuild, refine. Over, and over. Your machines become much more complex, yet more simplistic as you chase the ever elusive Most Efficient Path.It's like Tetris; you can always make it that little bit neater, just those few blocks more efficient. If you rebuild that subsection 2 blocks to the left and link those push blocks with that sensor over there, you could even aaaand it's 2am.			"

												This game is awesome. Being kidnapped by aliens and forced to build automated factories for them has never been so much fun!It's challenging, but not in a frustrating way. Even when I fail I'm having fun looking at my contraptions going wild. Experimenting is the key, and that's what's making it so fun. Also, that there is not one, but endless possible solutions and it's up to you how much you want to optimize yours (once you have one working) before moving on to the next level.It's addictive. It definitely has this ""just one more level"" feeling to it.Some of the levels I did together with my 10 y/o son, and he liked it very much as well. (He helped me solve some tricky levels by providing some creative ideas).I bought the game on sale and when I started it up it didn't look like much in the begining, so I wasn't expected it's gonna be that good.

												One of the best puzzle games i've ever played. If not the best. You get some resources, some machine parts and a delivery portal. Your goal is to create a machine that assembles the resources and deliver the resulting object to the portal.Easy at first, it becomes more and more difficult but without getting unfair.Each puzzle is evaluated by 3 different scores:- Footprint: space usage of the solution- Blocks: the cost of the solution- Cycles: the speed of the solutionWhen you solved a puzzle, the resulting score is compared with the scores from other players solutions. I really like this feature. It keeps me motivated to try solved puzzles again just to figure out a new solution that optimizes in footprint, blocks or cycles.			"

												This game is fantastic and it has both enough content and variety to justify the price.Now that the summary is out of the way let me talk about the difficulty of the puzzles because that's really not so easy to summarize. Basically a great deal of the early puzzles can usually be solved by using the same solutions over and over with a few tweeks each time. But unlike other puzzle games where the point is just to solve the puzzle and how you do it isn't very important, Infinifactory asks you to get creative with your solutions. You are judged on how quick, efficient, or costly (number of parts used) your solution is and how difficult each puzzle is or much fun and enjoyment you get out of the game (especially the earlier levels) is based on how much you try to optimize your solutions. You can never optimize all three categories and the game doesn't expect you to since the categories aren't comparable. Is making the solution take 20 cycles longer worth reducing the power cost by 5? Who knows and who cares. You choose one category and try to max it. You'll also find that solving for one category asks you to solve completely different problems than solving for another so you can try switching it up if you ever feel like your solutions are getting stale. But more importantly is that when you try to maximize for something the specifics and layout of each level become much more relevant to your solutions. This change can the solution for each level drastically and will require that you do something different each time.There is also a fourth category you can optimize and it's creativity. The game doesn't judge you on it but chances are if you're interested in Infinifactory you probably like the idea of building contraptions. Many times during a puzzle I would think to myself, ""I wonder if I can do this"" or ""Would that even work"" and I'd end up ignoring the categories and just building something that looked cool or was super intricate. With completely open ended puzzles and millions of correct solutions the game always lets you build the solution that you want to.			"

												Infinifactory is, at it's core, a simple problem solving game. You must get blocks from point A to point B in a specific configuration. It's your job to figure out how to do that with the blocks given. Creating assembly lines that will move your pieces around and assemble them into the finished product. If you like puzzle games, and enjoy building things, then this is a game you would likely enjoy.  Construction is reminicent of minecraft and other sandbox block building games, with a lot of trial-&-error required to get to the solutions. Pros:   -Fun, unique, and clever. Well designed game   -Promotes thinking outside the box   -Easy to learn, hard to put down   -Steam Workshop, so you can pit your brain against other people's creationsCons:   -The ""campaign"" is a bit short and completed easily   -Often a single solution works for most puzzles with a littlte tweaking   -Puzzles weren't as challenging as I had hoped. Looking forward to playing with community content.Overall, I'd give the game an easy 8/10 for fun, unique, puzzle play.  If you like puzzle games and block building sandbox games, buy this. It's a great sort of fusion of the two.I hope to see further development of this game, adding more challening puzzles and other fun and silly rewards to decorate my little hole in the wall. Also, please add additional flavours of food pellets. A diverse and delicious meal breeds productivity!			"

												TL;DR: Not as good as SpaceChem, but still a fairly good puzzle game.Mainly my problem with Infinifactory is that most of the puzzles just seem too straightforward.  In SpaceChem you had to worry about running out of room to place down instructions, and making sure the waldos could loop properly.  In Infinifactory you just have to make sure things get done reliably and the parts don't get in the way of eachother.  You won't even have a problem with the latter issue in most puzzles unless you increase the speed.  Most puzzles are not complicated enough to even have to think hard about how to get things done.The plot is alright, but it likewise seems a bit too straightforward.  In SpaceChem you had huge plot twists, escalation, and the feeling of being some kind of secret super-chemist fighting against an unknowable foe.  In Infinifactory, it just feels like you're doing your job.			"

												Another game from Zachtronics that I cannot recommend enough. Many people are calling it ""SpaceChem in 3d"" which is a fair description, but doesn't really capture the fun of finally guiding your blocks through twists and turns to get them synced up and in the right position at exactly the right time to have your construct output correctly.The overarching storyline is a bit minimal, but the real fun is in solving the puzzles in new ways. There's that sense of accomplishment when you see your machine completing the task, especially when your results compare favorably with the global statistics. There are audio logs from previous solvers scattered throughout the levels which add to the world, but are not needed to enjoy the game.As with SpaceChem, on occasion, I find some puzzles to be immediately obvious even at later levels, while others I sometimes have to think about for a while before a possible solution emerges. There are also some quirks of which control block takes precedence that you will have to work around and/or exploit to get the jobs finished.Community created puzzles are available in the Steam Workshop, but prepare to be challenged by them. The community seems to pride themselves on devious puzzle crafting. Overall, one of the most fun games I have played all year.My official game of the year for 2015!			"

												This game is an assembly line simulator, such as SpaceChem, but in 3D. The story is not as good and not as interesting like in SpaceChem, but the gameplay is much more complex and fun, so basically compensates this. There are a lot of puzzles, or missions in it and the basic walkthrough (without WorkShop puzzles) is 8 or 10 times longer than in any AAA game. I have 29 hours in it and I'm at around the half of the story (the missions are more and more complex, so I think it'll be around 70-80 hours 'till the end). There's a lot of WorkShop puzzles for the game. Also there are achievements for optimizations (certain amount of cycles or footprint), so you can run for those too. It is a must have game if you like to use your head!			"

												I absolutely love this game. This game’s story is rather lackluster; but the game could have zero story and I will still love it. The puzzles are what draw you in. They are simply amazing. I have spent over 50 hours in just the last two weeks playing this game. Yet, I haven’t felt frustrated or stuck on a level. This is probably because you are given so much freedom to design your factory however you need to. I haven’t even gotten to the Steam Workshop puzzles yet and I’m already hooked. I highly recommend it.			"

I did not thought this game has even a story, but there is one, and it is very catchy:) Every level is different and brings new surprises and interesting content. The levels also get very difficult, but still make fun. I have spent 23+ hours and i even haven't completet the story. Pros:-good story-every level is completely different and a new challenge -good graphicsCons:-you may destroy things in rage when you get stuck in a puzzle "

								SpaceChem in 3D would be a fair description of Infinifactory. Infinifactory is a first person block placer along the lines of Minecraft, or any Minecraft clone really. The draw of the game is really in the puzzles. They're as close to an ideal problem as you can get. A well defined objective, with well defined constraints, and huge latitude to execute a solution. Playing through so far, I've found the game to be much easier than SpaceChem was at a similar stage, though it may well be me being more familiar with the genre.The game does have some early access problems, like unclimbable staircases and the inability to look around while walking, which are annoying, but the core gameplay is still highly entertaining.

								This game has broken my brain in multiple ways, and then made me feel like a genius when I finally beat the level, or at least get close to solving it. Constantly challenging, the curve in this game is very solid. Whenever a new block is introduced it gives you a rather simple puzzle in order to learn how it works, and then in the next level you want to scream at the game because that new block is making this already puzzling game even more puzzling.Pros: - Amazing puzzle game. Open-ended solutions allow you to brag to your friends that your solutions are faster then theirs'. - Fitting and varied graphics. Every major ""section"" has a different planet design, and they always look great. Amazing skybox/background images and looming ships watching you really fits with the 'story.' - Story. Speaking of the story, there is one. I haven't finished the game so I don't know what kind of ending there is (or if there is one) but various elements in the levels (which are totally optional as to whether you investigate them or not) reveal how you got to where you are. - Almost a full fledged game already. Even though this game is in Early Access, it is basically a full game. Even if it was released this moment, I would not regret buying it.Cons: - No graphical settings. This will hopefully change since the game is still only in Early Access, but this is big for me since my computer isn't that amazing, and the game feels sluggish for me because of the various effects that are rendered (completely playable, I just feel like I'm snail in neck brace). - Some of the puzzles can be a good bit more difficult than others in that same section, but since you don't have to complete every single level to progress to the next section (in the first few sections you can do all but one to progress) and since the Early Access features a mandatory feedback system on how difficult and fun the puzzle was, I am sure any overly difficult levels will be reworked as the game improves.Overall, this is a gem. Who knew building factories on alien planets could be so fun, even if it makes your brain melt.My score for Infinifactory as a Factory building and Puzzle solving game - 9/10Oh, and I can't leave out the best part...My score for Infinifactory as a Food Pellet eating and Memorabilia collecting simulator - 11/10			"

								Highly recommended.I've found this much more accessible than SpaceChem, but still extremely satisfying and challenging. I liked the idea of SpaceChem but didn't play it much in the end as aspects of it seemed unintuitive to me. (I meant to go back to it, and figured I just needed to learn how to play it, but never did.) Not so here. Everything is clear from the start and I was instantly hooked.This is one of those puzzle games that gets inside your head and makes you start interpreting other things you look at as if they were in the game. Like how Tetris makes people dream about blocks, or instinctively work out how to slot everything they see in the real world together, just in case, because part of your brain has started doing that automatically.I am not usually a fan of Early Access but it's fine in this case. I can see there are some slight UI improvements that might be added to the final version (already being discussed by the devs) but that's about all you might gain by waiting. I usually dislike EA because I only want to play most games once, so I'd rather play them in their best form, but with this game you're solving puzzles which are so open-ended and free-form that you can solve them again another day in a completely new way, using new techniques you've learned and pieces you've unlocked, and still have a blast. And the game is already in a very good state. So this is a rare case where I can recommend an Early Access game.Infinifactory doesn't suffer from the problem of some ""build a thing to solve a puzzle"" games where the solution is either so simple or so restricted that you are not really having to think, only to work out what the designer wanted you to put where (except one or two levels which are obviously tutorials on new pieces, which are understandable a bit like that, but even then encourage experimenting). It's very open and you're generally given a large 3D canvas in which to invent methods of solving things. You can go for elegance, simplicity, or audacious complexity. Whatever you choose often turns out a lot more complex than you thought, which is part of the fun.Price wise, it seemed a bit high at first for what I thought might be a simple puzzle game. Having played it and become hooked, and seen the depth and replayability it has this has, the price is well worth it. I have spent literally hours on some puzzles, and even once they are finished the desire to improve the solution or just experiment remains. You will more than get your money's worth with this game.Congratulations to the devs, you knocked it out of the park and created a classic. In a world where ""puzzle game"" has started to mean ""match three in a generic grid of gems"", a game like Infinifactory is refreshing and inspiring.			"

												Infinifactory is the kind of game that only a certain type of people will enjoy. I can say that I fall under that category, and I thought it was fantastic. Due to its logical nature, Infinifactory is a game geared toward the same kind of people that enjoy programming; while playing, you'll likely find yourself using a lot of the same practices you might use when coding, such as building machines in ""sections"", optimizing, and debugging. It's also a great way to know if coding is something you'd enjoy or not; if you don't like this game you probably shouldn't try programming either. The game has plenty of content, and as an added bonus, if you have friends who play the game you can compete to see who can build the smallest and/or most efficient machine (which really adds some good replay value).Besides the fantastic and unique gameplay, the game has some pretty solid graphics and good, relaxing music. However, there's one thing about this game I find questionable, and that's the story. You've basically been ""captured"" by ""alien overlords"" who are forcing you to create these machines for them. Any story that uses those terms is very clearly cliché and uninteresting. Of course, no one is going to play this game for the story, but I think the game would be a lot more polished if the story were to be completely overhauled or even removed entirely (I do in fact like the space setting of the game worlds, and I think the game would work out just fine without any story whatsoever).Don't let the stuff I said about the story turn you away from playing Infinifactory – it's still an amazing game, and I highly recommend it if you think you're up for the challenge (especially if you enjoy or are looking into programming).

												One of the best puzzle games i've ever played. If not the best. You get some resources, some machine parts and a delivery portal. Your goal is to create a machine that assembles the resources and deliver the resulting object to the portal.Easy at first, it becomes more and more difficult but without getting unfair.Each puzzle is evaluated by 3 different scores:- Footprint: space usage of the solution- Blocks: the cost of the solution- Cycles: the speed of the solutionWhen you solved a puzzle, the resulting score is compared with the scores from other players solutions. I really like this feature. It keeps me motivated to try solved puzzles again just to figure out a new solution that optimizes in footprint, blocks or cycles.			"

												One of the best puzzle games i've ever played. If not the best. You get some resources, some machine parts and a delivery portal. Your goal is to create a machine that assembles the resources and deliver the resulting object to the portal.Easy at first, it becomes more and more difficult but without getting unfair.Each puzzle is evaluated by 3 different scores:- Footprint: space usage of the solution- Blocks: the cost of the solution- Cycles: the speed of the solutionWhen you solved a puzzle, the resulting score is compared with the scores from other players solutions. I really like this feature. It keeps me motivated to try solved puzzles again just to figure out a new solution that optimizes in footprint, blocks or cycles.			"

Would Recommend, Very funReally fun and clever. Every problem has many solutions.I got this game because I watched someone I am subscribed to on Youtube play it. I decided to get it after he played the first 6 levels. I thought to myself ""Well the first 6 levels of the game are pretty much spoiled, that sucks"". However when I got into the game I found myself solving puzzles in completely different ways. Even though I had already seen them be solved. This just shows how many possibilities there are. The game also controls very nicely and the puzzles are not to hard, but at the same time not to easy. The solution is not immediately obvious and when you figure it out, you feel really smart.The variety of blocks you can use to solve puzzles really makes it a fun game.			"

Early Access Review
								Mechanically a 3D Spacechem and while there are ups and downs to that, it is easily a worthwhile game. Has plenty enough content and difficulty for people who haven´t completed Spacechem and is well balanced for people coming into the production-puzzle genre thing, but at least for now pales in comparison to Spacechem in variety and amount of puzzles at the hard end of things. The game for now ends aprubtly and seemingly in the middle of the story but I imagine the promised to-be-added-during-EA content will fix these problems.All and all the mechanics are there and I am intently waiting for more. :)			"

								This may be in early access, but it is one of the most interesting pure puzzle games I have played. The basic mechanics are extremely intuitive, with hidden depth in how you use them, creating an enjoyable and engaging learning curve, where the process of learning and experimentation is one of the major aspects of the enjoyment from this game. Each puzzle presents a unique aproach building on what you have learned in previous puzzles and every puzzle has an almost infinite number of solutions, ranging from smartly designed and effiecient, to extremely hacky and conditional, but what's great is that both of these ideas are valid solutions. This game surpasses the already great Spacechem in almost every way and comes highly reccomended despite the fact that is in early access.			"

												I stumbled on the game randomly on my monthly humble bundle, and when I saw the Zachtronics stamp on it I knew it was going to be good, and yeah i was not disapointed. It's essencialy Space Chem meets Minecraft. I'm not too far into the game and the puzzle are starting to get tough, the though process to solve each puzzle is really rewarding, thinking  how to build the differents bits of the target piece, making a quick proto, then integrating it in the chain,  synch with the other line, weld together and BAM!  level is done! No wait I'm sure I can tune a bit to save blocks, or footprint.And all of a sudden you have the breakthrough about that previous puzzle you solved in a wonky way, you want to go back to redo it with this new elegant chunk of production line that avoids that very long winded triple rotation and pushing module you were proud of but was, admit it, massively ineficient.The handling is A-OK, it works, does what it says on the tin but sometimes the ergonomy is not as good as it can be. The efforts for the story telling are nice, small ""easter eggs"" etc. As for most Zachtronics puzzle the difficulty increase quickly, so don't get scared once you finish the tutorial.I wish there was a way to capture in game video / sharing on social media, some pieces of machinery are just so satifying I wish I could show them around.

												This game is 3D Spacechem. For more details, please see my Spacechem review.I still think Spacechem is the best puzzle game ever made. I haven't played enough of this to decide if this ursurps the puzzle game throne, but it looks like a good possibility so far.These games are hard to describe and intimidating to watch without having played (especially Spacechem since its just a bunch of weird lines and symbols). The best way I can think to describe it is, think of programming a loop or a method. You know what the inputs and outputs need to be and you know a few other functions/methods that you can use to take the inputs and make the outputs. These games are all about designing a repeatable process that won't fail under a heavy load.Besides the 3D, one of the main differentiators Infinifactory has is a humorous storyline that follows the ""Show, don't tell"" school of writing. I remember Spacechem being pretty wordy and not funny, but Infinifactory is the opposite!Buy Infinifactory....or Spacechem.UPDATE: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the difficulty escalates pretty quickly.			"

Early Access Review
								I would definately say that the asking price for this one is fair. Infinifactory is a well-made, fun, and challenging puzzler. The real challenge comes not from solving the puzzles once through (though that can also be difficult), no, but from beating your orginal score (measured in the number of blocks you use and the speed of your completed contraption).The game is well tutorialized, but it does not hold your hand. Starting off with simple puzzles and working up to more complex ones, the learning curve is gradual, and it soon gets complicated. The visuals and soundtrack are splendid. Not mind-blowing, but who needs that anyway. They work for the game and the genre, and make solving the puzzles relaxing.The narritive elements are like icing. It adds something but is not the real substance of the game.Anyway, this is a really good puzzler and I enjoy it alot. hightly reccomend.			"

Early Access Review
								A fantastic puzzle game. It's rock solid stable, looks good and has lots of content as well as an interesting storyline. If you liked SpaceChem then you'll love Infinifactory.As others have said It's basically SpaceChem in 3D, concepts of reactors and piping are more or less combined, with conveyers taking the place of the latter, and the entire level being the reactor. The same concept of optimising cycles (time), number of components used and now overall footprint of components is present. Finding a solution, and then tweaking to optimise is a dream come true for us OCD types out there! The game will rank your solution for a given challenge against the population playing the game, so that you can see where you score. It's difficult, and sometimes impossible to rank highly in each area. Decreasing cycle time will increase block count for example. Improving one of the three scores will usually come at the cost of one or both of the others.Zachtronics stands out for me as a real leader in modern puzzle games. Great challenge, lots of replayability, user created content and a sandbox mode! For those that like their puzzle games, I can't reccomend it enough.			"

												A nice puzzle game. Nothing spectacular, but well worth it. I feel like the developers wasted a chance to make a more immersive experience if they removed the option menu where you select the puzzles, and replaced that with some kind of mini level or teleport. Perhaps a small computer console standing next to the teleport would allow you to select the level to play. The way it is currently, I'm constantly reminded that I'm playing a game.Anyway, thumbs up for good puzzles which is the main reason I got it.			"

												Yes, get it, with or without trying other Zach games, this game is an amaizing puzzler, analytic, creative and re-playable game. Some other considerations to it:At first I was very sceptical with this game. I thought that the 3D building component of the game will be tiresome (running around putting dozens of pieces for a neat completion is not small task) but is actually what I like the most, the 3 dimensions for solving the problems.They fixed some mistakes done in Spacechem, like the saving system (now you can have three solutions (cycles, footprint, blocks optimized in the same profile). Actually optimize for footprint is another thing that I love about the game.Puzzles are varied, challenging and original. There are uncountable ways to solve them. Learning curve is good (maybe a bit slow if you're a veteran to Zachtronics games). "

												I loved SpaceChem, so I expected I would enjoy this game too. I wasn't wrong. Infinifactory is, simply put, SpaceChem in 3D. Pros+ Challenging Gameplay+Finishing levels gives a great sense of satisfaction+The audio logs are very interestingCons-Game doesn't seem to know quite what its tone is supposed to be. The times when you interact with the aliens are funny and goofy, but the audio logs you find on the bodies of your predecessors are pretty dark and haunting. There's even a  dead dog  within the first few levels. The uneven tone of the game doesn't take away from the gameplay, but I wish they had gone either serious or silly all the way/-Visually, not great. The visuals seem pretty utilitarian in their purpose. They show what you need to see with no bells and whistles. Lighting isn't great, either.-Music gets old fast, especially when spending a long time on a level. I usually play my own music unless I find one of the audio logs.In spite of the cons I've listed, I would still highly reccomend it. The gameplay is just so incredibly good that it makes up for the other shortcomings.9/10			"

Then, once your done, step back and look at your solution and say to yourself, ""Hmm...I could do this more efficiently"", then solve it again with a more efficient solution.

												This is one of the most under-rated puzzle games on steam in my opinion, and the best Zacktronics has ever produced.Like any of Zacktronic's other games, the puzzles are unique, challenging, well balanced, and fun. The story is interesting -- far more so than any other of their games. I cannot recommend this enough.			"

												I was looking forward to this game for awhile. I like it a lot and it has a bit of the same feeling I got from playing TIS-100. The puzzles are challenging enough and you don't get much input on how to figure things out. It keeps you thinking differently with each new puzzle. I really like what Zach has been producing so far. I hope he keeps it up.			"

												My favorite part of Zachtronics games is the feeling of moving tangible objects in the game world. That's what elevates it above awkward programming for me. Out of the Zachtronics games I've played, Infinifactory captures this aspect best.The workshop integration also adds a lot of value. The built-in puzzle design, as in all Zachtronics games, tends to favor big-and-messy puzzles as the game progresses, and I'm more a fan of small-and-clean puzzles. Many of the workshop puzzles offer this sort of design, in particular Aap op Sokken's ""Way Too Fast"" series.Compared to 2D Zachtronics games, it is less challenging to complete puzzles in Infinifactory because having 3 dimensions available means you are less space constrained. Those looking for pure difficulty may be disappointed, but for me the increased immersion makes up for it.			"

												This is a fantastic example of a problem-solving puzzle game.  If you're familiar with Zachtronics' other titles and liked them at all, stop wasting your time reading this and run-do-not-walk to the ""buy"" button.If you're not familiar with the genre or the other titles, let me put it like this: you're building a factory.  You get some collection of stuff in, and some tools (conveyor belts, welders, etc) which you arrange into a production line to build a specific requested product.  You have essentially infinite freedom for what to build, and the _first_ puzzle is figuring out how to make what you want.  Then things get a little OCD.Every solution you build to a puzzle is scored on three factors: how fast you solved it, how many pieces you used, and how ""big"" your solution was (for a measure of bigness that is not worth trying to define here.)  And it shows you how well yours scored compared to other users who have played the game.  Even if you're not the competitive type, it's awfully hard not to look at the fact that someone else solved it in half the time, think ""That's impossible!  Well maybe if I..."" and look up 4 hours later from the ruins of your civilization to realize that you are now addicted to this game.  Often times optimizing your solution one way will make it hilariously inefficent according to one of the other two scoring factors, so you'll end up solving the same problem many times.The game is also set in a quirky-but-dark setting with a nice touch of humour.  It doesn't impose on the gameplay much (yet) but it does add a nice tone.  The interface is quick and intuitive.  The music and art assets are well-done, and the support is nothing short of phenomenal - I emailed Zachtronics with an issue and got a response from the developer within minutes (not that you should expect that every time, but I was still impressed... especially since the issue was actually User Error.)Thanks Zach!  Great game!			"

												Infinifactory is actually just a 3D puzzle game. Each level is a challenge in which you need to design a machine that will construct a pattern. The building blocks are a well-defined set. Clear and simple. And there are many possible solutions. By itself it is not that hard if you don't care about finding the most efficient solution. If you do, however, it can be quite challenging!At first, I compared it to Portal (but not that good). Today, I rather think of it as a modern Lemmings!  :)If you like puzzle games & if you like first-person, then you may want to give this one a try! I am loving it!			"

												I'm enjoying this game quite a bit.  The key skill in this game is visualizing and manipulating objects in 3d space, and arranging all the inputs in the assembly process in proper orientation and sequence to complete your project.  Some of your tools are conveyer belts, pushers, sensors, welders, rotators, elevators, and demolishers, and I know there are some more, but I'm only 31 hours in so there's a couple blank tools I haven't seen yet.  Up to this point I've eagerly approached each puzzle, and only really had a couple major setbacks that required complete rebuilds.  You are able to optimize on different vectors including speed, # of parts used, and something else that I can't recall presently ;-)Compared to Zachtronics game Spacechem (which I also enjoyed), I think the puzzles in this game play out in a bit more ""fun"" way than the puzzles in Spacechem.  In Spacechem I found myself staring at the screen trying to find a devise a solution for a long time - and then ""bang"" the moment of enlightenment would come.  Infinifactory is different in that its more a series of small steps that gradually lead you to completion, although you do have to plan holistically the entire way.  The third dimension also provides interesting flexibility in builds also.The levels are beginning to get a bit difficult for me - I've stalled out on one of the meat preperation levels (the one with the whale) - and this is the first one that I've been hesitant to go back to because the solution looks a bit messy to me so far, it's sortof difficult to see what's happening,  and I have to carefully plan out my cuts on paper to maximize yield.  It's the first level that I haven't been drawn back to so far, but I'll get back to it soon enough.Anyhow, yes I recommend this game.  It's one of the best puzzle games I've played.   My one suggestion is that I wish there was a straightforward way to insert a logical ""AND"" into the sensors to require multiple conditions to be true before an action is carried out.  That can be overcome vie less straightforward means usually dependent upon timing, but its seems in several places I was wishing I could insert an ""AND"" condition and not worry about it so much.Yes, I recommend this game.

												I saw a short video of this game a while back displaying some of the gameplay. I thought the concept was really cool, and the gameplay looked smoothe, but I didn't really pay very much mind to it after that. Until it showed up one day in my dicovery queue, and, being the curious person that i am, I picked it up at it's Christmas sale price.I was completely blown away by just how fun this game is. Creating large assebmly lines and factories and watching all the small storage units come through from a nice top down view, or witnessing the creation that you spent hours on make a tiny mistake somewhere in the middle and fall apart with storage crates piling up and falling off cliffs due to your small error, and then procceding to pick apart your assembly line piece by piece to find that tiny little mistake.On top of this amazing ""create-> test-> fail-> change-> succeed"" style gameplay, there is a dark, but still somewhat goofy plot, that made me shed some tears in the early game. The unnerving corpses that litter each level, each one holding the last recorded audio log before they failed their task. This game brought me right up to my screen with so many different emotions. And, dare I say it... The dog. Being an overall animal lover, and an owner of a dog myself, witnessing the horrors that lie in that one level brought me to tears the moment I picked up that audio log, and really brought to light the horrific acts commited by the games antagonists.9/10			"

												Spacechem was amazing, but the one slightly annoying thing about it was that it wasn't 3D. I got this game because the developer has said it is ""Spacechem, but in 3D!"". It is a bit like space chem, but it has a lot of the really annoying things that make this overall way more frusturating:1. Welders are SO ANNOYING!!! they can't be turned off, so you have to be more careful with them then bonders in Spacechem.2. lack of vertical transport. If it ever shows up, I got too frusturated early on to get to it. If the input and output are on the same level, it's essentially 2D3. lack of story. Spacechem had a story, but this is just aliens yelling at you.EDIT: all these things are annoying, but if you stop  thinking of it as like spacechem, it gets much easier and more fun.			"

												Best first person puzzle game not named Portal. It's like if Valve took away your portal gun and gave you Minecraft redstone.			"

												Beautiful logistic puzzle game with, to be clear, no survival gameplay. Great in small doses.Definite get when on sale, since $25 seems way too high			"

												It's a neat little puzzle game. Focuses you to be creative and build your own solution not just the one the dev intended. The physics engine is rudimentary but it gets the job done.			"

												Each level in this game is experienced in a few stages.Stage 1Wow, this is pretty good. Like building your own production line.Stage 2Hmm, this is tougher than I thought it would be. I can do it though, just need to move this here and that over there.Stage 3WOW, this is SO FRUSTRATING OMG I SWEAR THIS LEVEL IS IMPOSSIBLE.Stage 4Lol so that was all it took. Gosh I'm feeling really smart now.Stage 5Huh, I'm feeling confident now. Let's try the next stage. (At this part you revert back to stage 1).			"

												Puzzle games don't get much better.  In this game you need to create a factory that creates the holographic object(s) shown.  Many levels I've entered and been like Holy Sht how am I going to build that.  Dig in and you can figure it out.  Then see how you can improve your design.  Great challenges.			"

												Good engineering puzzle fun times to be had. Really flexible system gives many different ways to accomplish tasks, it's up to you to find your own style and make something work. Good depth to be found in optimisation challenges and trying to beat friends and the wider community.The tools are limited to begin with, but expand quite a bit as you progress (and often you'll find yourself wishing you had a certain something only to later get it)Some small things missing that get a little frustrating (why can't welders/sensors also point up instead of down for instance) but overall good times to be had.If you liked engineering/tech mods in minecraft and the like, definitely a game for you.

												If you liked space chem, you'll love this too!It's a fantastic game all about optomising, testing, failing and failing again!Sometimes you hack together a solution that makes no sense, but it works... kind of... but what matters is that it does the job - Just like making software in the real world!I would also recommend playing with subtitles as they can be fairly funny for the sound effects sometimes			"

												Zachtronics has a history of creating highly acclaimed conveyor / programming logic puzzles, ever since their cult hit SpaceChem. Their other games have been 2-dimensional, but Infinifactory brings the same formula into 3D. The addition of 3rd dimension adds a whole lot more space for creating solutions, which can be both a good and a bad thing. Having more space can make solutions turn rather messy towards the end, where the conveyor belts can zigzag wildly among multiple levels of elevation, whereas 2D map restrictions forced a certain level of optimization to make the most of limited space. On the other hand, 3D offers far more possible solutions to any given puzzle, so wider range of players are able to find an answer eventually. The campaign difficulty is decently challenging but not too hard. For the most part the game leaves you to figure out your own tactics and favourite setups with the blocks you're given, which you earn gradually while progressing in the story. The story is rather weak though, and only starts to open up later in the game. The game's also rather visually simplistic, which worked just fine for the 2D puzzle games but sticks out a little bit more in the 3D environment. Still, neither really bothers anyone who's simply absorbed in the puzzle solving.The game tracks how well your solution was optimized, based on time, blocks used or how much space your factory takes. You can compare scores with your steam friends, or see where your score lands among the entire playerbase, so you can always go back and optimize your solution to compete for best scores. If you'd prefer more tangible goals besides score hunting, there's a good handful of achievements which require a certain score within certain levels, which often requires you to fully rethink your entire setup to complete.This game is a solid entry in their library and I have no problem recommending to fans of puzzle games, but in my opinion this isn't quite as good as their other titles. Give it a try, if you're in the mood for a puzzle game.			"
