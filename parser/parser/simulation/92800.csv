												SpaceChem has the most marvelously difficult puzzles where you don't so much find a solution as build it. The difficulty rises steeply, and you may yourself stumped, only to wake up in the middle of the night thinking ""Eureka! I've got it!"" (true story.) And once the atoms and molecules are whizzing around, doing their perfectly orchestrated dance that you yourself choreographed, you feel a wonderful sense of ownership of the solution, since it is in a very real sense yours.No knowledge of chemistry required, though people with programming experience may have an edge.

												I hated chemistry in school. You know that meme about math problems? The one about word math problems and the answer is ""Purple because aliens don't wear hats"". That one. That is how I felt and still feel about chemistry, engineering, and math. I have no idea where I even got SpaceChem, because I sure as hell wouldn't have bought it, unless I now have a sleep-buying condition I don't know about. At any rate, SpaceChem sat in my library for a very long time and it was only because I wanted the trading cards did I fire it up.It sat playing in the background for a little bit, and then I noticed the soundtrack. Such an elaborate soundscape, I had to take a look at this game, even if it fried my brain. The UI is stylish and minimalist, everything I would expect from a game with the words ""Space"" and ""Chemistry"" referenced in it. What I wasn't expecting was the rich story unfolding within the game. Like a science fiction unraveling through the planets explored with the completion of a set of puzzles found on each planet.I won't lie, the puzzles involve chemistry and engineering (to a degree... hur hur) but don't let that put you off. Initially, I could feel my brain melt out of my ears as my senses felt overloaded with symbols, flashbacks to chemistry lab and purple because aliens don't wear hats. But that soon subsided as I got stuck in with the tutorial and slowly tackled a couple of the earlier puzzles. There is a fluidity and beauty to this puzzle game that is perhaps what makes mathematicians, scientists and engineers smile when something goes right. I hate to admit it, but I felt it compelling at times to just watch a result replay. And there is a great sense of achievement when you solve a puzzle!There is a lot at your fingertips within this game - there's even a periodic table that you can review - but don't let that put you off. I can only play the game in doses, but the music is perfect to thinking and solving a logical puzzle, and that is ultimately what this game comes down to: logic with chemistry elements. I imagine anyone studying engineering or chemistry may find great joy within this game - and it could even be a great learning tool to someone trying to master some of the key concepts of the subject. If you can get pass some of symbols and terminology (and stop giggling at the term ""waldo"") then you will not be wasting your time exploring the puzzles and story within SpaceChem. The soundtrack alone is worth it.I never thought I would say it, but SpaceChem is a little gem of a puzzle game. I recommend it.			"

												Sheesh, where do I begin?  This game is a logician's wet dream.Sure, it's an exercise in humility, but I feel I can safely say it's also the most compelling puzzle game I have played to date.  There is no chaos whatsoever--only increasingly complex order and efficiency.  If ever there were a game that captured the passion of engineering, this is it.The music is deeply inspired and provides a suitable background to your work.  The story has some enrapturing quality as well, a smidge of suspense and intrigue enough to give you that extra nudge forward.  This may sound insane, but reading the story between puzzles feels physically relieving, as though the stress on your mind is shifted to different regions, much like those atoms are shuffled so smoothly around the reactors, so orderly, clean and calm.Wait, did I say 'work'?  I mean that in the kindest sense possible.  You'll understand once you start to 'play'; these words will become interchangeable.I could see this game used in schools to outstanding effect.It's a masterpiece.			"

												This game consumed my life... literally... for a couple months. To put this game into simple terms, SpaceChem is basically a visual programming game. You receive various inputs and using various tools within the game, the goal is to generate a specified output. Loops, if/then statements, arrays, and many more tools are at your disposal. The game starts simply, but the difficulty increases quickly. Pretty soon, you will find a puzzle that completely stumps you.This game is not for the feint of heart, the puzzles are hard. But since the game operates within a well defined set of rules, you will find yourself thinking of solutions throughout the day. I found myself drawing sketches to solutions that I had brainstormed while at work. Then I'd eagerly wait until the day was over to get home, try out the idea, and refine any issues. Like I said, the game consumes your life. But when you find yourself stumped on a puzzle for hours, only to conjure a solution during the day, and implement it to great success, you will feel an immense amount of accomplishment.Quite simply, this is one of the best puzzle games I have played. I wish there was more, I must have more. My only disclaimer is that if you don't like steeply difficult challenges, then you likely won't enjoy this game. I will say it once more, this game is hard.			"

												First off, this game is not chemistry.  Do not let the 'Chem' in 'SpaceChem' scare you off.  Second off, this game is an addictive programming puzzle game that uses the periodic table as a basis for its puzzles that has a steep learning curve and a brutal difficulty in the moderate to later levels.  It's an excellent game if you want a major mental challenge or simply wish to work on your spacial programming and optimization skills.			"

												SpaceChem is a puzzle game that deals with atoms and molecules.I don't really think the story makes that much sense, but where this game really excells is in the puzzles.The game is made up of chapters and levels. Each chapter will introduce one or two new new gameplay features. The levels take you through an easy tutorial of how to use the new element, and gets progressively more challenging. This learning curve is very good.As for how the levels themselves work, you are given various tools and a grid. The job is to move elements (like hydrogen/carbon etc.) around, and join them to form molecules which you then pipe out. It initially seems easy but once you add mulitple reactors piping out to each other it quicky adds more of a challenge.My only issue is, if I find myself becoming fixated on ridiculously complicated solutions. You can't skip levels if you are finding them too complicted. This means if you are completely stuck and can't progress unless you can solve each level sequentially.This game is controlled with a mouse, but has keyboard shortcust to make things easier to control. This works really well, in my opinion.The graphics are very simple, which is good as it makes it easy to see what exactly you're doing.The music and sounds in this game are very nice.There are extra challenges included once you complete the game, and ones that can earn you extras in TF2, it seems. This coupled with the wide number of challenges means the game definitely has a very good play-through time.Definitely buy this game if you like puzzles, but don't buy it for it's chemical/scientific accuracy.

												SpaceChem is a really excellent puzzle game—if “puzzle game” is even the right way to describe it (more on this in a moment). It casts the player as an engineer working for an outer-space industrial operation—your job is to program and arange the reactors that recombine chemical elements for various industrial purposes.Right up front it’s worth noting that SpaceChem isn’t actually a chemistry game. Ignorance of actual chemistry isn’t a hindrance. The actual game play consists of setting up tracks which carry chemical components around within a reactor, and inserting commands to make sure that what you want ends up where you want it. In some stages there is a further level of complexity where you must set up and connect multiple reactors to be used together.All this has a lot more to do with computer programming than it does which chemistry. In fact, it seems fair to say that SpaceChem is like the fun part of programming separated from all the arcane knowledge and headache that go along with it. You are, in essence, issuing simple commands to a machine to enable it to complete complex tasks. (People who have coded may also feel some déjà vu as they set about finding the bugs in the operation of reactors they’ve already set up—it feels just like debugging code.)Here is where SpaceChem is so different from most other puzzle games. Instead of being faced with a problem to which you must FIND a solution, here you are faced with an objective and you must DESIGN a solution. These stages are less puzzles than engineering tasks. And possible approaches to the SpaceChem stages are innumerable and call on your creativity as much as your deduction. This is emphasized by the feedback you get once you’ve completed a stage which compares your solution to all the others on record along several dimensions. For me, this added an incentive not just to beat a level, but to keep returning to my solution: surely I could find a way to do it faster, or with fewer instructions than the others who’d solved it. Thus the replayability of even a single stage is vast.That is the real strength and focus of the game, the core structure of the problem solving. Some other elements are less strong. The visuals are very simple, though, for the most part, I think this brings an abstract elegance. The story, such as it is, is darkly comedic but tacked on and not really worth your attention. And the boss battles, essentially normal stages with some sort of twist in how you apply your chemistry, are awkward and un-compelling as if an afterthought to the game’s design. But these complaints are peripheral to the core excellence of the game as an opportunity for creative, structured problem solving. (And don’t take the creative bit to mean it isn’t challenging. The difficulty of the game has been widely noted. Things start off easily enough, but don’t feel bad if you find the later stages very challenging—you have a lot of company.) So if you like puzzle games, coding, or a good challenge, SpaceChem is for you. (In addition to my Steam copy, I’ve put in many hours on a DRM free copy, and a number on a copy for my tablet. The game's that good--I've acquired it more than once.)			"

												Having played through the base game, Spacechem is a great puzzle game at it's core. Pros - The puzzles. They become increasing harder as you go along, but it is pretty steady. Each set of puzzles build on skills you have acquired from the previous. There are challenges associated with many of the puzzles. You do not have to complete them to beat the game, but they really make you think and work for the achievement. They can be tough, but I enjoyed solving them. Nothing in the game is forced on you with the challenges and achievements. It saves your progress so you can keep moving forward in the game and go back later to beat the challenges. I really felt a sense of accomplishment finishing this game. Many puzzle games become the a+b =c formula and thus, boring. Space Chem held to the end.The controls and UI worked really well. Learning the hotkeys helps. There are many videos on You Tube. Really cool after you beat a puzzle, you can see how others did it. I did not see any of my solutions online and there are may ways to solve each one. The instruction on new tools were good. Told you what you needed to know and left you to figure out how to employ them. The periodic chart was a useful addition.Cons – The story outside the puzzles was a cheese sandwich with the crust (Try eating one and you'll see what I mean, dry and chewy, just sayin'). Not the worst I have seen, but after while I didn't bother. I mention this only to point out it does not take away from the great puzzles. That is the heart of this great gem. If you don't like the story, skip it. The graphics do not interfere with the game at all. They were functional. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy puzzles that challenge your critical thinking and problem solving abilities. This is an exceptional game. Skip the story, solve the puzzles. You'll feel smarter, I do.			"

												SpaceChem is a very entertaining, mindbending challenge that manages to retain an approachable difficulty curve while the leaderboard system encourages you to to think deeply about the puzzle mechanics to out class your friends. The depth available to the game has spawned a community that has still not managed to perfect solutions for every level leaving plenty of room for the enterprising chemist to dazzle and impress. In short, if you're looking for a puzzle - this is the game to get. It's fun from the start and only gets better.Do not buy this game if you can't program. Turing completeness makes for some of the most engaging puzzling we will probably ever see in a video game, but it also unfortunately means that I cannot in good faith recommend this title without that massive caveat. The game makes no pretenses about its true nature and the introductory challenges are little more than cues to familiarize yourself with the game's controls and the puzzle mechanics. The experience with the demo version is only a portion of what the game has to offer: a lack of confidence in tackling the game's challenges will frustrate you and copying other people's solutions will leave you with no understanding or appreciation of the game.

												SpaceChem is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brilliant. In the course of the game you use reactors to combine elements into molecules - that's pretty much the gist of it. However, it's done via timing mechanisms where you take in molecules and atoms and manipulate them via a series of steps - adding/removing bonds, fusing them, splitting them, teleporting them, the list just goes on. From an actual chemistry standpoint it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, but what's really intriguing is that this takes the essence of programming/circuit design and distills it into a fascinating game. Engineering students/programming students should CONSUME this game - it's a wonderful example of the sort of work we try to solve.I got hopelessly addicted to this game for a good long while. It gets hard - REALLY hard. But the feeling of satisfaction upon finding a solution is just....so fantastic. Even more if you've got some friends who you can compete against trying to find more and more efficient solutions.I cannot recommend this game enough. It's wonderful.			"

												Why haven't you played SpaceChem? Probably because you are intimidated by the trailer and think it's too complicated, or because you didn't know it exists. Well, this game does exist, and now you don't have an excuse anymore to not at least try the free demo.SpaceChem is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. It uses fake chemistry only as a backdrop for its puzzle mechanics. So don't worry, you don't need to know anything about chemistry in order to play this game. Your job is to design machines that transform a given input into a required output. For example, the game gives you single hydrogen atoms and demands hydrogen molecules (two hydrogen atoms bonded to each other). You can then use functions like grab, drop, input, output, bond, etc. to create a machine that automatically turns hydrogen atoms into hydrogen molecues. How you do this exactly is up to you. It can be very satisfying to watch your solution run, because it is YOUR OWN creation. You are not simply following a strict path the puzzle designer wanted you to take. And after each completed puzzle, a graph will show you how efficient your solution is compared to others, giving you extra incentive to make your solution work just a little bit faster or use less functions.As you progress, more functions will be available like fusion or flip-flop switches, allowing you to create even more complex machines. Some levels let you link several machines together, so the output of one machine can be used as an input for another machine. The last couple of worlds are very challenging, but even if you give up there, you'll get your money's worth. And if the campaign isn't enough for you, there are still tons of user created puzzles to solve and challenges to master.If you like puzzle games, or if you like programming, buy this game now! If you are uncertain, play the demo. It's pretty long and gives you a good look into the game. For some people the demo might even be enough.I have finished the GOG version, and that's the one I'd recommend, because it includes the DLC.			"

												Spacechem is a very original puzzle game. It doesn't ask you to follow the developpers' train of thoughts and find out what they wanted you to do. Instead, you're presented with a problem and have to find your own solution.This is incredibly satisfying, because anything you try can theoretically work if you think hard enough. Or, you can just start from scratch and try something completely different.The difficulty curve is perfect, and there are enough levels for everyone to enjoy the game even if you don't make it to the end (the last couple of levels are pretty hard).Because there's no fixed solution to any problem, the replay value is huge. It becomes staggering when you take in consideration the different leaderboards and how getting a good score in each category requires a completely different approach each time.One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.

												SpaceChem is the video game equivalent of ""nerd sniping."" It's an approachable, but extremely difficult procedural programming-based indie puzzle game that's loosely based on chemistry. You are tasked with assembling ""reactors,"" which manipulate molecules to create other molecules. The game challenges you to think through a solution on a high level, then invent a way to actually accomplish it. The difficulty curve ramps up quickly, then continues to ramp up as new game mechanics are introduced.Play this game if you're feeling smart and want to prove otherwise. Unless you can beat it. Then you might actually be smart.			"

												This game has nothing to do with chemistry--the (fake) chemistry is just some nice visuals to distract you from the fact that you're coding--and everything to do with programming in assembly. If programming in assembly is your kind of thing, or a thing you'd like to make your thing, you'll probably enjoy this game! If not, you should probably try it anyway! But bring a whiteboard.			"

												This is weird game. Seriously. It was also bundled bunch of times, so you can grab it, if you so desire, for almost nothing. TL;DR (regarding gameplay itself) at the end.But what it's all about? I wouldn't say ""chemistry"" like others (and whats funny - also title) says. In chemistry, at least for now, you have to use reagents to get specific products (for example Na + Cl2 -> 2 NaCl). Here, you can operate on atomic level to manipulate what are you getting.You have something in your inputs and there is requirment to get something specific to output. Sounds easy? At first it is, only thing you need is to ""spawn"" molecule, grab it (with weird looking circle-like thing), drop it, ""despawn"" it and do it periodically. After that? Get 2 molecules, bound them and send them out. Next? While having only single H (hydrogen) and single C (carbon) make not CH but CH4 (methan) instead. And you can't simply spawn 4 H's (they appear in the same spot - causing an error), grab every one of them (only one atom with its bindings can be taken at the time) bind them with carbon... I would say playing this game literally using YT to pass levels is pointless (and I saw it in leaderboards that its common practice) because difficulty level grows quite quickly, you will need those YT clips to pass next level... and next one, and next and so on - which will become boring very quickly, you won't enjoy it as much etc. It is logical game for a reason. It took me good hour to do one level, but it was so good feeling I did it MYSELF without external help.(almost)TL;DR:Pros: good (but not great, mind you) design leaderboards (doing levels over and over again to do stuff even faster or with less ""parts"" is amazing) it's clear regarding what is actually happening/will happen requires carefull planing difficultyCons: well... difficulty would love to see some kind of small guide in the game how exactly everything works solutions are sometimes hard to pull off due to... ... limited amount of complication you can haveRegarding my last point - each waldo can ""go"" into specific point at best 2 times during one cycle. No more, due to how the game itself is constructed. Its painful when I want to drop 3 specific atoms one after the other in the same place, but I simply can't... Of course there is way around it but it makes things even more complicated.Ok to sum up - this is great game that requires huge amount of thinking, planning and almost literally debugging to make things work as intended. Feels seriously like programming but it's not.			"

TL;DR:It's not a bad game, but you should think carefully about whether or not you are the target audience.On paper, SpaceChem sounds exactly like my kind of game. It's a playful take on concurrent programming, and on top of that, it's themed around chemistry.I like puzzle games. I like programming. I like chemistry. Surely I will like SpaceChem then, right?Unfortunately not. I tried really hard to enjoy this game, but each time I play, a very distinctly nagging feeling hit me: I could just be programming. The game isn't bad in any notable way, and I actually had some fun playing it. But I just have so much more fun actually programming.This will be a ""buyers beware"" to the kind of people that get irritable during handhold-y tutorials and on-rails games.SpaceChem is a game. Not a sandbox. This game boils programming down to two concepts: Solving the problem, and optimizing your solution. There is going to be one single ""best"" solution to the problem at hand, and your solution is going to be either optimal or sub-optimal. End of story.Here is why you will probably like this game:If you need someone to tell you what your immediate goal is, if you feel uncomfortable with just being dropped in the deep end with no milestones or objectives, this game is for you! Intimidating as it may seem, this game does a wonderful job at providing the player with a controlled environment, clear goals, instructions and rules.Here is when and why you should think twice about buying this game:This game does its own thing, and it does it well, but it is neither chemistry nor computer science in any way. It is a game with a theme. At most, it is about repeatedly improving on solutions to the same problem. Hence, neither ""because programming"" nor ""because chemistry"" should be your reason for purchasing this title.If you have a fascination with chemistry, have done any programming in the past, or just generally prefer sandbox games, this is not that.

												A few points for context. I have a Chemical Engineering training background. I do lots of programming in my job. And I really love puzzle oriented games. In other words, this game should be a perfect fit for me.For the most part, this game is amazing. They took a very simple premise, and made a puzzle game that can get really complex. Additionally, since it is possible to design your own puzzles, I can easily understand the existence of online contests around this game.Unfortunately, I think that it is my programming background that shows the flaws in the developement environment. The help screens (and tooltips) are a bit lacking in detail. The cut-n-paste mechanics are a bit too weak. The ability to save components for reuse are also not useful enough. I understand that this is just a game, and not an IDE, but it is a programming game... or perhaps, I am just being too critical.   In summary, I do recommend this game, but it is not perfect.			"

And that you can´t stumble upon more complex yet simple & uncompromising game.While going to sleep with unfinished level I was experiencing something like lucid dreaming about possible solutions. It´s sure that this game will not be appreciated by majority of players.

												You beat each level by designing a machine to beat it for you.Pros:A clever educational game, and probably one of the most challenging puzzle games ever made. Solving the puzzles requires a mixture of computer programming, creativity, and chemistry. You don't require a knowledge of either subject since the game will teach you what you need to know. Great for students interested in learning about either subject.If you want to show off how clever you are, this is the game for you.Cons:The puzzles can be so challenging that playing the game - at times - feels like work.

												I'm not really sure how to review this game, I feel it is a very good game I just can't be bothered with it. It starts off very well with a nice intuitive system, great music and intriguing story told through text screens between levels. So where does it go wrong? Well it doesn't really go wrong as such, it is just the puzzles get ridiculously difficult. They are extremely satisfying when you solve them but they quickly get to the point where you don't even know where to start. This level of intellectual challenge is not what I am looking for in a game. I gave up having barely scratched the surface of the game. I think get this game if you are looking for a real challenge and if you can accept that you are probably not going to finish it.			"

First a little story:I got this game back when Steam gave everyone a free game for Christmas. At first, I was massively disappointed. Why the hell did I get this crap while my friend got Half-Life: The Complete Pack? Sometime later, I learnt this game had TF2 items, so I popped it open and got confused the first few minutes in, so I cheated my way and got the achievements I needed to get my free items. All's well ends well...Until recently, I was watching one of Mark Brown's ""Game Maker's Toolkit"" (being interested in becoming a video game programmer myself) videos in Youtube, and in one of them he praised SpaceChem. I felt bad for having tossed this game away back, even considering it's gained so many awards for being inovattive and a challenging puzzle game, so I popped it open once more, and here I am reccomending it.Onto the game now:The negative reviews on steam have a very good point in the game, this game is NOT EASY. You will benefit a lot by having programming knowledge from this game, however I could very easily reccomend this game to my friends who aren't programmers, simply because it does what it is supposed to very well, and that is being a puzzle game. Chemistry, while it is in the game and is a theme present in the game, is not required for the game. Even if you're a biologist (Lol people consider that a science nowadays?), you won't have to do chemistry here, so be happy.It starts off slow and easy, and it has a considerable difficulty curve. I haven't quite finished the game yet, but I am enjoying it and I've never really had any big moments of head-banging frustration, but I've had many ""EUREKA!"" moments. If you're not sure if you can really quite cope with this game, I encourage you to try out the demo. It should give you a rough idea of how the game plays.Graphics:The artstyle is quite nice, sadly though you spend a lot of time inside the reactors, so you get a gray screen with red and blue lasers most of the time.Story:The story is intriguing, and the written text files in the game are well written and have an interesting story developing (I don't want to spoil too much). That being said while it is not the focus of the game, it is still a nice touch.Sounds:The music has managed to staple itself into my brain. Bravo on that. It's a good soundtrack too. Sound effects are nice, my only complaint is that the sound of removing the pipes is a bit odd.If only I gave this game to my Ex back then. She would have loved it because she loves chemistry and puzzle games, despite her not being a computing nerd like me.This game is even forcing me to reconsider Portal as my favorite puzzle game. I even bought the DLC just to support this awesome game I didn't get the chance to purchase (As well as to get some extra content)SpaceChem, I'm sorry I ignored you my love. You're staying in my heart for a while.Story: 7/10Graphics: 8/10Music: 8/10Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: 8/10 "

SpaceChem is a game that's difficult to talk about without sounding like a major nerd, but I'll try.The game follows the story of the titular galactic chemical industry supercorporation, SpaceChem, through the eyes of a freshman reactor engineer. In itself that would sound like some of the most boring setups ever, but consider that SpaceChem universe is full of hostile giant alien wildlife, paranormal phenomena, and, worst of all, malfunctioning equipment, and it is all up to SpaceChem to deal with that stuff. You know, while synthesizing molecules.In the actual game, you operate special reactors that can manipulate separate atoms into place to synthesize molecules. You also get to build these reactors on the planets' actual surfaces and connect them with pipelines together to synthesize really crazy stuff, such as making water into plutonium. That plutonium is then used in nuclear warheads together with rocket fuel that you have to synthesize, and that warhead is launched in real time at a giant octopus attacking your facility, no questions asked. The game is not exactly easy, but it does a decent job introducing new mechanics exactly once you have mastered the previous one.SpaceChem is a crazy mix of really dumb fake chemistry, really smart solutions, really cool boss fights and a really bizarre-yet-thrilling story. You also get exclusive cosmetics for TF2 if you manage to solve special balls-hard australium puzzles, only for nobody to recognize your genius in that game.			"

												This game is the perfect puzzle game.It is brutally difficult with extremely challenging puzzles.The basis of the game is that you control a thing called waldos of blue and red colour to achieve an output atom structure based on the input atom structure.There are various puzzle elements like bonders,sensors,flip flops that are introduced to help you in your way with bonders bonding atoms,sesors sensing the atom and allowing you to take alternate paths and flip flops which are the most complicated puzzle element I have ever seen.***K flipflops.It is a highly rewarding fame once you figure the solution.It requires high critical thinking to come to the solution.It has absolutely nothing to do with chemistry with the atoms just forming a premise for the puzzles.I got more than the amount paid for the time I played the game.teh defense missions are one of the weak points and I gave up the game in the last 4 stages at a level called dont fear the reaper.but till that time I got more than my money's worth.the story is intriguing and is interesting and is displayed through text only.Highly recommended if you like to solve puzzles.Highly frustrating but equally highly rewarding.

												Congratulations!  You’re hired as a reaction engineer for SpaceChem Industries, the galaxy’s leading chemical supplier.  You’re going to be shipped off to far-flung worlds, harnessing their resources to generate the molecules that our space-faring society requires.  SpaceChem is a game about molecules.  No, that’s not right.  It’s a game about programming.  Well, that isn’t exactly true either.  SpaceChem is a game where you will take an impossible-seeming assignment, deconstruct it and build an incredibly complex engine to complete it, one bit at a time.  This is a game of puzzles, of organic problem solving, of creativity.In the most boring terms possible, here’s what you do in SpaceChem.  Take input molecules, break them down or combine them, and then output a target molecule.  Your “waldos” can manipulate the molecules on the board, but you have limited space to work in.  After a few easy introductory levels, timing and layout become incredibly important to your success.The best thing about this game is how open-ended it is.  There is no “correct” way to solve each level.  You could solve it with a small number of instruction symbols.  Or you could strive to limit the cycle time of your reactor.  Either way is valid, but you will hardly ever be able to minimize everything in one single solution.  When you finally do conquer a puzzle, you will see your scores compared to the entirety of the playerbase.  How did someone solve that level in less than 1000 cycles?!  It took me hours to figure out how to solve it in 3000!  You could revisit the problem again and try tweaking your reactors (as all of your solutions are saved when you finish them), or you could jump into the next problem right away.The soundtrack is both familiar, and entirely new.  Its’ epic soaring highs and quiet methodical moments are both uplifting and encouraging, but it doesn’t distract  from the matters at hand.The visuals are likewise very well thought-out.  This feels like an industrial console, and is likewise very simple and it is mostly very easy to grok what is going on.  This is critical, as your understanding of how the different objects interact and the sequence they will perform is your only hope of debugging your solution.SpaceChem is not easy.  In fact, it is one of the most difficult games I’ve ever played.  I couldn’t even beat the last few levels without looking on youtube for hints on how to set up my reactors.  But, it is not punishing.  Instead you feel joy whenever a little part of your setup finally starts working, and when you manage to finally get that last piece into place, its like you toppled an empire single-handed.If you have experience programming, or want to try your hand at it, SpaceChem teaches you the most important skills that you’ll require.  Not syntax or coding.  But trial-and-error, debugging, and breaking a problem into smaller parts.  If you think you can crack some of the toughest puzzles in video games, this is for you.			"

												This game is wonderful. Chances are if you're this far down in the reviews you have an idea of how this game works. If you don't, basically you use puzzle pieces to program machines that do chemistry. For every puzzle, there is no one solution,  you are limited only by the rules and your creativity as to what will work. You will spend hours trying to figure out one puzzle, but when you figure it out, there are few feelings better than that one of accomplishment the game creates.The game runs absolutely fine, of course, it's really not very demanding, so if you have a lower end PC and need to waste umpteen hours of your life, this can be your game.If you like puzzles, or programming, or chemistry, or running headlong into challenges, difficulty be damned, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.

												I did it.I beat this game.It only took me 6 years.Look at my time spent. That's how thorough this game forces you to be for just the campaign.The game is based around very basic programming and chemical principles, and involves you taking chemicals as inputs and transforming them into desired outputs. More difficult puzzles involve you using multiple sequences like this in tandem to power different devices to defeat some kind of boss.It may start out simple, but by the end it gets obscenely complexThe level of catharsis is proportional to the elegance of your solution, but even a brute-forced, less elegant approach will still warrant a satisfying sigh of relief for a job well done.All in all a great and very challenging puzzle game. While it may help a bit, you don't need a high level of mastery over chemistry to understand the game--that said it'll help teach you some basic principles. Buy if you're looking for a challenge.

												The most satisfying puzzle game I have ever played. I found the mechanics kinda difficult to grasp at the beginning but the basic principles are fairly easy to understand. Basically, you are building molecules out of atoms (who would have guessed). You start the game with one reactor that has 2 ""circuits"" in it, you can modify shape of these circuits and put different commands on them that will input/output atoms, grab them, bond them together, you can also rotate the molecules and do other stuff with them that I don't know about yet since I am not too far into the game.Later on, you will be given multiple reactors that can all be ""programmed"" separately giving the game a whole new level. For instance, you can have one reactor that will be used to brake bonds between atoms, then it will output them to another reactor that will bond them together with different atoms to form the molecule that you need. Now all of this sounds like you need a degree in chemistry and physics to be able to play the game but that is absolutely not the case. It's all logical, you don't need to know absolutely anything about chemistry or any other science.What some people may dislike about this game is that it ramps up the difficulty fairly quickly but a nice thing is that all the solutions are always saved and you can revisit previous levels to go over the basics again, experiment or improve your designs. Because unlike many other puzzle games where you are merely trying to find the single solution that the developers invented, in Spacechem there are hundreds if not thousands of solutions to every level and there is even online workshop kind of thing where you can download player-created levels and also upload your own (I hope that's what it's for, I have never actually used it :D), giving the game a HUGE replay value. I can imagine sinking hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this.Even though I am not very good at puzzle games and I doubt I will ever finnish this one because the difficulty gets absolutely ridiculous in later levels from what I've seen on youtube, I have to recommend Spacechem. It's extremely original, challenging, satisfying and fun. What more could you possibly ask of a puzzler? It even has a story! I haven't really followed it too much but it's there and sometimes you get a story-related mission like the one I recently got where I had to destroy a giant bulldozer closing in on our base by filling some tanks with methane causing them to explode in it's face!

												SpaceChem is an extremely difficult puzzle game that has players think like programmers in designing ""reactors"" that turn chemicals into others on an atomic scale. Two ""waldos"" move along tracks you design and execute commands on those tracks. There are several different commands and new mechanics that are implemented as you play.There are three game ""modes"" in the main story: ""Research"", where you work within one reactor; ""Production"", where you use multiple reactors; and ""Defense"", essentially ""Production"", but with added commands and boss fights. Throughout the main game, the player is told a story of a protagonist who joins SpaceChem, a company that produces chemicals, as they learn of its dark secrets.The game is simple at first, even up to the third world, but then one hits this game's learning cliff. Where it seems the puzzles can't possibly get more difficult, they do. Exponentially. It took me over a year to beat this game (though I played on and off times), and that was just the main story. SpaceChem has loads of user-created puzzles (I believe over 100) that further test your knowledge of the game. Your solve times are also ranked against other players on histograms. SpaceChem also has a full and powerful level editor and ways to upload your own puzzles. The community is great too, although it has been less active.There's just so much to do in this game - you'll find yourself spending hours just solving or optimising single puzzles. Nothing beats the euphoria you'll get from finally beating a puzzle you've been stuck on.Overall, SpaceChem is worth the full asking price as an excellent design-oriented puzzle game. It even has large discounts on it and its DLC very often, and trading cards to go with it. If you're a programmer or enjoy programming, or you just want to get into Zachtronics games, SpaceChem is definitely the way to go.			"

												I did it.I beat this game.It only took me 6 years.Look at my time spent. That's how thorough this game forces you to be for just the campaign.The game is based around very basic programming and chemical principles, and involves you taking chemicals as inputs and transforming them into desired outputs. More difficult puzzles involve you using multiple sequences like this in tandem to power different devices to defeat some kind of boss.It may start out simple, but by the end it gets obscenely complexThe level of catharsis is proportional to the elegance of your solution, but even a brute-forced, less elegant approach will still warrant a satisfying sigh of relief for a job well done.All in all a great and very challenging puzzle game. While it may help a bit, you don't need a high level of mastery over chemistry to understand the game--that said it'll help teach you some basic principles. Buy if you're looking for a challenge.

												This game is like an on/off relationship.I finished it though and I feel as though my IQ must have doubled in the process, that is: It isn't easy and it's difficutly is most certainly beyond ""average hard"".The spatial restrictions and limitation of other resources force you to actually think and come up with concise solutions.I found the interactive boss fights really refreshing and fun, especially the final level.I recommend, to those who are patient and seek a (serious) challenge.To beat this game you may have to think a day about and sleep a night over a problem once in a while.You may have to take a week long break to forget about a level and give it a fresh try once in a while.10/10 would browse the forums after beating the game all by myself and not using youtube to read about people complaining how difficult and frustrating this game is and how they didn't manage to finish it without looking up every other level on youtube just to boost my ego again.

												The single best puzzle game I've ever played. 100%ing it without peeking at solutions was a true tour de force, but once you beat the final level in the main campaign getting the rest of the achievements is definitely doable. The game does require you to leave puzzles and come back to them with a fresh head, and quite often throughout the day I would find myself thinking of possible ways to solve a puzzle or another.It's easy to jump in and out of the game, which means one doesn't need to set time ahead for a session, so it's pretty useful for people without too much free time on their hands. Unlike most other puzzle games, SpaceChem admits open ended solutions, the player does not have to double guess the designer's intentions, and not finding a solution is never caused by poor signposting -- one of the main frustrations with regular puzzle games.

												One of the best and most interesting puzzle-type games I've ever played. It starts off quite simple and naturally builds a lot of depth as more elements are added and as you discover more creative ways to use what you already have. The levels have no fixed solution and the amount of flexibility and freedom you have is staggering, so you're left to just find the best solution you can, without being railroaded into some design the developer thought of, like in so many other games.

												More like programming than like gaming, this game got me asking myself MANY times: why in heaven do I still playing this?! Probably because of the sense of accomplishment? I'm not sure. I hope I will figure out at some point, but I totally love it.You use a fictional machine to build an output, by disassembling/splitting/manipulating a given input. It happens to be molecules and atoms, but it could as well be sheeps and dogs, who cares? The difficulty of the game scales exponentially. There is 0 luck, 0 dexterity, just pure logic, so you can only blame yourself for failing. Under the hood, this is an ""algorithm building game"".The achievements are mostly progress-related, with few exceptions, but trust me: they are DIFFICULT. Don't trust the completion rate you see on Steam page, many people look the solution online.			"

												If you can beat the game by yourself without looking at youtube solution at all, then congraz you are officially a ♥♥♥♥ing genius. Don't play this if you are not into puzzle game or you know you aren't smart enough (a.k.a stupid), else you will probably end up smashing your PC.It only requires a very basic knowledge of chemistry...basically the game has almost nothing to do with chemistry. (Anyway if you failed your chemistry test paper, most likely you will fail at this ultra complex puzzle game as well lol)The tutorial in this game is totally useless, I have to figure out everything by my self. However if you are good in programming skills and have some basic knowledge on chemistry, you will have no problem in the begining, until you reach those final stages where you are going to cry for mama. Upon solving the puzzle there will be a graph comparing the stats between you and other players, this is the moment where you will realize how dumb you are, how in the hell is it possible to solve that ♥♥♥♥ in less than 300 cycles when my solution has 3000 cycles!? TL;DRThe best and hardest puzzle game I've ever played.Recommended for those who want to kill their brain cells, if you have a tumour in your brain, it will probably die too.			"

												I expected SpaceChem to be a cerebral game, and it delivered. What I didn't expect was for it to be so damned hard. I'm only about 25% through the missions, and some of them take an hour or more to complete. Finishing the game will an 80 hour task.SpaceChem is fun, if you like logic and programming puzzles. I'm hesitant to recommend it, because I know many people won't enjoy this. I think, though, that if you like this kind of game, you know who you are, and you'll find SpaceChem to be both entertaining and deliciously unforgiving.There are some nice non-game features, like leaderboards, in-game video recording (for Youtube!) and creating forum signatures based on your progress. One side effect of the videos, though, is that people seem to be looking up solutions on Youtube and duplicating them. You can tell by looking at the leadersboards. Why would anyone play this way? I dunno.Anyway, I won't be finishing this soon, but I won't be uninstalling it, either!			"

Might be the reasons stopping you from exploring & enjoying this gameFirst 5 levels""A bit too simple, is this really fun?""""Just grade 7 chemistry. Real-life reactions don't work that way. It's more tedious than difficult and I don't see how it's educational.""but the well-written story keeps me going :)Around level 8 or so""Woah the difficulty rise is a bit steep. I can't figure it out. I feel dumb & not exactly motivated to solve""↑ On hindsight that level isn't particularly hard, but this game is minimalistic. Minimalism gives it more possibilities. Also it doesn't give you any clues so you can think independently, explore around freely and have more fun when you discover a certain idiom of symbol arrangement on your own.The only problem is it might bore you before you ""get"" this game.When I just got into this game, I've no idea how certain arrangements are possible---like multiple entries within 1 run, or overlapping pipelines, so it takes a long time to arrive at the solution---outside the box thinking takes a bit of wrestling.Once I get to the 3rd & 4th planet, this game is pretty fun.It's challenging. It's getting addictive. If I beat a level but my solution isn't exactly neat, I'll replay the level.The game also starts showing more variations in gameplay.The mid and later portions of this game really gets difficult and tedious.I'm not there yet. I'll see if it loses me anywhere, or if it'd be both brain-wracking and fulfilling fun at the same time.			"

												Spacechem has one of the worst tutorials ever. It doesn't really help much in terms of teaching you the controls or how to play the game or the concepts that you need to think about to solve the puzzles. It even unintentionally teaches you some bad habits that unnecessarily clutter up your solutions and make things harder on yourself.However it's still an amazing puzzle game if you're willing to put the effort into it. While many puzzle games are designed to require a very specific order of steps to solve them, Spacechem is more of a sandbox. You work on your own to learn new mechanics hands on through experimentation, then you can try to think about how best to apply the concepts with meticulous planning or just try to work through it with trial and error and  gradually refining your solution until you find something that works. And as long as it works, it doesn't really matter how efficient your solution is (though you can always try to improve your work). So maybe the tutorial being bad isn't as big a deal as it might seem at first (assuming it doesn't turn you off the game completely).			"

												Space Chem is a puzzle without being a very obvious puzzle. In fact, you don't even need to know any chemistry, as it manages to blend science fiction with chemicals to make a very interesting game. Use ""waldoes"" to take apart chemicals and molecules and reassemble them to spec, with the the parts colliding, and try to do it wtih the fewest steps, parts, and so on. The game gets fiendishly difficult in the final few levels, when you have to swap parts from molecule to molecule using very limited means. The lack of hint system, IMHO, is this game's only weakness, but it also encourages some VERY creative (and seemingly head-slappying d'oh! what didn't I think of that) solutions. Search for some Youtube videos on this and see some of the more ingenious solutions out there.			"

												One of the most challenging puzzle games I've ever played. Most logical, that's for sure - it isn't chemistry, it's pure programming, creating algorithms. Each level has multiple ways to complete, almost always there's more efficient way and sometimes finding even one is very hard. The reward for completing the level? More difficult level! And a lot of satisfaction - of course as long as you won't look at the leaderboards. I've kept this game installed for almost three years, planning to finish it one day - because giving up, deleting SpaceChem wasn't an option. I was returning to some difficult, unsolved levels after months of not playing, totally forgetting previous ideas. I was making sketches and notes when not playing. And finally I've completed last level. Now I can return to previous ones and try to optimize my solutions. Or try all community levels. With SpaceChem there's always another puzzle to solve.			"

												Easily the best Puzzle game I've ever played.On each level the player is required to *create* a solution rather than just find the way the developers intended  like in many puzzle games.  This makes the gameplay compelling and rewarding because each solution is very much the player's own.The game is seriously challenging too, starting off with some easy levels so you get the hang of things, but quickly ramping up to missions that require complex solutions that actually take planning and ingenuity. For puzzle fans the game is well worth its normal price tag.  For everone else, at least try out the demo; the demo in itself is a decent length and will definitely make you decide whether this game is for you or not.			"

												Incredible game, especially for someone who loves programming like me. I've devoted 70+ hours playtime to it and I'm still not done playing it. I'm really proud of myself for having solved all the assignments except for the last one on my own - that one needed an intervention from a guide because my solution required way too much manual work. I also felt a bit silly when I found out you can bond / fuse an element while simply passing through the respective zone - I thought you had to drop it there first. There is also a bug with the ResearchNet achievements: all of them popped up at the same time as soon as I solved one published assignment. This is another thing I loved about this game though: you can make your own assignments and publish them.			"

And I'm sure dozen other games that just now I cannot name.Try waking up middle of the night with a numbed hand and in fever after spending 8 hours of playing SpaceChem. Still in sleep brain does funny things when it tries to solve the puzzle of how to get the hand working again. I learned I need to connect red input to red output to move my hand again.			"

												Earlier on today I activated the steam version of this, and thought I'd write a review.  Alas One needs five minutes of play time registered to play, so didn't I go and boot it up and play about for a bit.  This being my first time playing it on steam, didn't I see my friends records for levels, and didn't I go try and beat them.  And it's several hours later now.  But I certainly don't think they were hours wasted.  I didnt' even play that far in this time - just the first two worlds, but really enjoyed optimising my solutions to try match those of people on my friends list.This is one of my favourite games.

												Here’s a game I don’t like, but actually feel bad about not liking.SpaceChem is a puzzle game in which you have to create chemical compounds inside reactors. To be more precise, your job is to create procedures that assemble those compounds - yes, assemble. It’s not so much a game about chemistry as it is about creating factory lines, or concurrent programs.The concept behind the game is nothing short of brilliant, and I don’t think there’s a single game in the market remotely like it. I was taken by it in the first few hours. After that, however, the difficulty ramped up considerably, and I found myself taking way too long to figure out a single solution.That’s my problem with the game, it’s just too complicated for its own good. You have to spend massive amounts of time on details trying to make the solution work, and forget about the story because of how much time goes by between scenes. It ends up feeling like a job, not a diversion.Sometimes, I wish I could have gotten into it. I admire people who play this game well. In fact, I spent a lot of time at Spacechem.net trying out different solutions for levels, completely taken by how brilliant they were. But I saw no joy in trying to figure them out myself.I guess SpaceChem can be compared to EVE Online in this regard. It’s a game that’s really fun to watch unfold, but only the most patient and dedicated can actually play. If you’re in that group, good, buy it, but if you’re like me, skip it. There’s not much for you here.			"

												I definitely recommend this game if you like puzzles/programming. Each level you have to construct a kind of flow-chart to convert one type of molecule to another, but you only have so much space to work with and can't have things collide with one another!It can be very challenging, but there are lots of solutions available online if you do find yourself really stuck on one level. There are also hundreds of levels made by the community that give the game a huge lifespan. Just be careful because it can become a huge timesink!Overall I rate it 9/10			"

												Spacechem is a very demanding game.  It asks you, the player, to be creative and logical, to come up with your own answers for seemingly-intractable problems.  How well you receive the game will depend on how much you enjoy this type of challenge.If you get stuck on the main storyline, your only real recourses are to 1. keep hammering at it, 2. search out a video of how someone else did it for inspiration, or 3. take a break and try some of the side-missions.  These are available in the 'research net' section, and are user-created challenges released periodically.  They can also be undertaken in any order you wish.The only strikes against the game are:  Some features are not fully explained in terms of how they interact, so you have to do a bit of experimentation.  The working space and other limitations can be a real bear in some levels (i.e.. if you just had a bit more room to breathe, it would be a lot less frustrating).  They will frequently introduce some cool new feature in one mission series, show you how to use it, test you on it, then abandon it going forward.  You'll come to a level and think ""ok, I just have to set this up with some switches/sensors/whatever, and I'll be good to..  they took those out?!

												This is probably one of the best puzzle games I've played in my entire life. It is also one of the most difficult games I've played and I suck at it terribly.Basic premise is to program little robots on a constrained tilegrid (one action per grid) to turn atoms and molecules into different atoms and molecules by combining them, breaking them down and whatnot.Trust me it's more exciting than it sounds. You build your paths and actions, and see what breaks. You fix that, and see what 5 other things break. Hours later you have this massively elaborate thing, but it works, you made it, and you're proud. It's a satisfaction of your own work that you don't see much in games. It makes you feel like a genius mastermind once you have a puzzle solved and your solution running smoothly, only to have the game throw another curveball at you in the next one.			"

												Spacechem is absolutely beautiful. It manages to capture the magic of computer programming and make its joys accessible to a wider audience.Let me talk about actual programming for a minute. Programming is 90% problem-solving, 9% frustration, and 1% elation over the feeling of dominance. You start with a goal in mind; creating a program for a specific function. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the computer to do what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it, and find out it doesn't work. That's where the frustration comes in. You tweak your code, you run, it fails again. Lather, rinse, repeat about once per ten lines of code, then...VOILA! IT WORKS! It's a great feeling that I can't possibly describe sufficiently.Spacechem's gameplay follows the exact same process. You start with a goal in mind; taking given input molecules and turning them into given output molecules. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the game what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it and find out something went horribly wrong. You tweak the commands, run it again, fail again, repeat again, until eventually...SUCCESS! YOU ARE WINRAR! You feel like a total bada**.			"

												Simply the best puzzle game I have ever played. A modern 'The Incredible Machine'. If you want to think, play this game.Presentation: The Story is hilarious, if ultimately unimportant. The UI is clean and simple for the most part.The gameplay is the heart of the game, in the puzzle solving. The puzzles curve well from easy in the beginning to mind-bending towards the end, not to mention the Research Net that's continually adding new puzzles. And beyond just solving them, the game challenges you to optimize your solutions in both speed and parts used, with online leader-boards for comparison.The visuals are clean and simple, almost retro in how spartan they are. Nothing stands in the way of the 'puzzle' feel. Outside of the game board, it maintains a consistent, almost whimsical aesthetic. But don't come here looking for high quality 3D graphics, there simply aren't any.The sound effects are largely very basic beeps and boops. The music is alright, but isn't particularly memorable, nor does it add greatly to the experience. I actually had muted mine early on, and forgot the game even had music.In conclusion, this is everything a puzzle game needs to be, and little more. If you enjoy solving abstract puzzles, the game-play will carry this game, and you can completely overlook the points lost in other areas. There's a demo available, so there's no reason not to give it a try.			"

												SpaceChem is an excellent puzzle game that demans more from its players than many standard titles in this genre. It  requires spatial design, layout construction, coordinating of various components, and production output among other facets. It requires its players to build an assembly line to bond chemicals in various designs and then export them to either a load bay, or to the next factory in line, in which that design will be incorporated into a production that will result in an additional design. It can be wonderfully consuing and engaging for the right audience, and an infuriating nightmare for those who don't want to dive into the more challenging levels. It's fun for awhile, and it's excellent in its design, though it's not something I want to spend too much time with, though those who enjoy various forms of engineering will find hours of enjoyment in this game. Highest recommendations for those who enjoy engineering puzzles with a heavy science bias, while others who wish to dabble in that game space may enjoy it for a bit and then look elsewhere.			"

												There was a bit of time in 2011-2015 where I was fully obsessed with this game and the obsession came to a head in Late September 2014 when after 2 months of designing and running reactors on paper, an iPad and an Android tablet (usually simultaneously) where I finally beat the last level of the main campaign from scratch with absolutely no outside assistance. (Took a few months to recover before uploading my designs to Steam.)I own SpaceChem and 63 Corvi on Android, iOS, and PC (Both on steam and DRM free). 3 SpaceChem t-shirts, all of the swag you can imagine that was created by Zachtronics for the game and I have easily over 4000 hours played across all platforms (not to mention the ridiculous amount of time I spent doodling and planning on chemistry lab graph paper).With that out of the way here's a review:Warning, this game is not for hardcore puzzle game fans.This game is specifically for those who need to be obsessed with puzzles to the point of tryharding.Have you ever thought you could beat Tetris?Have you ever actually beaten Tetris?That's what playing SpaceChem feels like.SpaceChem is incredibly tedious and it will cause you mental anguish to the point where you might have a nervous breakdown. Need proof?Here's the statistics of people who actually complete the game: (Without Guides)[puu.sh]Image courtesy: http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem-statistics-time/You'll note that the further players get in the game the less they want/are able to finish it.In other words it is truly an incredibly humbling experience insofar as measuring your own intelligence. It's like an IQ test, if you apply yourself you will succeed, if you're haphazard about it (Like using guides or other players solutions) you will still succeed but it will make it much much easier than if you had just tried on your own.Most levels in this game have hundreds of millions of potential ways to solve EACH SECTION of the puzzle. If you try you will complete every level it is just a matter of designing your solutions.I know my summary score and my personal score don't add up, but this game is a 5/5. it is a masterpiece and just because the audio/story/visuals aren't ""the best"" it is a legendary game and deserves no less than a perfect score.Audio: 3/5 - AdequateGraphics: 4/5 - Sensible and useful but still a little confusing at points.Story: 2/5 - Not really inspiring or terrible but below average for necessity. Gameplay: - 5/5 - Legendary comprehensive chemistry factory game.Overall: 5/5 - I wouldn't give back the thousands of hours I've spent playing this game.

The graphics are simple and straight-to-the-point, and thus hold up very well for a game 5 years old as of now. The music can get repetitive, but is nice enough. Don't expect realistic chemestry, but the puzzles are challenging and satisfying to complete.

												Definitely recommended with a couple caveats:- Some puzzles will take hours/days to solve. You will be thinking about these puzzles during your spare time. You may even start keeping/carrying around a notepad to sketch possible solutions on. - You WILL get very frustrated. However, my advice is to NOT look up the answers, because again, the satisfaction you'll get from solving a level you've worked at for days is worth it. This game has caused more frustration than any game I can remember since the NES era. It's THAT hard. The difficulty spikes something fierce after only a couple levels. However, I can say that very few, if any, games have caused me to feel so satisfied from solving one of the levels. If you like solving puzzles no matter how high the difficulty, look no further than this game.  "

  You'll Enjoy This Game If You Like:   Figuring things out for yourself   Chemistry   Logical puzzles   Getting atoms to do your bidding This game is a great time sink but one that is fulfilling. You will feel as if you are achieving something, which I believe is mostly due to the game's academic feel. You don't need to be a chemist or an engineer to enjoy it but you definitely need a logical mind to tackle puzzles beyond the first couple of levels.One of the first things you'll realise is that the tutorials alone will not fully explain what you have to do. You'll really need to take a step back and review the UI, hover over items to figure out exactly what they do, and actually invest some time in a bit of trial and error to see how things work in practice.You will find yourself spending a lot of time, especially later in the game to solve levels but it won't feel like a waste after you finally crack the problem that's been preventing you from completing the game.Take it slow in the beginning, get your bearings and master those atoms.

												This game is only for ""Puzzle-masters"". It's just insanely difficult (if you don't use guides ofc, but I'm glad I didn't). I stopped at the end on the fourth planet, because I kinda had enough of it. I'll switch to something more relaxing, cause this game trains mind better then math, and then I'll return. I don't wanna talk about the game, but the only thing I'll mention is that you can use your own music while playing which was really important to me. Original sountrack isn't bad, but your choice of music will make things easier. I didn't follow storyline, so I cannot judge it.Anyway, all puzzlers, I should say need to check SpaceChem out! Its real price is 10$ and I think you better wait for a special offer, but paying 10$ for this is not a waste of money, I repeat, if you enjoy puzzle games!FINAL ESTIMATE: 9.5/10 "

												The player takes control of an unnamed undergraduate at the University of Chicago, working as a technician for a scientific team that discovers an alternative, low-cost, pollution-free fuel source. When one of the chief scientists is murdered and the invention stolen, The player (voiced by Gary Oldman) and his physicist lab assistant Lily Sinclair (Ivanka trump) are framed for it and have to flee for their lives, with the FBI, CIA and other involved parties in close pursuit. Paul Shannon (Gilbert gottfried), The Player's mentor, is the director of a scientific company which has commercial interests in the invention. The Player and Lily set out to find the stolen invention and hopefully clear themselves of the false charges. My Take: A formulaic action shooter with some impressive set pieces marred by lackluster writing. Regardless, it wasn't the best game nor the worst game ever made.

												Now folks that know me know that I like me a good puzzle. I had actually discovered this after getting a hold of TIS-100 (another programming puzzle game that I recommend). Someone was nice enough to get this for me from my wishlist, and I've been enjoying this for quite some time. Basic premise is this: you program what goes on inside of a ractor to produce certain atoms of molecules. Programming is also limited by how much space is in the reactors as well as the paths you use. It only sounds complicated, but you start getting the hang of things in the first levels. Later levels throw in other devices, multiple reactors, and so on.Some of the problems can really get you scratching your head, too. I have actually seen some people post their solutions on YouTube to some of these puzzles, and then stared slack-jawed at how these guys make all those atoms DANCE.The story line is interesting enough, the graphics are nothing fancy (and believe me, the KISS Principle works just fine here), and the background music is a nice listen.The replay value here for the most part is just seeing how you can streamline your processes... less instructions, shorter paths, fewer cycles... although outside of the DLC, there is a seperate set of puzzles that have been submitted that are some real doozies.One warning, though: a good chunk of solutions posted on YouTube may not work now. I'm guessing that there have been some tweaks to the way some reactions behave, so folks can't always use those glitches to their advantage anymore. Still, others might see that as a new challenge to overcome.			"

You can find tips online however to help.That said once you get the hang of things you can literally spend hours, if not days, working on a single puzzle.  Then you can work on the puzzle some more, if you choose, to optimize it to use less symbols or time.I recommend the game because I like complex puzzles but if you are looking for something quick and easy ... keep looking.

The field is wide open for solutions, making them feel very personal. You use the provided tools to create and break down different chemicals at the atomic level. Your solution's efficiency is graphed against the other players who have completed the puzzle, which is a fun incentive to go back and optimize your solutions. Finally the game will record your solution and upload it to your Youtube account, through a very simple in-game process. Not a necessary feature but a very cool one. With a level editor on the way, and other gameplay expansions this game is absolutely worth the price.			"

												This game is one of the best i have ever played. Unfortunately i cannot play it any more, my mind spins with possible solutions for hours afterwards, keeping me from sleep. It is at heart a programming game, but disguised into chemistry machine building.  In fact you are building a network of mutlithreaded realtime processors. The programming aspect makes this into a ""sandbox"" pussle; you must fulfill the objectives, but there are an infinite amount of ways to do so. Afterwards you get a comparison with others that have played the level, and get to se how well you did versus them. The interesting part of that comparison is that it rates you on both processsing time and design simplicity, and in general you cannot do well in both. This will either leave you with a feeling of that you chose the right optimization or (as in my case) trigger competitive insanity.

												I got this game when it was being offered for free, and I must say, it is easily the most challenging puzzle game I own. Zachtronics, the creators of Ironclad Tactics, also made this game, and you can count on them to consistently deliver unique, fun, and challenging games.If you enjoy challenging puzzles - in particular, circuit-based ones, space themes, progressively challening levels (this is basically the Demon/Dark Souls of puzzlers), and pondering on what the solution is for hours (or even days) at a time, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are decent - you will mostly be looking at a grid with blue and red circuits, however, the detail put into the land, structures, and ""others"" (usually the end of every planet) is well-done. The music is very good. There is quite a bit of lore that provides the story if you are interested - it's also well-written.The controls are simple, as you can do everything with only the mouse. There is an option for using keyboard hotkeys, and I personally found it easier (and much faster) to use the hotkeys. The learning curve is moderate to extremely difficult - mostly depending on your understanding of circuitry (chemistry is actually not that important in the game, as you will be given instructions). The game does a very good job of presenting you with progressively more and more difficult scenarios, adding new mechanics at every planet. The tutorial is absolutely essential and will help you understand the basics of the game.Be advised, the game implements very strong scaffolding, so if you do not understand the mechanics in the earlier levels and resort to guides/walkthroughs, you will have an extremely difficult time completing the levels on your own. I recommend you take a look at some video walkthroughs only if you've been stuck for a long while, as there may also be a new mechanic you have not thought of yet. Admittedly, I had been stuck on a puzzle for over a week, so I finally gave in and looked for a solution online - I was then able to complete the next few puzzles with knowledge gathered from the stage I was stuck on (I had not fully understood the new mechanic that was introduced).The circuit puzzles all consist of constructing an element/compound with your two starting circuits (blue and red), and dropping them into the output section of the grid. There are many restrictions and a large variety of different ways to solve each level.Later, you will need to take care of production, so you will not only be mapping out circuits (red and blue), but you will also be building reactors - and attaching them to things with pipes. Even more later on, you will be presented with ""defense"" levels, where you must power weapons to fend off enemies. Overall, if you are looking for an extremely good challenge and like circuitry, give this game a try. It will tease your brain quite a bit, and you may or may not love it. If you are intimidated by circuitry-based puzzles (and a minimal amount of chemistry), you may want to pass on this one. Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												The player takes control of an unnamed undergraduate at the University of Chicago, working as a technician for a scientific team that discovers an alternative, low-cost, pollution-free fuel source. When one of the chief scientists is murdered and the invention stolen, The player (voiced by Gary Oldman) and his physicist lab assistant Lily Sinclair (Ivanka trump) are framed for it and have to flee for their lives, with the FBI, CIA and other involved parties in close pursuit. Paul Shannon (Gilbert gottfried), The Player's mentor, is the director of a scientific company which has commercial interests in the invention. The Player and Lily set out to find the stolen invention and hopefully clear themselves of the false charges. My Take: A formulaic action shooter with some impressive set pieces marred by lackluster writing. Regardless, it wasn't the best game nor the worst game ever made. If you're looking for a fast paced game that you don't have to think too much on, this is it.  8/10			"

												It's like molecular programming.  This is one of the most thoughtful puzzle games I've ever played.  A relaxing soundtrack, streamlined interface and the ability to play windowed are just icing on the cake.  Compete with the community for space or speed efficiency with your builds.The game is difficult to explain.  Essentially you are tasked with building reactors that combine atoms from the periodic chart into molecules that are shipped away.  You have various tools at your disposal to combine, split and fuse atoms and molecules.  The solutions vary greatly from task to task and the difficulty ramps up quickly.			"

												A most interesting puzzle game, SpaceChem uses the concept of atomic waldoes to turn inorganic chemistry into an interesting series of puzzles. The ability to ""do over"" when a reaction fails to work as anticipated is most welcome. This iteration also includes a back story, not necessary to the game but definitely interesting, offered as skippable text blocks between puzzles; and there is a free demo, to give you the flavour of the game if you're a little low on cash.

												Back in 2000, CogniToy, now defunct, released a strange game called Mind Rover: The Europa Project. This game was of a genre I call a programming puzzle game. The object was to build a little car to complete certain tasks. However, the only thing you could do is put sensors and switches on your car and wire them together creating a program. After that, the car would run the course and either succeed or fail based on your program. Others have tried but not succeeded the way Mind Rover did, at least not for me.Fast forward ten years and Indie studio Zachtronics Industries released SpaceChem. While the premise is different, the concept is the same: a programming puzzle game. In this game, you are a SpaceChem engineer whose goal is to program reactors to take input molecules and output other molecules. The goal is to create a reactor program that runs as efficiently as possible: fewest code instructions, fewest cycles and in production puzzles - fewest reactors.The screen is split into a grid 20 by 20 squares. On the left are two inputs (alpha and beta) 10 by 10 each on the right there are two outputs (psi and omega) 4 by 4 each. There are two waldo’s, one red and one blue, that execute your program. During every cycle, the waldo’s move one square along the drawn route and execute the action (some actions, such as rotation, take an extra cycle count), if any, in the square. Each square can have one action and one redirection for each color. Actions that you can do include getting an input from the input feed, clearing the output reactors, rotating a molecule, bonding (or de-bonding) molecules together, sync the waldos’ movement. One other rule - molecules cannot bang into each other. From there, you create the program to complete the task, run the program, tweak the program, and around and around until you are satisfied.Running through the campaign, there are several different modes: Research, Production, and Defense. In the research mode, you have one reactor in which to take the inputs and make the outputs. In production mode, you have a planet view in which there may be many inputs to many outputs. You have the ability to create multiple reactors (level dependant) and pipe them around the planet. In this case, the movement of molecules through the pipes costs one cycle count. The final mode is the last mode for each planet and is a modified production level in which there is a specific goal and sometimes a time limit. After you finish the campaign mode there are some other puzzles that can be completed for added challenge.In all modes except defense, there is a graph that shows the results of your program. This shows how many cycles it took, how many reactors (1 on Research puzzles), and how many symbols used (every redirect or input counts as one). The big kicker is that is shows where you stand versus other players, and here is where the ultimate tweaking and optimization comes in. Slight changes in order of operations, distance waldos need to move, which waldos are waiting during sync instructions all of these can have drastic changes to how fast your program executes.I don’t know what it is about this game, but there are a couple of layers of challenge for me. On the first level, I just want to get a solution. The learning curve is fairly steep and there isn’t a user manual. There are about 10 tutorial missions, and the research usually gives some hint as to things you may need to use in future missions, but the puzzle difficult ramps up fairly quickly. The second is to optimize my solution. Moving things around and changing the order of operations can shave cycles off as well as reducing the number of symbols. The next optimization is to watch the reactor and see if one of the waldos is spending too much idle time. If so, can it be doing another task. This is easier to do in research puzzles as there aren’t restrictions on inputs and outputs. However, in production puzzles the reactors must wait to be fed (which takes time) and output pipes can only hold so much material. These reactors may stall while waiting to complete an instruction and in doing so create a jam. As you progress, you learn little tricks to get things to work more efficiently. These can be used in earlier puzzles to greatly improve times on earlier puzzles.I know that this type of game isn’t for everyone, but I love getting into the game and tinkering and tweaking on puzzle solutions to make it 2 cycles faster (obviously more is better, but any little bit is a victory). If you are a fan of puzzle games or like programming (even better if you like both) then I would suggest giving SpaceChem a try			"

												The first impression that SpaceChem imposes on it's audience is one of boredom. Complex gameplay mechanics, insufficient instructions and a non-illustrated storyline (which looked like it attained quite some inspiration from a generic fanfic) is enough to bore even the most patient gamer. But behind all that, you can leave your fast-paced FPSes behind and take SpaceChem with an open mind, it's actually a rather interesting game once you scrape the surface and get to the inner layers. To be fair, I still don't quite get some of the in-game mechanics, and I'm starting to struggle on the second planet, but that's the purpose of a puzzle game. If a puzzle game is simple, it's not a puzzle game; it's a test to check your sanity. But anyways, this game may seem uninteresting and even dreadful at times, but it's honestly a well-thought out puzzle game that simply doesn't have enough shine on its surface to keep players on the game for more than 10 minutes. If you can dig past that dull surface and get into the heart of the game where the creative thinking comes alive, this game is certainly worth the time and effort.			"

Product received for free
												Now folks that know me know that I like me a good puzzle. I had actually discovered this after getting a hold of TIS-100 (another programming puzzle game that I recommend). Someone was nice enough to get this for me from my wishlist, and I've been enjoying this for quite some time. Basic premise is this: you program what goes on inside of a ractor to produce certain atoms of molecules. Programming is also limited by how much space is in the reactors as well as the paths you use. It only sounds complicated, but you start getting the hang of things in the first levels. Later levels throw in other devices, multiple reactors, and so on.Some of the problems can really get you scratching your head, too. I have actually seen some people post their solutions on YouTube to some of these puzzles, and then stared slack-jawed at how these guys make all those atoms DANCE.The story line is interesting enough, the graphics are nothing fancy (and believe me, the KISS Principle works just fine here), and the background music is a nice listen.The replay value here for the most part is just seeing how you can streamline your processes... less instructions, shorter paths, fewer cycles... although outside of the DLC, there is a seperate set of puzzles that have been submitted that are some real doozies.One warning, though: a good chunk of solutions posted on YouTube may not work now. I'm guessing that there have been some tweaks to the way some reactions behave, so folks can't always use those glitches to their advantage anymore. Still, others might see that as a new challenge to overcome.			"

												10/10This game has it all - brilliant design, fantasy science (more like space alchemy), a science fiction episodic story and absolutely brutal difficulty. If you love puzzles, you're in for a treat. Some of the later levels will set your brain on fire, easily taking an hour each (my total playing time is inaccurate).There are also many, many possible solutions to every problem, so you can really work things your own way. If you complete a difficult mission and check out other solutions on youtube, you might find there was a way to solve it 5x more efficiently, and it will blow you away. Note that the mechanics rely on loops, so you're essentially programming an assembly line.Last but not least, the music is great, which is good because you'll be listening to it a lot.			"

												SpaceChem is an engineering puzzle game, in that the puzzles are about figuring out how to build a machine to process objects rather than to directly find your way through what's already been placed there for you. If that sounds appealing, this is probably the puzzle game for you! Just as you're building machines, it's building you into a machine maker. There's very little in the way of filler, and virtually every assignment offers something new for the player to learn from and apply, which is excellent pacing. That can be a bit frustrating when you're stuck on one without other options available, but perseverance will win the day.Highly recommended for puzzle game enthusiasts and programmers.			"

												I used to teach chemistry on the community college level (two year pre university school for those not familiar with the US system) so I thought this game would be simple and non fun for me.  Bought it mostly to see if I could use it in teaching as most of my students were visual and I was not (verbal myself).  Installed and played now as saw I didn't have the cards for it (so holiday auction good for one thing at least though really valve - rather than focusing on nickel and diming those of us who use your system new games or dare I say it I think I do Half life 3?) and this is rather quite fun.  The chemistry is simple (Ag and F make silver flouride when bond together high school chemistry here in the us middle school I expect in Europe) the visual puzzles are not.  In the tutorial I am actually feeling acomplishment for figureing some out and beating friends to find better ways to do it.  When the chemistry picks up (large organic molecules requiring several reactors, having to worry about reaction conditions) this will be very challanging but fun.The story is even good - son wanting to go into a dangerous job partly because it is dangerous mother not wanting him to (but seriously crying when your ten year old tells you what they want to do with their life ... harsh and I hope not from creators experience).Bottom line want a game that will challange BOTH sides of your brain: visual, and analytical and still be fun?  Look no farther!To developers: Market this to chemistry teachers all levels - if I was still teaching chemistry would use though would take some creativity and maybe some modding to find ways to do it well.

												I am playing SpaceChem and I have got to say, I most definitely recommend it. I will admit I am not very far in to the game, I also have to say that SpaceChem is really as boring as dirt, I doubt it will keep my attention long, and I am easily entertained! So why then you ask am I so willing to recommend it? Pure and simply because of its difficulty of course! Not often will you find a puzzle game that is so ""simple"" yet so hard, I think alot of it comes from them giving you so many different ways to complete each puzzle. You dont actually have to know chemistry to play this game. I think this is because the game is more pseudo chemistry really, so dont be afraid to try it.Overall I have got to say, SpaceChem is a ""Simple Hard"" puzzle game, that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of puzzle games. It really does take a special kind of person to enjoy this game, and not get bored almost immediately though. So be warned, if your not good at, or not interested in puzzle games, this is a game you may want to stay away from. To everyone else though, go take a look, you may be surprised.			"

This leaves a lot of room to go back and tweak old designs which is incredibly tempting to do on old levels as you get better.Also, much to my surprise, it actually contains rather tricky 'boss levels'.

												Great indie puzzle game, and without much parallel from what I've seen.There were great puzzles in the actual game, and much more in the researchnet when you've finished the game. There isn't much actual chemistry in the game; it's used more as a basis for the puzzles. The storyline was good, the visuals were fine. The reason why this game stands out is the open-endedness of the puzzles; finding your own solution and improving upon it is the main thrill of this game, and the euphoria of completing a puzzle or optimizing your design to the most efficient possible is where this game gets its fun. There bell curves (usually) in the missions, which tell you how well your solution is compared to others.I've been told that this game is quite similar to programming, which may drive you away or towards this game. I find it more about making a machine and watching it work as it executes commands the way you programmed it.On the other side, I'd say that the graphics in the reactors themselves are rather bland, but I can excuse that as it would become too complex if it weren't bland. I'd prefer if the game had told me what you can do and what you can't do with the molecules (can't collide), and there are some hidden tricks which are not mentioned at all (bonder priority, especially, though particle smashing to a lesser extent as well). The music also may get a bit repetitive (I personally can't get tired of it though).Other than that, this game is quite an amazing puzzle game. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for an intellectual challenge.			"

A relaxing soundtrack, streamlined interface and the ability to play windowed are just icing on the cake.  Compete with the community for space or speed efficiency with your builds.The game is difficult to explain.  Essentially you are tasked with building reactors that combine atoms from the periodic chart into molecules that are shipped away.  You have various tools at your disposal to combine, split and fuse atoms and molecules.  The solutions vary greatly from task to task and the difficulty ramps up quickly.			"

												Now folks that know me know that I like me a good puzzle. I had actually discovered this after getting a hold of TIS-100 (another programming puzzle game that I recommend). Someone was nice enough to get this for me from my wishlist, and I've been enjoying this for quite some time. Basic premise is this: you program what goes on inside of a ractor to produce certain atoms of molecules. Programming is also limited by how much space is in the reactors as well as the paths you use. It only sounds complicated, but you start getting the hang of things in the first levels. Later levels throw in other devices, multiple reactors, and so on.Some of the problems can really get you scratching your head, too. I have actually seen some people post their solutions on YouTube to some of these puzzles, and then stared slack-jawed at how these guys make all those atoms DANCE.The story line is interesting enough, the graphics are nothing fancy (and believe me, the KISS Principle works just fine here), and the background music is a nice listen.The replay value here for the most part is just seeing how you can streamline your processes... less instructions, shorter paths, fewer cycles... although outside of the DLC, there is a seperate set of puzzles that have been submitted that are some real doozies.One warning, though: a good chunk of solutions posted on YouTube may not work now. I'm guessing that there have been some tweaks to the way some reactions behave, so folks can't always use those glitches to their advantage anymore. Still, others might see that as a new challenge to overcome.			"

Brain-breakingly difficult at certain points, but it has an incredibly well-organized learning curve; every challenge is one step ahead of the player.

												The first impression that SpaceChem imposes on it's audience is one of boredom. Complex gameplay mechanics, insufficient instructions and a non-illustrated storyline (which looked like it attained quite some inspiration from a generic fanfic) is enough to bore even the most patient gamer. But behind all that, you can leave your fast-paced FPSes behind and take SpaceChem with an open mind, it's actually a rather interesting game once you scrape the surface and get to the inner layers. To be fair, I still don't quite get some of the in-game mechanics, and I'm starting to struggle on the second planet, but that's the purpose of a puzzle game. If a puzzle game is simple, it's not a puzzle game; it's a test to check your sanity. But anyways, this game may seem uninteresting and even dreadful at times, but it's honestly a well-thought out puzzle game that simply doesn't have enough shine on its surface to keep players on the game for more than 10 minutes. If you can dig past that dull surface and get into the heart of the game where the creative thinking comes alive, this game is certainly worth the time and effort.			"

												10/10This game has it all - brilliant design, fantasy science (more like space alchemy), a science fiction episodic story and absolutely brutal difficulty. If you love puzzles, you're in for a treat. Some of the later levels will set your brain on fire, easily taking an hour each (my total playing time is inaccurate).There are also many, many possible solutions to every problem, so you can really work things your own way. If you complete a difficult mission and check out other solutions on youtube, you might find there was a way to solve it 5x more efficiently, and it will blow you away. Note that the mechanics rely on loops, so you're essentially programming an assembly line.Last but not least, the music is great, which is good because you'll be listening to it a lot.			"

												I don't like puzzle games in general because they're either too easy, or are pure pixel hunt, or involve ""guessing what the developer wants you to do."" But this game is different. This game feels like real world design challenges. This game feels like a combination of programming, proving geometric statements and (just a little bit, despite of its name) chemistry. This game's logic works like this: you have two loops running at the same time, each can carry out certain commands in their courses; your task is to time those commands so that they do the right thing at the right time, and in the end find a way to synchronize the two loops so that they can loop back to their oriignal starting point and the whole process resets. You have limited space to place your commands so you have to really think hard where you place them (like the steric hinderance effect in real world chemistry synthesis). Overall, a really, really fun, thought-provoking game.			"

												Works on wine-staging 1.9.1, as long as you drag away that box that says the game has crashed and just leave the window open. (EDIT: It seems to not be saving my progress. Dammit. Oh well, I guess I get to have more practice, then.)I've played a lot of programming puzzle games before. As a general rule, if you're teaching an aspect of computer science, it usually turns out fairly good, and if you're just teaching people how to bash directions into a small space, it usually sucks.And then you've got stuff like SpaceChem, RoboZZle, and Jahooma's LogicBox, which are a bit of both. And they turn out amazing.(There are other categories, although Hack 'n' Slash gets its own special category for pretending to teach you how to hack but you have to go through some cumbersome chores first and you get bored before you finish them. Avoid.)SpaceChem, from a computer science perspective, is a game about multithreading, and avoiding race conditions. Or something like that.From a non-compsci perspective, it's about moving atoms around, binding them together, and hoping you get the right results and also hoping they don't smash into each other.Either way, it's a puzzle game that holds your hand for a few tutorial levels and basically gives you the ""standard"" answer, and then leaves you to it. It has a rather sharp difficulty curve, but even if you're stumped on a later level, you can always go back to an earlier one and look at just how bad the ""standard"" solution you were given on a silver platter was, and improve on it.You can also compute compete against your friends to see who can solve a puzzle in the fewest number of cycles, or use the fewest number of symbols... or the fewest number of reactors for some of the later puzzles that are still early enough to be in the demo version.Did I mention there's a demo version? You should play it, and then if you like it (and I will make you like it) then you can throw your money at Zachtronics and get the full version.In short, SpaceChem is a really good programming puzzle game that teaches you the fun of dealing with race conditions, and there's more than one way to do each puzzle.

The field is wide open for solutions, making them feel very personal. You use the provided tools to create and break down different chemicals at the atomic level. Your solution's efficiency is graphed against the other players who have completed the puzzle, which is a fun incentive to go back and optimize your solutions.

You can find tips online however to help.That said once you get the hang of things you can literally spend hours, if not days, working on a single puzzle.

												A genuinely brilliant puzzle game, with a darkly funny plot, the occasional completely insane ""boss"" puzzle, and a slick interface. The underlying gameplay involves building automated systems to construct/deconstruct/reconstruct molecules from the constituent atoms, though no real understanding of chemistry is required. The game does an excellent job of teaching you the basics, then throwing an escalating series of complicating additional factors and new capabilities at you. It has a large number of ""meta puzzles"" in which you must link together individual reactors (each of which you design) to perform some larger and more complex task. It's very challenging, but in a rewarding way. There are no cheap tricks here, it's just a matter of thinking through what has to be done and how best to do it. The developers have supported this title to an extraordinary degree. It contains quite a bit of bonus content with more turning up all the time, and also supports user created puzzles.			"

												SpaceChem is a fascinating puzzle game about chemistry and logic.  The goal is to find creative ways of transporting and changing atoms using a variety of techniques.  It is said by some that is a more of a programming tutorial than a chemistry game, and I see what they mean.  I suppose some people might have difficulty grasping the basics of the game, but I think most experienced gamers shouldn't have a problem jumping in and learning how the game works.  The logic of the game reveals itself pretty quick, but the really interesting stuff is when you have to figure out for yourself how to solve things.  There's a lot of trial and error, and the solutions can be pretty impressive.			"

												I can't recommend SpaceChem to everyone, but for those with a background or interest in science, particularly chemical reactions, or for those who like trying to find the most efficient solution for puzzles that have many possible solutions, it's definitely worth checking out. The early tutorials fall a little short which makes getting into the game more difficult, but once you get the hang of it the gameplay is very addicting. It's especially satisfying to complete a puzzle, then think up an even better solution that takes a completely different approach.Individual challenges can be completed in 15 minutes or less and can be saved when partially complete, so the game is good for quick breaks and doesn't demand a lot of time (though you can easily lose hours absorbed in it as well).

												Spacechem. a very simple puzzle/logic game that is so simple its surprisingly NOT a flash game... and despite its name it has very little to do with actual Chemistry OR Space. =p it just uses both for visual themes and to provide a backdrop for the storyline. however if you still hate science in all ways you may find that its usage of the atoms to be dislikable at best. nonetheless even if Steven Hawking or Einstein or even Michio Kaku played this game they would find their science expertise as not a factor to actually play the game. =p you dont need to know science to play. but if you do know it and you love science then its just an added plus as you smile to yourself.its simplicity however is trumped by its sheer mindnumbingly difficult puzzles. although it starts out easy it only progresses to become more and more difficult to the point where your problem solving skills are put to the greatest test. overall score i give a 10/10. this game although has 2d graphics it doesnt need anything beyond that as anything more would detract from the game. not enhance it.gameplay starts with the simple stuff and has a nice progression showing you the basic rules at the start. by the time you reach the third area that tutorial for the most part ends, only showing up when something new comes into play. however every level is for the most part the same with just a new twist on the solution. the game makes it so that when you beat a level you feel smart. it then shows you the rankings and you know just how ""smart"" you really are.the soundtrack admittedly is just 3 songs and although they dont stand out, that is for the most part a plus as your full attention should be on the puzzle at hand and not on some blaring soundtrack that has no ability to fit with the game like many flash games. overall very nice to listen to if you do choose to listen. at times upbeat at other times dark.story: although there is fairly very little it is a nice addition to the game and just adds some depth that is lacking in a few games of this genre. although i havent beaten it the character is at least remotely connectable and not just some random silent protaginist that the creator just makes it seem as if its you in only the partial, this is even IF you dont see very much of him except once in a while. thankfully you can view all previous bits of story so it can be reread to refresh your memory.overall id highly recommend this game to almost everyone. ""almost"" being the keyword. if you hate anything related to science this game is not for you as the games theme is very much related, in addition if you ABSOLUTELY HATE being put to the test with each level then again this game is not for you as each level after the tutorial just becomes difficult, even IF you know what your doing it still takes time to figure out the puzzle. Logic is a must for this game. otherwise youll NEVER be able to beat it. even then after logging 19 hours on it im only just now reaching the 15th level. in other words about 20% through the game.pros: simple, completely logic based, nice progression.cons: almost nothing except the difficulty may not be for some.

												Spacechem... Oh, Spacechem.. Where to start!?Tax your grey matter to it's limit!Do you hear the words ""Puzzle game"" and get a general feeling of dis-interest? Do you think about chemistry and then immediately stop thinking about chemistry? Fear not! Spacechem is one of THE MOST unique puzzle experiences you will EVER have! Don't be afraid of it's chemistry topic, either - For while the compounds you'll be breaking down and assembling are real, with appropriate atomic bonds, you don't need to understand a lick of chemistry to play.The puzzles involve you designing the interior of atomic reactors, using robotic manipulators called ""Waldos"" that move on paths you specify and obey commands you place on those paths to grab, rotate, bond & de-bond atoms and a host of other actions to transform raw input compounds - one molecule at a time - into the matter you need.The game is free of bugs and has high production values. There are enough levels to keep you working for a LONG time, split into different chapters taking place on different planets with the beginning of each chapter introducing a new reactor [game] mechanic. The levels get devilishly difficult and due to it's nature, there are almost infinite ways to solve any puzzle. As long as you output the correct compunds to the waiting shipping barge, exactly the steps you take to create that compound are entirely up to you!This game will tax your problem-solving, logic and lateral-thinking. Highly recommended for those with an above-average IQ and highly recommended for anyone who wants to sink their teeth into a real mental challenge.			"

But you need no knowledge about algorithms, mathematics or programming, its fairly simple and some trial and error is (at least for me) mostly more useful than thinking ahead too much ;)The learning curve is quite nice, and the replayability is great due to online leaderboards for the fastest or most efficient algorithms.

This review recommends Zachtronics' Spacechem as a phenomenally well-designed puzzle game with a great atmosphere, sure to challenge and addict.[. . .] No true fan of puzzle games should go through life without having experienced this title. Spacechem is elegant in its game-design simplicity and staggering in its gameplay complexity. This game is a satisfying yet relentless challenge, and its virtues do not end there.

												Different people have different tastes, and although SpaceChem is extremely popular, I find it extremely confusing, extremely difficult and extremely, urm, weird. OK, forget the weird part, it's actually weird in a good sense. As Mortlach said in his review (check below, may still be there), you need to have a different taste in games to enjoy this. It is complicated and complex, plus, I find the format a little hard to read. Some enjoy it, but some don't. I don't. From the time it took me to try and, er, uh... fail one level, I assume that it must take a whopping amount of time to complete the entire game compared to other puzzle games. Still, as I said, it's not the game for me, but it may be the game for you. BE VERY SURE IF YOU WANT TO GET IT BEFORE GETTING IT. BE VERY, VERY SURE. $9.99 is quite a large amount to spend on a game you may, in the end, realize you do not like. Read reviews, watch YouTube videos and stuff. Is this the game for you? Maybe. Maybe not. Good luck deciding.			"

												Argh … must resist the compulsion to optimise out another cycle and get on with my life!SpaceChem is a puzzle game about assembling molecules using a pair of programmable atom manipulators; the aim being to beat each puzzle by devising a layout that will take the input atoms and build the required output molecules.  Its a “programming” based game putting it in company with things like RoboRally and Tower of Babel.It starts off with a gentle introduction and slowly adds extra tools and more difficult challenges as you progress through the game - some of the later puzzles took me a couple of hours each to solve.The thing that makes it truly compelling and very replayable is the simple display of stats that places your solution to each completed puzzle on a graph of the all the solutions in three areas - cycles (execution time), number of reactors and number of symbols (commands) used.  Having completed a puzzle you find often out that it has been done much more efficiently, tempting you to go back and see if you can work out how.Highly recommended - if any of this sounds at all like your kind of challenge you won’t regret the purchase.

												This is not a puzzle game. Puzzles have a single solution that you must ferret out. This game presents problems that need to be solved with creativity and ingenuity. It's basically a visual programming game. It's for those who want a mental challenge and it provides that in spades. After you finish each challenge you're given histograms (histograms! Why don't more games have these? They're so much better at providing performance data than useless leaderboards) of how efficient your solution was compared to other players in how fast it is, how many reactors it uses and how many commands it uses. It's wonderful. Long live the histogram.			"

												You guys remember that episode of Star Trek The Next Generation where the USS Enterprise 1701-D kind of goes a little bit crazy and starts manufacturing a new life form in cargo bay five? The thing it builds, what is it? How do we know it's alive? Does it know it's alive? Is it alive? What does it like? Does it have feelings like we do? Where did it go? Will it be a good person or a bad person? Is it even a person? What does it mean to be a person? What do you think that it eats? Does it consume the ecosystems of planets to nourish itself? If it did, would the Enterprise have committed an atrocity? Why are fish cakes so delicious? Can we even understand what just happened? What does it mean to create artificial life? What if it destroys all other life as part of its lifecycle? What if it harbours a great hatred for all life but cannot do anything about it because it has no arms? Are we ready for the universe? Are we even ready for the solar system? What is life? What is anything?			"

												This game is a marvel. Zachtronics Industries proved that their sandbox games deserve a bigger scope. Spacechem offers dozens of puzzles in a story-driven campaign, where you need to design and optimize atomic assembly lines. Usually, you just need to produce given compounds, but the real fun begins when you need to manage the reactions in real time to defend yourself against exotic space monsters.For serious players, the game offers achievements, an optimization race in leaderboard statistics, and hundreds of player-created puzzles in the Journal of Reaction Engineering.While the main game environment looks very technical, you will become absorbed in building, optimizing and debugging your reactions to achieve results that initially seemed impossible. The austere environment of reactor grids is accompanied by beautiful hand-drawn visuals of various planets and cosmic monsters. The music is original, fitting, I would even say motivational, yet another high-quality element of the whole impressive piece.So, if you are actually reading this review, I cannot recommend Spacechem enough. Go buy it and make some chems!			"

												I've noticed that some of the reviewers have mentioned that this game is similar to programming and that you won't find it as fun if you're not a programmer. I dove into this game with no experience in programming and had an absolute blast with it. But then again, I ended up learning how to program eventually but that's not the point. You don't need any sort of background knowledge from programming or chemistry to enjoy this game but be aware that the puzzles can become mindblowingly convoluted yet incredibly satisfying when you manage to create a solution that works beautifully.I've started playing this game around three or so years ago and haven't finished the main storyline yet but I consider the ten bucks I've spent on this game so worth it for the time I've gotten out of it.Get the game, but be prepared for one hell of a challenge!

												Time to do some chemistry!SpaceChem is a great puzzle-ish game with a gripping storyline. But it's not for the faint-hearted. The first few worlds are absolutely great, fun, and entertaining. After that, things get a lot more difficult. But not difficult in a bad way! It's the kind of challenge that you'll spend a while working on and then jubliantly celebrate your victory, fist-pumping, smiling, doing powerslides... whatever your ""thing"" is! My point being, this game is really quite rewarding, and you'll feel great when you finally crack whatever problem is troubling you (quite literally in the case of some molecules).On top of all this, there's an absolutely amazing soundtrack, making this game a great experience for all.

												Avoid if you're on OS X! You must install additional software, “Mono” and a fan-made(!) patcher .app, to run this game now because of ""changes introduced to Mac OS X in version 10.11"" (which came out over a year ago).Trying to start this game just opens a webpage on the Zachtronics site which gives a link to download Mono (the download for which is more than twice the size the game itself) and a link to a (fan-made) github page that contains the patcher .app and the instructions. All of this requires far more time and effort than I wanted to put into trying to start a game. (I wasn’t going to bother, but Steam doesn’t allow reviews unless you’ve ran the game for at least five minutes.)I was very interested in other games by this developer, but not when they don't properly support their products. This has been a frustrating experience.Edit: I just noticed that the OS X version is on longer available on Steam. Good. But I'm still not going to risk buying any of their other games.			"

												I've mainly played this game on the iPad, but I wanted to express my love for this title here as well.  It is a well crafted puzzle game that encourages creativity in its solutions.In this game, there is a grid.  On this grid, you will place molecules, you will move molecules, and you will export specific, predetermined molecules.  The catch is, you have to do so by constructing a machine in advance, and then let it solve the problem for you.  Making such a machine is not easy, and it is rare that it will work as expected the first time.  The ""machine"" as I described it is composed of two tracks, with instructions along them.  A disc, which the game calls a WALDO, travels along each track, following the instructions as it comes across them.  The instructions include making an input molecule appear, making an output molecule disappear, grabbing/dropping a molecule, and bonding two molecules together.There are many ways to beat each level.  Some are more efficient than others.  The great thing about this is that it encourages you to replay old levels to try to find the most optimized way of beating them.  You get to compare the efficiency of your solutions to the solutions of others.  This is probably the hardest puzzle game I've ever played (I still haven't beaten it, even on the iPad), but it is definitely the most satisfying.  There's a real joy when your contraption finally comes together and works as planned.  And the challenge is such that it ultimately feels fair.  There's always a ""best"" way to do it, but whatever you can come up with, so long as it gets the job done, is acceptable.If you want a challenging, well made game that encourages creative solutions to puzzles, then look no further than this game.

												Spacechem is a fun and unique puzzle game. But I believe it can appeal only to those who love chemistry or complex problem solving. The fascinating thing about this game is that there's usually not one, but hundreds or thousands of different solutions to each puzzle. Surprisingly, the game has an epic soundtrack and contains lots of funny jokes.			"

												Spacechem is a indie chemistry based puzzle game with a high amount of depth.Even beating one level requires a lot of thinking, hard to solve but very satisfying afterwards.Price is a bit too much for this kind of game 10$, and there's no demo available so most people who get into this game won't know what to expect and might abandon due to high learning curve.

												Are you a fan of hard-core puzzle games? Do you enjoy pondering a problem until smoke trickles out your ears and your brain begins to turn to mush? Have you ever met a problem you just can't resist shooting? What if you don't have a gun?Look no further than SpaceChem for your next puzzler. I promise you that this game has stumped and infuriated me more than any other puzzle game I've played; And I've played my fair share.You hard-core '90s gamers may call me a whimp but give it a shot and see how far you can get.SpaceChem has an awesome campaign with a pretty good story to match.  In addition to the campaign, you can also create your own puzzles and play those created by others. All-in-all it makes for many hours of puzzler goodness. Certainly a must-play!			"

												The hardest puzzle game I've played in recent memory. There are loads of puzzles to do so there's no shortage of content. However it's more a matter of how much you can stomach playing. All the puzzles require you to start from scratch without hints (after the tutorial maps) and get increasingly complex, with more gameplay components being added every few maps. I don't know if it gets added in a later level or not (I'm about halfway through the third world now), but this game REALLY needs a hint system. The amount of complexity can be overwhelming and one mistimed reaction or misplaced pipe can lead to compounding failure and rage. Many times I have spent 30mins-1hr on a puzzle only to start over from scratch.I recommend this if you enjoy puzzle games, but prepared to visit youtube for solutions. A nice feature included is a built-in youtube recorder and uploader to show off your own solutions too so they are easy to find.			"

												SpaceChem has the potential to become synonymous with hard. Not hard like insane action game hard, oh no, this is perhaps even more intense. Bond molecules, break molecules, form new molecules and output them from the reactor. Then when you think that's all there is to it, you zoom out and realise there's sometimes more than one reactor! The learning curve is pretty steep, but the tutorials give you a good staring point. If you don't like using your brain, I cannot recommend this game. If you do though, then get your thinking caps on because we're going to do some chemistry!Disclaimer: Chemistry not actually real. Don't try breaking strong bonds at home. Free atoms can (and probably will) cause nausea, hearing loss, pain, death, and even explosions. Not for the faint at heart.			"

												This game is fun for people who like doing the same thing over and over.  While other games, such as the Contraption Maker, offer a wide variet of actions and tools, this game only offers 1 set of tools that mostly amount to: rotate, turn, up, down, left, right.  These tools offer no unique aspect of behavioral interaction like other puzzles.That's ok, I guess.  It's a science game written by someone who loves the tedium of scientific endeavors.  It's accompanied by a short story/novel you can read as you progress.For those who like this type of game, buy it, otherwise - you'll find yourself bored real fast.  It's like the call of duty of science games: competent, well done, but repetitive and boring if you sit at it too long.			"

												SpaceChem is one of those puzzle games where every level has an almost infinite number of solutions and where each and every one of your reactors is your very own beautiful unique snowflake (or a horribly clumsy and inefficient one, as the case may be). A game that makes you feel like an idiot, then a genius, and then an idiot once again. Brilliant.			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, with remarks.This is a great puzzleing game but, stay away of it if you don't want to loose lots of hours or even days trying to find out a solution. You've been warned!.The game starts with easy to understand tutorials and easy puzzles and then, difficulty increases puzzle after puzzle up to the hell.The overall goal for each puzzle is to get some atoms or molecules and transform them, to send the results to some storage  later.To transform particles, you use reactors. Each reactor can have up to two input and two ouput spots. You chain reactors and storages through pipes. You can chain reactors to produce the final product with the help of intermediate products.Reactors have some kind of program, with some special instructions: wait for input, grab, drop, rotate, bind, unbind, sync, branch if certain atom is being detected, flush the output area, etc. You will have to ""program"" a sequence of instructions to solve the puzzle and, just with the instructions and tools available for each puzzle.Graphics are good and attractive enough for this particular kind of game. The User's Interface is clear, easy to learn and, easy to use, very straight forward. You can do everything with just the mouse or, you can use keyboard shortcuts if you like it.The game was very well programmed, has no glitches, works smoothly and, seems to be very well optimized.This game is one on its kind. The idea is very original and, even that game mechanics sound so easy that can end boring you, the real thing is that puzzles are so challenging that you don't have such a feeling.But, be aware, if you don't like games that challenge your mind, don't buy this one; after a few of short easy puzzles you will face really challenging ones.I could say this is a casual game but, believe it, once you start a challenging puzzle, you will loose hours or days trying to figure out a solution. It's highly addictive.You can learn from solutions already designed by other people, by watching some youtube video (and, yes, you will do that), To beat the rest of community of players, you should solve the puzzles by using the less ammount of cycles (production cycles), the less amount of resources (reactors, storages, etc.) and the less amount of symbols (programming instructions). If to figure out a solution is challenging by itself, imagine how hard can be trying to beat other ""engineers"" (that's how the game calls to the player).			"

												If Myst was a puzzle game for artists, and crossword puzzles are a puzzle game for linguists, SpaceChem is a puzzle game for programmers.Sometimes brutally difficult, the feeling of fist-in-the-air celebration when you hit upon a solution is unmatched elsewhere.You don't actually have to know any programming to play, but you might find after a few hours of SpaceChem that your old c++ textbook from college suddenly makes more sense to you.Always fun, never unfair, and fantastic brain exercise.

												Best chemistry-themed programming language ever!SpaceChem is by no means an easy game, but that doesn't stop its vibrant community here on Steam from logging tens or even hundreds of hours figuring out solutions to its puzzles and devising new, more fiendish ones of their own.Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in computer science or who has kids they want to keep busy.

												If Myst was a puzzle game for artists, and crossword puzzles are a puzzle game for linguists, SpaceChem is a puzzle game for programmers.Sometimes brutally difficult, the feeling of fist-in-the-air celebration when you hit upon a solution is unmatched elsewhere.You don't actually have to know any programming to play, but you might find after a few hours of SpaceChem that your old c++ textbook from college suddenly makes more sense to you.Always fun, never unfair, and fantastic brain exercise.

												If you like puzzle / thinking games, give this one a try. It may appear easy at first but later on it's quite challenging and rewards you with a really good feeling when you finally found a solution.If you want to get your own impression first, there is a demo version :)PS: If you like this kind of games, look for the other Zachtronics games (e. g.  Codex of Alchemical Engineering and Infinifactory) they are quite good as well.			"

												It's a puzzle game, so I know most wouldn't be that interested, but it's unusual, intoxicating, and often has my brain running around in circles for hours on end.  Maybe it's just the programmer in me - I don't know.  Maybe it's the amount of time I spent playing Motor Programming on The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain.  Take it as you will - I heartily enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone interested in straining some neurons.			"

												This is perhaps the hardest game I have ever played. The complexity of the puzzles is not tedious, however. It is addictive, and anyone with an interest in programming or engineering will love this. There is some chemistry, but you need no prior knowledge to play. There is a quick learning curve, followed by challenges that become almost exponentially harder as the game progresses.It won't appeal to all, but I certainly rate it 10/10			"

												This game is fun for people who like doing the same thing over and over.  While other games, such as the Contraption Maker, offer a wide variet of actions and tools, this game only offers 1 set of tools that mostly amount to: rotate, turn, up, down, left, right.  These tools offer no unique aspect of behavioral interaction like other puzzles.That's ok, I guess.  It's a science game written by someone who loves the tedium of scientific endeavors.  It's accompanied by a short story/novel you can read as you progress.For those who like this type of game, buy it, otherwise - you'll find yourself bored real fast.  It's like the call of duty of science games: competent, well done, but repetitive and boring if you sit at it too long.			"

												This here, gentle reader, is brilliance in a box. I can't emphasize how dumb this game makes me feel when I'm struggling with finding a solution. Then, suddenly I feel like Einstein! It works! I'm a genius! Then I proceed to the next puzzle, play it for a bit and go back to the one I just completed. It needs to be optimized. Then I shave off a few things, make it a bit more elegant and feel even smarter.And that, perhaps, is the most brilliant part of this game: you want to go back, making an even better solution. I'd equate it with programming. Even if you code a solution you always think that you might be able to tweak it just a bit, nip off a line here and a line there. That is this game. Programming in form of a game.The story deserves a mention as well. While I can't claim to have seen all of it, due to being too stupid to progress at the moment, so far it's excellent. It does not get in the way of the game and is pretty much optional. But if you want it, it's there. Buy now!			"

												Quite simply, SpaceChem is the hardest puzzle game I've ever played by a wide margin. The object of the game is to use two pathways to assemble the atoms of elements in a grid from input to output, essentially programming a machine to create the desired output. This game is only for a certain type of person. If you're not prepared to have your brain explode, or you hate it when you can't get a puzzle right away, I don't recommend this game for you. It's really that hard. Solutions around mid-game will probably take you an hour or two. If you're not very inclined with logic and algorithms you may not like this game. However, even if any of these applied to you, I still think it's worth a buy, if only to experience the difficulty this game features, even so early on. If this kind of puzzler is your cup of tea, then do I have the game for you. Whenever you find a solution to a puzzle, the immense feeling of pride is overwhelming. As you're guiding the elements you'll actually feel like a scientist on a breakthrough project. When you do finally solve a puzzle after hours of planning, you'll want to make it more efficent and quicker than what you already have. You'll want to watch it work in front of you as you admire your handywork. If you enjoy working out difficult problems and like a programming-type style of puzzle then you are this game's audience.

												This is the hardest and most rewarding puzzle game I've ever played. New mechanics are introduced gradually. Difficulty ramps up very quickly.There is no ""one way"" to solve a task, the general idea is that you program the reactors to perform a goal. As long as the job gets done, it still counts. However efficiency and speed does result in higher ranks on the leaderboard.In tasks, you are limited by the number of programmable reactors you can use, and indeed the notion of limited space is real catch. If you run out of reactors or diagram space, you'll need to find a way to optimize your layout. I've been programming for many years and these puzzles itch the same portion of the brain. I suppose it's analgous to trying to write a program in 256 bytes of assembler.Unlike many puzzle games, this one fits into a context that makes sense, the story line and the objectives you complete don't seem forced or fanciful. And watching a completed system in action is highly rewarding.			"

												Possibly one of the most difficult puzzle games available.  This is sort of a robotic manufacturing game, where raw materials are disassembled, re-arranged and re-assembled using a handful of simple graphical commands on tracks.  This is the only game I'm aware of which has race conditions, just like what you find in real-life programming.I recommend it - go ahead and play the demo.  Even if it isn't your cup of tea, I tend to think you can overcome any feeling of ""this game makes me feel dumb"" if you approach it as an exploration: ""what happens if we try this?""  It takes a lot of persistence, knowing that every puzzle does have a solution.  But the payoff - especially for such a small price - is HUGE.  You'll learn to think in a more organized fashion by playing, I'm convinced of it.			"

												I can't recommend SpaceChem for a simple reason: game is quite difficult because it lacks a proper tutorial.Most of the time I played (very little, considering I farmed its cards before starting), was used to find out how things work. Am I supposed to watch other people's solutions? Should I keep trying and error until I'll discover how to bond multiple atoms in a cycle? I won't.I have little experience in Perl programming language but when I started learning, I read and watched tutorials.. isn't that the normal process you're supposed to go through when learning a new subject? You study it and then apply what you've learned to ""real life"" problems.So, you tell me, what's the point in playing this game when you don't know the rules?			"

The gameplay is quite simple in concept, but leads to quite difficult puzzles.   But the game just has a really horrible interface once you reach the later levels, and it becomes more frustrating than anything else.  It's not hard to figure out how to solve the problem—it's just the interface is so bad it's hard to tell which of the four reactors the problem is in, and what exactly caused it because you can't review what happened.   It just makes it frustrating, but not even difficult—just time consuming.			"

												I wish I could vote neutral, but I really can't thumbs up on this. Main reason: it's too clever for me. I get what it's trying to do and applaud the originality of it, but the execution brings it to a halt to me.Your task is to build certain molecules. Probably awesome if you're a chemist, but it beats others over the head with details. The actual game is layed out in a very, VERY minimal (even abstract) way, and because everything has to fit on a single screen, you either ""see"" it or you're messing around. Spacechem certainly isn't the only puzzle game that can get frustrating, but to me, this is one where solving puzzles didn't wow me. Perhaps because the field is so small most of my approaches failed to start (meaning: you better have an elegant solution RIGHT AWAY because otherwise you can't tweak what you build).At first I thought this kind of game just wasn't for me...but after playing infinifactory (which is more or less this game in 3D - by the same makers), I now think it's because this game is just too minimalistic and has a too narrow playing field.

												Truly the greatest puzzle game of all time. Not for the faint of heart. Shortly after the tutorial levels your intelligence will be challenged. If you're one of the elite few who have what it takes to make it to the last levels of the game then your sanity will be challenged.I'm sure I've gotten hundreds of hours of quality puzzle time from this game (I was playing the Linux version before Steam was available on Linux) and I consider completing this game the greatest gaming feat I will ever accomplish. Mostly because no one makes games this challenging.""The second incorrect assumption we made was thinking that puzzle games need to be difficult and long to be good. Although challenge is essential to making puzzle games ""work"", the difficulty that emerges from the mechanics of SpaceChem can be bewildering, even if it's what makes the puzzles feel so open-ended. Combining this intrinsic difficulty with an abundance of puzzles that must be beaten to ""complete"" the game gives SpaceChem an oppressive 40+ hour difficulty curve that only 2 percent of players reach the end of.""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/172250/postmortem_zachtronics_.php "

												Awesome, cool puzzle idea about chemistry that's only educational if you want it to be. It may be hard to understand at first, but once you get the hang of it it's a really interesting concept which is fun to play around with. It revolves around creating your own reactors and systems to move and bond molecules together for the sake of a plot held in space, which is very interesting but somewhat irrelevant. There are even boss battles! Late-game is only for the strongly puzzle-inclined, however, as it gets quite difficult and requires a lot of outside-the-box thinking. Regardless, try it out. Definitely recommended.			"

												This is an extremely annoying game. Even if you somehow manage to decipher the various tools, sometimes you get stuck because you didn't put enough of a delay with extended pipes. I got this game for free, and even at that price it was overvalued for my tastes.If you prefer puzzles that are poorly explained, require many hours just to ""fast forward"" to the end when everything is set up for a level, or just want to search for the puzzle solutions, you may like this game. It really isn't for me.Edit:I found out that, in addition to delays with pipes, you need to guess the orientation of the bonders. That's right, you can have a valid symbol layout, but the puzzle still won't work because of how the game secretly orders the symbols. This is inexcusable in a game focused on programming by puzzles.			"

												I am a chemistry teacher and as a teacher I had the thought that this game might help someone learn chemistry.  After forcing myself to play for aproximately 45min I feel that I can safely say there is not much learning about chemistry involved.  There is no way I could play this (seeing I love chemistry) let alone use it as a teaching tool.   Maybe the chemistry lessons get better later in the game but not good enough for me.As a gamer I can also say that this game isn't any fun either.  The idea of the game is boring.  This is basically just a really bad puzzle game.  setting up each level takes forever just to hit the play fast buttton becuase you really dont care what happens.			"

												I really liked this game, but theres enough frustrating elements that could be fixed but never were, which is sad for a top selling game.  This is the ultimate puzzle game thats rather unique. If you like challenging games that require a lot of forethought and trial and error this game is a must but for everone else this is a pass. The UI and support can be frustrating, clunky UI and controls take the player out of the game as you fight the UI to get the puzzle done.  No cloud saving means rebeating complicated puzzles every time you re-install.  There is access to user created content but the replay value is somewhat limited once you master the game.			"

												SpaceChem Review - Raymond KTSummary: Zachtronics Industries is back with an ambitious new design-based puzzle game. Take on the role of a Reactor Engineer working for SpaceChem, the leading chemical synthesizer for frontier colonies. Construct elaborate factories to transform raw materials into valuable chemical products! Streamline your designs to meet production quotas and survive encounters with the sinister threats that plague SpaceChem.Before we start this review, the first thing you need to do, right now, is ditch any preconceptions you’ve made off the back of SpaceChem’s chemistry-related imagery, or the fact that the screenshots look, at worst, like educational software. I can guarantee that you will learn almost nothing of any value, scientific or otherwise, playing this game. Your leisure hours are safe. If I have any chemists reading this, I can also guarantee that you’ll suck at SpaceChem as much as the rest of us. Sorry, chemists. In SpaceChem you play a new employee of a profoundly sinister interstellar chemical company (called SpaceChem), with the story of your career being told throughout the game through well-written text vignettes. The actual game of SpaceChem is, quite simply, building circuits. Using an intuitive and satisfying interface, you whip up tracks for chemicals to travel down with the objective of carrying an entirely different chemical to the level’s ultimate destination.If you like those kind of games, it's probably the best of the last 25 years. It's a game of extremes, the graphics are simply annoying, but it can keep you playing one level for a whole day. "

												A few years ago, a mother and father decided they needed a break, so they wanted to head out for a night on the town. They called their most trusted babysitter. When the babysitter arrived, the two children were already fast asleep in bed. So the babysitter just got to sit around and make sure everything was okay with the children. Later that night, the babysitter got bored and went to watch TV, but she couldn't watch it downstairs because they did not have cable downstairs (the parents didn't want children watching too much garbage). So, she called them and asked them if she could watch cable in the parent's room. Of course, the parents said it was OK, but the babysitter had one final request… she asked if she could cover up the angel statue outside the bedroom window with a blanket or cloth, at the very least close the blinds, because it made her nervous. The phone line was silent for a moment, and the father who was talking to the babysitter at the time said, ""..Take the children and get out of the house…we will call the police. We do not have an angel statue."" The police found all three of the house occupants dead within ten minutes of the call. No statue was found.			"

The puzzles challenge me, and the music, as well as the anticipation of reading the next piece of the narrative, are what challenge me to not give up. For those interested, the story is available on the internet at http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem-story/ for individuals who didn't complete the game but who'd still like to know the ending; the soundtrack was, at least at one time, available for free as well online.Thank you to Zach Barth, Evan Le Ny, and Hillary Field.

												SpaceChem is a game about fake chemestry and engineering. If you like challenging (very challenging) games where you push yourself against other people in using fewer moves and buttons to complete a task, this game is up your ally. This isnt a game you can play drunk while watching t.v. but more a game where you use all of your brain power to complete the task at hand. There is a wonderfull booklike story that goes with the game but the game itself is where its at. Would recommend 9.5/10, 100 hours and still havent completed the entire game.

												Mostly a game for casual gamers. There is no stress, it's only puzzles. The first one are fairly easy, then it simply gets more complex fairly fast. The real challenge is ain't to complete the level, which can be pretty hard, but to actually do it with the best efficiency and/or the best time. And both one solution doesn't automatically means it's the best for the other critera.			"

												This game is EPIC. The challenge is to program reactors with a series of tracks and commands that will produce a specific molecular result. It's far more complicated then it sounds and you have to think on many levels and try to perform the tasks efficiently and in a multitasking manner with the waldos (grabber/activators) that reside in each reactor. One reactor is hard enough, but try stringing together several and producing 2 or more different results to send to different freighters. This is definetly a programmer's game as the system seems remeniscent of a programmable processor that manipulates data and seperates the results to specific outputs. An instant favorite of mine, I'll never tire of looking for the most efficient and effective way to produce the desired output.			"

												Puzzle game of the year?  Maybe!No real chemistry involved here; it's basically visual scripting with a limited set of ""instructions"" (tools) and a geometric aspect. If you like coding/scripting, or if you like building contraptions and watching them crank along, then you'll probably dig it. It does quickly get complex. This is not an easy game. Fortunately the solving process doesn't (always) involve just staring at the screen, but rather building different aspects of a possible solution to see how they work out. So it's engaging even when you're not immediately solving stuff.The nifty thing is that each problem has lots of workable solutions. If you like, you can tune your solutions for efficiency or speed, and see how you compare to other players. I'm only halfway through the campaign myself, just taking my time and occasionally going back to earlier stages to tweak my solutions.You can see some solution examples at spacechem.net or on youtube.

												If you thought Portal 2 had challenging puzzles, or if you get scared at the thought of Tetris, then by all means, stay clear of Spacechem. On the other hand, if you love the afforementioned titles, then by all means, do indulge in a puzzlegame based on pure logic and exact science. Incredibly deep and massively engaging, Spacechem's systems and background mechanics will make your brain work like a well oiled V12 engine. In spacechem you have to program a nuclear reactor and assemble, or crack atoms. And that is just the entry level, when you get to einstein level, you have combine your atoms with more atoms, think about bindings, and load them into freighters. While making one compound is a walk in the proverbial park. You have to make make a pattern that is infintely repeatable...on all levels. Making that walk in the park a bloody streetfight in a volcano...in space.			"

												While building state machines is fun, I feel like this game could have some valuable lessons to teach in the realm of multi-threaded programming for those trying to optimize for the minimum number of cycles per level.Many of the puzzles are devilishly clever and the way the game presents itself it is very well done.  The UI is clear, it allows for player documentation of your state machines, and tries to give you the tools to come up with the best solution possible.  This is one of those games where the leaderboards matter and trying to eek out that little bit of optimization to get the fastest machine of your friends is something I spent a lot of time doing, even after ""solving"" the problem.

												If you like your puzzle games challenging, Spacechem is a towering acheivement.  Its gameplay and level design are elegant in a way that solutions feel like personal creations.  Its graphics and sound are clean and undistracting.  Its storyline's superfluous but entertaining nevertheless.  The basic game is quite long, and this length, along with the wonderful replay value in optimizing each level's stats makes the game a $/hr bargain.As the creator has bemoaned in interviews, the name SpaceChem scares away potential players who believe that the game is chemistry based.  However, a chemistry background is about as useful as a degree in ornithology for Angry Birds.  What will help is programming experience,  since the atomic manipulation is a veneer for a deep sequential instruction ""programming language.""  In fact, this game would be a fun tool to indirectly introduce computer programming to kids.  Well, super smart kids, since the game is hard.Last, and for some, least, there's an unheralded ""multiplayer"" component in outdoing your Steam friends on each level.  Some of the most fun I've had with the game has been the playful trashtalking earned by one-upping my pal's best scores just to see him retaliate with an even better solution.  This back and forth improvment closely mimics the most satisfying part of the engineering process, and once again, is a testament to the fundamental elegance of the game's design.			"

												I liked this game a lot. First of all, programming games are very rare. This is not only a good programming game, but also a fun and challenging game. The idea is genius! The design and implementation is good. The story is interesting. Even the menus look good. The boss battles are a very cool idea too. It's just amazing to use the ""boring"" thing like chemical plants to fight enemies. The switches in boss levels made it feel like I was creating a game inside a game (building the ""engine"" and wiring the controls).Liked the additional levels and the online gallery.The not so good parts (there are very few):1) Liked the music, but there's like only a single track. I've spent countless hours and the music got to me a bit.2) Non-gameplay graphics (like the pyramid) are a bit low-res and blurry when viewed on a large monitor.3) I encountered a bug: sometimes when I opened some old completed level, the plant schemes were slightly messed up (any any change breaks everything for good). Guess the save format was a bit unstable. This disn't set me back while I was playing through the game, but I'm a bit of archivist.Overall, this is a great game. I want some more of it. Don't know what exactly do I want, dut I want more =)			"

												An amazing puzzle game unlike anything else I've seen. While it is based on a chemistry theme, the gameplay is actually more akin to circuitry with logical algorithm building and no knowledge of chemisty is actually required. New puzzle types and logic pieces are unlocked regularly making for a varied and increasingly challenging experience. Not for the impatient since some puzzles can take hours to solve, but when you do finally figure a difficult puzzle out it is so immensely satisfying. Well worth the cost of buying, even if not on sale!			"

As you progress, the game becomes harder as new elements are added.  My only concern was that some of the directions were not clear enough when introducing new items, requiring a lot of time to be spent understanding the game mechanics.  As some of the other reviews indicated, this game is definitely for a specific type of person.  If you want instant gratification, do NOT get this game.

												Good: Yes.Hard: Also, yes. Although I am quite terrible with efficiency in this game (I once actually beat the performance curve on being over-the-top convoluted), and I'd say quite terrible at it in general, it's one of those games that I enjoyed because of the level of critical thinking it takes to solve each puzzle. You'll really stretch out your brain visualizing ways to make the damn thing work. There's a kind of freedom in how you go about it, too. You can go ahead and make a giant tangled mess that somehow manages to sync up and fart out molecules (like I do), or you can create elegantly simple systems that use minimal commands and reactor cycles (like the people on youtube, who make me feel very, very stupid). I'm not too, too far in yet, and I hear efficiency becomes a concern later (in which case I AM SO SCREWED). And yes, you kind of have to be a little bit of a nerd to get into this game. Knowing a little bit about programming helps, but isn't strictly necessary if you're decent at puzzle games. You only really need to know the basics of chemistry, as it's mostly gameplay science, anyhow. Overall, it's a little dense, but not enough to be inaccessible. Solving each level somehow feels more satisfying than other puzzle games, like you really contributed something. Or maybe it's just really hard in spots and you feel proud of yourself for getting it. I don't know. I like it, anyhow. I'd say it's worth a look if you want a hard puzzler and a good brain exercise.			"

												This is possibly the hardest puzzle game I've ever played. As a programmer, I enjoyed the element of breaking down the problems into programmatic algorithms - you must think like a programmer in order to succeed at this game, taking into consideration if/else, basic logic, input/output, and step-by-step requirements to get from point A to point B.You don't have to be a programmer, or a chemist, or a biologist. You do need to have patience and a solid grasp of logic and sequence. Some of the puzzles, I believe, are a bit too much, taking too much time and effort. It would be nice if you had a limited set of 'skips' that you can use to skip over problematic problems. However, I do believe that the balance of difficulty is spot on.The learning curve is gradual; however, the difficulty of the puzzles increases sharply. This game requires you to think outside the box (and not just one box, but multiple boxes at the same time). This is not a bad thing; in fact, this is exactly what I expect to find in a puzzle game. Not only that, but this game has some ♥♥♥♥♥in' music. I also like the fact that they added a story to the game, and there are various 'missions' that are different than the basic 'solve this puzzle' scenario. Replayability is available in the form of player-generated puzzles.I highly recommend this game to anyone who's tired of the same lame puzzle game and wants a bit of a challenge. 10/10			"

												I had a lot of fun with this programming-based puzzle game.  The base mechanics are simple to learn, but it's set up such that later missions require real planning and work to pull off, let alone to optimize solutions.			"

												I cannot put into words how much I love this game.  The type of thinking required for this game isn't something I've seen used in games that often.  Challenging, but very rewarding.  If you're still not sure, try Codex of Alchemical Engineering on Kongregate first; it's made by the same guy, and requires similar types of thinking.			"

												I hate this game.  Its not fun and I'm never going to play it again.  Its stupid.  Its a horrible puzzle game thats like crack without the payoff.  As a matter of fact I'm going to go delete it now.  SWEET just finished a level.  Oh the euphoria!   Maybe I'll play for a few more hours.			"

												This is a good game for when I want to relax for 30 minutes, it's a sciency puzzle game where you need to use logic and planning in order to solve the problems. Each level gives you specific molecules to begin with and you have to design a reactor process in order to produce the required products. It's very fun if you like problem solving. Also, free tf2 items.			"

												Amazingly brilliant puzzle game that rewards intelligence, spatial reasoning, and creativity. The perfect game for programmers and engineers (anyone who loves to tinker.)My one gripe is that the progress is linear so if you get stuck on a really tricky puzzle you can almost never skip it and try again later. Yes you can easily go on youtube and find solutions to any puzzle that's stumping you, but its annoying having to resort to such measures.			"

												Really, really fun and diabolical puzzle game.  If you like puzzles, at all, this game is awesome and well worth the money.  Try the demo, it's actually long enough to let you decide if you'll like it or not.EDIT: 3 years later, and my recommendation has only gotten stronger.  This is one of the best puzzle games ever written.  If you like puzzles, then this is your game.			"

												If you enjoy coding, math, or any kind of hard science, this game will consume your life. I spent WEEKS playing it when it came out, usually with a tab of graph paper and a pen. It presents you with challenge after challenge, and you'll have to be as efficient and creative as possible to complete them.If i could pick one game that i think would be a great thing to be literally addicted to; it's this one. It's almost an educational game (though not really about chemistry) in disguise, in that it forces you to think like an engineer.			"

If you do not have the patience and the will to think for so long and prefer more action in a game, then I would say that you can better leave this game alone			"

												SpaceChem is a game about fake chemestry and engineering. If you like challenging (very challenging) games where you push yourself against other people in using fewer moves and buttons to complete a task, this game is up your ally. This isnt a game you can play drunk while watching t.v. but more a game where you use all of your brain power to complete the task at hand. There is a wonderfull booklike story that goes with the game but the game itself is where its at. Would recommend 9.5/10, 100 hours and still havent completed the entire game. Could use an update on the graphics (no wide screen support).			"

												Mostly a game for casual gamers. There is no stress, it's only puzzles. The first one are fairly easy, then it simply gets more complex fairly fast. The real challenge is ain't to complete the level, which can be pretty hard, but to actually do it with the best efficiency and/or the best time. And both one solution doesn't automatically means it's the best for the other critera.			"

												What everyone else says, get this game if you don't give up when solving theorical problems (e.g. math problems) because in that case this game is AWESOME GOTY ALL YEARS, there's no other way to explain how good it is and how much you should be getting it.If you are the type of person that hates solving problems however then you shouldn't get this game at all, you may play a couple levels but will give up on it and hate this game before it even gets to the good parts.Having played this game, if you have a handheld device that can run this game, and you use it when you are in the bus, train, plane or somewhere else where you don't get to do much except sit on your butt, then try to get the spacechem version for that device (I know there's an ipad and android versions for instance), because that's the perfect time to think instead of doing nothing at all.

												I think this game caters to a specific type of gamer, but check out the demo and see if you like it. It's a logic puzzler at its core, and you can also go down the extreme optimization path as well. Don't let the apparent molecular/chemistry bend turn you off, it really has nothing to do with chemistry when it comes down to it. I've taken a break from it but very much enjoyed figuring out the puzzles. There's also a few slightly different gameplay mechanics to mix things up a bit.			"
