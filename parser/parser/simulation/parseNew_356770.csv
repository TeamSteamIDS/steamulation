												This is a nice little game. Fans of modern space travel would enjoy having it in their collection.My only criticism of the game is its lack of an Options menu.			"

												Quite possibly the biggest waste of $5.99 yet. The controls are terrible and an over all unsatisfactory game play. I would not let the recommended reviews give you a false perspective of the game like they did for me.			"

												Liking the game so far, Gameplay wise is alright but could definitely have more elements to it! Physics/ environment wise is amazing! Really loving the space atmosphere and the ""gravity free"" feel to it. I think this game would look spectacular with the Oculus Rift. Controls are pretty intuitive and definitely adds challenge to the gameplay! Also I could swear my head is still spinning from all the spins during the game ha!However, as a Sci fi/ space game lover I would love to see more to the game environment (perhaps other shuttles, the ISS, probes, making the ships accessible to the cabin etc, perhaps even stars to really enhance the visuals? Making the environment bigger too would be great especially with such freedom in movements). As for the gameplay, I would love to see perhaps co-op/ multiplayer gameplay because I think team work in this game would add more fun and realism to it. I would also like to see more interactive and different missions, instead of just mostly hovering on different waypoints,  Maybe users could also even design their own missions? Overall, great, chilled, relaxing simulator with huge potential!EDIT: I forgot, could you also include more dialogues, the radio dialogues get too repeated at times and we could sure use an options page as well in the menu.

												I bought this game thinking I was going to have a nice relaxing time flying about in space just like Sandra Bullock in Gravity before♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan, and I was not disappointed. For the low price that it is, Astronaut Simulator is reasonably well received in my eyes. Simulator? Not entirely immersive, but the control scheme does require some practice before you get the hang of it. But what do you expect for a less-than £5 title?There are obviously much more immersive and/or higher-detailed games out there for us space-sim lovers, but honestly I had fun playing around with this for the shorter-half of an hour on my alternate account. And I'm sure I will continue to enjoy it when I feel like I need a break from the more hardcore simulations I frequent.			"

												Astronaut Simulator is definitely not for everyone.=======CONS:- Hard to control: takes a LOT of practice; easy to press the wrong key and botch everything.- Frustration level = MAXIMUM OVERLOAD- Looping audio for missions: gets a tad annoying when you have to repeat the mission so many times.PROS:+ Good atmosphere: visuals are good, and the aesthetic is on-point+ True to life: Using the N2 to control your movement in space is right-on.+ Very preciseDo I recommend?Well... yes. It's a very good game to give a go at, but I wouldn't say it's for everyone. It can be extremely frustrating trying to get through the very first level (if you can), as you have to really try to control the precise movements of the astronaut. Small movements are important (very few button presses to release N2), and taking your time is crucial. It's very easy to screw up, so make sure you're pressing the right button, or you may go into a panicked frenzy of button pressing that jetisons you off into the darkest regions of the nether that is space..!...Don't buy it if you can't handle a good challenge, or don't have a lot of time to spare in getting really good at pretending to be an astronaut.

												WOW... for a 6 dollar game this is not bad at al. Its verry simplistic, all you have to do is move around The Endeavor and other space Shuttles and fix things, yet it can get SUPER intense when you loose control of yourself and slowly start drifting off in to the Deep Dark space that awaits to devour you, ya it can get kinda scary too. Its a great little game, and if you like anything to do with space this is somthing you will want to have in your library. If that sounds interesting then this is something you will defenitly wanna pick up.  "

												1. There are strange triangles flying around / i do not know what this should express but they look weird and definitely need to be removed - game will be looking much better without them/2. Textures of space shuttle definitely need to be with higher resolution and better quality as most time you are working around SS as earth and moon look good.I will be desperately waiting for these improvements as this will shift the game one level up and show basic of space physics to other fellow players.

												this game is ok because u know i love space stuff but i kinda wish it had more things to do than just repair stuf.this game also has the motion law that when you move in one way, you keep moving in that dirction unless acted upon another force. That is what makes this game some what relistic and chalengeing.for a $6 game its prety good, i recommend this game to people that like space and to try a new kind of game experince.			"

												Not bad.This game is pretty good to feel ""Gravity Free"".140MB of Available space required, High performance computer is not required to enjoy this little game.I'm playing this game with my old laptop which has a Pentium4M Processor, DDR 512MB Ram, and a ATI Mobility radeon Graphics. Yep, It's a Really old computer. But runs really good. I can play this game w/o lag or freeze.Now, gameplay. Some keyboard keys like wasd required to move your virtual astronaut. You can turn your head using mouse. I don't like these controls cuz this is too hard for me. But ""Automatic movement stop key?"" helped me a lot. Unfortunately, We can't make any user missions. Also, There's no multiplay!Cheap, but nice little game. Enjoyable, Simple, and Light.+Sorry for my bad English			"

												A simple little game/simulator that gives you a general idea of a spacewalk outside the space shuttle.For a free game, I was quite impressed with the graphics and gameplay. Very solid.You must travel from one waypoint to the next when directed.As solid as the graphics and gameplay are, there is nothing more then going from one spot to the next.This leads to repetitive gameplay, and can become old quickly.Definitely worth the try, but just don't expect too much variety out of it.It is what it is... A space walk simulator. But an impressive one.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

												Yes it works. no crash or flaw right now. You feel a little bit like an astronaut in a simulator.But there can be done a lot more here from the developers:- A hud with information like oxygen and fuel charging level. As well helpers like a gyroscope.  You can learn from the game ""Lunar Flight"".- Resolution of textures are very low, when you come close to the vessels. Quite a pixel show.- Player can't set the resolution at all.- Some more interesting tasks, not only fly to a point and stay there.- The Earth is spinning, when you fly over it with the shuttle in an orbit lower than 36.000 km.   The shuttle and MIR were mostly in a lower orbit. - Dialog loop too short, you hear it over and over again. More variety please.I am sorry guys, can't recommend it in this state			"

												For those old enough, the controls remind me very much of Descent from the 1990's: The first few flights you'll find yourself disorientated and occasionally spinning helplessly in space, but after a while you'll surprise yourself by pulling some very smooth moves, like orbiting around objects and changing your orientation while flying backwards. Simple in the surface but very rewarding. And for those wondering, it works fine with the keyboard,			"

												UPDATE!! 6/12/15 I REFUNDED THIS GAME!Please respect my opion.So I checked this game out thinking wow, as a simulator nut freak this looks pretty cool. How I was wrong. I jumped into game with a 360 controller at first thinking ""wow has control support nice"" The controls on the controler were garbage and uncontrolable. I could barely move with it and only got to one checkpoint in the tut before losing energy and not be able to stop spinning. So I pretty much laughed the game off for awhile untill today, I came to the conclusion to try it again. We'll Let me point this out, The controls are a little better and controlable with a keyboard they're still a bit wacky. I almost finished the tut before running out of energy. I made up my mind to try a mission. I was doing great untill I realized the energy bar is sooooo stupid. It's like trying  to keep a charge on a Ipod 1st Gen. The game is relaxing but needs quite a bit of help. If this game had like mechanics where your hands and stuff move or when you fix something you actuallly have a animation. Or even a bit more distinct way of finding the objectives.*Pros.*Pretty Decent Graphcs and Designs.*Good Specs.*Really cool voice clips from real space missions.*Decent music.*Gamepad support (HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED)*Cons.*Terrible movement.*Energy bar runs out WAY to fast.* I'd like to do missions inside the cabin too.*Once out of control with no energy you're done*The two little boxes that display info are kinda tacky.*No user menu interface. (Can't change video, Buttons, Sensitivity ETC)Conclusion: I can't determine if this game is for you or not. I wish I could put my review as  inbetween because it's negative and positive at the same time, One update is all this game needs and a couple of fixes and then I'll recommend the game. But until then No			"

												Well for a $5.99 I can't really complain too much. That's not to say it's a bad game or anything, but i just can't bring myself to recommend it to other people if only because it's not quite as interesting as I hoped it would be. There really isn't a lot to do other than ""go here, wait, go there, wait, go here, wait, go there, wait, go back here, end level"" all while admiring a beautiful scene of earth as you orbit around it, and the space beyond. Controls are easy if you use a controller, though they might take a while to get used to and gameplay's pretty simple and slow. pretty much your objective is to fly to waypoints and sometimes wait at them before heading back to the ship before your O2 or NO2 runs out. Bare bones and basic really. I was hoping that some of the waypoints that required you to wait by them to ""make repairs"" would have involved some small hud animation or even a little quick time event or something that would involve the player doing anything while they waited so that they're not bored twiddling their thumbs. Over all, it's a time killer for people who are really into simulations. If you wanna know what it's like to float around in ""Zero G"" while operating an ""MMU"" this is the game for you. otherwise, you might be more interested to play ""Moonbase Alpha""			"

												An OK game with much potential, but the somewhat poor textures on the Space Shuttle, simple and repetative missions, and lack of options (to turn the sound down, increase graphics etc) just narrowly bring the game down.There isn't much good to say about this game. If it had more content, or you could interact more with theshuttle when working on it, I think this would be a good game.I would rate this 4/10 but because with one or 2 simple updates it could be massively improved, I will recommend this game. I doubt those updates will ever come and more content will never be seen, but heigh-ho.			"

												I think my most favourite part about the game is how realistic it is when it comes to the atmosphere / physics of it, it's very easily to lose control and drift off if you're not careful.The controls are kind-of difficult to understand at first but it gets easier the more you play it, as you get used to the controls and how to move in a zero-gravity environment.I personally think improvement could be put in surroundings, maybe with more detail into the stars instead of flying bits of triangles everywhere, or maybe a space shuttle or something, but this doesn't really effect the game play at all.Overall it's a great game, 8/10.
