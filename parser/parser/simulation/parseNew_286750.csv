												May not be the best Zoo designing simulator out there, but used to be incredibly fun to me 10 years ago and it still is! I wouldn't recommend it to people who never played it earlier though.			"

												I don't know why some people say ""it's the worst zoo game"". But it's really given me a lot of fun about 10 years ago when I was a child.			"

												Still one of the best zoo simulators, and even though it's partially a nostalgic thing it's still very solid.			"

Zoo EmpireI really like this game! It's fun to play and very easy to understand. There are 2 Gamemodes called Career (or szenario) and free play. The graphics are outdated, but ok. For this low price you could definitely buy Zoo Empire!			"

												This is another case of wishing Reviews had a Neutral button, but because there isn't one, this game gets a thumbs down from me.I love Zoo Tycoon 1+2/Deluxe, so I was expecting something similar and my review will reflect that as I compare almost every aspect of this game to its much better counterpart. I definitely received a similar game, but it was executed poorly.First off, I wanted to like the game; I bet it's not bad, and maybe it's just my settings/computer, but I can't get around the strange mouse sensitivty when trying to click small objects. It feels like the mouse movement detection is not sensitive enough and I have to jerk the cursor farther than where I want it to go so it makes precise aiming for building things VERY obnoxious. I tried every slot in the mouse sensitivity settings in the game. I have to admit, this drove me nuts after 10 minutes of the game so I can't say much about anything else as I could barely click things I wanted to. This is the main reason for my thumbs down.I noticed not nearly as many animal choices as there are in the Zoo Tycoon games, and figuring out which items and fences and decorations were best for which animals was a much larger pain to do than in ZT, where you can just click the zookeeper recommendations for that animal and it'll give you all the items in a selectable list.However, the game seems a bit brighter and more ""cartoony"" than ZT, which appealed to me, but it was still pretty darn close to the ZT style. Overall, the game just seems like it's trying to be Zoo Tycoon, coming close, but still falling a bit short.I honestly wish I could have experienced a bit more of the game, but it was getting close to the two weeks refund period so I figured for the $1.75 I paid, I'll just grab my refund now and if I want to give the game another chance later, I shall.
