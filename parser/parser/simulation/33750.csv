												Yep I'm a life long gamer. Can't play this thing. Is this a game or a con? Honestly, worst thing EVER. Steam, you should not even have this on your shelf. Bad for your image allowing this stuff to be sold to your customers.			"

												Do you like building up  a prison and haven't played the prison tycoon 3? Then don't buy this nor the third one since nethier have a tutorial so good luck in trying to play the game (Get prison architect instead save your money for  that and a enjoy a more complex, better polished game which also has better graphics.)

												game is totally outdated do not waste your time, it's not a sharp game either everything seems to lag. Idea is great and it seems they have coevered all the basics but it can feel like a struggle just to find a guard and prevent a prison escape			"

												Another crappy game from a bundle pack that should have been retired instead of hastily ported to steam. The game is bad for a lot of reasons, but the biggest is its confusing interface. There isn't a tutorial mode, there are very few 'challenge' scenarios, theres no way of seeing when the next milestones are, building position seems to be irrelevant... The entire game is from another era - and while it might have some nostalgic value for a couple minutes, it definitely doesn't meet todays standards of a pay to play game -- it doesn't even hold up to most free games.

												I have never in my life wanted to make a prison as much as I have when I thought about buying this game six years ago. Now that I own it, I regret every cent I payed.			"

												If you like Tycoon games then this is a good game since you get to assign prisoners work to do within the prison, the guards can do searches of the prisoners cells, you can put the prison into lockdown and put in the prison into riot mode where the guards dress in riot gear (you can also buy tear gas). Very good game only played a few hours so can not write a very big review of the game.			"

												Where to start with this game.... got it as part on an enticing bundle a while back, thought I'd give it a go and I spent the first 10 minutes trying to figure out how to hire staff due to the fact there is no guide or tutorial so if you don't know you have to guess until you give up and google. Quit trying to play the game after trying to figure out how to assign prison staff. Not worth the money, not worth the time playing this game! Prison Architect is 10x better!			"
