												Hear me out on this game, it has its bugs and glitches which could ruin the game for you, however this game has shown me qualities that many like it don't have, this game has gotten me more emersed into what is going on in-game. Some positives are:1) Ship/Plane customization - I love this feature, it brings the most fun when you see a plane you named and built take out an A6M, P51, or a Spitfire, it just gives your fleets and squadrons more of a personalized touch to them that very few have.2) Bases - This can annoying but i love the feature of you building up your bases to help run the war effort, it is more intresting when you the Americans founded a base on Saipan or the Japanese founding a base in Alaska (That only happens in Free Campaign)  It gives you that tactical advantage if you take hubs like Hong Kong or San Diego, that very few give you.3) Production Line - This gives you the sense of building a War Machine by giving you the ability to build everything that you have at your disposal and have it all built, if you have the resources to do so, so if you wanted to build 20 ships of the Yamato Class Battleship go right ahead.The only negatives are from the constant crashes and bugs, like not being able to fight battles on certain maps etc, but aside from that, i love this gameNote: Steam this is for you, update the game to its newest patch or give it some upgrades, i would love to see this game without the bugs and glitches, it has the potential to become a cult classic if it was bug free.

												I played long before steam has kept records. After counltess hrs of play, I can confidently say this is an awesome concept with poor and unfinished programming. There were many great modders and community support for this game, I dont know if they are still  out there. I do remember there was an unofficial patch that made a lot of corrections, helped get rid of bugs and eventually made the game playable. I think the name of the mod was ""Germany Hannebu"" I believe the fault is in steam here, they should have had it overhauled before releasing it, just like numerous titles it had released this way (steam edition games) So as a summary, dont buy it from Steam but if you can find it elsewhere grab it.

												Man... PTOII for SNES was one of my fav games of all time. THousands of hours on that one no doubt about it. When I picked this up, I was literally overblown with joy with what seemed to be nostalgia from those days. Bugs though, man oh man bugs. Maybe not even bugs but unfinished/poorly implemented concepts (like the battles. Not somethign about the battles, the battles as a whole. What a wreck) Many fantastic ideas, I loved the supply system in this game, the recruiting system, the ship and plane building system, and the base system. They should have focused on the strategy side as there is great promise there; in my personal opinion 1)The battles 2)The bugs and 3)The AI totally do this game in. A shame too, because it had some potential.			"

												This game is by far the most complex Strategy game i've ever known. You are in charge of: Diplomacy, Science, Production, Logistics (Fuel, Ammo, to bases, Raw Materials from bases), Base Building, Command Structure, oh and of course fighting. The fighting takes place on a tactical 3d-map on which you can (and should) directly control every single unit, to make sure the bombs/torps hit for maximum effect.To be honest, this game with its complexity is really intimidating. But very rewarding as wel.If you read other comments, you will know that this game is a bug ridden pest. BUT, there is hope. The community is really awesome and they keep updating the game which seems to be abandoned by the devs. Look in the Community hub for the Unofficial Patch 1.71. You need this to be able to have any real fun with this game.They are still working on it and 1.8 is soon to be released.Right now it costs 70cent so there is no reson not to get it. Have fun!			"

												I'm sorry but i cannot recommend this game.The main reason is that it has more bugs than a outdoor lamp a summer day.Saved games that get corrupted, crashes, no matter how often you save you will lose your entire campaign sooner or later.There is no use playing a game that is impossible to finish.I WANT to like this game, but all the bugs and crashes forces me to not recommend it.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.At least if you value your sanity.This could of been an amazing game, but frankly as it is, it is a waste of money.This game crashes so often it is not funny. I have had it crash when saving, crash when exiting a 40 minute battle so you lose all that work.There could of been a good game here, but the devolper released it in an awful state and then stopped patching it before it was fixed.However if you can somehow crawl past the crashes and bugs you can have some fun.

												Seems like a fun game.Big open campaign map, choice to go wherever and attack whenever you want.Unit production, ammo production, tech-research, almost like Total War. But then their´s the micromanagement. You gotta do EVERYTHING. From Oil to fuel your ships and planes to the smallest MG-Bullet. You can set everything on auto-management for everybase, but then you only see dozen of ships drivin around, slowing down the game.And since you never know what exactly they do, you never know if everything is done right.This is de-activable in a so called ""Arcademode"", which supposedly makes it more like TW, you build the mine, it digs so much per month and at the end of the month you have the iron aviable without all this transport hysteria but then their´s still the battles...They are the most important part of this game and would have a lot of depth but they are soooooooooooooo sloooooooooooooooow.Wanna attack a port? Steer your fleet towards it for ten minutes. You can accelerate and slow down the time, which is helpful, especially since the game drops down to 5fps if you accelerate so high that your units would actually go faster.Now i see why this game only got average 50% from the press. Lucky i only paid 0,79€ for it.I advice you make a widespread research on its gameplay on Youtube about this game first, if you wanna buy it.PS: Just checked out the ""Arcade Mode"". Had about 30 american torpedo bombers attacking my Chitose aircraft-carrier with a widespread torpedo barrage.Not a single one hit. Because my 15,300 tons aircraft-carrier can now drive and turn around like a speedboat.In the second battle, six english light cruisers sunk my fleet of over 40 ships consisting of Destroyers, U-Boats, Heavy cruisers and Battleships. This seems even more legit if you know that i had the tec of radar supported artillery, which they didnt.			"

												First off, this game has it's ups and downs. I reccomend it because it IS quite fun and enjoably to play. HOWEVER, the main downside, is the fact that the game crashes with varying frequency, such as when too many units are in battle of a specific type-generally landing craft and tankers seem to cause this. It does vary however, seeing as a lot of the time, the game runs quite well. A second dislike I have is that the actual combat just feels too slow. Such as the fact that aircraft can take AGES to cross even the smaller maps.One other thing I don't like is the maximum units deployed, but, the upside is you can set the game to have up to 100 aircraft and 50 ships (destroyers, cruisers, battleships, submarines, carriers and so on)The graphics are pretty average. Not great or horrid, but just average. even at the highest settings. Although, i suppose it IS a pretty old game. Normally the graphics dont bother me too much, as long as they look finished, which, is achieved in this. Now for the positives:You are able to control just about any unit that is deployed in the game personally, ranging from the P-38 Lightning (personal favourite) to a Bf-109. You can even (to some degree) take command of a ship such as a destroyer, or battleship. Not many rts games have this feature, so it definitly is a highlight.In 'skirmish' (A.K.A 'battle planner') modes and multiplayer you can choose what units you will be wanting to deploy for the battle. This is done just before you begin a match, and is another interesting feature in the game. Being able to choose what aircraft and navy support you recieve is certainly an interesting factor. It has an unlimited amount of unit spots, so you can pretty much just swarm the enemy with bombers, that all get shot down, only to bring even more in for another wave. (say you deployed 30 bombers, only to watch them get shot down, you can have a MASSIVE backup army, although the deployment limit DOES hinder an all out swarm)There is quite a bit of strategy to this, although it does use the typical 'rock, paper, scissors' programming. (fighters against bombers are effective, bombers vs just about any ship, destroyers against fighters-most of the time anyway)The game ALSO has a campaign, although i havent looked into it myself, or at least, not for very long, so I can't really write much about that. Overall its a pretty good game (despite the random crashes) I'd definitely reccomend it to people that are really interested in WWII and the war in the pacific.Dragon out.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time! PTO2 for the SNES.  I ♥♥♥♥ myself with happiness when I found this modern day ""clone"" and bought it asap.  All the gameplay systems are laid out and there wonderful, just what I wanted from this game.  10/10But making it all work is the real killer for this game.  Somehow they completely FAILED to bug check this and that infuriates me!  It has EVERYTHING that I want, but it just doesn't work!5 hours of pain because this game has everything that I want.Edit:  1/28/2017Just re-installed to give it another chance.  Crashed starting a new game.  Quickly deleted once again.  It didn't even have the dignity to crash all the way, still had the game music playing.  Was forced to CTL ALT DEL and find it in the background programs to stop it.			"

												This game would be the greatest game I've ever played if there were not so manny bugs, crashes and CORRUPT SAVES. Seriously how is it even possible to programm a game so bad like Pacific Storm. I get every 10 to 15 minutes a crash. It crashes when staring a battle, it crashes when exiting a battle, it crashes when saving or it creates a corrupt save so when you are loading your old save game after an other crash it says: nope **** you, the save game is not working.I've tried different patches (even the ones created by the community) but none of them are fixing these issues.So please don't buy this game unless the ""developers"" of this game patch the game so its actually running alright			"

												I purchased the retail CD box of Pacific Storm several years ago.  I could install the retail CD to Windows XP, but not install the game to Windows 7 or 10.  The retail CD version of the game functioned perfectly fine, but once patched it did not and became quite unreliable.  Nevertheless, I believe that the game ""Pacific Storm "" is a great concept.  It's been the best game that I have seen in 10 - 20 years involving the Pacific Campaign of WWII.  The only problem is that the developers and programmers never properly completed reliability testing of their product and after the first patch to it, it became completely unreliable.  To think that they went on to create Pacific Storm Allies (which I've found crashes just as much as Pacific Storm - i.e. after every tactical battle), I can only believe that it was a deliberate attempt to defraud the consumer market.  When video game manufacturers create pretty products designed only to steal your money and no one holds them accountable for their crooked activities, then don't get upset when I quit purchasing your products.  Steam also bears responsibility in this regard for offering games that are known to not function properly, yet they still offer it for sale.  Steam should either fix the product before they offer it, or they shouldn't offer the game at all.  Otherwise, they are also a part of the problem (greed), because they knowingly offer a broken product and are making money from it.  No amount of money is worth a game that crashes every time you try to play it.			"

												If you didn't like the first one, you will like this even less. Same game, but with allies. Miserable graphics and clunky interface. Couldn't find bugs - thankfully, but for all the time spent making movies for this and their other games, you think they could have improved the extremely unappealing and confusing menus. Half of the screen shots are movie stills. You can judge for yourself if you like the quaility by looking for the screenshots with the GUI present in them - that's from the game - the others are from movies if you don't see a GUI in the picture.And what really angered me, is that after I exited this lame game (I guess this is a bug) it didn't send an ""exit"" to Steam so it kept me logged into it and I loss playtime credit on another game I actually liked. Sooo, I guess that is good because it got me off my tush to write this review and warn you before you made the mistake and spent money on this. Maybe, I will get some karma from helping you.			"

												Another strategy game I would have loved to like, but could not. Great promise, mediocre execution. I.e. this covers the entire pacific war setup, on both tactical and strategic level, but unfortunately is riddled by rather mediocre visuals and certain bugs. You may still want to give it a try, if you like this type of wargame or are specifically interested in the pacific war setups. But you have to expect something unpolished, which may crash on you pretty frequently (for me this seemed related to the amount of units, which basically made it unplayable in the later phase). Also, the mix of tactical and strategic does not really work out - you may constantly win a battle on automatic, but lose it on the tactical, or vice versa, due to the way the participants for a tactical battle are selected from the strategic forces.Depth: DetailedSetting: Pacific WarType: Strategic/TacticalMy Rating: 5 out of 10 (without the crashes/bugs might get 8 of 10).

												It's a great game, if it didn't crash most of the time. No way to change your controls too.It has a steep learning curve and when I mean steep, I mean STEEP. There are a lot of button that you have to click before you do this or do that, it's very complex and not for those who are just out to spawn in a bunch of ships and planes on a map and make a battle so huge, that your PC would explode for the sheer amount of ♥♥♥♥ going on.An otherwise great game ruined by game-breaking bugs and crashes. And did I mention you couldn't change your controls?Recommend only buying on sale and/or if you're determined to overlook this game's flaws and have patience because it might crash every now and then.
