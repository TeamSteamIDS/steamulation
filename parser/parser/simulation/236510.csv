												""Meet the game that brings back the tactical FPS shooter""...When in development this game promised to bring back the tactical shooter. It brought it back but not in a good way. There are so many problems with this game. It is a buggy mess. Gameplay is: Peak around corner, shoot dumb enemy. Move to next room. Peak around another corner, shoot enemy. Move to next room, peak around corner and get shot. Take control of team mate. Move to next room, crash due to game ruining bug... Haha fun isn't it?Good stuff:-Made me excited when seeing for first time.Bad stuff: -Made me cry when playing for the first time.-Customisation doesn't work.-Bad A.I.-Glitchy mess.-Boring.-Overpriced (devs should pay you to play).-Doesn't work.- I could go on for an hour about how bad this is. -2/10			"

												Takedown: Red Sabre was supposed to revive the tactical shooter genre but it failed miserably after the publisher forced the developers to release the game before it was anywhere near finished. The game had initially gotten over $221,000 from Kickstarter supporters but the final product wasn't anything like the developers had envisioned. This game was launched before it was anywhere near completed, by the company's own admission, in a cash grab by the publisher. Do not buy it. The company has moved on to new projects like Epsilon and this game is no longer supported, meaning that the developers do not intend to release further patches or content for it.A summary of the situation is below.

												Do you like ultra hardcore realistic tactical shooters that border on masochistic, giving you the ability to pretend you're a military genius capable of clearing an entire room of enemies with a single bullet ricocheting off walls?Don't get this game, buggy, unresponsive and downright crap. The AI is barely functional and has the incredible ability to spot and kill you through walls. Constantly. Moving a single step even crouched can alert an entire map to your position. Endlessly trawling through dull, drab environments looking for the solitary last enemy alive only to be sniped with a pistol through several brick walls across the map IS NOT FUN. Dropping an Action Man in to a blender and recording it in Slow-Motion is definitely more fun than this. Save your £3.99 for anything else.**Not literally anything.			"

												So I got this game as a gift recently.  Even as a free gift from a friend, this game is not worth playing.Giving your friend a gift of this game is akin to giving him a boxed present that is filled to the brim with droppings from a variety of different animals combined.Where can one begin on a game of so many failed things?The controls are stiff and uncomfortable, to start off.  Think ""Rainbow Six"", except not good.  Movement is a chore and no matter how slow you move, the AI seems to detect you through eight layers of concrete and steel without problem, even though you are making no noise on your end - The disconnect between what you hear and what the enemies can hear is severely disruptive.  You can move faster, but it does not help, nor is it advised.  You will always run straight into one of the AI juggernauts I will cover shortly.  The gunplay is abhorrent; barely tolerable. Every weapon feels, handles, and operates the same way (no differentiation between firearms) and are thoroughly  unenjoyable to use or fire.  The sounds are bland, stock, generic. . . etc.  Any word you can imagine to describe forgettable sounds applies here.  I can't think of a single sound that made me feel immersed, excited, thrilled, or anything you would WANT to feel about sound.  The sound design in this game is on par with Rainbow Six.  That game came out in 1998.  And so we get to the most offensive part of this game: the AI.  The enemy AI, if you would even stoop so low to call it that, is beyond unbelievable.  Not in the positive way, either.  It's so bad it needs its own paragraph to discuss it.  My average experience in this game upon loading a match up is seeing the first enemy in the level, maybe 15 seconds in, go from looking away from me, to instantly rotating 90 degrees towards me in a single frame, and then proceeding to headshot me from 50 feet away, ending my game instantly.  They will either stand still and eat bullets for you, or annihilate you mercilessly and without a single modicum of realism in their actions.  There is no middle ground.  These are hellish terminators bent on the destruction of humankind, loaded up with aimbot and wallhack software, yet with nearly absent pathfinding and tactical skills.  They are idiot savants who are expert marksmen yet walk into walls and freeze up upon trying to navigate the infinitely difficult obstacles of a simple wooden doorway.This is not a fun game.  This is barely even a game.  I have difficulty in believing that people intentionally made something this horrid.  I went into this wanting to like it, I truly did.  It had the heritage of Rainbow Six and tactical squad gameplay behind it, devs who wanted to do the old series justice, and the potential that new technology and a fresh perspective could have brought to the genre.  Instead, I was assaulted by an unplayable monstrosity that should have been put down by the evil scientists who created it before it broke loose from their lab.After playing a while with my friend who gifted me the game, the only redeeming values I found about the entire game were these:""Well, the models look pretty good.""""Aw dude, I can see your flashlight when you shine it.  That's awesome.""When the only things I can commend about your work are the above, you know you have problems.I do not recommend purchasing this game.  Indeed, if you're reading this, go somewhere else for your tactical action needs.  They will not be satisfied here.			"

												It was a dark stormy night... I had nothing going on but Twitch Streamers and Snicker candy bars. It was a peaceful night until I see the message. ""You have 1 new item in your inventory"" it read. I scream with joy for this is the first gift anyone has ever sent me. I open it and see the game ""Takedown Red Sabre"" with the message saying ""Hey man, this is the greatest game ever on stream. Graphics are high quality, gameplay is realistic, and the AI is the best! Enjoy!"" - my ex-friend. I click install and the game only took 5 seconds to download because it was only 25mbs in size. I launch the game and this...is my story.The first thing I had done was click on the graphics options ( so I can disable certain settings because at the time, I had a DELL Inspirion, the greatest laptop NA ) and configure it to my liking until my friend messages me saying ""Just max out the settings, you can handle it"" I get a bit confused for my PC at the time wasn't the greatest but I just simply followed his orders and started the game. The first thing I had noticed was that the graphics were the worst thing I had ever seen in my life. Poor player models, lame effects, and dirty textures. I thought to myself ""Well maybe this game is in beta????"" ... I was wrong. I start to move around and I noticed that my AI teammates were braindead. They never followed me when ever I gave them the order to, they never shot until I was killed, and best of all they never even bothered giving me intel on where the enemy had been. So I simply walk by my self down the flight of stairs until I see an enemy. He startled me so I fired... I missed and at that moment, I knew I had ♥♥♥♥ed up. He slowly turns to look at me and then he fires once at my leg. My player stutters then collapses to a fatal position.... He was dead. I scratch my head and wonder exactly what in the actually ♥♥♥♥ just happened. The game is so ♥♥♥♥, that every single weapon kills you in 1 BULLET. No matter where you are shot, the bullet will just kill you. I started to rage so I quit the game at 0.5 hrs completed.This will be a game, I will never play ever again. Please, I beg of you, do not buy this game under any circumstances.			"

												This game should not be classified as a game, as it is an unfinished product a later alpha at best, if you have the misfortune of owning it, look in the games main folder it says ""Early Access"" that should tell you the amount of effort alone. The AI can range from completely stupid, to unrealistically accurate, the game is riddled with various menu bugs, such as when you choose a level you don't always get the level you choose, and in addtion the inventory system rarely saves. I could never recomend this ""Game"" to anyone espically when the games it clams to be based off are vastly superior, even now Swat 4 is a better game, a 2004 game is better then this, even Swat 3 is better because it's AI was at least competent as far as team AI goes, IE: Checking corners by leaning.And the biggest culprit of all to this bad game is the devlopers who blame their community for ""Not being hardcore enough"" they don't even have the gumption to admit their game is severely underdevloped compaired to the games they ""Based"" their game off of. If your thinking of buying this, just don't there are at most 3 servers if you are lucky, mostly none though.			"

												WARNING!! ****  DO NOT BUY ****While this game is relatively inexpensive, it is priced far too high for its level of quality, and should be avoided.  The game was not finished prior to launch and it remains laden with bugs and missing/broken features.  Serellan (the developer) was never able to get dynamic shadows to function properly, even with the help of the game engine's developer, so the game's lighting is a bit off.  Physics are a joke, characters do some strange things when they're killed and ragdoll physics take over, and the resulting odd behavioir is probably the only positive thing about the game because it might give you a laugh.  Artificial intelligence of the enemy was ""better than Chuck Norris"" ridiculous when the game launched, and friendly AI is borked in the opposite direction, effectively eliminating any sort of ""tactical"" feel to the game.  It plays like a really bad knockoff of a really bad game.  Spend your money on something developed by someone that is capable and willing to produce a quality indie title.  Setting $15 on fire and watching it burn would be more entertaining and worthwhile.* NOTE: It appears the new Steam tagging system is subject to heavy censorship/moderation.  Every negative ""popular"" tag seems to have been scrubbed.  Do publishers & game developers have a say as to what tags are ok and what must be removed?  I sure hope not...			"

												Alright. Okay. Hear me out. This game's got some flaws. The movement is kinda clunky and the hit detection is a bit off. BUTWhat I'm trying to say here is that there's been a little bit of unfair criticism goin' on here. The brunt of it has been on this game's AI. People say it's ""bad."" But ask yourself this before you count yourself among them. What if this game just features the most advanced enemy morality system ever devised in a video game?      What if, that time an enemy shot your teammate then stared at you doing nothing, what if he was simply, at that moment, being overwhelmed with the crushing reality of the fact that he'd just killed a human being? And you shot him in the face, didn't you? You didn't even think about it. You chalked it up to ""bad AI.""      That terrorist got up this morning, just like you did, put on his beret, kissed his wife and kids, and left for work. His oldest daughter had just gotten into that college she loved. His little boy had show-and-tell that day at school. He was bringing his dad's fatigues in to show off to his friends. He drove to work, just like he had every other day. He said heartfelt ""good mornings"" to all his colleagues. Jim's wife had gone into labour the day earlier and given birth to a baby girl; Jim's shift ended in two hours. He was going to see her. Tom was the one who always took care of the plants around the office. He didn't mind; it brought a smile to his face. A typical Thursday.      They grabbed their bombs and headed out to their routine day of terrorism. Jim and Tom sat around playing cards. Tom couldn't ever seem to win; he just liked playing because he got to hang out with Jim. He couldn't know that this was the last time he would ever see him.      A frag grenade landed on Jim's lap. A flash of light and a deafening boom. Jim's body had been torn apart by shards of metal before he could react. Tom just sat there, eyes wide, cards still gripped in his hands, just trying to understand what had happened to his friend Jim. As he turned, he saw two more of his coworkers cut down by the SWAT team that was now entering the room. There had been no screams, no chance to cry out. Tom raised his weapon and fired, surprising himself. He hadn't even remembered picking it up. One of the SWAT officers crumpled to the floor, one last monosyllable escaping his lips. Tom stood there over the man, mouth slightly open. He'd done this. He'd killed this man. Why? For what? He hadn't meant to. He didn't even know the man's name. Tom turned toward the other officers, raising his hands. ""No, I didn't mean to, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, please.""      He would have said these things. He would have calmly knelt down and been handcuffed and gone quietly. He would have lived the rest of his life a shell of a man, haunted by the memories of his friends, gone in the blink of an eye one Thursday. He would have done a great many things. But he wasn't given the chance. Tom was shot thirteen times by the remaining SWAT officers. He was dead before he heard the shots.       10/10 best game 2014			"

												TakeDown:RedSabrethis game promised to bring back tactical shooters and re-invent a now dead genre. Needless to say that this is not the case. lets break down why the game is so bad.Gameplay:Terrible squad and enemy Artificial intelligence. they spend more time shooting at walls than each other.Meaningless customization: Three different armor types and multiple weapons that behaive exactly the same.The enemies can one shot kill you, no matter where they hit you regardless of armor.Interface:very difficult to traverse menus.Lack of visual settingsMisc:Good luck setting up multi-player for friends.Now lets look at some other points. The price is currently set at $5.49 CDN, this is still way to much to buy this game for, in fact this is a game that you should not even accept as a gift. I bought 4 copies of this game for $5.49 TOTAL, so that my friends could suffer along with me.and finally let me remind you of the awards section of the store page. (with my own commentary in brackets)AwardsFPS Guru - Pax Prime'13 Most InnovativeThe Most Innovative award is yet another indie title (Step your game up pax....). One of the great things about indie games is they always manage to be unique and bring something new to the table (Not always good). They're able to take the risks that triple A companies aren't. This is a company that has made the decision to skip following the generic shooter genre, let's get rid of levels(Maybe this is why there are only four maps...) , noob tubing, and throw in tactics (if by tactics they mean boredom) and strategy (and by strategy they mean endless buyers remorse) instead. Serellan LLC certainly deserves this award for (Ruining) their tactical shooter, Takedown: Red Sabre. (The name of the game also doubles as a request to valve)Takedown: Red Sabre encourages the player to communicate with their team mates (by yelling at the npcs for walking into walls)  and take on each mission differently (in exactly the same fashion) , in their hope to survive. don't expect to be running and gunning down the hallways, because (good luck finding anyone to shoot) there's no respawning(apart from the fact that you turn into team mates after death). It's a (Dis)pleasure to see a return to the tactical shooter and what appears to be a(n) (un)successful return. Once I got my hands on Takedown: Red Sabre it was difficult to stop. (Because the menus wouldent let you.)			"

												Fakedown: Red Gaybre is a game where:-You fall half a metre and die of ebola and coronary heart disease-The AI brings a sniper with a scope to a CQB scenario-The terrorists are actually super mutants with super hearing who are angry at their creators 'cause they can sure as hell hear you creeping 3 rooms away-You have 3 speeds of travel;walking,brisk-walking(wtf) and sprinting-They give you a butt-load of SMGs and ARs but only one sniper and shotgun. But who cares 'cause we can't tell the difference-Enemy bullets are like anti-goodguy bullets which will disintegrate your HEAVY armor and straight out kill you.-You have to use task manager to quit the game-You regret buying the game eventhough you got it for free-The pistols look like they have dwarfism+You get trading cards. Dats cool i guess+You have a great time laughing with friends in the training missions but lose them once you start playing the actual missions+You can put flags on your armor.

												I might say that this game is mediocre.The concept is cool, I like the idea on bringing back the old school hardcore fps shooter style...but there are so many lacks on the system in its complexity.There were a lot of problems with the developing on this game...the publisher wanted to release the game as soon as possible..and the developers were at half of the project probably.As we can see the I.A. of this game is very poor...at it works as if you're behind the enemy, the enemy won't see you but if you're on the enemy's angle of view...you're screwed..BUT..you could fool the system by hiding with the Q and E keys behind a wall, and they will basically ignore you..The graphics is really horrible even if we consider that it has been developed with the UT graphics engine..and we fairly know that the lightining of that engine are extraordinary.Here on most levels the lightining is set on an horrible state...but it's good in HQ's environment...so we could understand that there has been completely a lack of time for the developers...they could have done a better work if they had more time.[Sorry for eventual mistakes, I'm 15 and english is not my native language.]			"

												""Takedown: Red Sabre is largely unfinished but may have potential if it was finished""As a fan of tactical FPS games such as Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and Arma I was excited to hear about Takedown: Red Sabre. Unfortunately, the game failed to live upto the hype, which was promised by the developers, as being a realistic tactical FPS. In almost every area of the game it's clear to see that the game was rushed with apparently no time spent whatsoever for polishing or improving the game before it's release.In terms of gameplay, majority of the game is actually there but it's poorly implemented. Enemies range from being completely unaware of you to being deadly accurate. The friendly AI is almost completely lacking, which makes singleplayer completely unenjoyable. However, the game's core mechanics are in fact there, which means that there is a small amount of fun to be had if you choose to play the game with friends. But be aware, there is no way to create private matches and there are no online games available at all at the time of writing this review. If you can live with some 'small' niggles such as the unbelievably slow walking speed, the fact that any height can kill you and the AI the game is playable but it just doesn't live up to what the developers promised.The level design is one of the few aspects of the game that appears to have been properly thought out with levels that feature tight hallways and open spaces which might create a tactical FPS if the game's mechanics were equally polished. The graphics aren't terrible (on low settings) and even lower end machines should be able to handle the game pretty easily.Overall, Takedown: Red Sabre is largely unfinished but might have some potential to live up to it's promises if someone took the time to finish it and give it the polish it desperately needs.

												Does man deserve perfection?     Such a question has been passed for centuries, reaching the farthest inquiries and the sharpest of minds. If man does not have perfection, it will strive to one day create it. Such is the pursuit of happiness. When pleasure takes presidence in the human mind and perfection has been sought for a millenia, what beautiful creation may be spawned? Man made a gem.      A ruby.      A radiant pearl in the depths of sorrow and distraught.     A gleaming beacon of hope in a dark sea of dissatisfaction.     A flawless painting that picques the picassos. Man made Takedown: Red Sabre.     An enigma wrapped in golden silk, Takedown draws you in with its deep character customization, and limitless combinations of weapons and attachments. At the main menu alone, I was at first overwhelmed with the flood of paths I could begin on. Luckily for us all, the God-crafted tutorial helps to soften the blow of the numerous gamemodes and maps. With a simple and stylish interface, Takedown takes you for a ride, yet holds your hand and still kisses you during it, whispering words of encouragement as it occassionally nibbles at your ear.      Once in-game, you'll find the stunning realism to it all. After my first kill, I balled up my fist and held it over my mouth, turning from the screen. Moisture tickled the corners of my eyes, and I found myself shaking without end. The sound of the bullet, the scream of pain, and the thud of a lifeless being left me sighing in distress. For a moment, I truly believed that I had taken the life of another human being.       As you slowly make your way from corridor to corridor, you can almost feel the weight of your armor bearing down on you. Your comrades are with you though, and the bonds you form with one another will follow you until you exhale your last breath. As time progresses, you feel much like a spider, spinning beautiful gossamer to create an oh-so fragile web of emotions with your squadmates.     Rick ""The Stick"" Flick is a wild card, but has a soft spot when it comes to those he cares about. With a family photo in his locker and his locket, he's commited to those he brought into the world, and gentle with the woman he loves more than himself.     Feanus is emotional, quick to anger, but a loyal man regardless. His friends come first and that's the bottom line. Bullets or bickering, nothing will ever tear apart a bond that Feanus has built up. Known to be a bit fiesty, he keeps his pipop up on the front lines, and never lets his anger interfere with whatever mission is at hand.     Laffy Taffy is a quiet man, tired of the war he's endlessly fought, both in himself, and on the battlefield. An honest soldier trying to get by, he always seems to have a mission to be done, and a task for his gun. Although he seems little more than a melancholy soldier, Laffy Taffy has an easily brought out smile, and a grin that can turn the world jovial again.     And then there's you. Will you make a name for yourself? Will you put your life on the line over and over again and see to it that your loved ones see tomorrow? Will you take arms and fight for your brothers, your family, and your home? Will you gun your way through countless murderers, terrorists, and thieves to rid the world of filth?To be honest, you probably shouldn't.			"

												This game had a lot of promise. The concept was solid. A tactical thinking-man's shooter. The dream come reality in 2014 fell short compared to a game made in 2005, SWAT 4.My biggest complaint is the AI is embarrassing. The enemy AI is oblivious. It never seems to respond to sound or much of the happenings in the environment. Only event that causes them to spring into action is if they catch the player visually in their line-of-sight. Additionally, the animations of enemies are robotic.As for the friendly AI, they are completely brain-dead. There are no real commands! You can tell them to stay and follow. Not look over there! Not stack up on this doorway! Not toss a flashbang in and clear! Nothing!I really wish this game lived up to my expectations, but it didn't. I cannot recommend it. Your time and money would be better spent on its inspirations, SWAT 4 and Rainbow Six.			"

												This game is terrible. Mechanics are ♥♥♥♥, visuals are ♥♥♥♥, AI is ♥♥♥♥, and nobody even plays at all ever. So good luck trying to even find a game online. Save your money. At $15 this is highway robbery. At $1.50 this is a waste of $1.50. If this was free to play, it would be a waste of your time to bother with it.1/10 -- would not ever recommend. Unless you paid me, in which case for a few hundred dollars I *might* give it a 3.P.S. If you are wondering about my play time: Yes I played it for 15 minutes on this account -- that was enought itme for me to get through the tutorial and play two rounds on an official server.  It really doesn't take long to see how terrible it is, and I'm sure you can tell by my review: it really wasnt worth any more time.It should tell you something that the videos for this in the store page show mediocre review snippets, and doctored images that aren't from the game itself.

												I purchased Takedown: Red Sabre back when it was around a dollar, guessing it be a capable, perhaps minimalistic first-person, tactical shooter, qualities I tend to occasionally enjoy and recommend, but in place of an entertaining romp through room clearing and CQC, I instead received an underwelming mix-match of unfinished ideas and interesting concepts.	Using Takedown's 'spiritual predecessors,' the Rainbow Six series and SWAT 4 -whose demos are still available online, as the standards for tactical shooters, Red Sabre falls a little short.	Starting with the mission select screen, the lack of a planning stage means the player is left to begin the mission blind as to the mission objective, general routes, and overall level design. Yes, several vague objectives are posted in the form of a style-over-substance video overlay, but their possible locations, numbers, and significance are all still left unknown or murky. A realistic estimation of the cloud of combat and the limitations of simple surveillance? Not really, seeing as all three of these aspects are sensible targets of approximation during the inevitable observations that occur prior to sending in tactical teams...Right? A simple, pre-mission map with rough outlines and selectable routes would be wonderful, as would some form of dialogue between squad and commander to answer any lingering mission details.	On the topic of missions, the actual mission objectives, considering Red Sabre's apparent tactical roots, are surprizingly bland and simplistic in nature, echoing the desires of a standardized checklist, rather than the actual SWAT operations they wish to emulate. Missing are the dynamic hostage rescues with captive/captor dialogue and potential loss of life due to the explosive nature of such echanges. Even compared to the earlier SWAT series, Takedown's missions are devoid of the atmospheric tension maintained through periodic use of covnversation and ambient comments.	    Then, when actually playing a mission, several basic capabilities are absent, namely squad manipulation and regular status updates. In place of a context menu or other useful method of commanding your team, a simple hold toggle and ROE wheel are offered, both of which obfuscate the all-essential room clearing, as your team is always behind you, in turn rendering useless the more elaborate levels with their multitude of cover and choke points, as your teammates will never actually take strategic positions or utilize flanks, and complicating simple matters of spacial awareness as our mates tend to vanish when not verbally announcing enemies, their virtual minds dead set on maintaining unnecessary radio silence. The ability to investigate, both physically and visually through your squadmates: rooms, towers, corners, windows, doors, would be a monumental improvement, as would simple formation and movement commands.	This brings into light, your squad's strange lack of communication. Yes, the AI announces spotted enemies, but that's seemingly the extent of their communicative ability. Positions, actions, general side-chatter, are all absent, replaced instead with a wall of silence and death. While the latter is more a subset of mood setting and tone, the former two topics of conveyance are important aspects of movement and firing maneuvers, as proper placement of suppression and flanking teams must be confirmed before performance. That, and the awkwardness of having to spin your character around to check their periodic status, when enemies are everpresent, is painful. The movie, Way of the Gun, provides a fun example of firefight communication, as do several article by dslyecxi, a founding member of ARMA's ShacTac.	    Lastly is a breakdown of the player's ironically standard moveset, given the advances in recent game design and Takedown's desire to be both modern and tactical. The player is limited to a digital lean, without a stepout or means of truly examining corners and bends, two digital stances, without any real cover system, nonexistent damage modeling -foot shots are instakills, and strangely simplified gun mechanics. As stated by its own developer, Red Sabre's crippled lean was intentional, but as demonstrated in RavenShield, fully analog leaning and stance change are possible, and with a reticule present -reticules being a sensible representation of the mental focal point one references when looking around and not the fabricated, game-world only gimmick some make it out to be btw, returning fire is possible so long as the weapon is locked to the view, an equally sensible representation, given SWAT behavior. The application of such a system would allow for full realization of the environment, window avoidance, and improved surveillance, aspects only improved upon by a fluid cover system, one that allows, at least in its most basic form, temporarily full coverage from fire, as shown in Red Orchestra and even Killzone or Perfect Dark, but in a more advanced form, with some manner of controlled cover migration. Exemplified in games like Receiver and the aforementioned Orchestra, gun mechanics can be rather complex without seeming overwhelming, so long as they're presented intuitively. Ammo checking, magazine management, individual component manipulation, bracing have therefore all been implemented in the past and have helped in pulling player skill and concentration away from reflexes and placing them on planning and execution.	    Along with several prevalent, submitted glitches, involving firing, aiming, and stance freezes, I hope the above mentioned points help illuminate the fact that, while not the horrid abomination some have made it out to be, Takedown: Red Sabre is at its best underdeveloped and at its worst, unfinished, statuses that could effectively be remedied via patches and/or modding. 	Looking into the history of Red Sabre, it would seem Takedown's developer, Serellan, started a KickStarter to create a certain type of product of a certain calibre, and after raising a fair amount of money -over $220,000, released a product of subpar qualities, even after praising their own past experience and ability. That's just frustrating and unprofessional.			"

												AwardsFPS Guru - Pax Prime'13 Most InnovativeThe Most Innovative award is yet another indie title. One of the great things about indie games is they always manage to be unique and bring something new to the table. They're able to take the risks that triple A companies aren't. This is a company that has made the decision to skip following the generic shooter genre, let's get rid of levels, noob tubing, and throw in tactics and strategy instead. Serellan LLC certainly deserves this award for their tactical shooter, Takedown: Red Sabre. Takedown: Red Sabre encourages the player to communicate with their team mates and take on each mission differently, in their hope to survive. Don't expect to be running and gunning down the hallways, because there's no respawning. It's a pleasure to see a return to the tactical shooter and what appears to be a successful return. Once I got my hands on Takedown: Red Sabre it was difficult to stop.so, how much did you pay FPSGuru to say that?			"

												I was really looking forward to this title. Personally, Rainbow Six Rogue Spear was among the first games i ever played.The game was funded on kickstarter with a goal of $200,000. Alas, it didn't live up to its expectations. Takedown Red Sabre vs Rainbow Six and SWAT First of all, it's not really that tactical. In Rainbow Six and SWAT you could review the layout of the level before starting, listen to the briefing, take advice from specialists etc. You would get a roaster of units to choose from - all having their portraits and biographies. Not only were those games tactical, they were very atmospheric.In this game you are just walking around as a nameless 3D model. You cannot command your teammates (other than basic follow or stop), you cannot switch to them, you cannot even choose their loadout.Honestly, the only bond between these games is the fact that everybody dies easily. Content It only offers 6 levels, one of which is a tutorial level.

As for weapons - 7 primary weapons and 3 pistols.http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Takedown:_Red_Sabre I simplified to account for all the clones. Issues Loadout customization is kind of bugged as well. Also, they have this thing - every scope except for holographic has a disturbing zoom in effect. Whatever effect they wanted to mimic, they shouldn't have. It's completely unnecessary and frustrating.The AI isn't that great either - neither your teammates' or enemies'. In fact, making allies follow you is not advisable, you are much better using them as extra lives. As for the enemy, these guys, while deadly, can still miss at point black range.Multiplayer and coop weren't working for some time, and when they did, they game died out. Conclusion I really think that $200,000 is just not enough to fund something worthy of being called a spiritual successor to Rainbow Six and SWAT. The game was made on Unreal engine, which requires quite a lot to license. Additionally, they probably spent quite a lot of their budget on weapon licensing.On top of that, the pricing of the game was only 15$. In the end, the game has too many problems that need to be fixed. It's not really superior to the rainbow six or swat in any way, even graphical, so you are better off playing the old games. They really nailed that ""everybody dies easily"" part, but the rest - enemy AI, game's depth, content, some game design choices, not so much. It's very shallow and just not worth your time.			"

												Note: To see  this review in it's true form go to: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/03/game-takedown-red-sabre.htmlI hate to have to give this game a bad review because a friend gave me this game for free, but the game is just not good. Where to start? First Single player is a no-go because your team ""AI"" is 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. they react in slow-mo and always end up dead in seconds. to make matters worse the enemy AI all have aim-bot, as soon as they see you, they hit you and mainly in the head or other critical areas.This alone makes single player impossible and boring as heck. The next thing you will notice is the sub par visuals and animations. you walk as slow as a turtle and even when sprinting you don't go that fast. once while leaning out of cover the game starting auto-leaning my player left and right, left and right. i had to shut it down and restart for it to stop. other times my screen would go red and blurry for no reason at all, once again only going away when i shut the game down. the weapons sound like crap, and even the animation for the guns is horrible. you'll feel like you are shooting a paintball gun not a colt M4 Carbine that the US Marines use.To make matters worse the game seems to have been set up to be released in Early access version, but then later for some reason the Devs decided to call it a day. what prove do i have of this? well other than the obviously un-finished gameplay, there is a folder in your steamapps called ""Takedown Red Sabre Early access"" . what more prove that the devs are desperate to sell this game? well, with each purchase you get TWO copies of the game that's right two for one! except the game still sucks, the only way i could see this ever being a reasonable purchase is if you get it for a Dollar or lower.Do yourself a favor and don't waste $15.99. if you need even more prove of how bad the game is just check out the reviews on steam. they ain't pretty,""Red Sabre was the single biggest disappointment of the past 2 years for me""  ""They sold an unfinished game, but advertised it as finished"" and most of them start along the lines of ""STOP, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!""  and it has a 2.6 Metascore based on 126 reviews.  seriously, spare yourself the horrors of this game.

												This has got to be the worst FPS I have ever played, made by one of the most childish developers imaginable. They froze threads on thier forums containing any opinions differing from their own, and on the steam forums they did much of the same thing. The game was released as an unplayable mess and to this day continues to be a nail in the Realistic-FPS genre's coffin. I grew up loving rainbow six and SWAT and prefer realistic shooters to generic fps games however I cannot reccommend this to anyone. It handles like a broken tricycle and has the most rediculous AI I have ever seen, some moments they cannot hear your bullets whiz by them point blank and others they can pick you off with 360 no scopes. STAY AWAY from this garbage, the rating is there for a reason.			"

												I see people hating on this game, but lets give actual reasons for why this game is bad okay?I'll start off with the pros, then move to the cons.The overall design direction is something that I honestly really liked.You get one life, a multitude of weapons to choose from, and you can experience this with your friends through different missions that will test your skill, ability to communicate as a team, and planning. The maps feel rather well laid out, and don't really detract from what this game is.\The difficulty that is presented with the AI also feels good, the enemies have very realistic bullet damage, so when going up against them, its quite based on if you can outsmart the AI.There is also a map editor that got placed into the game, haven't used it myself, but thats pretty cool!What does detract from it?Number one thing for me, is how clunky the controls feel, I can work around everything else, but controls feeling weird are honestly just a no go from me.The way everything handles just doesn't feel smooth in the slightest, so honestly most of the times I died honestly felt like they could be chocked up to how poorly it felt like it controlled. If you want to make a game difficult and challenging, go for it, but combine difficulty with poor handling and all you manage to create frustration. If difficulty is done right it can make players strive to beat the challenge.The game also makes a few missteps in how enemies and objectives are spawned. The objective and replayability of the game comes into play with how the arena should change, because the missions you're engaging in are as quick reaction to situations, so you wouldn't be going in knowing anything besides Maaaybe the floor plan of the buildings.But this gets negated when objectives spawn in the same places no matter what.Here's a place where a system like what Payday 2 has, where buildings have certain features that get randomized every time you load up a new match, would be amazingly beneficial and would go miles for replayability.I also praised the enemies a little earlier, however I should mention they're honestly very stupid, the designers managed to get around this slightly by placing all the enemies facing towards where the player would most likely appear in front of them, but still, there were situations where I managed to go behind an enemy and just follow them for a little while, so yeah, enemies are very unintelligent from my experience.Finally, the UI is fairly clunky and not very easy to manage, choosing a loadout honestly feels very weird, its been a long time since I played it, but it feels very unwieldy and hard to work with.I think the core idea of this game is definitely saveable, can this game be patched and fixed? If the controls could be made to be tighter, I would invest more time in this game, since I would honestly be able to enjoy the game. If there was more replayability through map randomization, then I think this could be a very competitive game instead of what it is in its current state.But as I was saying, the core idea is good, but the overall package doesn't really deliver since its not really a polished package. Stay away unless some of these things get fixed.			"

												I am a extremely big fan of the older tactical games. Especially Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. I loved that game. And still do. So when I found out that one of the creators was working on a new game I went nuts. I told all my friends to buy it, and most actually did because we had such fond memories of the older tactical shooter games that aren't really being made anymore. Needless to say, my friends now hate me. This game lacks in every front. Graphically, map-wise (everything is very empty), the gameplay itself isn't good at all. Technically it's a mess. The AI is atrocious. Please do not purchase this game.			"

												Takedown: Red Sabre does not feel like a finished product. The performance is horrendous yet calling the visuals ""basic"" would be putting it nicely. No settings can be changed in-game and all adjustments must be done at the main menu. There are only three levels of visual detail to select from and changing this requires a full exit and restart of the game. Beyond the rudimentary presentation there is a shortage of content and what's there barely feels like a game. There is a training mission that feels half-finished, and the rest of the missions make little effort to give any sort of context into the situation. You are simply thrown into arbitrary settings to kill unidentified enemies with perfect aim suffering from braindead AI to complete objectives that are never really justified beyond a simple briefing. Movement is stiff to a fault, weapons lack panache, and performing any action just feels awkward. The online multiplayer is unsurprisingly a ghost town and the handful of missions are no fun to play in single-player anyway. Even if you're still longing for a return to tactical shooters the likes of SWAT 3/4 or Rainbow Six, Takedown isn't what you're looking for and as much as you may want to like it the game is sure to disappoint.

												A gritty zombie survival set in a near distant future. In the early game you must raise your zerglings while last hitting minions to ensure you get maximum exp. The story has branching dialogue trees with strong moral choices, do you want to let Aiden go mental, or bide your time and unleash the power of your thu'um.Can you stop Hugo from destroying Arkham city?Will you let Benny get away with shooting you?Can you defeat the elite four?All these question can be answered by solving the games many puzzles, and rising up against the looming threat of the tyranids.On the specs side of the game, it made me purchase a fourth GTX titan to achieve the ultra quality. It burnt out my 64gbs of RAM. Before buying this game, remember to watercool your entire house, it heats up your GPU about ten times more than Far cry 3 on Ultra. "

												Give it a shot if you are really bored... Put prepare to be utterly disapointed as this game might make you wish you spent the few dollars on a cheeseburger or something... The developer is probably drowning his sorrow in alchohol because of how many negative reviews this thing got. Speaking of that where the hell did the good reviews for this game come from in the trailer? I mainly purchased it because it was sale for a buck which I kinda wish I spent on a few gumballs... The characters can go from being kickass to rookie which I hopefully assume is a way to make it look like their is somekind of skill system if any. Poor developer who made this game... I bet he knows how much it actually sucks. I tried likeing this game, and I kinda do... At least when the AI is not being complete ♥♥♥♥. But overal... If you want a game that you sink atleast 4 or 6 hours into, I would rather get something else. Sorry but its pretty bad game.			"

												To keep this review simple I will sum it up thusly.Takedown: Red Sabre was released in 2014 to revive the tactical shooter genere AND YET it plays like the alpha version of Rainbow 6: Raven Shield which was released in 2003.What R6:RS did for tactical shooters, setting the bar for mission planning and execution, Takedown fails miserably at. There is no mission map, no planning method, no meaningful squad control (only to shoot, or not, or hold posistion), the enemy AI always sees you while your squad MAY see them, all glass (from my experience) seems to be bullet proof, and suppressed weapons will still draw a lot of attention. i could go on but this game is pretty awful and there seems no inclination to fix it.Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery but I am pretty sure that UbiSoft and Red Storm would have rather not had this title try to emulate their well crafted game.

												［ＥＮ/ＦＲ］　That game is nothing more thanA SCAMWhy? First, the game is empty, nothing to do, the game-play is like a 1995's game, 2 monkeys lock in a room can do better in only 10 minutes....  Why i have really angry again the devs ? Because he told ''That will like be SWAT4'', He take the name of a awesome game to make people believe in his game, so he get money from a crowdfunding, and stop after....For now, he clearly say the game is canceled, but still in sale in Steam, still people can mistake and bought the game, If its wasen't a scam, the game would be already removed....For me, that one of the worst game i played in my life, even Delta Force 2 (1999) is better !If you are looking for a great SWAT game, play SWAT 4, that game is awesome, even the server are down and still no steam edition....Ce jeu, c'est pas difficile, C'est une arnaque pur et simple, pourquoi ?Déja parce que le jeu n'a rien, tout simplement, quelques map, quelques armes, bref 2 singes enfermer dans un bureau ferrait mieux en selement 10 minutes....Pourquoi je suis énervé contre les devs ? Pour avoir dit ''Le jeu sera comme SWAT4'', Prendre un nom de jeu comme ça, attirer des gens, pour ensuite faire un crowdfunding, ramasser de l'argent, et annuler le jeu derrière....Et maintenant, le jeu est clairement annuler, mais toujours en vente, encore une preuve d'arnaque, le jeu aurait déjà été retirer si ce n'etait pas une arnaque...C'est l'un des plus mauvais jeu auquel j'ai jouer, Delta force 2 est largement mieux (1999)Si vous cherchez un très bon jeu de SWAT, je recommende sérieusement SWAT 4, Ce jeu la, au moins, vaut vraiment le coup !

												Travel around the world to exotic locales with team Red Sabre, a team of operatives from various nations who seem to walk around at a pace no greater than your average, garden variety snail as you fight terrorists with some of the smallest handguns to have ever seen production. And employ real world tactics used by S.O.F. units, such as 'hacking' servers with your mind, and running in blind due to lack of any pre-mission planning.Non-existant squad A.I. which will call out targets and not engage, despite have a clear shot from a good firing position, despite having loosened the R.O.E. As well as blocking doorways and narrow corridors. They can't be issued any orders either.Terribad enemy A.I. which will pick off your A.I. squad members rather methodically from awkward positions as your squad never returns fire. They are also know to aimbot the crap out of anyone, anywhere, anytime.This game is wasted potential, and could have been so much better. Terrible singleplayer, but a decent co-op experience, if you can get passed all the shortcomings.			"

												I do like this game. It does have a long list of problems. Like, surprisingly bad for a game based on Unreal 3 Engine. The controls are clunky. The AI is clumsy on pathing, but very good on reacting to your sound (light armor and light gun make all the difference in CQB maps because of noise more than mobility/muzzle length. The AI of your teammates is almost non-existent, and incredibly disappointing, considering Christian Allen's pedigree.The interface is god-awful and forgets maps your selections every time you finish a round. It appears to forget your loadout selections too, but it doesn't (though sometimes I select a loadout and it doesn't work)And multiplayer? Well, no one plays this game. And if you try to make co-op multiplayer work, you'll find it won't connect without a whole lot of troubleshooting (use Tunngle.)All that being said, it is challenging. The bots don't mess around with their aim, and react very well to any noise you make (if they don't fail at pathing) When I first started playing, I felt proud if I could kill 20 people before I died. And without unlocks in the game, it lends itself well to having this kind of challenge and not being frustrating. I've had some really classic moments playing this game, and it can get REALLY intense at times.I have logged 29 hours in this game, and I still haven't beaten Cargo Ship or Facility. I still really like playing it!But... it's currently at a low price and it's a great deal if you want a challenging Tactical FPS. The bugs don't *break* the experience, but it helps to go into the purchase expecting to get a game that feels like it's still in Beta.			"

Broken (and at times, outright unfair) AI coupled with boring gameplay, stiff controls and underwhelming graphics even by 2014's standards.

												Design wise, not a bad attempt at a basic little tactical shooter. At £3.99 I wasn't expecting a masterpiece of game design, and I was fairly happy with the mechanics etc. It's a small scale game which doesn't require any real time commitment and you can pick it up and put it down as you please without losing any of the experience.However, there are game-breaking bugs such as crashes on loading screens. I've yet to come across anything that restarting the game won't fix, but if you aren't prepared to deal with this kind of thing (which is of course perfectly reasonable) don't buy this game. Personally, I don't really mind. Although like I say, people have every right to complain about it, as you're paying for a working product and getting something which doesn't work as it should.So, in summary, I quite like this game as an idea. HOWEVER, bearing in mind that really this is an unfinished product being sold as a finished one, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.			"

												Well, if you're expecting Rainbow Six or SWAT-like gameplay, run away.I really wanted to see this game succeed a few years back before it got released, but it never has, and probably never will. I remember back during initial launch it was almost impossible to join friends. It was plagued by awful AI and many problems. I relaunched it recently to see if anything has changed, and if it was playable. Well, it's playable, but the AI is still the absolute worst. I almost want to call VAC bans on the AI, due to their aimbot nature. And your team AI is absolutely laughable. When they aren't doing crouches because they missed leg day, they're mindlessly standing behind you staring at your back instead of actually functioning like a team. Given that you respawn as the next member of your squad if you happen to die, if that member happens to be standing right in the way of enemy fire you're going to die in 1 ms. Now repeat that two more times until game over.The presentation of the game initially seems nice. The voice acting is alright and the UI in the lobby is decent. Once you load into the map though, everything becomes lifeless and silent. It doesn't feel like anything more than assets pieced together with poor AI.It had a vision and initial promise, but the game failed to achieve it, and now we wonder what it could have been.(Oh, and it used to be sold for $15. Now it's $5, and I still think that's too much to pay. Get it at less than $1 or avoid it completely.)			"

												This game COULD HAVE BEEN a great classic shooter from the old days of Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon. However from day one this game is simply a laugh. Too many bugs and the worst AI make this just a complete failure. A shame really, cause if they would have released it as an Early Access the community would have still supported it. Don't buy this game and just go for Rainbow Six Siege, Ravenshield or the complete Ghost Recon collection instead.			"

												I've gotten this game for about $1.50 and to me, it's still not worth it.  I see some people defending this game and it always confuses me.  I'm all up for reviving the slow pace tactical game play but this game doesn't really offer anything good at all.  The squad function is minimal, only having two options for your squad.  There's squad movement and squad rule of engagement with only two options for each.  There's hold and follow then aggressive and defensive.  Just the barebones for controlling your squad.  You can't tell them to throw any grenades, clear rooms, breach doors, just barebones.  Also, only 6 maps.  It isn't much at all but at least the maps look somewhat nice.  Let's talk about the AI.  I know that this game is suppose to be played with 3 other people but this game is absolutely dead and no one wants to play it.  Your teammates just stand there and get shot at.  They're absolutely useless when it counts.  Also, all I can say about the graphics is that they're horrible and they look like they're from the PS2 era.From what I can say, do yourself a favor and buy Rainbow Six 3 and you know what's sad?  A game from 2003 still surpasses a game from 2013 and that's completely unacceptable.			"

												I see loads of people who actually don't like this game but to be fair I don't think it's THAT bad, but I'm glad I didn't paid for the full game.Ofcourse there needs to be work on it and ofcourse it's nothing like Rainbow Six and the SWAT series, but I actually enjoy this game.We don't need another Call of Duty game, where you run and shoot brainless as your health regenerates.You need to think what you're doing, taking it more tacticly and that's what I like about this game.What they really should focus so far is on the AI of your squad team and the tangos, it's quite bad but which games doesn't have bad AI lately?It's a minor complaint and I really think people are so negative about this game don't get the message.The only thing I can hope for is that they still work on the game, mainly on the, maps, briefing, objective, squad management and AI of the game.

												I (not) proudly present you this review of a game I can't exactly tell whether or not I should recommend it...Takedown was a succefully kickstartered game that made it's way onto steam only to receive negative aclaim from every possible reviewer. The AI was broken in never before seen proportions (I remember a video I saw once upon it's release last year where the player shot at the side of an enemy an unsilenced rifle, only to receive as an AI reaction: nothing... after that, he shot in the same place his SILENCED pistol, only to receive as a reaction: the AI turns around and clunkily shoots the player, killing him.) Thankfully it has been heavily patched, but the AI is still painfully broken. An issues is that once you spawn on the map the AI know your exact position and some (not all, of course) enemies will rush your spawn point. For tactical FPS stealth fans like me, the classic Rainbow Six fanboy, this is a dealbreaker for the game, immediately removing your will to complete it's 6 maps.yes, it has *only* 6 missions. Half of them are boring (the ship at night is an outright copy of the 2nd mission of Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear from 1999! and it's done REALLY poorly!)The prize you get for completing the mission is: nothing! Sense of completion is next to nil thanks to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI that wins is numbers, not in smarts, the clear aimbot they have also make the game unbelievably easy sometimes and other times a boring chore of unfair difficulty ON THE SAME MAP! It's not balanced properly and it feels like you are playing according to the game/AI's mood rather than testing your skills in a tough but fair game like Rainbow Six! The devs seemed to have dropped out of high-school because they don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing clue on how light reflection and refraction through a basic glass window/door works in real life and thus, in a video game!The textures are muddy and bland. The game looks from 2007 (and even then, PS2 titles from 2007 like Black (absolute masterpiece, go play it whenever you can!) look BETTER! A PS2 GAME!).The story is literally non-existant, even other tactical shooters like Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear (again I'll mention the date of Rogue Spear's release to embarass this game: 1999!) had a coherent (though, basic) and good enough storyline!The gunplay is ok, I suppose, guns have nice recoil, though the handling is clunky at best: Even with a full magazine you can reload your gun, which is weird and pointless. The reload animations are outright terrible, just watch somewhere the M4 and it's variant's reload animation (which is the same) and then have a few laughs and publish that on Facebook or something, that will make someone's day, escpecially if that someone is an avid gun-nut.Sound design is bad as well, lighting effects are abysmal (your flashlight only lights up a circle in front of you, light doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing suffer dispersion through the air or refract through glass, again! The devs got their degree at a Starbucks warehouse...), everyone know air is made of particles and gases that disperse the light into an omnidirectional radius (the flashlight should illuminate in front of you, but also stuff near and at your sides, because that's how dispersion and basic reflection physics work!), right? I'm looking a bit pretensious here, but it's basic physics, everyone should know that!Almost forgot about the music! It doesn't exist! Only 1 action-movie-generic song nº1003530 at the menu and that's it.Finally: The loadout system, it's broken! It doesn't save ocasionally, and it doesn't tell which button saves, because there isn't a ""pick loadout"" option, only the ""change loadout"" option and you have like 5 loadouts, so when you start your mission, pray you get the one you want! It's incredibly random and After 4 hours, I still have no clue on how to change it, whenever I want to change, I press everything, every combination possible and it outright does not work! (If anyone know, plz tell me, thanks in advance!) The game lacks, giving the player basic guides or ideas, the grenade throw is clunky at best as well, with an abstract bar telling the force of the throw. The grenade doesn't respect basic physics' laws at all either!I was STILL going to recommend it (it dropped from 13,99€ to 4,99€ a while ago, with a 4-pack costing now 14,99€), but I just saw E3 and its recently announced title ""Rainbow Six: Siege"", which looks MILES away better than this! So much that I am now telling you to not buy this unless under 1€ and/or wait for R6:Siege to bring back old-school great tactical FPS goodness back to gaming, such tactical greatness that gamers haven't witnessed being well done since Rainbow Six: Raven Shield from 2003!4/10, it's fun for a while only... ultimately comes down to you!SMALL EDIT: R6:Siege is looking so ♥♥♥♥ing terrible lol. I advise you to get Insurgency or Rainbow Six 3: Gold Edition on steam. You can pick both up for 20€ or on a sale for a combined total of about 5€.I am so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disappointed O_o Siege looks so bad! Looks like the Tactical FPS genre isn't coming back any time soon...  "

												This game ist not good. At all. The AI doesn't work - and is inconsistant at that: Occasionally, your enemies dont even see you when you're in front of them, sometimes they kill you when you walk through a door. Your teammates dont help either (at least they didn't last time I played): Mostly, they track the enemies through the wall and then just stand where they were, trying to see them - through a solid wall. The game does not at all meet any expectations created by the advertising and the trailers.You should not buy this game if you want a fun game to play, but should it be on sale for less then 1€ and you can live with paying developers who are basically scamming, the game is good for a quick laugh.Wait for CSGO to be on sale and get that instead, maybe even for less than this bad game is now (5€) - and if you want something to do in the meantime, you can still make fun of me for having payed 13€ for this bad game at its release.

												This is an Unreal based co-op FPS based around realism and tactical gameplay.  This is a very hard, unforgiving game that often sees you killed in 1 shot.  You do have no HUD identifier for friendlies, so a lot of friendIy fire is expected.  It is such a shame people 'reviewed' this on meta critic to be a ~30%. Though it is not made clear on the store page, this was, and still is, in ALPHA.  This ruined the indie developers chance to make a fun, small co-op Counter-Srike/PayDay2 like game. All the problems complained about at meta critic have been fixed already!  The AI is repsonsive, the AI does not 'cheat', and the menus work.  There are still things that need to be added, like an option for Push-to-Talk VOIP in game, but it is well worth a $5 buy as it is now.			"

												Oh boy, Takedown: Red Sabre, this game is probaly the worst FPS Shooter since the Modern Warfare Franchise. Alright, I'm gonna just go jump in right away to the movement, now you might be asking,""What? The movement? Why is that?"" Well, the reason for it is because there is 3 MODES of running, 3 MODES! Now you might be saying,""3 Modes of running? I thought this was a FPS Shooter not a Racing game!"" I thought the exact same thing. You have walking mode, which is slow as hell, then you got running mode which only increases the walking by the smallest bit, and to do so you hold SHIFT, and lastly, sprinting, which increases your running by a lot, now the funny thing is the way you sprint is that you have to hold CTRL, yes, CTRL. Why would they even have running if you can just sprint?Anyway, the next thing I want to talk about is the recoil, the recoil on every gun on this game is terrible, and I am not just saying that, the bad recoil and plus the bad movement combined are making the gameplay for this game terrible. Next is the servers, alright, so after doing the terrible tutorial, I went to have a look on some Multiplayer servers, I only found around about 4 servers that were up, 2 had hardly anybody on the server, and the other 2 servers could only manage a player limit of 14 players. I joined the server, to my surprise having no music. I also had a objective to do, which was to defend something, while also trying to plant a bomb (Gee, doesn't that remind you of a game?). The game acts like Arena Mode in Team Fortress 2, where if everyone on one team dies, they loose, no respawn. I found the maps to be the exact same just with different textures, and each map was as confusing as the other. It took me 4 minutes to actually find a enemy, and when I finally did, the player would kill me in a near instant, not giving me a chance to do... really anything. And with the the small amount of players on the server, the rounds went quick. After Multiplayer, I gave a go at Singleplayer, hoping that I could get trained, because at the time, I thought it was me that was bad. The AI on Singleplayer was horrendous. Your teammates would basically follow you and shoot any enemy in their sight. Another thing was that when you died you turned into one of your teammates. Now, the enemy AI are scattered around the map, and If you try to open a door and a enemy is on the other side you have no chance of survival, since bullets basically instakill you in this game. Takedown: Red Sabre! Around 5$ just to get this game is not worth it. I would rather recommend Black Ops 2 than this terribly programmed game.			"

												Is this game fun? Yes i enjoy it quite a bit, but not for the right reasons. This game should never have been released in its current state it is a garbage excuse for a full game and should be labled early access. AI is awful the worst i have seen, Gunplay is questionable, and  controls are buggy to say the least every gun model is virtually the same. There are 5 awful excuses for missions. I would take back the money spent on this game in a heartbeat. I must admit though this game is one of my favorites for laughs but DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY this game if you are looking for a good tactical shooter i would not recommend to someone i dont know but i would say you need AT LEAST 1 other person. This game is garbage to the point of almost unbeatability but i do have my fair share of laughs and its pretty much the only reason i havent uninstalled this game			"

												My opinionWell, I got this game for free (well, 1 cent) in a trade.At the first, the guy wanted to sell it to me for 3$, of course I said no, so he then selled it to me for the 1 cent final price.I didn't know why he would sell a game of 5$ for a cent.NOW I KNOW WHY, HE WANTED TO FREE HIMSELF OF THIS CURSE. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrorists kill you with one shot. ONE ♥♥♥♥ING SINGLE SHOT. Where's the tactic here if you can't even get close to them because if somebody sees you calls his mates and then you are in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gangbang surrounded by 839347389274380947032198040731029847329 bots.Seriously, this game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome... if you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.11/10Would uninstall againBtw:░░░░░░░░░░░█▀▀░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀░░░░░█▄▄░░░░░░░░░░█░█░░░░░░░░░░▐░░░ ░░░░░░▐▐░░░░░░░░░▄░▐░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░▄▀▀░▐░░░ ░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░▐░▄▄▀░░░░ ░░▄▀░░░▐░░░░░█▄▀░▐░░░░░ ░░█░░░▐░░░░░░░░▄░█░░░░░ ░░░█▄░░▀▄░░░░▄▀▐░█░░░░░ ░░░█▐▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░░▐░█░░░░░ ░░▐█▐▄░░▀░░░░░░▐░█▄▄░░░ ░░░▀▀▄ Takedown:RS ▄▄▄▄▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░			"

AI seems far to fast to react to certain situations. 60% of the time you cna be instnatly killed before making a move. as a attempt on copying the rainbow six series i have to say they have failed miserably. if this game was free to play i still wouldnt recommend it due to the serious AI flaws. if these issues are fixed and working correctly and/or fixing difficulty settings. i would reccomend it. as it stands it is just far too much work to enjoy even with some serious tactics and voice comms among friends.

												 I miss tactical shooters so much it kinda hurts. I wanted to believe so badly that this game would be fun despite bad reviews, because the tactical shooter was my genre, and ever since its downfall gaming just hasnt been  the same. So i buy the game, thankfully on sale, get into the screen and the game crashes. Ok.. start again and go to my loadout screen. After about 5 minutes with the sluggish ui and bland selection i save and go to start a game and the first thing i notice is there is no campaign. Ok... so i decide on the first map, thinking chronologically. The game just loads up, no team loadout screen, no planning phase, not even a whiteboard diagram of the building were assaulting. No intel to help decide on loadout. Ok... Start the mission and the weapon i have is not what i picked at all, it was the basic mp5 starter setup. WTF... Decide to play on, start scouring the keybaord to find some team controls...... none. Not only can you NOT control your team, but they sem to work against you. I went down the stairs with them and apparently noone was checking our six, since when I got to the bottom i noticed noone was following me. I go back up the stairs and see my 3 teammates all flat on their faces, with a tango just standing there not even noticing me. A perfect metaphor for the state of this game as well as the integrity of the devs. And after i back out i find it goes on and on. You cant see or access your loadouts from anywhere but the games main menu,    No ROE or any tyoes of control, no idea where youre going or what your doing, Crashes every time I play it. This game is a disrespectful slap in the face to consumers, and I can only hope an act so foul causes the universe to plague the devs with infinite misery.			"

Product received for free
												A pretty poor Rainbow Six clone. Broken, unfinished and abandoned. The difference between what they said they intended to do and what they actually released is a bit surprising. Serellan LLC is either very cynical or quite self-deluded about the quality of their product. If you are making a game, make it but dont release  half broken, at least make sure your game is 99% done.			"

												Rough around the edges.  Did not live up to hype, or even close. This is a terrible, unfinished mess. This game will go down in history as one of the worst crowd-funded indie games ever. It is the Atari E.T. of indie games. Many were following this game's development for over a year. The developer has released an alpha product and is selling it as a finished game. It most certainly is not. AVOID THIS GAME.			"

												This game is NOT recommendable to buy, the description describes a nice game, but it does not describe this game. Firstly it isn't finished yet, but that is not the main problem. The Single-player is awful, you have no tactical options, you cant give precise orders to your NPC-Mates (like “Rush that room”). If you look for a game like the SWAT Series of Sierra, then you are wrong here. Your only way to play the Single player is to kill the terrorists, like in every CoD campaign mode. Maybe in Coop or in multi player this game  can show its good sides. But there are server/connection problems. I tried on different days now and couldn't connect a single time in any game online. I can just recommend to wait until this game is some when finished and maybe good or until another good tactic Shooter appears before you spend your money here (even if its on sale its not worth the money)			"

TAKEDOWN: RED SABRE: OFFICIAL GAMESPY REVIEW FOR THE YEAR 2020people gave the devs over 200,000 dollars on kickstarter to develop this game. someone saw fit to donate 7500+ dollars so the creative director could fly to his hometown and host a takedown LAN party. instead of tossing their cash to, i don't know, the local humane society or the soup kitchen, they decided it was better to throw the devs hundreds of thousands of dollars so that they could later spend 15 dollars on a game that basically doesn't existturns out the people clamouring for a new ""thinking-man's shooter"" were actually gigantic idiots !!! yowza !!! talk about irony !!!

												I didn't listen to the reviews and I bought the game... I ended up on the fence about how I feel about this game. I bought the game, which is currently $1.50, and I wasn't expecting much, so in the end I found the game to be fun and enjoyable. Knowning that this game was subpar beforehand made me find the game funny and quirky instead of horrible and buggy. The bugs in this game make it more fun and more playable then if it was without bugs, in my opinion. In the end i thought it was worth the buck 50, but I wouldn't spend much more than that.			"

												This game is the absolute biggest turd I have ever played.. It's unworthy of the term ""tactical"" as the AI has X-ray vision and immaculate aiming. The netcode is completely screwed, can't keep a connection in coop at all and even though VOIP is turned off, you still broadcast constantly. The entire game is clunky and slow, until you encounter an enemy, for they will shoot you in the face within .01 seconds.I paid euro 1,34 for it and I feel wallet ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												This game has guns, terrorists, tactics, and corridors. You shoot braindead yet very accurate terrorists while moving through ugly corridors with your lobotomized teammates who can't tactics. Then you die and restart. Die, do it again, die, and do it again until you realize that your life sucks and you should probably go play a game that isn't terrible.I would give this game a kick in the pants out of 10, but it's probably not wearing any.

Does Exist a Limit for ""BAD""? [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I am one of the few guys that got the game KNOWING how bad it was, just to be sure it was bad for real. You should be happy knowing that I wasn't disappointed!I think this game should be played by every developer out there just to let they know how to NOT make a game. When your boy come home from school with a bad score, buy him this game and force him playing for a full day: it is a harsh punishment. But let's talk about the negative points:1. Graphics is more than horrible, I have seen better GameCube games.2. Changing gun and reloading it is slow as hell - this is not an assault team, it's a physical impaired team.3. Enemies are dumbest than a brainless monkey but still they can hear you from 6 rooms of distance and can teleport near you without damage.4. Online is dead: 4 server, 2 of them are empty and 1 has an outdated client.5. People playing it are a**holes: I have been teamkilled 2 seconds from the start, no report, no warning, no kicking out, no penalties.6. Even only spectating a gameplay does led to bugs!7. The developers knows how bad it is: they give you 1 free copy for every purchase. It seems like they wanted to say: ""sorry for buying it, we can't fix it, please take this gift and give it to your worst enemy"".Please do not let my play time count fool you: I only managed to play this game for 20 minutes, then I left it idling for cards (steam trading cards is the only positive point of this game).p.s.

												I saw this game for sale looked cool so i bought it for 1 buck. I played the game for maybe 30 mins maybe I had issues getting into games and once I got into games it became extermly boring waiting for the round to end! and once it ended after watching people walk around for about 5 minutes because you cant sprint! I got to play now the comunity was usually a buch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s I was open to them and they became very anti new players and drove me away and disscouraged playing with them, this completely ruined the game which could have been good had there been a faster walk or sprint function because It was far too slow, So if your looking at buying this game I strongly Disscourage that you wont get your time out of it and you'll regret playing it! and the people you play with are just rude and make the game even worse!

												This game is horrendous. Do not buy it. I cannot properly enumerate the reasons not to buy this game. Really, it's easier to list reasons why it's good, because there are none. The graphics are poor, the sound is awful, and has no direction to it, the attempts at ""realism"" either result in people being bulletproof, or dropping from one 9mm round to the foot (don't get me started on the human turtles that are the characters in this game- seriously, the movement speeds are atrociously slow), and the AI is some of the worst I've ever seen. I thought all of these were signs of a game very early in development when I first bought this game. This game is the same thing today as it was in pre-alpha. The whole effort at development was a fraud, perpetrated by charlatans. Everything claimed by the company staff was either wildly misinformed or made-up. I, seriously, have not seen a single more duplicitous or non-trasparent project in my entire life. The dishonesty and awful quality Takedown and its developers, as ridiculous as this may sound, actually make me angry (yes, I'm getting mad over a game). With an absolute absence of business ethics or competence, Serellan has managed to both make the worst game I've ever seen, and earn my contempt. Please, do yourself a favor and don't buy this. It's not worth a damned cent.Rating: 0/10			"

												This game shouldn't have a pricetag on it yet, it should still be in beta.  After playing for only 5 minutes on the first real mission, my weapons dissapeared an I was unable to switch weapons, shoot, etc., resulting in my needing to restart the game.After playing for about a half an hour I have put together a list of issues that the developers should tackle (A list that should have been tackled before putting a pricetag on the game!!)-Gamepad support isn't great.  There is no sprint via controller.  I haven't tried going into controls and manually mapping every key to a controller button, but why should I need to?-You cannot select options while in a mission!  this is just poor game design.-After leaving a mission, the next time you go into the mission menu it has 'training' mission selected.  It doesn't remember the last mission you played!  This would take 5 minutes of programming to fix.-The AI is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Both your crew, and the enemies.  I like that you can tell your crew what to do (offense/defense, hold/follow) except it is easy to lose track of them.  Not sure if there is a minimap, can't remember, but I don't think there is.-When you die, it takes a solid 3-5 seconds before you're put into a different member of your crew.  This should be fairly instantaneous, I've watched my whole crew die after my first character went down, when I could have swung one of them around to kill the enemy. (again, if they weren't so derpy, it wouldn't matter.)-The default settings for movement are annoyingly slow.  Your character pretty much crawls, unless you hit 'shift' to run, or 'ctrl' to sprint.  Buried in the menu options, you can switch run and walk (which should be the default).  now that I found it my character moves at a reasonable rate, and I switched sprint to 'shift', and if I really feel the need to walk (crawl essentially), I have it bound to 'c'.  Crouch was moved to 'ctrl' which should have been the default.-graphics are glitchy and laggy.  Really annoying if it happens right when you engage an enemy.-The game advertises itself as a 'thinkers' FPS, but is really like Rainbow-Six IF Rainbow-Six sucked.-I'm sure I could come up with many more bugs/issues/poor design choices, but i'm not sure if I can bring myself to play anymore of this game.  Maybe I'll play it more just for the trading card drops, so I can at least get some of my money back.-Also, the first mission you are sent in to a biological weapons researcher to help save their company from being exposed.  Why the hell would I be motivated to help a bio-weapons lab?  I wanna be part of the crew that takes those inhumane SOBs down, not helps protect them!I really don't like to be so harsh on a developer, but this game shouldn't be for sale as-is.  Change the tag to beta, release it for free to get some notes such as the ones above, and do your job as programmers!!!  1.5/5 stars			"

												When checking the screenshots you will notice Takedown: Red Sabre does look OK and indeed some of the maps are pretty, but then you start playing.... The game tries to be a multiplayer version of Rainbow Six, which is a good thing. When you first join a server you immediately notice the clunky controlls and buggy feel of the game and it makes you want to instantly quit the game. To be honest I've only played like 2/3 rounds, so yes I did not see every map and every game mode, but at that time there were only 2 other players playing. "

												I was able to get this game at the low low price of like $1.49I thought that it was gonna be a run and gun affair.NOPE.Get shot, die.Shoot, kill, die.Slow paced cause it requires tactical approaches and it tries to be realistic like in real life tactical ops.Good concept, poor execution. I spent an hour just to play one mission.And i failed it. Proudly. This is a nerve racking experience if you're into that kind of stuff. I guess its a plus that it gives you a free copy too.It tries really hard to be true to life and realistic and i respect that. Sometimes i look for that in games even. But you know, after playing this..i'm glad some games are unrealistic. Hell, they were made to entertain. I don't wanna finish playing a game then suddenly experience PTSD afterwards cause i got into it too far.But playing it with your mates should give you a nice experience.When they patch this up and finish it nicely, i'll give it another go.For now it gets a 4/10Why?+1 for free copies.+1 for working animations+1 for being $1.49+1 for steam cards.There you go.

The game has absolutely no bugs, this is one of the most stable games I have ever seen. The writing and storytelling easily tops games like HL2 or Heavy Rain. The gameplay is like nothing you have seen before, it is like you are actually shooting that M4A1, firefights get so intense with all of the different mechanics the game has to simulate gun battles. Finally, the graphics are virtually photrealistic and yet it is so well-optimized that I can play it on my 5 year old laptop. THE DEVELOPER EVEN GAVE ME AN EXTRA COPY! WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?			"

												The AI in this game is in serious need of attention. If a bot sees you, you'll be lucky if you didn't die instantly. Bots seem to ignore the rules that players need to follow (they can see through ledges and corners, can shoot and kill anything in line of sight). Co-op is pretty much not an option for this reason, it's unplayable as it is.Finer aspects of this game (like in-game chat, weapon balancing, and player movement) only shine through when you're playing multiplayer versus, where it's actually possible to enjoy this game a little. However, all of these things are still in dire need of a lot more polish.The maps in this game are really cool. Aside from looking unique, most of them are clearly designed to have easily identifiable areas. It's all wasted potential now, though.The basic ideas behind this game are great, but the execution is shameful. It wouldn't have taken a whole lot more to make this game into something really worthwhile. The game has been on sale in its current state for far longer than is excusable. It should serve as one more example of what not to do when making a video game.			"

												This game is not nearly as bad as the reviews make it seem. Maybe they fixed a lot in the new patch, I wouldn't know as I just started playing it. AI isn't genius but it isn't too terrible and is just challenging enough to make each game interesting. AI's spawn at start instead of at triggered locations which is something I missed from the old Rainbow Six games. There is a lack of weapons which hopefully will be added later on but it is by no means a game breaker. Also the MP5 (M5 in game) is much more innacurate than it is in real life. I enjoy this game quite a bit all things considered. The M4 and ACOG (Combat Optic) are both well done, better than I've found in many games and I know this for a fact since I got a lot of experience with both during my time in the military. I'd give it a 7.5/10, definitely worth a buy during a sale!			"

												So I posted a thread asking whether Takedown: Red Sabre  was any good because I was hoping it would scratch my itch for a slow paced old-school Rainbow 6 shooter. Everyone said that it was ♥♥♥♥ and a huge disappointment and that it was a waste of even the $1 that it's worth even now on Steam.However, there was one guy who posted a screenshot of his playtime in the game (about 26 hours iirc) and said that everyone itt was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that it was actually fun. This guy singlehandedly convinced me to buy it anyway and ignore the circlejerk.I'm very glad that I did.During my first 3 hours of gameplay I decided to write a list of +s and -s about the game, coming at it from a low-expectation and is-this-game-like-rainbow-6 perspective.spoiler alert: it was exactly what i hoped it would beThe following is my list of +s and -s about Takedown: Red Sabre based on my experiences with the game. I am a very old school Rainbow 6 player and I came into this game with very low expectations due to the Total Biscuit review (and later PSA), random internet people's advice and opinions about the game. One thing I want to be clear about here, though, is that I am not the kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about cosmetic ♥♥♥♥ like sexy reload animations, graphics, et cetera. Imo all of these things are completely fine. They're not as good as ArmA 3 or Skyrim but they don't take away from my experience at all.---While checking this game out and making this list, I fully was wearing my Rainbow 6, Rogue Spear, SWAT 4, and Raven Shield hats and I try to make direct comparisons to each of those games as often as I can in this list for you:(these are in the order I wrote them down while playing the game)+ Level editor (not even Tribes has this) is exactly like the old Raven Shield one (because they're based on the same engine), which is way ♥♥♥♥ing better than the old Rogue Spear one. This is a huge plus for me because I love making custom ♥♥♥♥ in games and then playing them with my friends.+ 3 game modes across 13 different maps by default (however the Mission game mode limits the pool to only 5)+ Mirrors and glass in general actually ♥♥♥♥ing works -- there are genuine reflections that you can use to see people around corners, such as when on the top floor of the Biolab where you can see enemies under your feet by looking at the tall windows.+ Gimping works just like in the old Rainbow 6 games.+ AI is just as good at shooting as you are (assuming that you don't suck at crosshair placement and aiming), but only when they're alerted to your presence. It's exactly like Rainbow 6, except instead of multiple difficulty settings (Recruit, Veteran, Elite) each AI has its own difficulty settings. Some are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cowardly whereas others are 360 noscope mlg xxx tier. Either extreme is very rare (maybe 1 per mission) and most AI are probably in between Raven Shield's Veteran and Elite difficulties imo.+ Atmosphere is just like the old Rainbow 6 games (e.g. rooftop biolab insertion feels exactly like the Raven Shield Penthouse insertion zone).+ You die in 1 hit most of the time unless you equip heavy armor, in which case you can take 2~5 hits. This is exactly the same as in each of the old Rainbow 6 games. It depends on where you were hit and the caliber of the gun that the guy who shot you has. HOWEVER, unlike in the old Rainbow 6 games, when you wear Heavy armor you are not allowed to sprint (default: LCtrl) anymore. imo that's completely fine.+ Hit detection on narrow edges (like shooting through doorways at tight angles) are exactly the same as in Raven Shield -- presumably because they're built with the same engine.- When you die, you don't get any feedback about your stats or whatever (e.g. accuracy, how many kills you got, et cetera).- There's no indication of how many enemies in total you're up against. Because of this, you can easily get bored running circles around the map searching for the last guy.+ The game can only be done slowly, so it's just like Rainbow 6. imo, it's even slower than that, though -- I'll explain why I think this later on down this list.+ The relationship between accuracy and movement feels exactly the same as in the old Rainbow 6 games (but it goes out the window when you scope in or use ironsights, which did technically exist in the old Rainbow 6 games because you could still zoom a little even without a scope anyway -- it just didn't look like that once they introduced first person weapon models in Raven Shield).- It lacks certain functionality that people consider ""basic"" or ""essential"" nowadays (e.g. being able to change options while in the middle of a mission) but weren't exactly taken for granted back in the old Rainbow 6 days. Most ♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the internet seem to judge a book by its cover, so to speak, and so they look at this lack of ""basic"" functionality in the menus and just drop the game completely and tell everyone it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. In my opinion, people who do this can go suck a ♥♥♥♥.- TotalBiscuit complained about how there are only 3 graphical settings in his review videos, but tbh I don't care because I get 60fps on my old laptop with Medium and Low settings... and all 3 settings don't take away from my gameplay experience at all so imo he's just nitpicking on that point, at least).+ It *FEELS* like I'm playng a modern Rogue Spear game, except the pace is slower (tbh Rainbow 6 and Rogue Spear both were very fast paced in terms of movement and it wasn't until Raven Shield that they slowed it down, which I loved personally... but this game slows it down even more while still letting you run and sprint through clear areas at the old Rainbow 6 and Rogue Spear running speeds, so I'm 100% cool with this and won't list it as a minus).+ Sound *ACTUALLY MATTERS* in this game, similar to how it matters in CounterStrike (although for different reasons). The AI will even hear you if you so much as switch to your grenades! In my opinion, this is a huge step up from all of the old Raven Shield games. Whereas in the old Rainbow 6 games, you can run around with Heavy Armor and it makes no significant difference to how the AI detects you... in this game you can actually see very easily how the AI reacts to your movements, even through walls and doors. All of this makes the gameplay slow down even more, which makes me much happier personally because that's how tactical shooters are supposed to be played in the first ♥♥♥♥ing place!+ You can choose multiple insertion zones both in Single AND in Multiplayer. In the old Rainbow 6 games, you could only do this in a few special missions for single player... but *NEVER* for multiplayer. This is a big plus for me because in Multiplayer you can divide your team into actual separate groups that start in completely different areas of the map.- There is no 2D map or anything for the missions you can play. You have to learn them as you go. This isn't a big minus for me, personally, but it is definitely a minus. It means that only people with enough experience can actually plan ahead, which takes away from the fun for me. It adds a sense of exploration to the game, true, but I don't think that this sort of thing is appropriate for this kind of game.- No pre-mission planning phase at all. The old Rainbow 6 games never did this for multiplayer, of course, but it was at least there in Single Player. Ultimately, though, it's not that big of a deal I guess but I'd still like to be able to do it in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer. It only adds to the fun of the game and doesn't take anything away at all imo.+ There is a decent selection of weapons and gadgets (which is what the game calls grenades and stuff). You can't give yourself a High Capacity mag like in Raven Shield (thank you jesus I never liked that feature anyway back then because it made the gameplay speed up unnecessarily since you hardly ever had to worry about taking cover to reload).

												No use to have this game on your account, unless collecting all games or garbage stuffs.If you want similar game but a good one, Try Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms or America's Army! At least those for free! Or with some luck, wait for SWAT4 for Steam. (who knows?) Now that would be awesome!Graphics okay, doesn't matter much, peeking is a little bit lame (comparing to any other games),Multiplayer: didn't seen anyone plays this ""game"".Overall: do not buy it! Throw it to your worst enemy, like a flashbang.			"

												If you love and enjoy tactical FPS games like the old Tom Clancy Rainbow Six games and you aren't a graphic-♥♥♥♥ you'll enjoy this, I saw all the negative comments so I was edgy to buy it so I watched reviews and I decided to have a swing. After buying it I bought one for my brother and we both love tactical FPS games and this really hit home for us, it was a great addition to add multiplayer co-op. It's intense and requires a lot of teamwork, so what if the graphics aren't ""Crysis"" it is still really enjoyable, I do not regret buying it.You don't die to easy, it's realistic, do you really think that the enemies would hire dumbasses without training? It's not CoD or Battlefield, you're not the ""Hero"" like the other games portray, you're a regular HUMAN swat member who dies in a couple of shots if not one to the head. I'm not saying it's perfect but it is what it says it is.It'd be nice though to tell your teammates where to go, at the moment you can just say Stop, Regroup and RoE Offensive, Defensive. It's a really enjoyable game and I hope they keep updating it and adding stuff! (Adding Achievements, guns, missions, etc)			"

												This game is pure garbage and so are Serillion for ripping people off. As far as I can tell, this is the first project they've ever created on their own outside of 505 Games. They don't accept being criticised and ban those that do here on Steam as if they are gods or something. Their website is full of disgruntled people wanting their money back and yet, Serillion refuses to refund them. The Steam forum has over 38 pages of dissatisfied clients all wanting their money back. I do go overboard at times with my attitude but to receive a permanent ban for a game that I spent MY money on for them to be able to continue development of their game is pure ignorance on their part not to mention, stealing money from me for a game I cannot even play anymore of which, I was playing it until their last update that claims my video card is no good. HA! I can play any and every other game out today on todays market without any problem and yet Serillion games I cannot?! What kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is that?

												Part of me really wanted to like Takedown:RS, but not even an hour in, and I can't stand to engage in this... it's truly a broken game in terms of basic fps mechanics and things that most of us gamers simply take for granted. I love tactical shooters, but wow have they got some work to do on this title. The lack of any radar or standard crosshair is a huge problem, but I suppose that was their intention given the 'hardcore' nature of the game to begin with. Even still, it doesn't help matters. Furthermore, movement seems glitchy and don't even get me started on the 'run' and 'sprint' functions in this game... unreal. Careful, going down a set of stairs at the wrong angle could prove to be fatal. Fall damage is outrageous in this game. Enemy AI is everything from oblivious to fully aware, ready to flick shot you as you stealth your way towards them. Talk about rolling the dice on this one. That just about concludes my rant on this game. You'd be wise to save your money and pass on this. As a takeaway, I hope the developers get a better understanding of these issues and patch in some serious fixes as the game matures. Good luck and Godspeed! 2/5			"

												This game is a piece of utter garbage. AI is unbelieveably stupid, yet some how manages to slaughter you and your team instantly. They sniped me from 300 feet, with a submachine gun while I had heavy armor. There's no point in using silencers, they can see you and hear you no matter where you are, and they call every NPC on the map to you.Your teammates are the WORST. When you die, they stand still while they wait for you to transfer to one of them. That means when you're taking 5 seconds to take controll, the enemies have the time to kill everyone, AND THEY WILL. They also get in your way constantly.The AI sucks, you die with a single shot to the chest even in heavy armor, even from a pistol.The reload breaks, you have unlimited ammo, and the controls are garbage.This was released as a ""finished"" game, and I have played alphas that are better made than this trashy heap of freaking garbage.

												Where to begin...It's always a good sign when a game starts off with, ""I really don't know where to begin with this game."" I bought this game during a sale for right around $1 and thought I had stumbled onto a good deal. After all, a game with steam trading cards grants some merit, right? Wrong. There are sooo many things wrong with this game. The menus and options screens are difficult to maneuver and clunky, the AI in this game is terrible, and the half the time you have no idea what you should do. The game just throws you into the menu, not really forcing you into training or explaining how to maneuver the menus to change character class or loadout. Pretty much everything is trial and error, with the training (that I eventually completed) not really being helpful at all. I give this game 0 pieces of crap out of 5 gold stars.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! NO PRICE IS WORTH IT!			"

												I would usually take a chance like this to be ironic and sarcastic as possible. But not with this ♥♥♥♥ing game. First off, I have only played this game for like fifteen minutes, and in throughout that entire experience, I wanted to put a bullet in my face after every thirty seconds. I bought a 4-pack of the game for my friends and I and thought ""Why not?"". However it was a huge ♥♥♥♥ing mistake not to read the reviews. I got in the game with my friends and I, and my first thought was ""Wow, walking feels kind of funky."" So then I shot a simple bullet, but my gun didn't even have any firing animation. I just kept shooting bullets into a wall and I had no way to tell. But that was fine. I walked down literally one flight of steps, turned to the left, and died. I thought ""Ok, he had the jump on me, I will be more aware next time."" So, I respawned, and walked through a door. Then, a single AI turned around instantly, shot me twice, and killed me. So this game must have the AI of ♥♥♥♥ing Far Cry 1 and combined with the difficulty of Dark Souls.

												This game is great if you're down for mandatory stealth-like shooters that strip you of the ability to jump, turn at any realistic rate, and die in a single hit. Honestly, this game has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It's like playing Devil May Cry on Hell and Hell difficulty the first time you've ever played a melee-POV action game without being able to use Ebony & Ivory or Rebellion. You are punished heavily for using weapons via the recoils and you are constantly put in situations where you have threats from multiple sides and die before you can see all of them. My biggest qualm with this game is that you die in a single shot while wearing a fully armored combat raid suit and the stealth they are oh-so-focused on doesn't mean a damn thing.TL;DR: Don't buy this game.

												A brilliantly hyped piece of complete garbage.  If you can manage to convince it to run, the prolonged character customization will trick you into believing this is actually a game.  It is not.  It is the distilled essence of failure, wrapped up in shiny labels and an appeal to an underserved market cynically crafted to to con as many people as possible out of their money before they have a chance to see it for themselves.  There is nothing good about it.  The AI is awful, the guns feel like Hasbro toys if they were dipped in molten lead instead of paint, and the graphics are somehow uglier than much older, theoretically less advanced games.  The only good thing about it is that it has the good grace to crash frequently, sparing the user from having to play more of it.  I pre-ordered it, played it, and then gave up and uninstalled it before forgetting about it until now, desperate not to remember this horrible product.  The only thing that could save it would be a refund.			"

Free Game.""Installed, Started, Cried.Graphics? You cant call this Graphics. This is even worse than 144p.Gameplay? Ugh, Werid Controls, Dumb Teammates and OP enemies.Thats about it. I played it for like 10 minutes in total. It has no ranking system/level ups or any stuff to unlock (I think) and it has no Campaign. So its not even worth it.By the way, if you buy it, you get 2 Copies. thats why I got this as a gift. and if you get this as a gift (or trade, just if you have it redeemed) you get another Copy aswell (atleast I got another one, not sure if it was a Bug or not)so if you hate someone, Gift him this game and leave a message saying ""Its a Good Game :D"", like my Friend did.

												This in my opinion, is a classic among tactical shooters such as Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and SWAT. The cause of the influx of bad reviews are from players who went into the game expecting a COD or Battlefield playstyle. They were soreley wrong. This is a textbook tactical shooter. The fact that its almost dead is a crime due to consumers not being able to have induvidual opinons of their own.  Bad reviews equals no buy. Reviews are but a component of a purchasing desicion, the others  should be research, evaluation in lets plays or articles and person taste. This was not how it was done. I consider this a classic in tactical shooters and is one of my favorite games. I only wish it could have beccome a franchise. Sadly, this generation wants games that literally hold their hand, shame.			"

												I backed this on Kickstarter two years ago (April 2012). It was launched in the last part of September 2013, with an average of 88 players online.

												Let me try to give a balanced review:  some of the shooty gameplay is actually fun.  I came back to this for almost 15 hours because it was kind of fun to see if I could complete any of the missions despite...well.  The innumerable problems with the game.So, fun aside, I have no idea how Serellan took an existing game engine (Unreal?) and managed to make it do things like lose the connection to the host while playing SINGLE PLAYER or not have a working game browser until several patches in.  Extremely basic design decisions are poorly done:  how might you handle weapons loadouts?  Customize before each mission?  Not in this game!  You chose four loadouts from the main menu, differentiated only by their names, and then chose those by name (what did I make the Assault loadout again?) when going into a mission.  (EDIT 12/27:  oh joy!  You can edit the loadouts at the mission jump-off screen!  But you're still editing the four choices...then choosing one.........idiots...)  Your team members never changed weapons, so the one guy was always carrying a sniper rifle, even through urban hallways.  That might've mattered if the team AI did much more than absorb bullets or mutter things like ""rounds downrange""--you have basically no control over them except to ask for them not to follow you, and even if they're supposed to sometimes their pathing will fail and they'll get stuck.  Ultimately, they were only useful as extra lives--except that their loadouts couldn't be customized, so eventually YOU were the idiot stuck with the sniper rifle while trying to do CQB.I wanted badly for this game to be good, but it wasn't.

												I hate to do this because the devs obviously worked hard on this but this game is rushed, unfinished and unpolished in the extreme. Having worked with UE3 before their lack of knowledge on basic engine functions astounds me. Furthermore the game simply refuses to work in MP and SP will often disconnect you for no reason. There is no VOIP and the game lacks any steam community functionality at all. The menus are a mess (e.g. they don't allow you to change options while in game) and the entire thing wreaks of a project that was pushed out the door because the devs realized there was no salvaging the project. This might be worth 5/10 if you can actually connect to play with friends otherwise i'm giving this 1/10 for actually being able to run but other than that this is a game in pre-alpha state.			"

												BUYER BEWAREI like the concept of this game, but it just did not meet my expectations. AT ALL.  First of all here are my PC specs: i7-4770 at 3.9 Ghz, 12GB DDR3 RAM. 1TB 7500 RPM HDD, nvidia gtx 645 w/ 1GB RAm.  This is a gaming capable pc.  I max out almopst every game on high settings, including this game.  But about every 10 minutes into the game, the framerate goes down to 2.  And crashes.  It has game brteaking bugs and glitches, the AI sucks a massive ♥♥♥♥, weapons are all the same, and online matches are completely broken.  Now again, I like the concept of a hardcore FPS, and thats why I bought the game.  Luckily only fpr $1.50 on sale.  When, the games works, it provides about 5 minutes of fun.  Now, i know this is suposed to be a hard game, but it is near to impossible.  It took hours of trying the first mission to beat it, as there is always one guy who shoots all of you teammates, because their AI sucks. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  IT HASNT BEEN UPDATIED FOR EVER, AND IS STILL IN ALPHA.  IT WILL PROBABLY STAY THAT WAY FOREVER.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!			"

												As a Reviewer I try my hardest to find the good things about any game, wether it be good, or bad, and try to be as fair, rational,  intellectual, and informative as possible, while trying to keep a fairly positive and upbeat demeanor in giving my critique.And after only a few hours of this game I can safely say, while it may not be as ""Horrid"" as most people would put it, as I have played WAAAAY worse, this game unfortunately sits at the kids table in consideration of the quality of this highly touted Tactical Shooter.I along with many others were expecting this game to be pretty cool, as it at least had some people who had worked on Ghost Recon 2 and Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 1 and 2, so I of course thought ""Wow this game has some talent behind it, it looks interesting, glad to see a methodical shooter instead of most of the action based nonsense we usually get.""But sadly that was not the case.While it may have looked promising in it's preview stages, it just seems that the game never really left that phase.Were to begin? Well for starters, how about the fact that the game has ♥♥♥♥-all in regards to PC Settings as most of them seemed to be lacking, especially  like the  Display Settings where there is no options other than, Screen resolution and graphics settings of :Low, Medium, and High.The controls are somewhat ehh...I mean the sensitivy for the mouse feels rather slow for a game that expects you to have the reflexes of that of a cheetah, even at full sensitivity. Leaning is rather useless as all it really does is bend side to side from the waist up instead of, you know, LEANING WITH YOR ENTIRE BODY, making looking around corners more of a hassle than it needs to,so I practically don't even use that feature at all. Weapon damage is rather inconsistent at times as at times 2-3 shots to the chest will be enough, while sometimes you can shoot point blank at someones chest with no armor, with BUCKSHOT, and they'll still keep chuggin.The disturbing absense of Squad Commands feels very wrong for a ""Tactical Shooter"". I mean Squad commands have been present in most if not all Tactical shooters, and no I don't count Halting Your Squad mates, and just saying random phrases like ""Going on Offensive"" or ""Going on Defensive"" as being as remotely helpful as it generally does nothing, hell even Ghost Recon: Future Soldier had Squad commands! And that was more of a action third person Shooter!And the above problems don't help when the AI is rather inconsistent...what do I mean by that you ask? Well when the Enemy is so stupid as to stare at a corner all day, looking in the absolute wrong direction they should logically expect you to be coming from, walking directly past you even when you are firing point blank in their face, to being so alert as to know that you were to come out through a door on a balcony after killing one of my squad mates on the bottom floor, shooting me in the face with disturbingly accurate accuracy in one shot, when logically there was no reason to know I was going to come out from there, HELL, sometimes the enemies will know I'm behind a door, even though they didn't hear me, or see me going through the door yet...seriously are some of the enemies psychic?The same also applies to your squad mates too. If they aren't really hyper aware and getting really accurate shots killing the enemies really quickly, they are either NOT shooting the enemies and are just shouting that theres an enemy soldier coming right at them, while they are looking Straight at them, not firing a bullet, usually resulting in very crappy and hilariously awful deaths, or WORSE, getting you stuck in a corner, keeping you captive until you put a bullet in one of their skulls, which surprisingly they don't retaliate for.The Graphics is...Alright, it at least looks serviceable at High Setting, but the worst thing about the presentation has to be the animations...I mean, I get some serious X Operations vibes just looking at them walk, it's just un-natural.and after all that, was there anything good about this game...well, I liked the fact that you had to be mindful of how long your weapon is in consideration to the walls adding a layer of strategic thinking, but even with that...no, I have nothing really good to say about this game...The most cardinal sin about this game is that fact that this game was released in a very poor, and rather unfinished state. Like most people have said, it does feel like an early alpha state game...the lack of modes and maps should be an indication of that, and the fact that Serrellan after all the money they got on kickstater, and then getting partnered with 505 games to puplish the game, and to just release the game, in THIS state, is just un-acceptable.It's so dissapointing to see such potential go to waste, as the guys at Serrellan obviously were proud of this game, and work was put into it.Like I said before, this game isn't as awful as some people make it to be, but would I say it's good, no...If I had to give a short review of this game, I would simply put: ""Takedown: Red Sabre is like a dumb 4 year old eating crayons....it may seem adorable, but it doesn't cover up the fact it ♥♥♥♥ it'self.""

												Reading through Takedown: Red Sabre's Kickstarter page may give the impression that the game is a spiritual successor to classic PC shooters like Rainbow Six and SWAT4. Instead, like Tom Clancy's imagining of the submarine Red October, the threat of this game engages the player with little to no warning.The idea behind Takedown is a throwback to the classic era of PC tactical first-person shooters, but the desire to perform any form of tactic is tossed aside to make way for frustrating gameplay, unrealistic AI and disappointing physics. My first playthrough began with a member of my team relentlessly crouching and standing upright in an endless wave of teabagging while enemies sprayed bullets in our direction. Squadmates often stand in place like cardboard cutouts as enemies assault only to suddenly become active and return fire a few seconds after combat begins. I've had some enemies outright ignore me for nearly a minute after I accidentally sprint into them. Grenades bounce off of objects and sometimes launch across rooms as if they were thrown onto a trampoline, and enemies sometimes launch into the air or soar across a room when killed.Bad AI is Takedown's most crippling issue. Explosions don't tip them off to enemy presence. Flashbangs seem to be low-grade sparklers to them. They would rather stare at walls than pursue enemies and they often choose to shuffle around in a circle before engaging the player. Enemies can sometimes spot the player seemingly by looking through objects, yet they sometimes walk by a door where the player is in plain sight without a single reaction.The game's graphics are very rough, and the overall visuals look incomplete. Some weapons lack fire animations. Enemies look like an alpha build of characters from a mid-2000s game instead of a product from 2013. Anyone expecting top notch, or even acceptable, graphics from Takedown will be disappointed. Areas in a single mission often look recycled and uninspired. This can become especially troublesome if you become lost and can't remember what floor you're on. Most other shooter games would have the player press the “M” key and dissolve the confusion, but there is no key to bring up a map in Takedown.Stage objectives are challenging and fun to attempt, but the frustration from bad AI and no map assistance kills the mood. Some objectives like “destroy PC disk drives” are entirely too obscure. I discovered how to complete this objective by aimlessly firing in an office for no reason and struck a PC tower by accident. A room filled with large, standup computers was introduced before the office room was, so I was frantically trying to discover how to destroy these disk drives. The player normally interacts with objectives by holding the shift key, so changes in how objectives are completed introduced a great deal of confusion.Players may choose to customize layouts in order to choose primary and secondary weapons, grenades and breach charges; but customization often yields little change. I never felt like using a different weapon mattered much. The true difference came when I chose scopes over red sights, but I abandoned worrying about either after shooting enemies spot on in the abdomen only to have them scurry away unscathed and aimlessly charge up and down flights of stairs. Flashbang grenades leave enemies unharmed and hardly alert. Nearby explosions from frag grenades resulted in enemies staying in the same position, admiring the walls that enemies often stare at rather than reacting like a person would.Takedown offers Mission, Bomb Disarm and Tango Hunt modes of play. Bomb Disarm and Tango Hunt could arguably be more enjoyable than Mission, but the same issues haunt these alternate modes of play. These modes are made worse than Mission because a player's squad is reduced to one. It then becomes quicker to be killed, quicker to be overwhelmed by several bad guys so one random shot can instantly kill the player, and quicker to realize that the noise suppressor accessory for the weapons is garbage. If the idea behind Takedown is to be a spiritual successor to old games like Rainbow Six or other tactical, team-based shooters, then the idea of reducing a team to one to defuse bombs or to take out an enemy team is absolutely befuddling.Takedown: Red Sabre is a good concept's stage show of poor execution. The project's potential can certainly be felt and understood, but the likeliness of such potential surfacing – even through patches – is low. To call the Takedown project lazy would be harsh, but it wouldn't be inaccurate. The goals for this project were laid out in the open both in the Kickstarter campaign and on the game's official website, but very little victory can be tasted in this final product. Couple a disappointing experience with a $14.99 price tag, and you have arguably the most disappointing video game to be funded by a Kickstarter campaign.			"

Short ReviewA supposed comeback for the tactical shooting genre, Takedown: Red Sabre passes selection and completed his training courses, yet when it came to his first real mission, he flopped… Big time.Pretty much the bare basics of a tactical shooter. Awkward menu, horrible AI, mediocre game mechanics and glitches abound. But decent graphics and great level design.Kiddie Steam reviewer verdict: “chnged gun. started game. gun didn’t change. Wnt back. changed gun. game still dusnt register change. carried on. ai squad gt stuck in door. Saw enemy across map with back turned. He turn round and killed me in half a second. Tried multiplayer. Uinable to connect 2 any server. 4/10 wud disconnect agen.”Long ReviewIt’s no secret that games these days are all about your waist high walls, linear objectives and regenerating health. Answering the cry of help from the tactical gaming community, a few industry veterans (who’s work involves that of Ghost Recon, SWAT and Halo) stepped up to the call and decided to create their very own game to resurrect this dying genre. GraphicsThe graphics range from excellent to quite poor. The environment textures look absolutely fantastic and whilst a bit too clean and sterile, offer a pleasing amount of colours and contrasts that make it an absolute shame you have to shoot up the place. It’s a shame there’s no peaceful mode as I would have loved to explore the excellently crafted map.The character models look fantastic! Boasting high polys and great texture work, each character looks like a real life operative who’s been kidnapped and transported into the Unreal engine (bless their poor souls). The character and model artists really know what they’re doing with this one. It’s a shame that characters move like they’re made out of wood and lack any idle animation, resulting in a game of musical statues. I don’t even know if they can blink.On the downside, the weapon and first person view-models look like they were pulled from a game 5 years ago. Much lower poly than you’d expect so appear rigid and angular, plus they also house a number of bad faces that reflect light at odd angles. When you have a stunning environment with life-like character models, but have to stare at your blocky arms and firearm that looks like it was made out of tin foil, it’s pretty jarring to say the least.SoundThe music is pretty good, definitely sets the mood with its militaristic theme. Whilst there isn’t a wealth load of tracks, they’re all done to great effect and tie in well with what you’d expect from a tactical shooter.As for in game sound, well there isn’t much to talk about. Everything seems eerily quiet and doors opening, soldiers screaming, spouts of gunfire is all you’re pretty much going to get. Whilst the guns sound ok, they sure sound generic and lack that looping variation you’d expect from games like Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon.GameplayTakedown: Red Sabre has come a long way since it’s behemoth of a disaster at launch, but sadly it’s still a sordid buggy shell of a game.The menu is basic but seems glitchy at times. Often I’d try to change my equipment, only for it to not register until I realised you have to click on the kit name (recon, assault, etc), then click “save loadout” then click back. At least I think that’s how I did it.Your AI squad waddles behind you like a group of duck, refusing to follow any sort of tactical formation, either choosing to form a conga line or dancing all over the place like frightened cockroaches in a matchbox. Very much like your first puppy, outsides of asking them to follow, sit, attack or stay quiet, there’s pretty much no other use for them except extra lives should you bite the dusts. Moreover, when you get killed in a doorway, they enjoy running straight into the doorway and getting capped themselves.The enemy AI is just as bad. Running around like headless chickens, staring at a shiny wall instead of that door you just blown open… then managing to do a 180 spin and headshot you from across the other side of the map in about 0.23 seconds. Cheap.I have sadly never ever been able to participate in a multiplayer match, thanks to a wide range of “connection problems” and error messages. Having played prior to writing this review, I’m still getting unable to connect to server messages and I still cannot get a LAN game to run. Movement is a little odd as you seem to slide everywhere. You can’t lean very far nor move and lean (which apparently is due to quote “The realistic nature of the game”) even though you could do so in most other tactical shooters.Asides from the terrible AI and connection issues, there is a game here, it’s just very barren. It has its moments of enjoyment and if you can accept the complete package for what it is, it’s not the end of the world. If somehow you manage to win the lottery and spot a pig flying in the air at the same time, get the multiplayer to work (if it still does) and playing with other people should make the game more enjoyable.Final WordsTakedown: Red Sabre is a huge disappointment. Whilst it’s not an absolutely terrible game, it’s far far from a good one either. Having trashed the game on a public article and being called out for having inaccurate info then told by the game developer that many problems have been solved, bottom line is many many problems still remain. Where’s my multiplayer?As for the company behind Takedown: Red Sabre, they’re making a new tactical shooter called Epsilon. The question is, should you support them? I think so!They’ve seemed to have learned from their mistakes and putting all efforts into their new title. I’ve gotten my hands on the alpha and for the price of a 6” Subway, it’s given me great bang for the buck. Still, a few bad lemons are bound to pop up in a box every now and then, so I urge you to check Epsilon out.			"

												Cosidering my tastes, this game immediatly attracted my attention. When I got it though, nearly every feature was incomplete or utterly broken. After the game was fixed, however, a few positive points came about. Pros: Good Fiream handling, Costomability ect.Other than that, this game clearly lacks content, the AI is attrocious, and the maps are punitive. Ragdoll physics are broken as well. In my opinion, it is disapionting to see such good ideas gone wrong. I regret spending $15 on this.			"

												Be aware this game is not a final product. It has a ton of bugs, a pretty simple looking and not even well designed UI. It has just a few weapons and levels as well.The funny fact is when this game was released the folder was called ""Takedown - Early Access""  but it was sold, with tons of bugs, as a finished product. This is what was communicated by the dev team as well. Seriously? They lied. Period. Nobody would have complained if it was cleary sold as early access but this way at least I feel cheated.The only thing in which this game is better than any real tactical shooter is, because it is newer, the graphics. That's it. Nothing else is superior or barly equal to for example Rainbow Six Ravenshield. Get Rainbow Six Ravenshield for a few bucks it is a superior - and more important - a finished product.

												No, no, no. Please god no, not another five minutes of this game. THis game is so utterly appaling so smug in it's own failure that it needs to be taken down from Steam.But first let me spin you a little fable.Once upon a time there was a bloke named wolfthing, he had enjoyed one or two of the Rainbow Six Vegas games when he was younger but felt things were missing, like I dunno, TACTICS. Then he learned about SWAT 4 and this made Wolfthing happy, sadly it's not available for legitimate digital download anywhere and as Wolfthing was screwed over by pirates once, he won't pirate it. In his brooding he discovered Takedown: Red sabre and apparently so did one of his friends, who gifted him the game, Wolfthing was happy. Until he pressed Play. After a good 20 minutes of online shennanigins and about 15 of single player crap he quit the game and uninstalled it, creating a new category in his library marked ""Horrible, So Horrible""Now that the scene is set, let me open with this.THIS GAME IS COMPLETE AND UTTER ♥♥♥♥ FOR THE LOVE OF GODDONOTBUYITSo about 3 minutes after clicking play I have some issues already, the menu is ♥♥♥♥, like worse than cheap console port ♥♥♥♥, the options aren't the worst I've seen but they leave much to be desired. So I go to join my buddy and I can't. Eventually we find eachother on a public server. Now begins my 20 minutes of online play. I think it's best to describe my thoughts at the time rather than attempt to actually review this.Ok these controls are pretty slow, I guess it is tactical. Oh look I can open doors, but all the rooms are copy pasted, I haven't seen anyone yet, oh hey a bad guy no that's just my reflection, well this is boring, I'm out, peace.Yeah, pretty bad, the single player is much the same except the enemy AI sucks ♥♥♥ for a living, it takes a good 2 seconds at least for it to react and any retard can react to him in that time, they never surrender and have deadeye aim when they finally do wake up, meaning you will be insta-killed. Speaking of killed I suppose I should point out the game's only good feature and elaborate on it so I seem fair, when you die to switch to one of your squadmates, it's a brilliant idea and I can't remember PLAYING another game that did it, although I think one of the Brothers in Arms games did. It's great if you need to speedrun a level in order to get through a ♥♥♥♥ game as fast as possible but in the end I gave up anyway.The story isn't a story it's a set up, and it works fine. You are a squad of a special forces division of a morally ambigous private military corporation. Basically people hire you to go in and shoot the bad guys before the Police get there and find the Illegal weapons you've been developing for sale to Private states, or the Government as the case may be. And this works fine, it means the game can skip some corners on the whole protocol thing that the SWAT games did. It does mean however with it's gritty black ops feel, you ask yourself why is there an army of deadeye terrorists (Who are apparently just some kind of Pro-humanity protest group in one mission) and noone is taking precautions to stop them?Sadly the game missed out on some base management stuff which I feel would've been kind of cool, having to manage staff, equiipment, the Public opinion, your secrecy and your profit, but that would've required extra work.Work is something the devs seem to have a paralysing fear of as they have released an unfinished game claiming it finished. It's not even a beta it's a ♥♥♥♥ing dev-build they released at 0.8914 or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it is.Seriously don't buy this game, it's ♥♥♥♥ on frozen ♥♥♥♥ pie. I couldn't even play it for an hour. I don't really like scores in reviews but I'd give this one 0/10 and then add a million zeroes to the 10. Then triple it.			"

												Wow, here's my thoughts on Takedown...First off, key binding is broken.  I always assign my Tab key to reload function in every FPS game. But for some stupid reason, the Tab key is permafixed to console or chat in this one.  That's a deal breaker for me.  Secondly, the lean function appears to be broken. You should be able to stay in that position as you strafe, but you can't, even when you change the toggle in the settings.  Weird.  The gameplay itself was mediocre, nothing really stood out for me. Most everything seemed to be worse than Rainbow Six 3. It kind of a had a similiar feel to that game but everything felt dumber somehow, like I was playing a poor immitation of that game.  If it weren't for the poor controls, I might play around with this more. Overall the game feels very unpolished and unfinished.  Other than being curious masochist (like I was) or as a joke, I can't think of any good reason to play this. Every tactical shooter I've ever played before is better than this.			"

This game also boasts pistol ammunition that can kill a man from ten miles away and AI that walk into walls, shoot mentioned walls and then have their bullets ricochet from the walls into you for one reason or another. This game is so awful that it can't help but be hilarious, and I'm glad I payed the $0.99 to get it while it was on sale. Would I buy this game at full price?

I always thought Meta Critic and general Steam gamers that do reviews are harsh on any game they play. Well Meta Critic and Steam players were right about this one. This game sucks donkey ♥♥♥♥ and it is poorly made. The walking speed in this game sucks too. So when you are ""running"" you go granny speed and when you hold the shift key you are supposed to be walking. Well my ♥♥♥♥ing turtle beats the characters pace on either running or walking mode.

												This game is pretty crappy.  The tutorial doesn't give you what keys you are supposed to use, which can be hard since they wont even let you access the menu besides resume and Menu, A.I. will stand for 3 maybe 4 seconds before they actually shoot you, and also there is no consequences for shooting your teammates in S.P.  Even though I got this for a few cards that I sometimes collect i'd say it was worth the 10 cards that I used to trade with.  Other than that this game is a pile of s***.  It's hilarious at first watching teammates stand while you shoot everything then it becomes annoying.

The description of the game describes take down as being ""brutal, hardcore and deadly"" and they get that right, just turning the game on is all of those things! i feel sorry for the people that actually payed money for this ♥♥♥♥!

												EDIT: Decided to reinstall after what.. a year? Still awful. Avoid like the plague, seriously.Takedown: Red Sabre is.. painful.It fails as a tactical shooter. Planning is non-existent, there's no map in the briefing and no ingame map. There are no squad commands past ""wait"" and ""follow"". Your AI companions are basically extra lives for when you inevitably die. Flashbangs either don't work, or they blind you through a wall. There are no smoke grenades, or thermal goggles, so you're extremely limited in your options. Firefights boil down to edging around a corner, crouched and aiming, hoping you see the other guy first. Hardcore? Maybe. Tactical? Not a chance.			"

												This game has some potential but suffers severly from a few issues, namely:a) AI that is, at the same time, beyond stupid and annoyingly precise in it's shooting. Bad guys go from not seeing you at all to sniping you with a slingshot from across the map. Oh, and they take out the entire rest of your idiot squadmates before you can even switch characters. Which leads me to...b) No squadmate commands. Horridly annoying with the AI as completely mentally handicapped as it is in this game. This means you can't even use your blind/deaf/can't hit ♥♥♥♥ squadmates at scout fodder. It also makes any kind of tactics like what you might be used to in Raven Shield completely impossible.c) Horrid interface design. It's completely unintuitive and doesn't flow.d) Nagging Issues: Here's one -every single door on every map starts ""open"". Minor in the grand scheme of things but annoying combined with a and b above when a hostile snipes you through 5 bulkheads or doors that would otherwise be closed. It's worth mentioning because it demonstrates the complete lack of polish on this game, and this isn't the only example I could have picked.e) There are other numerous issues that individually aren't huge but combined make for a frustrating experience.f) The developer doesn't seem interested in addressing player concerns. For the longest time I remember every complaint was responded with ""Due to the hardcore nature of the game..."". It was used as an excuse for exceptional game-breaking bugs (like the aforementioned horrible AI). The map design, overall, I thought was decent even if it feels a bit sparse or dated. A few of them are good enough I'd love to play them in Raven Shield. Frankly though this game just isn't worth it, and the developer doesn't seem interested in fixing it. This game is simply incomplete. I haven't dumped a lot of time into it and I have zero desire to bother again. While it has the potential to be pretty awesome at the moment it offers nothing you can't get elseware.			"

												I had such high hopes for this game and I think thats what hurts the most. I love tac shooters and the kickstarter campaign behind this game made believe that the time was right for a comeback. I bought this game on day one and needless to say I will never buy a game on day again. It's just really broken, rushed and like the opposite of fun. It's a real shame becuase there is a desire for this types of games and its sucks so much that these yahoos bungled this title so badly. Get door kickers and rainbow six 3 instead.			"

												This game was not worth 1.50. I should have never sold my cards to buy this game, it's not even a real tactical shooter. It's a slow paced shooter with several tactical elements, like.... walking very slowly.There is no fluid door opening, and if you open a door, you are more than likely going to die unless you place yourself at a wall. The options for this game are absolutely horrid. At max sensitivity, I still feel incredibly sluggish, making me want to throw up. Literally. The AI are as dumb as bricks, but they have an insanely fast reaction time ( wut? ).Occasionally, you'll be able to kill 20 enemies with ease, due to how stupid they are, but sometimes, you will be insta-killed by the game by an enemy who will use only about 0.2 seconds to shoot you. This is coming from someone who has fast reflexes and good aim. Not to mention, when you do actually get shot at, you will shot in the head. This happens 90% of the time and it makes the medium and heavy armor types very useless.The equipment options in the game are very basic, you get a frag grenade, a flash grenade, and a breach charge. The flashbang usually doesn't work, as terrorists seem to be completely normal ( By shooting me in the head ).They don't retreat from frag grenades, oddly enough... But the grenade physics make them feel like rubber balls.Breach charges are generally useless, as the AI will either open the door on you as soon as you put the charge there, or... There won't be anyone in the room.The mission variety in the game is pretty awful. There's only about 5 different missions, and this game was released several months ago. The community is either non-existant, or extremely stupid TKing trolls. You get 1 of the 2.The friendly AI is extremely stupid, worse than the enemy. You get terrible command options over them, and you are unable to seperate them and tactically manage them. You can tell them to follow you or watch a certain area, which barely works. You can't have 2 guys watch the door and have your sniper on the roof, because there is no way to tell them to get into a specific location.The weapons and damage in this game are REALLY weird. For a tactical game, it's weird how you don't even have to aim to accurately hit a target. Aiming is useless in CQC, you have a better chance to charge and strafe. And when you do aim, you can literally strafe left and right ( ADAD Spam ) and dodge most bullets. Except from the guy who instantly headshots you. Don't put weapons into full auto, just put your weapon in single shot and click as fast as you can. You can get much better accuracy and less recoil, while killing targets in 1-3 hits.The enemy AI in this game is really immersion breaking. ( If you wanted that kind of thing ).They seem to charge at you DIRECTLY ( Not heading towards cover ) or, they run away from you and do a 180 and headshot you, then retreat again into a random corner.The AI doesn't patrol around an area, engage in conversation with other AI, or do anything.Their only goal is to wait for you and to kill you. Being stealthy in this game has no benefit, most of them will somehow know where you are anyways, and then instantly headshot you. Surviving a bullet is rare, especially since armor isn't protective.(RECAP)There isn't a real story in the game, so that's a negative.No planning mode. A minus on the 'tactical' side of things.No advanced room clearing tactics. Just open and peek in until everyone is dead.Extreme lack of AI commands.Dead Community, about 40 players at MOST. I'm pretty sure Star Wars: Battlefront 2 has 180 players at most. Which is extremely sad.Extremely sluggish controls, including mouse sensitvity.Extremely barebones options menu. Extremely barebones menu in general.Very slow-paced, but not tactical.Not fun, or engaging. Instead of being intense, this game is more than likely going to make you rage.Buggy. ( After several months )Huge lack of content.Terribad AI.Un-immersive. No cool features either, like a tactical map or an overhead picture you can draw on or a planning mode.Lack of customization. Pick your guns, what armor, what you want on your patch, and what equipment. That's it.Completely random crashing and connectivity issues.1/10    -At least they tried-                      Actually, I don't even know if they tried, they seemed quick to place the game on Xbox Arcade.I recommend that you buy Rainbow Six: Raven Shield instead of this garbage.It's a much older game, but it's also much more fun.Especially with friends, where as this game makes everyone just get angry at each other until everyone leaves.

												""Made by the guys who worked on Rainbow Six and Halo!""By who, the mail room guy at Bungie? If someone took my stapler, I'd probably torture them by making a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game too.This game is ♥♥♥♥ing disgusting to look at. I'm gonna do a name drop here: ever watch Lowtax and Shmorky? They look at ♥♥♥♥-tastic Unity and gamemaker games. This is on par with one of those. How ANYONE could think these graphics were passable for 2013 is beyond my comprehension. On high, it looks like your average Unity game. On low, it looks like, well, this.

This is made in Unreal Engine 3 by the way. The Ball looks a hundred times better than this ever will.Gameplay is bad. The guns feel weak, the movement is terrible (running is almost the exact same as walking, sprinting seems infinite.) The enemies next to one-shot you no matter the armor, your loadout doesn't matter whatsoever, and FALLING FIVE FEET CAN KILL YOU INSTANTLY. The enemy AI goes from full potato to half-potato. The controls are also incredibly bad, but that's not a surprise by now. I played this game for about 20 minutes (I sadly spent the rest of the time idling for the last card drop), and this is without a doubt the worst shooter I've ever played. Bar ♥♥♥♥in' NONE. And I have NO CLUE what the hell the last paragraph means when it says ""If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than running and gunning or perks."" No shooter I've ever played, run-n-gun or tactical, was EVER this bad. ""Out Think The Enemy"" my foot.If you want me to give you an actual score or TL;DR, let me put it into perspective for you. I got this game TODAY, when it was on sale for $1.50 USD. I bought Audiosurf for that exact price a couple years ago, and it is one of my favorite games. I bought Alpha Prime, a REALLY bad game for $1.25 USD, and even that game was enjoyable enough to last a whole run through. I got this game as a GIFT and I feel buyer's remorse. BUYER'S REMORSE FOR A FREE GAME. I pity anyone who bought this for the full price, pre-ordered it, or even bought it at all.Do not buy this game.			"

												I've played a lot of games in my life, yet never have I played a game where one can put a breach charge on a door, stand behind a wall about ten feet away from the door, and get killed instantly by a pebble of debris from the door's explosion. This game also boasts pistol ammunition that can kill a man from ten miles away and AI that walk into walls, shoot mentioned walls and then have their bullets ricochet from the walls into you for one reason or another. This game is so awful that it can't help but be hilarious, and I'm glad I payed the $0.99 to get it while it was on sale. Would I buy this game at full price? No, but it was worth what I payed for it. Long story short: buy this game if and only if it's on sale; any price higher and I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												About as much fun as a punch to the junk. Тhe enemy AI is stupid but still able to drop you with single magical bullet (sometime before you can even see them or them you). While this is going on, the rest your AI teammates are busy with coloring books somewhere else in the level because helping you doesn't seem that important.The best part is after you die from a magic bullet to your frontal lobe, you take control of one of your teammates who has managed to tare himself away from his coloring book long enough to let you relive the experience all over again.Dont buy/gift this game for anyone you like or would like to remain friends with.

												This game was a lot harder than I thought.  Basically it was like real life: you get shot, you die.  Guess thats why this is a hardcore fps.  However, what I didn't like was how the graphics were actaully pretty poor and that there is no multiplayer base at all.  When I was trying to find any sort of online co-op match, I found 3, 2 of which were friend only and 1 which had a ridiculously high ping.  The game is not very entertaining for the casual fps game that likes to run in and take shots and regen the health back after waiting a little as you literally die with 1 shot.  Regardless, this game would be for some people, but it is just not for me as I flat out don't like hardcore fps games where you die this fast.Rating: 4.5			"

												It seemed to be a much older game than what I am used to. It did have quite a bit of potential and probably would've taken off if all of these other first person shooters hadn't brainwashed us with a ""good"" and ""bad"" perspective on games. This one digs more into the serious aspect of a game, the one that makes you think, because your movement speed is slowed down significantly compared to other games, and one bullet is all it takes to kill you. Now, none of this is to say it is a bad game, I just don't have the taste for it, however, if you like a game that has rather indecent graphics, slow and difficult controls, a very limited armory with absolutely no possibility of hand to hand combat due to the lack of a melee command, and absolutely no storyloine or unlockable items; I'd recommend this game to you. If you do not, I'd suggest a different game for you, because there is a reason there's no gameplay in the trailer...			"

												""Ah, how bad could it be?"" I thought to myself when i saw this game on sale. What i was about to blindly delve into could only be compared to performing a hysterectomy on someone you love and cherish like your mother, your cat or yourself even.I played this game twice. At first i quit because i really wanted to vomit everywhere, and the second time i was forced to quit because i vomited all over my brand new computer, which consequently broke beyond repairs. I also flooded half of my house with vomit, so i don't think i enjoyed this game a whole lot. There's actually no campaign at all, only a few guards with down's syndrome in a couple of maps that every now and then see you with the back of their head and sexually abuse you beyond repairs.Basically, if you are an avid bulimic or would like to move to a new house and buy a new computer, then get this game. It will work quickly and strongly like a very good laxative that poisons your very soul.P.S. If you do decide to get this game, make sure it's not on sale.

												Bought it because it was only $1.50 and got a free copy to give to a friend. I read some reviews and they all said it sucked but I thought ""Its only a buck fifty, what can I lose?"". Well I can completely say that it was even a waste of that little money, I mean I could have went to a 711 and bought a Slurpee. The movement in the game is absolute rubbish, you have the mobility of a 85 year old women. The physics engine is horrible! What more can I say. There is never anyone online and I think that’s for a good reason. The only thing decent about the game is the maps. I would not recommend this game to anyone, mainly because the people who released it, released an incomplete game.			"

												I downloaded this again after a huge patch promised to fix this game. It hasn't.It's still broken. It's still dumb. It's still infuriating. And you still can't even change video settings mid-game. Nope. Every U3 engine game has this basic, fundamental feature but not this game! Nope. Want to turn down some graphics (which you'll want to since this game is so badly optimized) then tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, because you'll have to end your game to do so. Not only that, but the graphics look ugly, both in terms of graphical fidelity and general art style that really show a real lack of flare or interest. Compare the locations here to classics such as SWAT 4 and it just doesn't compare at all,  and I have no problem at all with saying that SWAT 4 has better graphics than this. It does.The A.I. still flails wildly from jedi mind tricks to sheer, inane stupidity, with absolutely no happy middleground. Each map is either unbearably tough and unfinishable, or you steam roll opponents like they aren't even there.the guns are fine, they look like guns, I guess, so whatever. But honestly, how can you get gun models wrong in this day and age? That said, it's no Battlefield or CoD in terms of how nice they look really, so even in that area this title is just very generic.Being a massive SWAT 4 fan, I was super excited about this, but it's not even a patch on the classic. There's no hostages to speak of, your teammates are just cardboard cut outs to be mutilated by zen-like opponents, there's no atmosphere, no immersion factor, you never feel like a SWAT officer (or are these guys army guys? The game isn't even clear on that) Like a lot of people, I saw TotalBiscuits playthrough of this and was super excited. What I didn't realize is that playing the game for more than 30 minutes will tell you everything you need to know. This isn't the tactical shooter you're looking for. There's barely any room for tactical descision, as your thought process is usually ""will the A.I. headshot me from miles away in this next room or will they stand there looking at the walls?""Don't play this, play SWAT 4 instead. It's an eight year old game with more replay value, realism, fear, tension and tactical thought than anything this game has to offer.			"

												Horrible, unfinished, sloppy piece of crap game that obviously needs it's A.I fixed. The levels are good and missions are decent enough, but if you so much as open a door to outside Gary who graduated top of his class in A.I Academy will snap his pistol up and shoot you from the hip 2.7 miles away the moment your head breaks the plane of that door. That being said if you have 2-3 friends who are masochists this game is a blast trying to clear out missions together as the broken A.I makes this game challenging for an entirely different set of reasons the developer intended for. Accidently made a lobby in multiplayer and someone was actually on and joined in. I'm half certain it was the actual creator of the game cause I don't know anyone that hates themselves enough to play this game singleplayer.			"

												Don't! Just don't!I too wanted to like this game.. But didn't.Menu/lobbyOhhh Boy!The menues were the first alarm bell. Controls in the menues and lobby are clunky. Clearly aimed at the console crowd.There are no drop-down boxes for selection and overview of your options, and the menu graphics are.. well.. outdated is a nice way to put it.But to hell with menues if the game is good.But notice, there is no where to select enemy difficulty.. More on that below.Single-Player/AIAs already stated by others, the AI is...... well.. Frustrating is a nice way to put it.The enemies are super-human.. the AI squad mates, not so much.Example: AI squad mate crouches in the open and just looks at an enemy while I franticly try to shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and he me. Even after a reload, my 'friend' was still hesitant to shoot the terrorist.Another example: Sneaking down a corridor, a squad mate calls out, enemy spotted. I look left, I look right.. Nothing. No enemies. Then I hear the shot and the 'man down' message. Turns out, an enemy had moved up behind us. My squad mates spotted him as the proffesionals they are.. but.. decided he wasn't worth shooting at.Most of the time, though, the AI enemies will simply shoot you before you get a chance to spot them, so no worries.To put this in contrast, I enjoyed Rainbow Six 3. The AI was challenging, but the squad mates were dependable.Multi-playerSorry, I couldn't be bothered.Weapons, outfits and grenadesGrenades are weird: I threw a grenade at an enemy, but one of my AI squad mates walked in front of me and the grenade bounced back from his head.........Also tried throwing a grenade into a room where an enemy was waiting to ambush me. No explosion ensued, so apparently the grenade just vanished.The emphasis on realistic weapon modeling is a joke. The military trained me to fire a ♥♥♥♥-poor SMG at targets 100 yards away.. and hit. http://www.thm-online.dk/public/billeder/genstande/1500-1599/b_1524_s.jpg <--- The SMG in question.In contrast, the 'proffesional' soldiers portraied in this game can't hit a stationary enemy.. from a stationary crouch.. with a holographic sight.. at 30-40 yards.The enemy advanced, and at less than 10 yards, more like 5, I finally managed to score a hit.. Not by carefull aiming, as I had done up to this point, but by spraying an entire magazine at his center body mass.Also, forget anything about bigger weapons and more powerfull sighting systems in single player, as you will always be leading your team. I decided not to try multi-player, so I have no idea if they are actually usefull there.I only tried a few weapons, but I noticed that the Steyr SMG, which should be awesome at this stuff; I've fired the Steyr Assault Rifle, and it's magnificent... The Steyr SMG in this game is crap. Horrible accuracy and control.For some reason, all the weapons use silencers by default, but this is worthless, as the enemies apparently can hear silenced weapons through several concrete walls.Weapon recoil is hillarious. Muzzle travel is comparable to firing an LMG from a standing position. Nuff said.You got a selection of armor, but I found that only the heaviest armor was usefull. The restrictions on wearing the biggest armor is not really that big, but being able to survive a few hits from the OP AI enemies is worth everything.Movement and controlI appreciate the effort to limit player mobility. However, there is a fine line between limited mobility and useless mobility.You can sprint. You can walk.. and you can sneak. Fairly standard. However, even at less than 10 yards, you have little chance of hitting anything if you as much as sneak, let alone walk around. I found that there was no such thing as hitting anything while on the move. So move-stop-aim-shoot became standard.One good thing has been implemented. You can turn on your flashlight and use the light as an aiming cone. Much like the proffesionals do. This lets you hit things in close quarters without actually aiming through the sight.As a nod to other tactical shooters, you can lean to a side. The first-person view effect being that the screen tilts a bit and your view moves a hairline fracture to the side. However, you CANNOT move while leaning, so if you want to take the smart option at doors, you will learn a new, weird dance of getting in position, leaning.. looking at the doorframe still.. un-lean.. move.. lean.. still looking at the door frame.. unlean.. move.. Ohhh, the enemy in the room just shot you.This should have been an awesome mechanic, but I decided real early to just forget about it.And lastly, speaking of moving, while you have been limited by the devs to how fast and agile you can move, the enemies have no such problems. Often running or dashing through rooms, then stopping bone-snappingly fast and firing off one round that hits you straight in the face.The resultThis game has done one thing right.The devs have reminded me that, Counter-Strike wasn't that bad a game after all, and maybe I should download it again and play it a bit.I know I paid €1.24 for this game.. but I really want my money back, not to mention the hour or so I spend playing it.So don't.. Just don't..			"

												This game is pretty crappy.  The tutorial doesn't give you what keys you are supposed to use, which can be hard since they wont even let you access the menu besides resume and Menu, A.I. will stand for 3 maybe 4 seconds before they actually shoot you, and also there is no consequences for shooting your teammates in S.P.  Even though I got this for a few cards that I sometimes collect i'd say it was worth the 10 cards that I used to trade with.  Other than that this game is a pile of s***.  It's hilarious at first watching teammates stand while you shoot everything then it becomes annoying.  If I had to give this a rating out of ten, this would get a 2 since there is a bit of fun to be had.			"

Don't event get me started on the ♥♥♥♥ing monstrousity that the creaters dared call ai. Artificial intelligence my left ♥♥♥ cheek! there is nothing intelligent about them.

												As all other reviews already state, don't buy this game, it's not worth anyone's money. Made by a team of former Rainbow Six team members it is kind of a disgrace to R6, SWAT and games alike. Released month ago this game is still not fixed properly.			"

												How this game even managed to be released is beyond me. With its God-awful AI, terrible interface, and horrible animations, it feels like a product in its alpha stage. Dear Lord, how could this possibly even be considered a finished product? Who was in charge of the quality control for this game? A dead fish? This game had so much potential, but it ended up absolutely wretched.			"

												Takedown is a mess, but I've enjoyed the game nevertheless. It's glitchy as hell, and the netcode is unreliable, but when I have played with friends online I've had fun.It's a barebones experience. Do not expect a planning stage, or any team AI control beyond hold/follow commands and basic rules of engagement modification. The campaign is also short, and somewhat disjointed.The fact of the matter is that this game was obviously in an Early Access state upon release (The install directory of the game even lists it as ""Takedown Red Sabre Early Access""), and wasn't listed as such in the store. That was enough to deal a severe blow to what could have been a pretty decent little tactical shooter.At this point, while I hope the developers will continue fixing and improving on their design, there's little incentive for 505 Games, the publisher, to fund them to do so.Again, the whole situation is a mess, but as much as part of me wants to dismiss it wholesale, I can't say I hate the game.It's brutal and unforgiving in the same way the old Rainbow Six games were, which is bound to be offputting to some people, but scratches an itch most shooters don't for me right now.Shots can kill or seriously injure you very quickly, and there is no way to recover health.The AI opponents have moments of startling cleverness, though most of the times they drop you will be due to not cursoring over them fast enough to evade their sometimes exceptionally quick and accurate weapons fire. There's a tenseness to the action that would be lost if the damage model and AI were more forgiving.The map designs are open and interesting, each one providing you with two potential ""insertion points"" which determine where you start. Some of the design is actually fairly visually attractive, though strange things like reflections that don't actually reflect the environment in a coherent way can slightly mar the experience. (Particularly in the ""HQ"" level.)Despite there being numerous doors on most maps that are purely decorative and don't open, there's a refreshing amount of freedom to how you approach each mission. The nonlinearity also scratches an itch I haven't had many first-person games reach recently. This isn't always player-friendly design in the sense of providing easy and obvious ways to progress, but I'm not sure this is a situation where one can have their cake and eat it too.HUD is rather minimal, and they go so far as to strip you of a crosshair. You can aim down sights, but that slows your movement. Recoil is extremely noticeable on most weapons, and really needs to be minded in combat.These are traits that add interest to me, but could be deal breakers for some.What's most likely to bother people though, and rightly so, is that the game simply isn't finished. It's glitchy to the point that sometimes something as simple as switching weapons will lock you into a selection, leaving you twiddling your thumbs when the grenade slot you locked into runs out of ammo. Menus are glitchy and need to be minded, sometimes forgetting loadout changes (particularly the addition/removal of silencers). It's missing features as simple as text chat in game lobbies.Despite the fact that I myself have found enjoyment in the game, I can't bring myself to recommend anyone spend $14.99 on it - especially not when Rainbow Six 3 Gold, which is $5 cheaper, scratches all of the same gaming itches and has far more polish, depth, and content. That said, Rainbow Six 3 is more than ten years old and there have been too few games like it on the market since its release. This is a genre and style of gameplay that needs preserving, but Takedown just isn't offering enough.(As Serellan updates this title, assuming they do, I will update this review. As of the time of this writing, the last update was February 6th, 2014.)			"

												To be frank this game is awful. For when it was released the graphics were bad, the controls and movement feels so clunky, and the AI is either Forest Gump or worlds best marksman with no in between. Alongside that the menu is a broken system, often ignoring choices. At least PvP is enjoyable so I dont feel like the whole one pound was wasted. Normally I'm not picky with having over 200 games but this one really takes the mick. If you want a good tactical shooter, go back to the old rainbow 6 and ghost recon games, you'll have more enjoyment.			"

												This game was not worth 1.50. I should have never sold my cards to buy this game, it's not even a real tactical shooter. It's a slow paced shooter with several tactical elements, like.... walking very slowly.There is no fluid door opening, and if you open a door, you are more than likely going to die unless you place yourself at a wall. The options for this game are absolutely horrid. At max sensitivity, I still feel incredibly sluggish, making me want to throw up. Literally. The AI are as dumb as bricks, but they have an insanely fast reaction time ( wut? ).Occasionally, you'll be able to kill 20 enemies with ease, due to how stupid they are, but sometimes, you will be insta-killed by the game by an enemy who will use only about 0.2 seconds to shoot you. This is coming from someone who has fast reflexes and good aim. Not to mention, when you do actually get shot at, you will shot in the head. This happens 90% of the time and it makes the medium and heavy armor types very useless.The equipment options in the game are very basic, you get a frag grenade, a flash grenade, and a breach charge. The flashbang usually doesn't work, as terrorists seem to be completely normal ( By shooting me in the head ).They don't retreat from frag grenades, oddly enough... But the grenade physics make them feel like rubber balls.Breach charges are generally useless, as the AI will either open the door on you as soon as you put the charge there, or... There won't be anyone in the room.The mission variety in the game is pretty awful. There's only about 5 different missions, and this game was released several months ago. The community is either non-existant, or extremely stupid TKing trolls. You get 1 of the 2.The friendly AI is extremely stupid, worse than the enemy. You get terrible command options over them, and you are unable to seperate them and tactically manage them. You can tell them to follow you or watch a certain area, which barely works. You can't have 2 guys watch the door and have your sniper on the roof, because there is no way to tell them to get into a specific location.The weapons and damage in this game are REALLY weird. For a tactical game, it's weird how you don't even have to aim to accurately hit a target. Aiming is useless in CQC, you have a better chance to charge and strafe. And when you do aim, you can literally strafe left and right ( ADAD Spam ) and dodge most bullets. Except from the guy who instantly headshots you. Don't put weapons into full auto, just put your weapon in single shot and click as fast as you can. You can get much better accuracy and less recoil, while killing targets in 1-3 hits.The enemy AI in this game is really immersion breaking. ( If you wanted that kind of thing ).They seem to charge at you DIRECTLY ( Not heading towards cover ) or, they run away from you and do a 180 and headshot you, then retreat again into a random corner.The AI doesn't patrol around an area, engage in conversation with other AI, or do anything.Their only goal is to wait for you and to kill you. Being stealthy in this game has no benefit, most of them will somehow know where you are anyways, and then instantly headshot you. Surviving a bullet is rare, especially since armor isn't protective.(RECAP)There isn't a real story in the game, so that's a negative.No planning mode. A minus on the 'tactical' side of things.No advanced room clearing tactics. Just open and peek in until everyone is dead.Extreme lack of AI commands.Dead Community, about 40 players at MOST. I'm pretty sure Star Wars: Battlefront 2 has 180 players at most. Which is extremely sad.Extremely sluggish controls, including mouse sensitvity.Extremely barebones options menu. Extremely barebones menu in general.Very slow-paced, but not tactical.Not fun, or engaging. Instead of being intense, this game is more than likely going to make you rage.Buggy. ( After several months )Huge lack of content.Terribad AI.Un-immersive. No cool features either, like a tactical map or an overhead picture you can draw on or a planning mode.Lack of customization. Pick your guns, what armor, what you want on your patch, and what equipment. That's it.Completely random crashing and connectivity issues.1/10    -At least they tried-                      Actually, I don't even know if they tried, they seemed quick to place the game on Xbox Arcade.I recommend that you buy Rainbow Six: Raven Shield instead of this garbage.It's a much older game, but it's also much more fun.Especially with friends, where as this game makes everyone just get angry at each other until everyone leaves.

												This game is so good. I literally cannot stop playing it.Here is a list of my favorite things: Bot MechanismSo the bot mechanism for this game is impecable!The bots work fairly well with team play and seem to always have your back.  The developers of this game put a lot of effort into making the teamate bots useful and seem as if they are real players.  It is insane the level of detail the developers have added to this mechanism.Map QualityThis game has one of the best graphical rendering systems i have ever used.  The maps are gorgeous and flaw free!  Each map was made to be a fully emmersed scenario where you and your squad will feel as if you are actually there.Enemy AIThe Enemy Ai is the only thing I have 1 issue with.  This issue is they are just way to realistic!  They seem to play as if they are real players and not AI!  They call out to eachother your position, they tactically flank and execute plays against you while you are trying to defuse the bombs!Overall! This game is a definite 10/10 and I would recommend it to everyone!Most realistic shooter I have ever played.			"

												I met a lot of my friends in Raven Shield. We then progressed to other tactical games such as SWAT. With a lack of true tactical games where strategy is needed we had high hopes for this. We bought it, installed it, and played in for 30 minutes. It was promptly removed.Recently, we thought we'd give it another try since it has been a while. Maybe improvements were made and it was progressing more towards completion. Wrong.I do have to say that the player models are pretty good. That's the only thing good about this game. Sorry guys....I'm just...sorry. Is there a way to remove it from my Steam library?			"

												Okay, I've put in a fair amount of time to this game, -90% off? FPS Game that is tactical? Sure! Bought 7 copies for 5 dollars, and got it to work as soon as i put it in, okay. The loadout is personally my favorite aspect of this game, you get to make your own loadout, to fit your personal standards, cool. But the game, is, TERRIBLE, first off, when you play the training, its basic, you already know how to fit this game, the controls are standard, but serve no purpose. When you play your first mission, you will know what I'm talking about. The AI is too smart, smarter than your highly trained SWAT team you have following you like mindless zombies. When they see a bad-guy, they say Tango Spotted, so I tell them to shoot it, they just look at it though. The enemy AI always knows where you are. Your only intel is what the game gives you. You spend more time getting killed by super buffed pirates than you do killing pirates that aren't trained. If you're going stealthy, you'd expect that they wouldn't know where you are. But really, all they do is aim at you, until you come into the direct line of sight, then they start running after you. Glass is bad for you, because you can't entirely see through it, but the enemy can, and shoot at you, killing you on the first hit. There are around 2-3 people that are programmed to look in a certain direction, and not staring at you the entire time. Your team is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you cannot tell a single person what to do. You have a sniper, an assault, and a breach, you are supposed to be the recon, but what if you don't like that class? Your team will stare at a bad guy, but not fire. They do not know where a single person is, until the person shoots them in the head, with their 99.99% accuracy, while yours and your teammates accuracy is 80%. Your team is clunky, ending up alerting the enemy before you can scope out the map, because you cannot make them wear different armor, or armor fit for what you want to do. The mission always wants you to go steath, when the mission objectives call for action. Your team always has silencers, when you don't even need them. Now I'm getting started on multiplayer. Half the time, you're on the team with a prick, who only wants you to hate the game you payed for, it's not even free, so they kill you with their insta-kill guns, wearing huge-♥♥♥ armor, so they kill the entire team before the game even really starts, then they kill themselves, because they're bored. Other than that the maps are too big for 6 on 6 team deathmatches. If you could have 12 people on each team, then it would be fair, and the match would be 90% more interesting, but it's full of boring experience. I was lucky to buy the game for less than a dollar, you, are not. If you really want this game, just message me and I'll send you a copy. But be warned, until the makers seriously patch this game. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. 2/10			"

												This is probably the CS:GO training simulator for going against aim bots. The enemy will give you little to no time on being detected, so you might as well try to be quick on your shots. The bad thing about being detected is that the aim line is right at your head with seemingly little to no spray or recoil from the bots as much as from you. If you play this, good luck and may God have mercy on your soul.			"

												Takedown: Red Sabre is a first person shooter that markets itself as a tactical shooter using mechanics akin to Americas' Army or Counterstrike. It fails to achieve this, as it fails to achieve anything, this game can best be summarized as an unfinished product, which if it was in early access it would be perhaps excusable (but it is not). Even the directory folder states that it is an early build of the game, and it plays like one. I cannot under any circumstance or at any price recommend this unfinished product, all you are given is a very small handful of missions with broken AI/game mechanics which make the game ultimately unplayable. It isn't even worth it for the steam cards.			"

												Where do I start?  Off the bat, lets get this bit out of the way, yes this game is awful, in almost every way you can think of, and a few you haven't yet.  But despite that, on occasion when they let their guard down I manage to convince a few friends to shuffle (that's what you do in this game, you        shuffle, noisily) behind me in a few (you can only manage a few before you'd prefer to remove your own eyes rather than keep playing) games of the various coop missions.  Yet somewhere in there, and I can't quite put my finger on it, there's something I'm quite fond of in the game.I often think, that if you gave a turnip enough time, and a few beginners guide to Pascal lessons, this is exactly what they'd come up with.  You'll never understand it, but its amusing just the same.There is potential here, I believe there is  a need for such a game rite now, and you do get a sense of the innovative and exciting ideas that are fueling this game, they just don't come through yet.Do you buy it?  Of course.  I'd really like to see It grow,   Its not where it wants to be yet, but I'm sure Christian Allen and the team at Serellan will take it there.  Check out their site, they are indie game development team that really value their community and are listening.  This is why I'm continuing to support it.			"

												This has got to be the best and most realistic shooter I have ever played PERIOD.  11 out of 7.  6 stars.  3 Thumbs up.This game is not for casual scrubby COD players, this is for the more serious skilled players, no not players, shooters.  You will actually feel like you are a real member of a special tatics team.  You get to play by yourself, or with up to three other team mates, either other human players or AI who actually act as though they were really special ops not just random 9 year olds spraying down hallways.  So if you can manage to get three serious people together you can have a great time simulating a real special ops team or team in general.  The game is really well designed and also, I'm pretty sure I mentioned this already, it's also really realistic.  You can create up to four different classes or presets with different gear.  You can also pretty much customize anything you could ever want!  You can pick your primary weapon and a secondary.  Your primary will pretty much be any weapon you could ever want.  You got rifles, single shot, burst fire, AND fully automatic, you got shotguns, you got it all, but no silly rocketlaunchers or grenade launchers as those would be both unneccesary and unrealistic for the missions you would be taking part of.  Your secondary will usually be some sort of pistol or a light weapon.  On top of choosing your own weapons, you can also pick attachments like different ironsights/scopes, and if that wasn't enough, you can also select different ammo (yes it matters), so be sure to have the right ammo for the right mission.  Then you get different equipment you can bring, I'm not going to bother listing them all but you can choose from a large assortment of grenades, you got claymores, you got all tons of stuff it's like a terrorist's dream come true.  I almost forgot to mention this, but you can also pick different armour or protective equipment that actually effect your gameplay, like it will make it so you can't run as fast or for a long amount of time if you have heavier equipment.  On top of that, you can even put a nice little patch representing whatever country you want on your sleeve.Now when you got your presets set up, you can pick either Singleplayer or Multiplayer to try them out.  I don't really want to take up too much of your time talking about the amazing thing called multiplayer, so in this review I'm only going to talk about single player.  First of all you get to choose which type of mission you want to do, from tango hunt to bomb disarment.  You'll get your mission briefing at the start of the mission and you can pick an area for deployment.  After that it's the same deal as most of those ""army"" or ""special forces"" shooters (cod, moh, etc.), where you'll go through the mission, but it's not like them at all.  You don't have that ridiculous red border to show that you're dying, you'll actually feel like you're dying and then eventually if you don't start to get serious, you'll be dead.  You also won't be picking up any of those silly health packs or other  nonsense pick ups.  The only things you'll be picking up are guns from the people you kill.  The enemy AI is also not like other typical games, where they just always miss and are totally oblivious of your presence.  They will hear your gunshots, they will hear your footsteps, they will call for backup.  Unless you get with the program you will die.  I'm not going to ruin the suprise of what happens when you manage to beat a level, that's an experience you just have to experience yourself.Well this review for this great game was a bit longer than I inteded it to be so I'll stop soon.  I'm going to start capitalizing every letter now to put emphasis on my next sentences.  THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY GAME, IT IS PRETTY MUCH A STEAL TOO.  IT'S SOO CHEAP I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE DOESN'T OWN THIS MASTERPIECE.  THIS GAME HAS IT ALL, GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, RADIOS.  I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I COULD ASK FOR IN A GAME.  THIS IS THE MOST REALISTIC SHOOTING EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING IN DANGER.  I CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH, THIS IS A  MUST BUY GAME !!!I'm pretty sure I forgot to mention some things, but I hope you get my point.			"

												New tactical shooter at a low price running on Unreal? Why is is so cheap?If I had to place a specific genre on the top of my list of games I want to play the most, it would have to be the ""Sci-Fi Tatical Shooter"" genre. While Stellar Marines isn't anywhere close to complete, I looked for something to challenge me in the mean time.At the end of the day, playing isn't good enough. There has to be a challenge, and that is what seems to separate the two major classes of modern gamers. Games used to make you rage to the point of throwing your machine out the window (and not due to bugs!). Takedown: Red Sabre returns to these roots for the most part, which is why it was hyped up at the start.So what about all the other reviews and metascore? Why are they giving the title a huge thumbs down? Well the key issue lays with release day. I had thought about purchasing the title on release day, but passed off wanting to ensure I wasn't wasting money on a buggy game. Good thing I did, bugs were everywhere in the game. People would disconnect from singleplayer games randomly, and the server browser didn't work. Rest assured most (if not all) release day bugs have been fixed.Being a ""hardcore"" tactical shooter, it's not easy to beat. Playing by yourself is quite a trick, so bring friends whenever possible.Speaking of friends -- to make the game enjoyable you should bring some. The game isn't VAC secured, and trolls will be in game sooner or later. Teamkilling seems to consist of a moral punishment, nothing more. There's no current system (2/10/2014) to get rid of them without knowing Unreal's console. An oversight for sure, mainly from the game being so cheap. And don't forget there's no private or password protected lobbies!The game isn't complete, and shouldn't be advertised as such. The AI is very hit-or-miss, having naturally deadly aim the moment you open the door, but then stare at you in other cases. Flashbangs don't interact how they should, as AI don't seem to be ""flashed"" when thrown. The AI also seem to be unaware of any sounds, but then can somehow know you are outside the door.Maps are well designed, modeled after real life places that a tactical team might find themselves in. The key part is that the levels don't lack in openness. You have to be naked out in the open sometime, proving to be an almost instant death if you don't play it right. Indoor environments react how they should, but door handling with latency can be an issue.Could the game be more? For sure and without a doubt. Examples would be finer tuning on the Kevlar or bullet resistant gear (like where on the body), a prone position, or even a true clip/magazine system (a big must for hardcore). However, the title has to clean up the AI. In it's current state, it's not really hardcore, but it's getting there. One way to clean the AI up would be to add group intelligence like that seen in Half Life 2. Squad tactics are shown on the human side of Takedown, but not on the AI side of things. It would be simple as adding code when an AI spots a human player, other AI join in the firefight. Just play the level called ""Facility"" on Co-op. You will see what I mean, the AI all act independently.So there you have it. All the issues but good positives as well. This review is kind of odd being price dependent. I purchased the title for about $1.79. At that cost, I would happily slap a 7 for title. At it's regular cost, 6.5. With the odd handling somehow working out to make a hard game, it certainly checks the ""different"" checkbox for me. Anyone that knows me well enough understands it's a key criteria to meet.6.5/10 - 7/10			"

If you want to get steam cards then get this game as it gives you 1 card for each map you play but otherwise it isnt worth it, Just stick to CS:GO or cod or whatever. Do not invest in this game.

												Got this game for free from the forums. Someone bought a four pack for some friends but they all denied the gift. Said I might as well add it to my collection of games I would personally never play. But then I wanted to get first hand on what everyone hated about it, So I hopped on bourd the shi* train to shi*ville and had a very short ride there. Right when I opened the game it I was in an avalanch of loud music and badly made intro sequencing that for the life of me could not skip, to get to the poorly made homescreen. I then went first to the training sequences to get a feel of the game. Trust me when I say this. There was no ""Feel"" Besides me bashing my head on the keyboard as I had to listen to the voice instructor and be frozen still for a good 20 minuets as he explained how to pis* in a can. I then got board and just got online. Seeing that only one server was active I joined and from my surprise. They were all 10 year old kids talking about eachothers mothers, I then tried playing the game. As I entered a room to get demolished by a guy facing the other direction as he shot at the wall. I then left the game. Deleted my :System32: File and said screw it to the world of videogames. Since then I have gotten married wrote a novel and even finished lawschool and now I am going to be a sucessful man in the name of the law. Overall long review short this game is the best thing thats ever happened to me and the time I played of it will be the best memories of my gaming career I once withheld. Thanks 505 Games!			"

												Many people were thrilled when they heard they'd be getting a tactical shooter again in this day and age of action shooters like COD. The premise of tactical team-based combat ala SWAT and Rainbow Six is mouthwatering to any veteran team-player. With one of the key designers of the classic Rainbow Six games behind the helm it almost seemed too good to be true and unfortunately, it kind of is. First off i'll state the games has MUCH promise and the prospect of user generated content is fantastic, but the problem with Takedown is it lacks character and style its predecessors had. It feels very generic and lifeless plus the addition of serious network hiccups and server browser issues dosent help. If you played ""Realistic Shooters"" like Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising, SWAT 4, or ANY of the 3 Rainbow Six games, you'll learn this game pales in comparison to those. It has a budget price but for that same price you can buy one of the games i just mentioned and they would be more worth the buck. All in all, the initial feeling for this game is disappointment, but only time will tell if the devs can somehow redeem these critical mistakes.			"

												When I first loaded up Takedown: Red Sabre I was at a loss for words. The game portrays realistic close quarter combat in ways never seen before. The sheer atmosphere of the game quite literally took my breath away, because it made me want to die.The game is broken in so many ways, that you find yourself trying to change your loadout to one of the four predefined setups, only to find yourself always playing with the same weapon.The AI will either be intent on looking at the same wall until they are inevitably killed, or they will pull a blindfolded 720 noscope as soon as they see an atom on your body.Suffice to say, the game is broken to the level where it becomes a joke to play, but that in itself results in a tonne of fun. For all it's flaws, I've never had as many laughs playing a supposedly ""serious"" game as I have playing Takedown: Red Sabre.			"

												ATTENTION:  THIS IS SIMPLY MY OPINION.  PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME ♥♥♥♥ ABOUT THIS GAME IN FUTURE REVIEWS OR COMMENTS.     I do recomend this game, not because i like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games, but because I really enjoy a challenge when it comes to gaming, and this game brought me that challenge.  I will warn you though.  This game WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO KILL YOUR COMPUTER!  The AI are extremely annoying, being able to have their back turned to you way down the cargoship map, and then shooting you with an AK.  When it comes to the tactics, this is very fun, especially with friends in CO-OP!  Some of the maps are hard, especially the ones with long ranged targets.  I can't say that you will like this game, but I do, and enjoy trying to beat the super  AI that always sees you.			"

												I bought this game a while ago as a joke for me and my friends, seeing as it was only around 80p at the time. The game did not disappoint. From enemies that would shoot you on site with pinpoint accuracy and turning back around. To them turning into ♥♥♥♥ wits that have never heard of a gun before and have never heard of basic movement. Oh, but it doesn't stop there. The 'hardcore' aspect of the game amounts to enemies killing you in one or two shots even with heavy armor, or having the whole team wiped in less than 10 seconds because ... I don't know, they sniffed out your presence from a mile away. If there is anything to take from Takedown: Red Sabre, is that it will make you and your friends laugh from how bad the game is. So thanks Takedown, you're the best gag gift money can buy.			"

												I'd really like to give this game a recommendation to balance out all the hate, but I can't. It WAS shipped pretty unfinished, but it's a functional game now. No really, it's pretty solid now. It's fairly stripped down. No tactical map or plot, just creep about and shoot. However, it's a dead game at this point. No one plays it online, there's no community, and any future support is doubtful at best. It's a case of alienating an over-hyped audience with a truely terrible launch.			"

My friend and I are huge PAYDAY 2 fans and we thought that this game would be similar to that. With the $1.50 price tag, it was almost an instant sell for us.SO MUCH DISAPPOINTMENT. Almost everything about this game is terrible. The graphics are mediocre at best, the controls are very uncomfortable, the AI is terrible, etc, etc, etc. It's almost like the developers put more time, effort, and money into the trailer than into the actual game.

												This game has a clunky set of controls. The fact that the lean feature doesn't work when moving and combine that with the fact that you barely lean makes CQB next to impossible which the game is primarily based around. The friendly AI is always too close to you, which is strange since they are highly trained special forces soldiers or somthing, too make matters worse when you die and switch to one of the AI soldiers he's usally too close to where you got killed and the completely over powered enemy AI kills you as soon as you switch over to the next character. This game could have been a lot better if they had of held off releasing the game until much much later so they could fix the bugs properly and just improve the game in general.I hope one day the game get better so that I can recomend this game but that seems like it isn't going to be any time soon.

												Having played this after buying it for 79p (around $1/50 rublei) I can honestly say that I do not recommend this game to anyone. Ever. Even if it's free. There are several issues with the game and I am going to post a few:1. Lag. Everyone gets lag. It's terrible. However funny it is watching your team walk into walls it gets boring after a while.2. AI. The bots in this game are terrible. Team mates don't help you and enemies instantly kill you while they are facing into a wall.3. Shooting. You cannot kill anyone. Insane recoil and no weapon damage as well as inability to aim.4. Snails. You move like a snail.5. Feel. The menus are horrible. They don't work. You cannot change loadout for some reason. You cannot change settings during a game and they are very limited. The chat is horrible and messages disappear after 3 seconds. I am yet to find voice chat.6. Players. Barely anyone plays this and those who do hate it. End of.			"

												Absolutely awful game. I was sadly a supporter of the kickstarter for this game. From all the kickstarter support, you would have thought that these guys would have made a better game in every sense of the word. Through their marketing online, they made it seem that this game would be like a more realistic Rainbow Six: Vegas, which was one of my favorite shooters of the past decade. When I finally installed the game I could not belive my eyes. The game was truly terrible. Im wondering if all the money they raised for the kickstarter was used on rendering highly processed screenshots to show us. The game looks and plays nothing like what they showed on the kickstarter and is full of bugs and glitches. Dont waste your money or if this game winds up being free, dont waste your time.

												I bought this game when it was 1 dollar and got so far around 2 hours of playing time on it. That's well worth 1 dollar in my opinion. But 5 dollars? Not so much.Now, if you are looking at it for the full price, which is 5 dollars, you should take your money elsewhere. This game was kickstarted and I was looking forward to an actual tactical shooter as everyone else was. The team behind this game were a good set of developers who everyone believed could make a really good tactical shooter that could compare to games like SWAT 4 or the old Rainbow Six games.What you get instead is a game that seems about 80% finished, with solid shooting mechanics but shoddy texture work and poor AI. The AI sometimes hear you through two walls but sometimes don't notice you when you are next to them. Doesn't make any sense. The online community for this game doesn't exist as everyone has jumped ship on this game. So you're stuck with the AI teammates who just get killed constantly.For a dollar, if you are interested in a tactical shooter that you'll probably play for a couple of hours, go for it. But if you are looking for a tactical shooter for 5 dollars, look elsewhere. You're just wasting your money here.			"

												I usually don't write reviews for games, especially if they're bad, but boy... Thankfully I got 2 copies for $1.50, so it's not that big of a loss. It provided me with a lot of laughs at just how bad this game is. It's like if Rainbow Six and Counter Strike were to have a child, this would be it. But the child would have such bad mental retardation that it would basically be a vegetable. To pu that into applicable terms, it has the ""tactical"" ""gameplay"" of Rainbow Six with the ""style"" of Counter Strike. They might have managed to emulate a visual style close to Counter Strike, but oh boy, they missed all of the functionality. How about the tactial gameplay of Rainbow Six? Nope. AI is too stupid when you're not shooting, and way too smart when you are. They run out into the open, or run away from you. Basically, this video sums it up just perfectly: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0_W4Oo8dEA Stay the hell away, I don't care how cheap it is, unless you want to just laugh at how bad it is. I guess for $1.50 that's okay. 10 minutes was plenty to see how horrible this game was and that I never want to play it again. Is there a way to delete a game from your Steam library...?			"

I thought wrong.This game is so bad, and i feel bad for 505 games for trusting it. Bad ai, stupid situations and no commands or instructions at all.			"

												If you're looking for a modern tactical shooter... Look elsewhere, this is not it.It's not as bad as some of the other reviews make out... That's about the best I can say about it though, because in all fairness it's just not very good. It's just simply not good...It's a bit like playing the very first Rainbow Six game... Trouble is it looks like the very first Rainbow Six game, with less detail. Textures look like something from 15 or 20 years ago. Lighting is flat and lifeless. Shadows, what shadows?I can ignore bad graphics if the gameplay is good. Trouble is the gameplay in this is dull and uninspiring... Walk round a corner with Guy1, get shot in the head. Walk round the same corner with Guy2 and shoot the guy that shot Guy1, open a door and get shot in the head. Guy3 goes through the door, shoots the baddy that killed Guy2. A door across the corridor opens and Guy3 gets shot in the head. Guy4 meanwhile is stuck with his ♥♥♥ hanging out of a wall before the first corner. Because Guy4 is such a derp, he gets surrounded and then shot in the head...People go on about the AI being ""too hard"", yet I don't think they're as tough as the old school Rainbow Six AI... The AI can be punishing and difficult if your team make too much noise. It's the games one redeeming feature in my mind.When it's on sale at a £1 it's alright if you can get a couple of people together, but it wears thin quickly...TL/DR? If you're looking for a modern tactical shooter... Get Insurgency instead.			"

												This was supposed to be the great hero that would bring back hardcore tactical co-op first person shooting to the old farts like myself, who have been waiting for a successor to games like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 and SWAT 4. It held great promise and the developer spoke such sweet words, pouring honey on the ears of the people like me. Then it was released...At first it seemed like a game with some launch hick-ups and bugs. The basis was there for T:RS to take this not-so-well sought after throne, but every update was just making more and more of a mess. Then, not very long after release, they started to sell it for 1€ and gave all owners an extra copy to give away to unsuspecting enemies friends... which is kind of a clear sign that they threw in the towel and gave up on it.As said; the basic foundation is there; a hardcore, slow paced, co-op, tactical game... if you can get into it. It's hard enough to get a group to successfully join a server, but then you can't make that server private. The AI seems okay at first, but is actually bugged out like crap in a thunderstorm. The game freezes, the game rolls over like a dog without anyone commanding, the game just doesn't do what it's suppose to and does everything it's not suppose to. The only thing that worked from the get go; the in-game text-to-speech chat, they had removed in an update. First the maps were all too big, so you were running around searching for the last terrorist... then they made them smaller, but made them minimal.Nothing has gone right with Takedown: Red Sabre, and my kind (the hardcore co-op FPS:ers) had to look elsewhere. Fortunately we found Insurgency, which is a bloody good game; get that one instead!The only thing T:RS managed to do was to have our gaming group make sarcastic jokes about ""...it's in the hardcore nature of the game."" and ""...this game is epic!"" which were compliments once upon a time, but after the release and subsequent downfall of T:RS have now become the worst insults we can say about a game.It's all just really sad...

I was waiting for a modern revamp of the genre but to my GREAT DISSAPOINTMENT we are left with this, a $15 Beta that is as unpolished and unfinished as some online flash games. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME NOT EVEN FOR $2. Here is a list that includes but is not limited to...-Terrible AI (practically non-existent/worthless), and if somehow you can find someone to play with you have to deal with...- Hackneyed weapon and attatchment selections (silencer, holographic sight, acog scope, thats practically all of them).-Weak gun mechanics and physics.-No level of character or weapon customization that has become standard for even the most mediocre of FPS.The only pros for this game would have been justifiable 10 years ago.

It was on sale 80% off, $0.99, so I figured why not.The devs won't shut up about how tactical you have to be. How thoroughly you need to plan, how prepared you need to be, blah blah blah.The only ""tactics"" in this game seem to be:Peek around corners and shoot bad guys before they shoot you.Try to be sneaky and quiet.Fail at being sneaky and quiet because the bad guys apparently have the best hearing in the world, no matter how silent you think you're being.SWAT 4 was amazing. It came out in 2005, and it has more features and better gameplay than this pile of disappointment.It's pretty sad when a decade-old game is superior in every way.			"

												I came in thinking it was a more hardcore version of counterstrike, only to be baffled by the mission setup. I redid the first mission about 5 times before realizing that I had already completed it, but it  just doesn't tell you. Then I went on to the first mission thinking that it was a little mistake, before realizing that the AI are so overpowered they can hear you sneaking through the walls. Even your peaking ability doesn't help, as it only allows a small vision of the area, not so far that you could actually see them like it was desined to. I didn't even care to play the other missions fully as this one really just demoralized, depressed, and unsatissfied me in everyway possible for a game like this. So unless you want to waste your money, I personally do not recommend this game.			"

												This game has a clunky set of controls. The fact that the lean feature doesn't work when moving and combine that with the fact that you barely lean makes CQB next to impossible which the game is primarily based around. The friendly AI is always too close to you, which is strange since they are highly trained special forces soldiers or somthing, too make matters worse when you die and switch to one of the AI soldiers he's usally too close to where you got killed and the completely over powered enemy AI kills you as soon as you switch over to the next character. This game could have been a lot better if they had of held off releasing the game until much much later so they could fix the bugs properly and just improve the game in general.I hope one day the game get better so that I can recomend this game but that seems like it isn't going to be any time soon.

												Absolutely awful game. I was sadly a supporter of the kickstarter for this game. From all the kickstarter support, you would have thought that these guys would have made a better game in every sense of the word. Through their marketing online, they made it seem that this game would be like a more realistic Rainbow Six: Vegas, which was one of my favorite shooters of the past decade. When I finally installed the game I could not belive my eyes. The game was truly terrible. Im wondering if all the money they raised for the kickstarter was used on rendering highly processed screenshots to show us. The game looks and plays nothing like what they showed on the kickstarter and is full of bugs and glitches. Dont waste your money or if this game winds up being free, dont waste your time.

												Well. I hate to make this my first review, but I don't feel like looking at my Child Health, Safety, & Nutrition coursework for the week. Here we go.So, the good news: guns, bullets, and the overall concept.The bad news: how all those come together.I won't be the first or last to state that the AI is just awful. As mentioned in another review, the enemy soldiers can pick you off from across the map with one quick and silent shot through your cover, faster than you can say: ""I wonder if people still play Ghost Recon?"" Sometimes all of them converge on the player at one single time, and if it wasn't bad enough that one has an advantage over you (that's right, I said <<advantage>> because they're Aimbots), you'll have no hope against multiple foes because... the controls are pretty stiff. Very stiff. Fiddle and configure all you want. Go ahead, stick that 360 control in. It does not matter. Now, some of us are not surprised by a more confined feeling for a game like this... except, here, the controls wear a straight jacket. There's not much that's smooth about them. At all, really.Now, as others have also said, I really wanted to like this game. Truly. In its current state, it is <<not>> a finished game. It's not. It's ugly.Wait - speaking of ugly - have you seen the graphics on it? Now, okay, I get it, graphics are not the end-all. But it wouldn't hurt to have worked on the aesthetics as long as the gameplay, tactics, realism, and controls were all being ignored.Verdict: In its current state, this game is not worth playing or owning. If they do a gargantuan overhaul and addres all the issues we see... maybe we'll talk.'til then, dudes, turn this baby down.PS: Sorry, Mike, I gifted this to you so it wouldn't be in my ""inventory.""

												Rainbow Six with ramped up difficulty and realistic gameplay. The game is so hard that the player is pushed into a position where they have to use their tactical prowess to survive. Guns basically insta-kill and there are pretty much no revives. The game, in its complete form, is an utter disaster. The maps are way too linear for tactical gameplay. I kept walking down stairs or into a room with a guy, and it would be who shot first rather than what strategy I used. The map design just doesn't help this mess, and that's only the beginning. Rainbow Six and other tactical shooters are fun because they don't sacrifice gameplay for realism. In Red Sabre, you can't get revived, and you don't respawn. If you die, you lose, and you are taken back to the lobby. In Hotline miami, you die a lot, but you respawn quickly and get as many chances as you want to complete the level. The same thing goes for Super Meat Boy. The truth is, Red Sabre needs a reason to be worth playing. The graphics are bland, the maps are linear and unexciting to say the least, and I don't feel compelled to completely restart the mission each time I fail at it. The developers clearly wanted a realistic feel, so that the players would be forced to play tactically. They did almost everything wrong with this game, and it isn't even close to being redeemed. The truth is, there are way better games on the market that do what this game does, but better. Honestly, I feel like this game tries to be unique among other shooters, but goes way over the top, and sacrifices any little bit of fun this game could've been capable of.			"

I mean, it was a great concept that I was really looking forward to, but the execution was just terrible.When jumping into the game you will likely be terribly confused, not really knowing where you're supposed to be going or how you're supposed to do things. Once you figure out exactly what you're doing, you realize that the matchmaking is horrible and to be honest, no one is really playing it. There's very few servers and most of them are filled with trolls that just teamkill everyone at the start.A horrible experience and the only thing that really made it worth it to me was that I ordered a 4-pack for friends and got 8 copies thanks to Steam messing up so I can troll-gift it to people, haha.

												If you're looking for a modern tactical shooter... Look elsewhere, this is not it.It's not as bad as some of the other reviews make out... That's about the best I can say about it though, because in all fairness it's just not very good. It's just simply not good...It's a bit like playing the very first Rainbow Six game... Trouble is it looks like the very first Rainbow Six game, with less detail. Textures look like something from 15 or 20 years ago. Lighting is flat and lifeless. Shadows, what shadows?I can ignore bad graphics if the gameplay is good. Trouble is the gameplay in this is dull and uninspiring... Walk round a corner with Guy1, get shot in the head. Walk round the same corner with Guy2 and shoot the guy that shot Guy1, open a door and get shot in the head. Guy3 goes through the door, shoots the baddy that killed Guy2. A door across the corridor opens and Guy3 gets shot in the head. Guy4 meanwhile is stuck with his ♥♥♥ hanging out of a wall before the first corner. Because Guy4 is such a derp, he gets surrounded and then shot in the head...People go on about the AI being ""too hard"", yet I don't think they're as tough as the old school Rainbow Six AI... The AI can be punishing and difficult if your team make too much noise. It's the games one redeeming feature in my mind.When it's on sale at a £1 it's alright if you can get a couple of people together, but it wears thin quickly...TL/DR? If you're looking for a modern tactical shooter... Get Insurgency instead.			"

												This was supposed to be the great hero that would bring back hardcore tactical co-op first person shooting to the old farts like myself, who have been waiting for a successor to games like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 and SWAT 4. It held great promise and the developer spoke such sweet words, pouring honey on the ears of the people like me. Then it was released...At first it seemed like a game with some launch hick-ups and bugs. The basis was there for T:RS to take this not-so-well sought after throne, but every update was just making more and more of a mess. Then, not very long after release, they started to sell it for 1€ and gave all owners an extra copy to give away to unsuspecting enemies friends... which is kind of a clear sign that they threw in the towel and gave up on it.As said; the basic foundation is there; a hardcore, slow paced, co-op, tactical game... if you can get into it. It's hard enough to get a group to successfully join a server, but then you can't make that server private. The AI seems okay at first, but is actually bugged out like crap in a thunderstorm. The game freezes, the game rolls over like a dog without anyone commanding, the game just doesn't do what it's suppose to and does everything it's not suppose to. The only thing that worked from the get go; the in-game text-to-speech chat, they had removed in an update. First the maps were all too big, so you were running around searching for the last terrorist... then they made them smaller, but made them minimal.Nothing has gone right with Takedown: Red Sabre, and my kind (the hardcore co-op FPS:ers) had to look elsewhere. Fortunately we found Insurgency, which is a bloody good game; get that one instead!The only thing T:RS managed to do was to have our gaming group make sarcastic jokes about ""...it's in the hardcore nature of the game."" and ""...this game is epic!"" which were compliments once upon a time, but after the release and subsequent downfall of T:RS have now become the worst insults we can say about a game.It's all just really sad...

												Backed it on Kickstarter and really wanted it to be good. Sadly, it's not: The old Rainbow 6 game did this better. The UI is unnecessarily clunky, enemy AI is a bit weird and friendly AI is useless. Visuals are OK and the game has improved a lot with patches, but still can't recommend it unless you get it for cheap. May be worthwhile in multiplayer, but I've not tried that.  "

												I really wanted to love this game, hell I would have been happy to like this game, but I can't, regretting backing this on kickstarter, if it was still ""in dev"" rather than a half arsed beta feeling released game I could give it some sympathy.AI = terrible Commands to Team = Non-existantCommands to AI Team = clunky and VERY limited (follow, stay, agressive, passive) Looks = Thought I was playing SWAT 4, which atleast I would have squad commands and working Allies and Enemies.The best thing I can say about this game is that I has made me go and reinstall SWAT 4 for the 100th time.Had high hopes, and it doesn't even scrape casual shooter nevermind well thoughtout squad shooter.Very disapointed :(			"

												Well, it was a gift. But even then I cant recommend it. Controls are very clunky and almost unusable. You move extremely slowly. The AI is awful. Things will probably ""see"" you through concrete. Maybe Im just worse than I thought, but it seems slightly gimmicky that the AI can see you from out in Narnia, instantly position themselves, and headshot you all in a couple frames. And if you do manage to get some rounds off, either you missed or they just hit like flying, wet turds. Ill just assume I couldnt get far enough in, but I didnt see anything really tactical I could do other than get headshot out of the gate. Just not a very well thought out or fun game.

												I went into this game with  an open mind and hoped with patches it would be good. Turns out, i should have just not gotten it. Quick note: I think it is worth $1.50 while its on sale, but its not worth $15 and that what i am basing my review on.Cons:-You would think by now the patches would be ironed out, but no. There is lag (i can run bf4) even in single player and there is constant stuterring. I can even occasionally shoot trough the edge of walls-The accuracy is awful for all guns except snipers and pistols. I understand that there is bullet drop and wind resistance, but i would take two shots in a row and sometimes, one bullet would go to the right while the other goes to the left. Makes no sense-Missions objectives are in the pause menu but you have no idea where your actually supposed to go. Concidering this is a simulator, you would think maybe you would have a blueprint. In one mission, a company hires you to go into their building to do some stuff, but does not give you a blueprint to locate the stuff. Do they want you to die?-when you are in lean mode and move, the game stutters -your weapon disappears when you touch a wall. I know this is on purpose but have no idea why. It is not part of a cover system and makes it easier to die when you try to hide behind a table only to learn you cant shoot.-squad system is not good at allPros:-okay, the game is not all bad. The the one-two hit kill is a nice feature for those looking for hard core games.-no respawn. True to the genre ""simulator"", once you die, your finished. If you are playing singleplayer, you can take the life of an ai teammate, but you only have three, and they can die on their own.-because you can die easily and lose 50 min of progress, it create a ""one more game"" feel as you are determined to beat that levelI will update as i play more.

												This game is a ripoff. I believe Steam owes it to its customers to refund payment for this. It is not a tactical shooter it isn't anything really. Its junk its garbage masquerading as a game. Its a disgrace and Steam should bear some responsibility for putting such a lemon on its marketplace. This isn't a matter of taste either. This is now a known fact, check around. Don't buy. Whatever you do don't buy. Its like they published this knowing some people would buy just from reading they synopsis (I did) and not actually doing any research and thus didn't even try and just figured they would make what they could off of they synopsis alone and just made the lowest common denominator that could pass as a game without being legally liable. Which I am not sure they aren't because this game is of such poor quality and build, and so much lower than what one would expect I feel it is in some way a breach of contract.			"

From all the kickstarter support, you would have thought that these guys would have made a better game in every sense of the word. Through their marketing online, they made it seem that this game would be like a more realistic Rainbow Six: Vegas, which was one of my favorite shooters of the past decade. When I finally installed the game I could not belive my eyes. The game was truly terrible. Im wondering if all the money they raised for the kickstarter was used on rendering highly processed screenshots to show us. The game looks and plays nothing like what they showed on the kickstarter and is full of bugs and glitches. Dont waste your money or if this game winds up being free, dont waste your time.

												This game reminds me of playing Far Cry 3 on the hardest difficulty: Be spotted and you're as good as dead. While the AI seem to be unable to notice bullets from a far distance, they react quickly enough if they see you and don't always instagib you, for example, if you are peeking around walls. The wall-peek system, while a good concept, is executed in such a way that you end up having to slowly peek around all of the walls, in order to shoot the guy waiting around the corner before he can see you. This game might be good multiplayer, but the single-player experience feels like trying to use a cheese grater to kill a SWAT team. It's possible, but it mostly relies on luck and the enemies messing up.			"

												Do not buy this game. This is one of those games that metacritic will give a 32 for a good reason. The people who developed Take Down: Red Sabre probably had a good idea in mind, but executed it horribly. Take Down tries to bring realistic shooters to the modern day scene full of CoD and BF, but falls flat in a wide variety of aspects. First off, the gunplay is some of the worst I have had in a while. It consists of a poorly model weapon of choice with what seems like no recoil, but the spread on these guns is absolutely ridiculous after the first round. Second off, the AI is down right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, including your enemies and squad mates. It seems that there is only two different poles to this AI, they will either be A) Seal Team Six grade soldiers or B) third graders that had their heads smashed in with hammers. The enemies also have something similar happening, they will either kill you instantly with one shot, no chance to kill them, or miss every single god damn round in thier mag. The AI enemies also have ""unfair"" tactics sometimes, most often involving them clipping through the ♥♥♥♥ing wall and blasting you and the remaining members of your squad striaght out of the game. The map design is also rather subpar in comparison to most games these days, consisting of almost exclusively CQC oriented environments, and mass enemy spawning. The worst part about all of this is that this is a game coming out in 2013 and very well could've been the spiritual successor to Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six series, but takes that oppportunity and runs it into a 747 jet. A game with much potential, but with no delivery.3/10			"

												This game is just terrible optimized and made game. The controls are ok, but the gameplay is not that funny depends on if you play singleplayer or multiplayer. In singleplayer it is not fun at all it´s just difficult to play and to proceed the mission. Also the enemies are pretty much op and sometimes you think you got a hit while you are shooting at them and they are not dead. Meantime yourself might get killed by one bullet. Mission are really confusing, because it´s not showing (except explaining what to do) like on a map where things are or some sort of icons for directions. But in multiplayer it might be a litte bit easier to accomplish missions and to take down your enemies than singleplayer. I do not recommend this game and I do not like the game except multiplayer which is quite ok only if you play with friends.			"

												Okay, first off... I love this game... BUT this game is unfair... NO! NO! SIT DOWN! YOU ARE NOT LEAVING! First off if you are at full health, and you have heavy armor and you get one shotted? Thats the mark of a bad,unfair,tactical,game... Now, if you do not play by the games rules you'll die many times. I've been counting 39 times... ON THE FIRST LEVEL!!!!! I realise... This game is tough... But this is shoving these rules down your throat! Like I said if you don't have a strategy but... If you die enough times you'll know were they're are AT ALL TIMES! You'll know where they spawn where they can kill you most speaking of dieing hallways.. are death traps... And DO NOT get me started on the STUPID A.I. And they said the A.I. is fixed well... No its not! I put this on my wishlist hoping this game could be cool... It was $4.99 and wow... It sucks... And if the enemys aren't using the Pistol or sub machine gun... or anything else... THEY ARE USING THE OP SHOTGUN! They need to nerf it.... In the first level there are 3 guys and they all have Sub-machine guns except theat one dude with a shotgun... When I died I was like what my avatar is... This is like Ride to hell returbution! Now... The loadout is broken if the loadout is not trolling you... Its annoying when you actually use it its not the weapons you have... THEY RANDOMLY GENERATE WEAPONS... Now to the final verdict... Actually no I need more... Some of the enemy A.I. is put into unfair positions... Like in the first level when you walk into the lobby... If you're lucky enough there is a guy on the second floor constantly shooting at you. Now... to the final verdict... Nope... Still need more... The A.I. will sometimes get you killed or they'll be stupid enough to run right infront of you while you're shooting at the enemy and do not ever leave the friendily A.I. Alone because once you'll do you'll see there dead body and then you'll see your dead body... FROM THE GUY THAT KILLED THE A.I! Now enough... The final verdict is a 4/10... (P.S.) I never got passed the first level (Biohazard). Now sorry the for the rage, I was playing the game before I wrote the review so I didn't really get to touch on the good elements and I wanted to do so... First off... Its realistic and fun... But there is reapeativaness to hell in this gane including soundtrack... But, I went back and I'm gonna change the rating to a 2/10 because I just threw numbers and a slash... So, thats what its gonna be for now... If you want me to do others... Please do, and Add me on steam... If you want to see all my reviews for games.			"

												Installed the game, ran first time setup, during first time setup, took a dump, came back to main menu, adjusted graphics settings, played for ten minmutes.... all in all, taking the dump was the most entertain part of this process...			"

												It is quite shocking that a game this terrible and this broken is still being sold on Steam. Granted I did get my copy for next to nothing during a sale, I can honestly say the $2.50 I spent on this game was not worth it...Someone from STEAM really needs to takedown this game, no pun intended.
