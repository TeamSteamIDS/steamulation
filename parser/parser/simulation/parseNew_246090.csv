Early Access Review
								It's been in Alpha for a year and is suddenly going to 1.0 next month. They're just gonna skip beta stage, add a tutorial, iron out a few bugs, and leave the rest to modders. Almost none of the stuff originally teased http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplans that people bought the game for is to be found. This game is too barebones to be worth your 25 bones. Double Fine has fallen from grace, for whatever inexplicable reason. :/You can play through all of the content within a few hours.boooooooooo!

												I'm so sorry - even now with 1.06, read some episodes:- Tried the new tutorial, how to play; got to the explore derelict task - but the derelict never appeared :-) :-(- Started a new game and despite in a sector with ""low"" threats, there were plenty of hostile ships chiming in from time to time.- I was expanding my base; suddenly I got hails from friendlies. Two new ships/buildings appeared; one docked in the middle of a room building operation leaving it inaccessible; the other docked on a wall that had a ship engine. I could access the latter by cutting a wall and tearing down the engine to free the main entrance, but the former still inaccessible.- There's a dead raider lying in the room to be the second reactor room. I can not build a power generator since the raider blocks it - seems bodies just don't disappear. I also have a floating dead astronaut in the middle of my bar; he was killed when the room didn't even exist.I've spent hours in the game but only got frustration out of it - whatever progress I made, disappearing floor tiles, stupid AI, bugs, ... ruined it. Maybe I should finally uninstall it - I'd have had fun with it if it had been more mature.			"

""Thanks for the money. I'll need it for my other projects."" - Tim ""3.3"" Schafer (Not an actual quote he made, meant to be satrical)Another title that's a stain on the early access program. You'd think a developer like DoubleFine couldn't mess up a PC game like this. Just take everything from Theme Hospital, mix abit of Dwarf Fortress in there add abit of originality and hey presto, you have a game. Not really though, as you've come across the bad reviews/recommendations for this game and there's alot of them.There's nothing good in this game, it's bare-bones as it comes. Unless a very, very talented modding crew works relentlessly on this game it's never going to be worth a purchase.Oh and one more thing; Recommending your own game through the Curator system isn't ethical. Stop that.Edit - 21/07/2015Wow, didn't realise that this 'review' would get so popular.I'd just like to thank everyone who took the time to click on that good ol' green thumb and bring to light the trash that is early access and greenlight games. Thanks to Steams new refund option, broken, half made games like this will hopefully never come to be.

Early Access Review
								SEPTEMBER 22 EDIT: Do not buy this game. The game is going into ""1.0"" release next month and is being left to modders to finish it up. They claim they're going to fix bugs, but as I made clear in the review below, they couldn't even finish the A.I. during thier ""Alpha"" stage.This game is like an incredibly dumbed-down Dwarf Fortress in space. Key word being dumb. The AI has incredibly complex inabilities to solve their problems. They would rather let themselves asphyxiate in the cold of space than finish constructing the airlock that is filled with oxygen. Why? Because the unfinished part is a space suit locker. They were in space suits already.In a previous run, the builders refused to add onto the life support section because oxygen was running low (for some unknown reason) and so the whole crew suffocated. Another run, I had to tear down a door I placed. That destroyed the wall and converted the next room from an airlock into a reactor, and while trying to fix that, the builder simply never finished construction. The crew died because they had no airlock to exit and expand and there was a hole into space.The security have no sense of uniformity and would rather walk one at a time into a derelict and die continuously to the same thing.You can't place objects in 4 directions, only two. I don't know why 4-view camera controls aren't implemented yet, but its frustrating to deal with as you have so much unused space. It's a neat concept and can become a good game, but it is not at all worth your time or money. It is bug-ridden. It has very stupid AI. If the developers can create useful viewing controls and decent AI that you don't have to play around in a nit-picky manner, it'll be a fun, hard game of balance between many facets of every characters' needs and wants, and management of a space station.

												Don't believe the release announcement. Spacebase DF-9 hasn't been really updated in months. The developers messed up the Early Access model with months of no updates and lack of content and this is them saying that they're not going to work on the game anymore.Features that were originally planned for were scrapped, no real end game or even a mid game and people are still reporting bugs despite them having all this time to ""finish it."" Avoid this one and for a game that gets Early Access, check out Prison Architect.			"

												While the game in its current state is relatively playable it is sadly unfinished.  The UI is rather clunky and unfinished.  The AI even more so. There doesn't seem to be any dynamic events other than meteor strikes and random raiders which given the basic nature of the AI means that a lot of your personnell will be left dead and dying on the floor.  There was no effort put in to making the Random derelict encounters anything other than a randomly generated set of rooms to be a ""starship"" or chunk of space station and they pop into exisence randomly on the map sometimes popping in attached to your base.All in all it is a stable game which is sparse and empty that will hopefully be completed by mod teams into something a little more robust.However this only serves to prove that Double Fine missed the while point of what utelizing early access is for and clearly started this project with the hopes of funding it exclusively through EA rather than making sure they had the capital to put out a product.For the price its going for you'll get a better deal by either waiting for Starbound, Planet Explorers, or Space Engineers to get out of alpha and into beta.

												Unfortunately I can't recommend this game.  I personally like it but since the developer decided to leave the game unfinished and incomplete, I can't recommend it.  What you have is a fun Spacestation simulator that minus the bugs and glitches would be good enough on its own.  However these bugs and glitches are often game breaking and could even destroy your save.  That being said, don't buy this game unless you have a high tolerance for pain.			"

												For formatting and pics go to: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/12/space-base-df-9.htmlWhat Space Base DF-9 did right -Great visual AppealOne of the things i love about SBDF-9 is the look and style, they just seem right. And it reminds me of the Sims 4 or Sim City(2013)-Great idea for a gamelots of people have done building games, city games,etc, but Space Bases are few. The idea for this game is Perfect, now if only the game was...What Space Base DF-9 did wrong-Did not deliveron the Double Fine Games website they had a roadmap (now long gone) of things they said they were going to try to add. It was a big one. And yes i know that even they said it wasn't ""set in stone"" but it was used to get people to buy the game, and now only about 20 to 40% of those features are in the game, and it kinda feels like they tricked us. -Left the Game unfinishedDouble Fine Games the dev and publisher has left SBDF-9 to make another game and thereby make more money. They basically blame the community citing that ""not enough people bought the game to fund it"". Perhaps because the game is in an Alpha state at the most -♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AII don't know about you but when i'm in a space base on the far reaches of the milky way, i get pretty damn♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when i don't have Five Star meals, or Gyms, or bars, or TV. So mad i start trashing my own Oxygen tanks thereby killing myself. What? You wouldn't do that? Well the AI in this game does that. Yep, if they aren't living in luxury they decide life just ain't worth living. -Not Worth the priceIf Double Fine Games was going to keep working on this, i would say this is worth the price, however they aren't so really there is no point in spending cash on it. Its not going to get better, its not going to get fixed, and its not a good game. -bugs and glitches that will never be fixedNot being able to build, Oxygen not being produced despite the fact i have Oxygen tanks and more, these are bugs and glitches that will never be fixed. -Made us pay for their failureThis is more of a issue of Double Fine Games itself. They the whole reason they said the game is being shut down is because one: Not enough people bought it, and two: they ran out of Kickstarter money. If they did run out of kickstarter money then STOP working on another game and spend that money on the game you sold us. -This is not the first time Double Fine Game has let people downAnother game by DFG, Broken Age was also misleading. The game is sold as a full game but it is like TellTale games in that there are ""Episodes"". Right now, a year after the funding for the game ended there is only ONE  episode, with a ""promise"" that the second one will be coming on ""sometime in early 2015"" Who Space Base DF-9 is for-People who like wasting money -People who don't care about playing an unfinished game -People who buy games on sale -IdiotsFinal ThoughtsThe idea behind this game is amazing, and if worked on properly it could be a masterpiece. But it won't and thats a shame. Normally i keep supporting even bad EA games because i figure ""eh, they will fix it later"" i mean at the point i've already given them money, the best thing to do is hold on to the hope (however pointless) that the game will get better. There is no hope with SBDF-9, not anymore. And yes, modders could make it better, and they could make it a great game, but my belief is that if modders have to fix your game, and i mean Make it playable, then you've already failed. "

												When I get a full refund from Double Fine for Spacebase DF-9, then I'll consider buying another DF game. I don't care how great the guys developing Massive Chalice are, they're from the same studio that scamed me out of 25 bucks.25 dollars, in the grand scheme of things, it isn't much. But there's alot of things I could've done with that 25 dollars, first thing that comes to mind is buy a case of mediocre beer. Now when I buy a case of Budwieser I expect certian things; I expect bland taste, I expect to get a mild buzz, sounds like a pretty ♥♥♥♥ty use of 25 dollars right? Here's the thing, I was never promised anything more.Lets expand on the beer analogy: instead of Budweiser, DF is now the brewer. DF promises me a pretty nice brew: nothing amazing, but something well worth my money. Having heard DF has produced some quality brews in the past I buy a case from the affable salesman. I take the case home, eager to try a fresh new flavor from the brewer I've heard so many good things about; then I open the first bottle. ♥♥♥♥, this bottle contains nothing but ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ fumes; disgusted but still hoping to at least drink my initial disgust away I open another bottle..........more ♥♥♥♥. So the evening rolls on with me opening up bottle after bottle of DF's ♥♥♥♥ untill the whole case is gone in the midst of my now pungent apartment I realize: that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at DF scamed me.I storm down to the storefront where I bought the not-brew only to find the signs down, the windows shuttered, and a note on the door: closed due to lack of customers.That's the best way I can think to describe my one and only transaction with DF, they sold me a case of ♥♥♥♥ and said the reason the ♥♥♥♥ was ♥♥♥♥ is because not enough people bought their ♥♥♥♥. So I hope you fine folks at DF can understand why the next time someone asks me to spend my money on one of your products, I'll tell you to shove your product up your ♥♥♥.			"

												This is not my review but I thought it should be noted that this game won ""Best mod support"" from PC Gamer. http://www.pcgamer.com/goty-simulator-2014-the-alternative-pc-gamer-awards/What does that mean you ask?""It's always great when games arrive with built-in mod support, but this year Double Fine went a step beyond. Not only did they release the full source code for their Early Access game Spacebase DF-9, but they left hundreds of planned features incomplete, giving modders the exciting challenge of finishing the game themselves. It's rare to see that sort of selfless generosity from a developer, and we salute Double Fine for passing the torch to modders, or at least hurriedly chucking the torch at modders from the window of their limousine as they screeched away from the curb.""So yeah. Buy at your own risk.			"

Early Access Review
								I really try to like this game, I really do. But between the horrible AI, UI, and overall game meta, not to mention lackluster developer support over the course of the last year I cannot with good conscience recommend this to anybody. Wait at least until beta to buy this, and only if they significantly alter the meta-game.As it stands the AI are imbecilic, the gameplay progression borders on unfair or unplayable even at low difficulty, and the game has a daisy chain of progressive bugs and glitches that functionally cripple your base the longer you play. Invisible raiders? Yes. Unhealable citizens? Got that too. Ludicrous pathing? Sure! Lack of transparency in regards to what you're placing into the game? Oh hell yes, have to rely on an oft-incomplete wiki full of speculations.You would be better off looking to ancient games like Space Colony, or Startopia for a game of this genre that works. (More in the case of Startopia) This is what bugs me the most, since I normally would expect good things from a Double Fine game, if only because I enjoyed Brutal Legend. But it is obvious to me that Double Fine isn't investing many resources in this game, and probably have no intention of doing so either.My prediction? A halt in development by Fall of 2014 when the dev team gets recalled to work on what is seen as more 'profitable' ventures. But maybe I'm just pessimistic because I've played games like this in the past with far higher levels of development from studios most people have never even heard of. (Okay, it's moving up into fall 2014 when I edited this and still no halt.. I can only hope that alpha 6 is some sort of incredible improvement.. But I won't hold my breath.) Spacebase DF-9 - 24.99Startopia - 6.99 (Space Base DF-9 could learn something about meta from this)Space Colony - Available on GOG for 9.99 (Again, something Spacebase DF-9 could learn about creating at least tolerably realistic social interactions in somewhat of a fun fashion.)

												This started out as a good looking project from a respected maker of novel games.  Then apparently Double fine's collective brains fell out and they decided that since people had already payed for their game in early access they didn't actually need to bother to finish it.The release version of the game is fundamentally broken, and cannot even claim to be a working beta.  It's a half finished alpha they just dumped with zero consideration for their customers.  Most of the features promissed don't exist, or if they do are not functioning correctly.Issules include but ar not limited to:Spotty AI of both crew and hostile mobs.Exploring wrecks is almost pointless since the risk of loosing crew because they refuse to come back to the station after checking it is usually greater than any benefits you may get from it.  Plus the mining reources always run out far too early leaving gutting wrecks for matter the only way to keep a base running.Station power supply only works sometimes.The only way to satisfy the entertainment need of station crew is to put at least 2 televisions in EVERY room of the base (including airlocks) since nothing else was ever added for entertainment.The shield tech to stop asteroids punching holes in the base was never added, so you tend to spend half your time patching holes.Don't even THINK of buying this game, and if you want my advice, stay clear of anything else from this developer as they do not deserve to exist.

												I purchased this game when it was still in Early Access for the full price (was $25 when I bought it).  Developers promised a lot of things, new features, customization, and a vast amount of gameplay.  Unfortunately, none of these promises were delivered.  I bought the game because I enjoyed Double Fine's Brutal Legend.  They seemed like a trustworthy developer that could get a fun quirky game done and make it worthwhile. After months of no updates and no communication I began to lose heart.  The minimal amount of playtime (logged 0.6 hours) was due to the lack of a tutorial (which they have since added, and it's sub-par) and (I assume) a bug that prevented my characters from entering the base I built.  I started another game, and again they wouldn't enter the base I built and ended up suffocating.  Started another game and I finally got them to enter the base, and that's where more bugs appeared.  Just read the forums to get an idea of how frustrating the bugs are and how broken the game is, despite it getting a full release.  Very disappointed in Double Fine.  Their lack of communication regarding the game's development, refusal to be honest with people who bought their product (e.g. not letting us know they planned to stop development and leave the game as is), and the fact that they had the gall to release the code and tell the community that if they like the game, then they have to fix it.  Come on.  To conclude, I'd say avoid this game, it will receive no further updates, and as it stands it's an incomplete mish-mosh of ideas.  Even for $12 I'd say skip it.  Hopefully they update Gang Beast, which I also purchased before this fiasco, although it hasn't received an update since the day I bought it (2 months ago).Update: Source code has been released...and there are still parts of the code that are hidden, as one person on the forum mentioned, the Oxygen Recycler.  One of the most basic units of the game.  It's used to prevent your base from losing oxygen, thus preventing everyone from suffocating.Update #2: Price has changed to $20.01 (from the sale price of $12), and that's about it.  Tried playing the game again and it wouldn't let me complete the tutorial (was not allowed to place a second airlock door where it indicated).  Still have yet to build my own base.  They supposedly also fixed some bugs on October 30th.  This is what one user had to say: ""crlsniper Nov 1 @ 2:30pm Glad to see your working on fixes, though the bigest fixes need to be AI fixes, Mostly for doctors and security. I lost an entire base just because none of the doctors would go help people who where incapacitated, neither would soldiers go arrest and move raiders who where incapacitated either.""Multiple counts of the same complaint.  Furthermore, despite where you establish your base, you will have near constant attacks from pirates/raiders.Some brave souls have attempted to mod the game (essentially having to rebuild the game from the ground up), check this thread out: http://steamcommunity.com/app/246090/discussions/0/613940477963640858/It outlines a lot of the bugs and problems with the game, such as faulty oxygen recyclers (e.g. too many people in a room would cause dramatic decreases in oxygen no matter how many recyclers you had, thus everyone in that room eventually would suffocate).Update #3: Free copies of Hack n Slash were provided to buyers of this game (myself and a few others received a copy), however it strikes me as more of a political ploy than a genuine apology.  This is because people who purchased Hack n Slash got a copy of this game.  As far as I know, Hack n Slash purchasers weren't spat upon and kicked to the curb by Double Fine, so this move makes no sense to me.And of course I'm not eligible for the new refund policy, since I purchased this game over a year ago.  GFY Double Fine.			"

												It's fun if you want to simulate trying to keep a bunch of literal violent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alive in space.  Am I joking or exaggerating?  No I am not.  I have never dealt with such mind-crushing stupidity in any game of this sort, ever.  The stupidity of your citizens goes above and beyond funny and delves into the absolutely painful and rage-inducing.  I'm talking about builders not building airlocks and dying from it, Techs not maintaining their oxygen recyclers, panicing when the lack of oxygen makes them suffocate, and then dies flailing around in circles - going into a raider/monster infested derelict one after another for the sole purpose of greed; the overwhelming desire to pick up some stupid, worthless toy and dying for it in a pile of their greedy dead friends, stamping on a roaring fire the size of a house and burning to death in a huge mass instead of using the fire extinguishers directly outside and in said flaming room - walling themselves into small rooms and dying, refusing to tear down the wall to escape or build a door,   Downright refusing to maintain the station, their lives, their jobs, or anything relating what so ever to order, because they'd rather bash each others brains out in some psychotic fight, or they'd rather have a temper tantrum because they need to keep the oxygen recyclers operational and they can't play with their rubber duckies.Yes, all of this actually happens, and it happens constantly.  It isn't some stupid trivial issue that appears once in awhile, it's literally ♥♥♥♥ing constant and it never ♥♥♥♥ing ends.  Seeing 30 people die one after another because they individually decided to stop working/cooking/sleeping to go steal a ♥♥♥♥ing trinket from a derelict near-by, and absolutely nothing I try to do can ♥♥♥♥ing stop them (Making them security and putting the deployment icon elsewhere, making them builders and trying to make them build, ANYTHING BUT DIE IN THAT ♥♥♥♥ING DERELICT ONE AFTER ANOTHER FOR YOUR STUPID ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T).Again, this isn't funny.  It goes beyond funny.  It's unplayable.  It's literally ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable because you're actually trying to manage severely mentally disabled humans and aliens in a ♥♥♥♥ing space station.  If they don't kill themselves from suffocating, greed, or just random senseless violence and fighting, the almost constant raider attacks (that eventually culminates to a literal raider fleet, for no reason what so ever) will kill them.  The best part is apparently the developers took the money and ran, haven't been doing anything with the game, ban people who point this out or mention it on their forums, and are making new projects/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with the nonexistant money.This game could be really, really good if the crew wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and suicidal.  If they were competent and HAD PRIORITIES like ANY LIVING CREATURE WITH SOME SENSE OF SELF-PRESERVATION, the game would be good, REALLY good in fact.  As it is right now?  No it's unplayable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Maybe some modders can take it over and fix it, do anything with it, I don't know.  But by default this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is awful.			"

Early Access Review
								Great UI, some good ideas, but current feature set is exremely small, leading to a shallow game where you'll have seen everything it has to offer within an hour.   It's also riddled with severe, game-breaking bugs; your station's success usually has more to do with whether or not the game decides to malfunction, and less with the environmental hazards. Down the road I could see this evolving into something excellent, but in it's current state it's falling short of playable.  I would only reccomend purchasing at this stage as a means of supporting the project, don't expect a fully playable game at this point.			"

												I poured money into this expecting it to be an ongoing project. It started out interesting for an alpha but then we realised that this was as good as it was going to get.The developer either mismanaged the money so severely to the point where it should honestly be questioned whether Doublefine has any business in early access or they simply took the money and ran. Not bothering to finish this game as other projects needed more attention.Either way we are left with a sorry excuse for a game. Horrendously shallow gameplay with barely any of the initially promised features. It is a barren boring game that you will grow weary of in less than half an hour of starting it up.Do not buy unless it goes for less than a dollar.			"

								I had a lot of hopes for this game but regardless of what Double Fine says this game is not finished. It's broken, it's missing features, it's a game full of promises that won't be delivered. Double Fine does try to rectify this by releasing the game's code to allow modders to take over, but how is this fair? I want a game I don't have to go and search for 3rd party mods of varrying quality or even security. Disapointed in this game and disapointed in Double Fine who I once could call my favorite developer. Getting rid of my poster with Tim Shaffer's signature on it. Don't get disapointed like I am, don't buy this.			"

												I've finally decided to give the ""release"" version a full go. After completing most of the goals in the game I've come to a conclusion:DF-9 does not hold up to its promise. Not by a long shot.Aside from the fact that fact that Double Fine abandoned (I do actually understand their situation) the game long before their planned goals had been implemented, the unfortunate truth is that what we do have isn't finished either.Most prominently the power system. Without an actual power meter (like we have for O2) your base will just suddenly lose power if you've built too much. You have no useful way of knowing when to build another reactor. The devs expect you to hover your mouse over each and every room and sum up the power consumption in your head each time you want to take inventory.Next up is the ""story"" of the game. One of the last versions must have shoehorned this in because I don't remember it from Alpha5. Basically at some point the game will spontaneously throw multiple raider ships and raider astronauts at you in bulk. I've you've managed to build your base accordingly by then: congratulations for figuring out the simple and boring strategy needed. If you haven't? Well, you can start all over again.Then as you continue to play and expand your base to meet the other goals you'll notice how the game becomes increasingly glitchy.And speaking of goals: The ""build all the things"" goal isn't even possible. I tried. I built everything there is and allegedly I'm still missing something.			"

Early Access Review
								Warning: AVOID.Very sad to say this, but it seems that the developer is cutting this title loose. The store page says this is in Alpha. It is not. It is in final beta stages since they have just announced that after a round of bug fixes they will release version 1.0 in october and content updates will stop. The game had huge potential and I was under the impression this still had at LEAST a year left of updates, but sadly it seems like they are ditching it. What exsists today is the shell of a full title, a scant promise of something it could be after a lot longer in development, but £19 for this? Forget it. This is the first time I have been badly stung by Early Access and it has shaken my faith in it completely. I have huge respect for Double Fine, but I will NEVER buy any of their Early Access titles again (and I was so close to getting Gang Beasts). Just have to put this one behind me I suppose. Can't see how this won't hurt the developers Early Access reputation however.Very disappointed.			"

												This game was great. Keyword ""WAS""It seemed very promising and I bought it right after it came out, put almost 24 hours into it. Soon after, they went from alpha to finished, and didn't complete anything on their ""To Do List""Absolute garbage when a publisher does that. I would suggest that you family share with a friend that has this game already if you want to play. Not worth buying.Another thing that sucked was the fact that most of us purchased this game for a significantly greater price than it is now, expecting the early access updates(which never happened)Fun game, still has too many bugs that need to be fixed, and even when playing on easiest settings, the best of bases will fail from bugs in the game.Advice to you: Save you're money!!!

A shame.Time for the good/bad/ugly.The Good:The art style is niceOxygen simulation works wellCharacters have moods and these change according to what happensThe Bad:General lack of features; boredom does not take long.Building a large base is not difficult, merely very time-consuming.The Ugly:The AI. DEAR GOD.Seriously, half of the time people don't do their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jobs.I'm not kidding. Characters manage to kill themselves REGULARLY.In my personal opinion this should not even be on sale anymore.

												As good as this game promised to be, Double Fine sadly ruined their chances of making a great game when they chose to fund this game pretty much from their early access sales, which is a perfectly reasonable strategy, if you deliver regular, great content. Sadly this has not occured, and the game sales stagnated. DF have now quickly pushed the game into a half complete, half-featureless husk of what it could have been, and it's still not very fun to play anymore. A lesson for everyone going forwards.

												The game has been abandoned in the Alpha stages and really it seemed like it had quite a bit going for it. But DoubleFine really screwed the pooch when it decided to do damage control on the disgruntled community. Instead of apologizing and admitting the problems they decided to ban threads, remove forum posts, and keep everything as quiet as possible. I would have been mildly upset with DF-9, but with the way DoubleFine is handling the situation I'm outright refusing to even touch anything else they make.

												Well thats how fast it can go. Apparently this alpha if going to be 1.0 in a month...with LARGE parts promissed not yet implemented and, if you read the new devplan posted lately, not going to be in. Without a betaphase. I was pretty content with this game and its developmentpacing until now. If this is realy what they want to call finish then this game is basicaly a scam. For this price you will get 2h of playtime and after that there is NOTHING to do anymore exept getting a larger base...without any goal...just building more rooms. I`m deeply dissapointed right now. How this could happen out of nothing puzzles my mind. Especialy since Double Fine is developing this so no...they didnt run out of money.Edit: http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplansThat was the plan.

												Double Fine slapped a ""1.0"" sticker on this game and abandoned it. Whilst I appreciate that there are times that an Early Access game may not deliver all of the promised features, this game received a small fraction of those features proposed.But this is a game review, not a review of Double Fine's business practices. So how is the game?In short, the game is a mess of buggy AI with barely enough gameplay mechanics to sustain more than a couple of hours of play. The character morale system is horribly half-baked, and the game is little more than a series of repetitive busywork tasks.That Double Fine now has it's greasy mitts out for Early Access funding for Massive Chalice barely a month after abandoning DF-9 is an insult to all of those people who put their faith in the company.Never again.

												I promised I wouldn't leave a review until it was finished, as leaving negative feedback on an early access game is just unfair.  I loved this game, and with every patch it got better and better.So why don't I recommend it?It's simple.  It's far too unpolished for a finished game.Missing text, UI errors, and dodgy AI prioritisation, The AI is good most times, but it has glareing holes where it puts things like ""stomping out fire on the other side of the raiders"" above ""the raiders are shooting at me, run away"" and you end up with ""look a fire behind those raiders that they just set that doesn't affect anyone, let’s get every civilian to run over to the raiders and stomp out a fire while they shoot us all""My personal favourite is ""the oxygen recyclers are breaking?  No, don't fix them, lets panic for two hours while the oxygen slowly runs out""Now you can put most people down to blind panic in situations like those, but out of a crew of 64, 52 of them went to stomp out the fire (they ran all the way from a safe section of the base, past security and into the raiders, most of which were assigned to security and tasked with killing the raiders.  You just wouldn't get a situation like that in real life.I understand the reasons behind it, and the bug fixing is ongoing.  However in its current state it is still very very difficult to play smoothly, and I don't mean that the game is hard, I mean the game visibly holds you back when you want to play it and a single bug can be a game breaker.If you like the look of this game, feel free to get it, back up your saves MANUALY on a regular basis, and don't be surprised if a sudden bug/glitch wrecks your experience.  However please don't buy this game if you are thinking it will be epic.  It's epic until a bug kills it.As major bugs are patched I will update this review, but it’s looking like the ""patches"" will either not continue or be few and far in-between.  There is currently a comminity unofficial patch in the works so I will be interested to see how/if that pans out.			"

Early Access Review
								DO. NOT. BUY. I bought into this game very early, paying $25 for basically a tech demo, because I loved the concept. I also trusted DoubleFine and Tim Schafer, being a respected studio and developer, to deliver an awesome product in the end. Alas, the development of this game seems to have been mismanaged into the ground. DF is abandoning the project and leaving us gamers with an unfinished buggy mess and calling it 1.0 release. There's about 10 hours of playtime here at most and quite frankly that is just not worth the pricetag.Update 11/12/14: I tried playing this game again after the 1.0 release. It still feels terribly unfinished. The new tutorial and goals system feel slapped together, lackluster, and unnecessary. I wish they would have spent the time adding more actual game content instead of these ""features"". Not to mention, the game is still very buggy. My first attempt at a base fell apart rather quickly after a derelict showed up. I set  a beacon to have my security guard check it out, who got killed by a bot. That alone would be fine as a possible risk of exploration, but then my other non-security personnel decided to go to the derelict ""picking something up"" (presumably the body) even after the beacon was removed. They all subsequently got killed, too. Nothing I could do would send them back to the safety of the base. Basically, I just got too frustrated to want to continue. If you still want to try this game, get it on super sale. It is just not worth the new lower price of $20.01.			"

												So I guess this is what happened:- Tim Schafer goes to a handful of investors with a prototype for a game. A game that has potential, a game that has that Double Fine sense of humor we all love, and a game that will fill a void in the market that has been left open for far too long.- The investors love it and give Tim Schafer $400,000 to make this game.- Tim Schafer gets addicted to cocaine and hookers and completely blows (heh) all of his investors' money, but just about this time Steam early access was hitting its stride and crafty Schafer cooks up a scheme.- Tim Schafer puts a very early, borderline-developmental build of DF9 up on steam for $25 with a link to a web page promising tons and tons of features - all with a very nebulous timetable attached.- A few months later (and a few inconsequential updates later) Tim Schafer finally cons enough money from hard-working people to pay back his investors (and get himself into rehab). Unfortunately, Double Fine is now broke.- Tim Schafer announces the latest development build as the final release, takes down the webpage with the planned content, and releases the source code in a futile attempt to placate his former fans.- Tim Schafer goes off to further bankrupt Double Fine.tl;dr, DO NOT BUY.  This game is fundamentally broken and lacking in content.I realize game development can be expensive, but I think it's pretty obvious from this and the Broken Age debacles that Tim Schafer isn't particularly good with money. Maybe Double Fine's next project should be an Excel spreadsheet so he can keep track of expenses.Also, I really don't see how releasing the source code, or modding API, or whatever will possibly save this turd.  Modders are not going to want to spend time making a bad game adequate.  I think a complete rewrite of the AI should be the first thing to be done, but by the time they familiarize themselves with the code and rework the game, it'll be months from now. Months of work, just to maybe make the game playable and - best case senario - make Tim Schafer a few more bucks from sales.Tim SchaferTim ShillferTim PilferTim Tookallyourmoneyfer			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.The Game is incomplete and will not be completed. This game was funded via Early Access and because the Early Access version had maybe 40 minutes of gameplay, no one bothered to buy it and Double Fine decided to cut their loses and go straight from mid-alpha to release when it is still full of bugs, and told modders to finish the game for them. They gave out free copies of another game, Hack N Slash, just to be like ""We messed up, Whoops sorry!"" This game is a scam even at 90% off.The game still consists of very little to do. The AI people die from suffocation and other stupid reasons all the time due to poor programming. The start of a new base also leaves very little margin for error.You can find a rant I did about this whole thing in the video below. Avoid Double Fine games in the future.

												This game is based on a really nice idea. It's just not completed yet.Let's start out with management. Since the tiles you are working with is not directly underneath the stuff you're actually building, it's impossible to know if you're for example deleteing just this room, or also deleting the wall for the next room, which would mean all of the oxygen sucked out of your base.Another thing is, that you can't move citizens around. This means, that you'll have to wait with (for example) destroying a room, because there are people in it. It can also be annoying, when you know theres a fire in a place, and you just have to wait until somebody discovers it. Even having the rooms alarm on won't help you. People only notices fires (and mostly also intruders), if they accidentally walks into them.A third thing is bugs. There are bugs everywhere in this game. One bug happens when you have an intruder. You then mark the intruder with an icon saying ""kill this man"". Even if all of your citizens are security guards, they can just be standing, looking at the intruder destroying all of your reactors, and they will first react, when he actually starts shooting at them.OMG thats annoying.Another bugged thing is the airlock, the chamber between the base and space. Here you have two doors, that are never ment to be opened at the same time. Despite that, i've had a whole base killed twice, because the doors sudenly opens at the same time, and everybody is sucked out into space or suffocated. I've also tried people just standing in this room with the outer door opened, waiting until they die, and the door closes again.AHHHHHHHHHThis is just some of the bugs i have experienced. Tough i've tried several times now, my best game has only been finishing my base, and starting to make research, when some stupid bug happens, or some superior enemies destroy your entire base in seconds.If DoubleFine made this game 10 times more solid, i would definetely think it was a good game.But unfortunately for everyone, this game is totally ruined by the crazy amount of bugs and poorly crafted tools in it.

								Noble effort, very polished for an Alpha, but simply not enough content or player feedback at this time.It's like feeding space fish right now.  You give them food, you clean the filter, and they do stupid sh** like poop on everything and then eat each other.    Your pH instruments say everything is perfect and yet they die, doomed to float for all eternity at the top of their little aquarium in the universe.As of Alpha, several rooms don't do anything, customization of your base is extremely limited, the UX is uninformative, and your ""Sims"" do random, stupid stuff instead of fixing the life-threatening oxygen pump (despite being assigned to do exactly that).Good luck devs!   Get some more people on the team (I think I saw a blog post that there were 3?!?), and this may be worth the buy in.    "

								This game taught me a 24.99 lesson.  I will never purvhase another doublefine game.  A developer this large should not use the greenlight games as an alternate development strategy.  I am almost embarassed that I purchased this game and the only reason I did is that the green light games I have purchased in the past were KSP and starbound, both excellent purchases.  Remember before buying any greenlight game that you are buying an unpolished and unfinished game as is and the developer, as doublefine affirmed, does not owe you ant future content.  If someone has a game where you can currently jump and play a card game, even if they promise the best RPG of all time, you are buying that game and not what they promise.  I have bought games that have tremendous glitches and that dont start on my laptop through steam and this is the one I am most dissapointed about. This is the one I want my money back for.  I probably own 5 doublefine games on my xbox and I will never buy another game from them due to this experience.  Google this game and read a news article as to why you shouldnt buy it,			"

As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. If DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.			"

												I was really enjoying this game earlier in the year when I bought it. It was buggy as all hell but I knew it was early access and it had a dedicated team working on every problem. I could see the potential this game had and the creativity it would inspire in the future. Then Double Fine just gave up. They mismanaged their budget for this game and basically said ""Here, you finish it."" I've never been so insulted by a game company since the last time I bought something made by EA. The game is still a broken, buggy mess despite the patches coming out and that trickle of patches will end soon and it will be up to the community to fix it, mod it, add features and make the most out of a game abandoned by its original creators. Double Fine then tried to quell my outrage with a free game...that I promptly gave away. This ugly event has killed any faith I had in Double Fine. I will never buy their products again and they have no one to blame but themselves.Oh, and about their new ""$20.01"" price point...har har har. That's a joke but not for the reason they think it is. If they drop the price by $20 bucks, then you'll get your money's worth.			"

												Spacebase DF-9 lets you create your own space station, managing crew and resources all while staving off pirates and taking hails. It sounds like a lot of fun for anyone that was into Star Trek or even games like Dungeon Keeper 2, but it turns into all of the management and none of the fun. The big issues that I have with the game is that its tough to survive the first few moments of a normal game and beyond that, its just a dull game that forces you to assimilate all metal to keep growing your station to accommodate more crew.Your objective is to keep your crew alive against first asphyxiation and later raiders. Even when your crew dies and the game tells you start a new game, it still continues. It is a game over without being concrete or giving you a final score before you have to start a new game.To start with, there's an optional easy how to play tutorial level that will guide you through the basics without feeling forced upon you. The tutorial makes it easy to get up and running. Assign crew to the roster of jobs. Builders build when you construct rooms or objects. Miners will mine ore to be refined to get more matter to construct with. Technicians fix things and that's about as far as the tutorial gets.You'll need a few things to get a space base operational. The first is power that comes in the form of reactors or a seed to start with. The second is the base itself which can be a giant room. You'll need an oxygen recycler since you are in space after all. After your space base has O2, an enclosed room and power, there's another matter and that's getting in. To do this you need to setup an air lock with two airlock doors one to the interior and the other to the exterior. This room also needs to have a locker for space suits.Outside of the tutorial the giant problem that I have with the game is the level of difficulty when you're even getting started. The tutorial is nice and setup and it does let you continue on playing which is perhaps the best method. Consider that easy mode. You get to select your location and the game tells you how rich in ore and the frequency of attacks. Its a nice choice of difficulty without being a blunt difficulty slider.In normal play, the game starts you with a seed for power and three crew in space suits with limited oxygen. There is so much that can go wrong. Running out of matter before your crew is in oxygen will doom you. So you need to budget building a small room to house the seed, a recycler, food dispenser, and a second for the air lock. Then you need to wait for the station to fill with oxygen and even for the air lock to cycle air in and out. Your spacemen can die in their suits when waiting for an air lock to pressurize. Oh but there is another nail to get caught on and that's the fact ore needs to be converted into matter, so it requires a matter refinery. This getting started kicks off the game and it will scare people away.On paper, interesting things do happen. Derelict space stations will come into your area for you to explore and spaceships will dock with you. From there you have a choice, send your security over to investigate them or ignore them. The spaceships become part of your base where then you need to claim each room, which can be tedious and cumbersome since many small rooms are just tough to click on.People can come aboard infected with a disease and then your science station will be put to work finding the cure. To do so, click whatever science room you've setup and select whatever they should research. There are a number of diseases to cure and upgrades to unlock. Upgrades include things like body armor and heavier doors.You will get attacked from time to time. Raiders will float out in space and either try to shoot your miners as they pass by or they will board your station. Other times vessels will dock with your station and you'll be invaded. The catch is, unless you're watching a mining operation, its easy to spot and prepare for. You can have your security waiting for them, unless they're busy putting out a fire. It seems like more of an annoyance than a fun or cool challenge. You can also purchase wall mounted defense turrets.Normal crew will still engage the enemy if they're in the same room, but to send crew in to fight hostiles, you'll need to assign crew to the security. From there you can make a security beacon that draws them to the area. It feels like an extra step and even marking the point and calling off security seems like it could be streamlined. A lot of the game needs to be streamlined.Once attackers are incapacitated you can act to cuff, uncuff or execute them. In fact you can chose to execute or cuff any of your crew. Its just a little odd. Sometimes they will even chose to join your crew. Once resources become scarce, its just easier to execute them and dump them into the refiners to make matter.Sometimes there is an issue where a firefight in an airlock can down the only crew inside the station. So anyone outside the station is forced to suffocate over time because the air lock refuses to open when someone is in there without a suit. It gets more hilarious because in smaller stations, crew will just stand in the air lock when its too crowded everywhere else. Spacebase DF-9 is an amazing game to watch because of its logic.Speaking of logic, I managed to glitch the game into thinking there was no airlock. Those outside the station would die of asphyxiation and those inside the station would stay in there. Even crew joining would stay outside until they died. Destroying the airlock doors and rebuilding had no effect. Yet I could manually keep a door open so the spacemen could float into my base still in their suits. They would still suffer the same fate with no oxygen. The only way I was able to get people in and out was to build a new airlock.In terms of crew management, when it comes to the roster everyone has an emotion to specific jobs no matter what their skill level is. You can have someone great at botany, yet hates doing it. Crew member you're the best doctor we have! Yeah but they get sad while doing it. Its a realistic and offers a level of micro management. Once you get to a point where you have crew of every class it gets easier since you no longer have people flip jobs such as having a miner one day and builder the next.You get constant hails to answer and decide if you want them to join. It feels like a chore so I opt to avoid the calls. Sometimes the hails are to lull you into security so they can get ""in your base, killing your dudes."" Their transmissions all seems sketchy. There is no one that sounds like a clear cut good or bad choice. They all sound like they're trying to be funny and questionable, because that's what people like in their games, humor and charm. Well both fall flat and it feels forced.Its also annoying having to press the faster speed setting, because the game will drop to normal speed whenever a yellow notice appears. It could be worse by being a popup box that you have to click like in so many other games. These warnings are things such as a crew member is starving or running out of oxygen. These warnings are color coated. Green means an overall hint on what's needed in your station such as more self space. Yellow and brown seem to be specific crew have achieved something or need something. Major warnings like crew being attacked or raiders about to board are in yellow so they blend in. A lot of times I realize we've been attacked after I see the number of crew go down. Raiders look similar to your own crew.Spacebase DF-9 is just a tough game to love when it feels like a tough start followed by dull and uninspired management. It does feel like a fleshed out game with a lot of annoyances. I think scenarios would help extend my interest, but within a few hours I feel like I've seen everything there is to see. With all of that said, it is still worth the one dollar I paid for it.			"

												To start off, i'm more neutral towards the gameplay factor, but i have to give this a negative rating for the fact that DF just abandoned the game when they saw it progressed to slow.But here's the gameplay review, if you're still wondering if you should buy it or not : The game's idea is wonderfull imo : build a base in space, maintain it and welcome new colonists into it while fending off raiders and managing the jobs the citizens do. The way they did it was not bad at all, simple drag-build controlls and assigning the different areas by a simple click of a button and design the interior as you like with various props. Easy. Simple.But the thing that made the game bad is the fact that it's unbalanced, buggy and just unfinished.The A.I is pretty bad in prioritizing their tasks, and with the new mood system there is just no way of keeping them happy, even if you furnish every room and give them their favourite jobs. they all eventualy get depressed and start fighting over nothing, which screws up the whole base and delays tasks as they recover in the sickbay.The gameplay is refined for an Alpha at the time, but there was no change in it whatsoever when it went to V1.0 .I wouldn't recomend the game to someone who disliked game-breaking bugs and dumb A.I , but if you just like building a base and dont mind using mods to fix all of the vanilla game's problems, it is worth buying whenever it gets on sale.But otherwise, i sadly can'r recommend it, sorry Double Fine, but ya kinda screwed it up here.4.5/10 "

												Wasted My money:Turrets have too short of rangeEnemies outside of their ship have just as much health as the ships do...why?Sometimes the lights of the base do not light up when you come back onlineI chose the perfect sector 22-31 where the crime rate was supposed to be extremely low, after a few minutes of playing I get swarmed with raiders.The game was designed with minimal resources as this game has no goal other than sandbox mode and build until the raiders come to destroy you. And if you do manage to thwart off the ridiculous amount of raiders, when you build a decent sized base I got a raider message saying my base was too large and I got swarmed by soo many raiders that even with my base being completely built with turrets on everyother outside block on my base that even this wasn't enough to kill those raiders.Eventually the game AI will always destroy you so very un even programming.There are not many options to customize your base withThere are upgrades but you have to find the plans to them on derelictsBesides raiders in between those raids you have people parking their so called ships on your base and you eventually have to continually play cleanup where you kill the people aboard, select and highlight their ship and try and dismantle it, and once your done finally clearing away their junk it seems another NPC wants to park their ship on your base where it become permanently attached until you tell again your workers to disasemble it.It might have had potential if the game designers decided to spend more time polishing it and expanding the way the surfaces interact...as in raider ships come in at some wierd xyz angle that looks goofy and unrefined.Anyways there is more I can complain about but I would rather throw money at a hole in the wall.-----Do not buy it unless your addiction to buy stupid games and crossed yet another questionable line.----			"

Early Access Review
								Double Fine are giving Early Access a bad name here, by confusing it with crowd funding. This game is overpriced, unfinished and, worst of all, abandoned. The argument that not enough people bought the title to warrant continued development is a silly one, as most people tend to wait for a title that is at least playable before purchasing, no doubt explaining the poor sales. On top of that, they will not be offering refunds, and complaining about the people who did not purchase, Double Fine are just providing an extra slap in the face to those that did. There was so much potential here, but as it stands the AI is a mess & it isn't possible to prioritise tasks so DF-9  becomes an exorcise in frustration.  You may find yourself wanting to create a turret to defend against incoming raiders, but because you can't tell your builders to do so, they'll continue to build a room before the turret and by the time they've finished it's too late and your whole base has been destroyed.Raiders are also occasionally very overpowered, a raider single handedly killed everybody in my base because all of my crew members seemed to just flap about and let themselves die.Even if you get round these issues, there simply isn't enough to do to warrant a purchase, especially at the frankly ridiculous price of £18.99. I will never buy another Double Fine title again. If you'd like to see an Early Access title that never deserted its backers and continues to get more and more brilliant by the day, try Project Zomboid. It's being made by friendly, helpful developers and is 3 times cheaper than this one for at least 10x the content.			"

												Spacebase DF-9 Version 1 plays like a badly designed tower defense game now it has finally been released. Where you get a limited amount of time to build your station and then have to defend it against attackers. In one game I had a raider visiting by shuttle and 2 other ships attemping to breach my station and right after that pirates appeared. My crew went from 9 down to 1 before the last pirate ship appeared.During the Alpha this game was about building a space station and whilst that was its main aim, I quite liked it. But the second it was released, it became something else entirely.Games typically last about 40 minutes before one raider or another wipes you out having magically appeared in a room they did not have access too. I liked this game during the Alpha but now, I am afraid I must give it a thumbs down.... they seem to have ruined it in the rush to get version 1 out. Pretty Sad... If your looking for tower defense games, look else where, if your looking for space station games, try Startopia.			"

												So bad that Valve changed the rules for Early Access to ensure that all projects actually have a finished game at the end, rather than being used as another funding source to be cut off whenever they feel like it isn't making a profit.Doublefine have managed to lose me as a customer, and quite frankly should consider it a vast PR blunder.

												While initially fun and full of promise, this base-building game quickly turns into a frustrating mess.  As a fan of the genre, I'm generally willing to look over minor flaws in base-building games, and when I first fired up Spacebase DF-9, I'll admit I let the excitement of building a space-station get the better of me.  Now, countless hours in, I find myself pinching the bridge of my nose in frustration and dissappointment everytime I boot the game up. The game begins by mousing over an imaginary galaxy to find an area to establish a new space-base.  While I dreamed of building my own Deep Space 9 or Babylon 5 at an optimal location, I found that I needed to spend 5 full minutes dragging my mouse around the galaxy map looking for an ideal location.  Rather than allowing the player to set start parameters, the designers force you to hunt the 2D galaxy map for 4 varying starting conditions, consisiting of generally unclear parameters.  Sure, levels of mining materials, a threat level, and a proximity to a warp gate seemed to make sense since I was a sci-fi fan, but through different playthoughs, they had only small differences.  The final and fourth parameter, Magnetic Interference, remains unclear.  This is because none of these parameters are ever explained, even during the tutorial. Once the game begins, regardless of the parameters selected, the player has but a few minutes to build a basic base before the three astronuats supplied run out of air to breath.  They must be assigned tasks, which, at first are dictated by necessity, and later by NPC prefence, which is shown via an assignment screen using varying degrees of happy and sad faces.The problem with building a basic base is that your resources are so low, no matter what world parameters you set, that you need to be near absolute barebones.  There is very little room for error.  Of course, once basic resources, like air, food and the ability to create building material are met, a player can always expand, and sometimes with ease.  But, this is where bugs, even in version 1.03 begin to appear.I've had my start point pressed up against materials which have made it extremely difficult to start a base.  I've had one of my 3 vital NPCs get caught on what little terrain there is at the start.  NPCs get caught inside fully constructed rooms until you place a door, which usually isn't bad, unless you go pet your cat for 30 seconds and then look up to find everyone dead.  Or, in my last three games in a row, which inspired this review, have NPC's get stuck in terrain that was under construction, rendering the game a death sentence.  Since there is only one save, this requires a new base, which in turn requires mousing over the 2D galaxy for 5 minutes to find starting parameters...Once a player has a basic base up and running, the game begins to punish it much too soon.  Incoming asteroids, disease, incoming asteroids, raiders, incoming asteroids, and NPC incompatibilty all appear just a 4 or 5 rooms into the base.  Did I mention that incoming asteroids will hit your base and ALWAYS target vital systems?  Once a base is established, NPCs start getting sad, angry or upset.  They all have demands.  Nobody knows how to please those demands.  I even doubt the developers know.  I have never found a correlation between the limited items I can place and NPC happiness.  I try to supply them with, say, Monitors.  What do Monitors do?  I have no idea.  Are Monitors cosmetic?  Do they increase Happiness?  Do they decrease stress?  No one knows.In summation:  The game works.  It does some basic stuff.  But, I get so frustrated everytime I bring myself to give the game a 8th or 9th chance than I'd rather watch watch seconds tick by.  Furthermore, I'd like to say that my faith in Double Fine is rattled - a company that once did no wrong has now done wrong.			"

All of which, Would be fine, If the Dev team was working on it, But, Oh, Yeah, I forgot, The Dev's have done absolutely nothing on this game since November 2014.And incase you were wondering, The patch they did back in november, Was not good, It essentially added in loads of broken, Terrible mechanics that completely broke an already not good game, Not its just not playable, Seriously, Do not buy this game, Its terrible.With the Dev team essentially walking away from this game with all the money of their supportrs, You would only be giving those thieves money if you payed for this, Do yourself a Favour and pick up a Different space game ;).Gameplay - 3/10Dev Team - 1/10Bug Support - 1/10Waste of money - 11/10			"

												An abandonware scam, essentially. Double fine stopped work on the game when the money from the initial rush stopped rolling in. Heaven forbid they learn to manage their finances more prudently and move out of ultra-expensive San Francisco offices. Like a financial black hole devouring money vastly out of proportion to the reasonable requirements of a project, it has become apparent that no amount of funding short of a bottomless AAA corporate money pit is too great for Schafer and his gang to squander. No, clearly the better decision is to make bait-and-switch scams like this in between making quirky over-hyped and obscenely over-budgeted hipster adventure games with A-list geek-chic voice talent. For me, this is the last double fine title I'll ever spend money on. Not that they'll ever learn with so many other people begging to throw money at Schafer for whatever poorly conceived swindle he's got lined up next. ""Remember my Lucasarts adventure games and Psychonauts? Good, now shovel money in my general direction to feed my SF hipster pub crawling habit."" As with the pathological liar Molyneux, enough is enough.			"

Doing so would be disastrous for our reputation and would kill us emotionally""Unless they decide to be true to their word and finish what they started then their reputation should suffer. As for killing them emotionally they have done that to themselves.Be warned when buying any Double Fine game in the future they are not to be trusted for games in development.			"

												I was in love with the potential for this game. I loved dwarf fortress, psychonauts was amazing, what could go wrong?I bought the early access copy since it was Double Fine, these guys are gamers, they get it, they wont mess this up.Well the could be lazy and greedy and  just release half finished♥♥♥♥♥♥when they get bored thats what.This could have been a truly amazing game. Instead it is a half finished idea, you can still see the  whiteboard brainstorm session. Zones? Incomplete. Progress? Nonexistant. It is a  gesture at dwarf fortress in space but instead of living up to their studios name they just ♥♥♥♥ed off when the cash grab was done.Every time I logged into this game I said to myself ""okay, still a lot of huge problems, but Double Fine will fix it and eventually this is going to be the next iteration of dwarf fortress. I cant wait to see where this goes.""I said that every time I played this game for a few hours, dealing with horrendous AI was okay because hell, its still alpha. They will fix it.I logged into steam today, saw that it was 1.0 and was thrilled. Oh my to go to 1.0 the AI must finally be good! They must have fixed all the hilarious behaviour where a guy repairs an oxygen recycler and then freaks out and dies, finally i can play a base that wont just come undone due to insane citizens after a few hours! Great!I created a new base and was horrified to see the exact same ♥♥♥♥ing problems that made the alpha quite literally unplayable. The citizen ai will guarantee your base will fall apart after a few hours.No matter how smart your contstruction, no matter how carefully you manage the base, some collection of events WILL occur and wipe your base out. And it will be because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥AI. like telling people to repair a hull breach but instead they all just run around and suffocate. Or when a base adds on to yours and you explore it but then your whole base thinks it would be cool to explore and then they all suffocate and die. My favorite one so far was a guy who refused to build a door to get out of a room even after making him a builder and watching him starve to death, which caused the entire base to become depressed and stop repairing things so the base falls apart.This is infuriating and flatly unacceptableI will never buy another game that has Tim Schafer in the building, and I will never purchase another Double Fine game. if this is how they want to play the game, fine. ♥♥♥♥ them.also the DF = double fine = dwarf fortress?? reference can go eat a♥♥♥♥♥♥ These people are the worst.

												This is the game that made me start reading reviews.I bought this thinking that it would be like a sci-fi version on Towns without the clunky crafting system, also it reminded me of FTL. The game was just released in alpha when I got it, so I overlooked the plethora of bugs and unfinished... everything.It didn't get better.I am one of those people who gets angry at videogames, mostly due to something irritating that the devs decided to go with instead of something I think makes sense, and I get over it and come back to the game after a bit. This is the first time I have felt truely cheated by a game dev though. I have put up with the abuse that big companie give their customers like selling DLC that is vital to the game it's being sold for and should come with it stock,(*cough* ea *cough*), and many of you have too, but this is the first time that I have been sold a demo for the price of a full game and then be told that if I want it to be better that I should do it myself. This kind of thing is unacceptable in most other markets.Yeah sure they gave everyone that bought it Hack 'n Slash, but if I wanted that game I would have bought it. I shelled out a good amount of money for a simple indie style game that was not delivered, in any other market I would be entitled to a refund. There should be a class action suite against Double Fine.TL;DRThis game is an over priced and incomplete insult to everyone that bought it. They jumped form alpha 6e to 1.0 and I can't help but feel cheated.			"

Early Access Review
								One of my favourite games from years ago was Theme Hospital, I liked the style and the humour to this end this seemed to scratch a particular itch.Because of this I bought this game when it first came out, it seemed a little buggy but as an early access I was willing to let it slide as they were promising monthly updates and seemed to have a solid list of achievable goals.I played the game until the my guys locked themselves out and suffocated. I thought ""A bug, I'll come back in a couple of weeks""I played it a couple of weeks later, I maxed out the building element of the game, built a couple of each room, hired people based on skills, trained them up etc. not that it made any noticable difference and then a similar thing happened. people suit up go outside and wait until o2 runs out, and so on, and so on, apparently I have done this several times in less than 6 hours of total gameplay over the course of 12 months. Now it's a year after the release date. they're advertising their 6th alpha which is already less than they previously stated and unless they offer an incredible amount of content in their next release they're offering a game that will let your base be built and let the residents lock them selves out and suffocate to death over the course of about an hour and a half.So yeah, save your money, go to the cinema, for once it's better value for money.

Their unfinished game was not selling like it was the next Minecraft so they decided to cut and run. The features of the game were unceremoniously pared down and a date was given for ""1.0"". There is almost nothing to this game. Don't go into this expecting any sort of depth. You can build a dozen or so different rooms and pirates or derelicts will enter the area every so often. Sometimes your citizens will get angry and go on a rampage. That's about the extent of the interaction in the game. This game once had promise but because it didn't sell while UNRELEASED and UNFINISHED every drop of potential was sucked out of it and it was pushed out the door with some bug fixes and a tutorial.

												A side-project by the venerable Double Fine, Spacebase DF-9 had ambitions of being “Dwarf Fortress but in SPACE!”. It’s in space, that part they finished pretty early on. The entire everything else part, the parts that involve managing a large, complex and interrelated system of many smaller systems all working together and against each other, that part they didn’t quite finish. Much of what was promised for Spacebase DF-9 was dropped just before release (the game had been in Early Access for about a year now). The game was given a half-decent tutorial, opened up so users could modify and “finish” the game themselves, and a few meta-goals were added to give the experience a bit of structure.So what you’re left with is something that so painfully looks like the start of something great but then never actually goes there.  You can build your base, take on space immigrants, juggle their needs and desires, fend off raiders and explore derelicts that may appear. But it all feels pointless, unless you chase the arbitrary goals the team shoved in at the last minute, like “have a base with X amount of denizens”. It’s a pity the game didn’t get more support in Early Access, as a lack of interest from consumers is why Double Fine claims to have dropped the project.			"

												This game made me to rethink purchasing early access games. First it had a great potential, periodic updates, enthusiastic and ambitious developers. Once they reached a certain financial threshold they have shamelessly closed the project and skipped from alpha to a final release. However, I will be looking forward for independent modders to turn this frozen 'work-in-progress' into a true masterpiece.			"

												This ""game"" is not worth your time.  The developer and publisher could not be bothered to complete it.  Labelling a game 1.0 does not make it so.  It would be inappropriate for me to speculate where the money that was donated to funding the project went to or what it was actually used for but if the state of the game is an indication it wasn't allocated where it should have been.The only reason you might consider paying money for this is if you are a skilled modder and want to prove your ability to the gaming industry.  It would be very impressive if you could create a release worthy program out of this monument to mediocrity.  Can you accomplish what $400k+ and a bevy of yesterday's news hipsters could not? "

Early Access Review
								Don't buy this.....yet.I figured it would be alpha as in full of bugs. Turns out it's a mostly bug free extremely short demo.There is some promise here. If this turns out to be Dwarf Fortress in space that would be fantastic but it's feeling more like a theme park game at this point. Babby mode easy and when it is ""hard"" it's because your sims are pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and can't follow a basic command.I'm hoping against hope that is actually a bug but I get the feeling it's going to be one of those games where you are infuriated with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sims not doing the most basic task and you have no direct controll over them so you're just stuck yelling at the screen.Just wait. I don't plan to play it again until it's finished. Gameplay issues aside there is almost no content here. I'm not going to boot it up again every time they add a new sprite.			"

												Purchased during Early Access/Beta period as I'm a fan of Double Fine/Tim Schafer and this looked set to be a promising (but not genre-defining) Sims-y colony management game, with a chunky, retro Theme Hospital aesthetic.I wasn't after a lot, just a bit of a casual management game to pass the time when I'm not in the mood for something with a little more meat on it's bones.Entertaining to start off, but gets quite boring, quite quickly once you're fully established; resources and food no longer become a problem. It could, at this point; open up into a Sims-style social management game rather than a resource-gathering and base building game, a switch of pace would have been an interesting way to remove the monotony.However, the devs just up and left the project.It's nowhere near finished. It's an intro to a game that could have been, an early alpha concept piece.Avoid like the Space Plague - unless you're planning on making a video on abandoned games or something, as it really ain't worth it.

Well, that's not the case. Double Fine decides they can't keep working on the game and they leave it filled with bugs and glitches. This is the type of behavior that destroys developers and wrecks the credibility of steam greenlight. I'm so disappointed, this game HAD a lot of potential.

Early Access Review
								From the first day up until weeks before the end I was assured that my apprehension about this game was unwarranted. Doublefine has quickly gained a reputation for not satisfying the end consumer and creating products that are merely designed to appear flashy and draw sales and this game is no exception. Billed as Dwarf Fortress in space, with the lofty promises of away team missions and much much more. This game is now being released with barely any content and over a year spent making it barely playable and none of the interesting promises of the roadmap. On top of that they managed to cash in on it not once, not twice but three times. With the Amnesia Fortnight Bundle people actually paid money for the concept to be developed. Then with the kickstarter, people paid the money for the game to be developed. And with early access on steam, people actually paid for these devs to lead extravangant lifestyles. They're software designers in San Fransisco. THey are geniuses. You've gotta tease that genius out with sweet tens of thousands of dollars. It isn't their fauilt the money dried up, and besides they are needed more elswhere. On the next flashy soon to flop Double Fine project. Look out for it!			"

												This game had incredible promise.. but in the continuing saga of Early Access and Kickstarter, it's another confirmation that developers just can't be trusted to deliver on their promises. They've figured out how to sell half-baked demos as full priced games.This is a demo... an interesting demo... but not a finished game. Along with Broken Age, I think that Double Fine has successfully burnt all of their credit with the people that have followed them for years.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ANY MONEY. Just read all the reviews others have given it.This game, given another year in development, could have been good. But the alpha version you get here is really frustrating to play:- Only one saved game at a time, and auto save only. So if anything goes wrong, that's all your time wasted.- Quite often when raiding a derelict (which should be a fun thing to do), oxygen levels will drop for no reason and kill all your guys.- A single raider can easily kill way too many of your experienced guys. Even in areas that are meant to have low threat levels and even when your guys are firing back (and because of AI bugs, sometimes they don't).- I've not noticed any difference in the threat level of the main map, because I can get raided once in an hour in a high area, and almost once a minute in a low area. It makes no sense and feels like the map rating wasn't connected to anything.- The AI has serious flaws, the most irritating of which is where your security team WILL JUST STAND there and get killed. Even 10 highly trained guys will stand right next to a raider and let themselves all be killed. There is also a bug where they get confused and refused to enter the base to regain oxygen, eventually dying.- You can't tell your guys to leave an area, which means that once you own a derelict it becomes a magnate for guys and raiders which is no end of trouble. For instance, When raiders retake a derelict, technicians and doctors will all float over and get killed. I know an emergency switch is used for this, but derelicts don't come with any.- You can't pan when in the building menu, which means you have to start all over again if the camera isn't perfect.- You can view oxygen levels, but not power levels, and is seems power units need to be close enough to power things. So you have to guess where power is going.- Oxygen leaks are impossible to spot sometimes if a ****ing raider blows out a wall that's not in an obvious spot. The O2 overlay needs to show leak spots.- Sometime when building a new base, oxygen recyclers don't work.There's enough game here that would be worth checking out if it were free. BUT, because this isn't on early access I can't recommend spending any money on it. There's just WAY too many game breaking flaws that end up ruining your time. The fact Double Fine thought it was OK to continue to charge money for such a broken game, and with no plans to fix any of it, they get a BIG F.U from me. Seriously, I would never trust anything from them ever again (especially their kick starters).			"

												UPDATE: So Double Fine finally pushed the '1.0 launch' and at least props to them for trying to repair some goodwill damage by offering up Hack N Slash (their recently launched game) for free to previous supporters (prior to 1.0) of this game. It takes a bit of the sting away though unfortunately I still wouldn't recommend this game at it's current price of 20 bucks.In summary, Double Fine made a lot of faithful customers lose a lot of trust in them and I strongly advise anyone to carefully re-consider throwing money towards Double Fine for any of their future Early Access games.ORIGINAL REVIEW: DO NOT buy this game and DO NOT buy from Double Fine until they can prove that they aren't an immature developer that renege on promises made by exploiting the community's goodwill.You don't just go to v1.0 after sparse alpha updates and lack of any real content. Terrible planning, terrible cop out, and terrible damage to their reputation. I would rather recommend buying a $1 dollar completed Flash game 20 times instead of buying this.			"

												Under normal circumstances this game would have been cancelled in mid production when the devs realised it was not going to be any good. Unfortunately, because it was released as an ALPHA and people paid money for it and the devs can no longer cancel the project without refunding users a LOT of money. This is one of the pitfalls of ""Early Access"" games. If a company realises the game is fundamentaly flawed they can't just pull the plug and cut their loses. Instead, what we are left with is an unfinished game that doesn't know what sort of game it is supposed to be and is completely uninteresting after the first half-hour of play.			"

												This game could have been very good, it had great potential, and although Double Fine claims otherwise, it has been left unfinished! A game simply doesn't go from ""Alpha 6"" to ""♥♥♥♥ you we got your money it's finished"".On top of that the AI are all as stupid as ♥♥♥♥! They will build and repair oxygen tanks LAST and destroy them when unhappy therefore killing themselfs. There is no easy way to calm down an angry person apart from killing them... Or is it just me that does that? Sure there is mod support but no steam workshop so mods aren't as easily avalible. Anyone who bought this game during early access is propably weeping in pain, writing a negative review or playing this game along with it bugs. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game that will get you 30+ hours of play time but it's no longer worth the price tag.EDIT 1: Revisited the game several months later to notice how the already stupid A.I. WILLINGLY sufficate themselves to death as I have zero percent control.EDIT 2: Did the same as above again, played the game for a few hours, then 38 pirates arrive in multiple ships all at the same time (Not one after another) and completly demolished everyone before suffocating themselves to death.

												I got Spacebase DF-9 a while back when it was in Early Access.  My hopes were high, as I've enjoyed some of Double Fine's previous games quite a lot, and the game's website gave the impression that the completed product would be rich with gameplay and features.  I suppose it was foolish of me to believe what I read/watched.  As you probably have already heard, the game was not, and will not be finished.  The released game doesn't come even remotely close to what the website claimed was in production.  I'm actually a little surprised that Double Fine is even releasing what is essentially a demo for sale to the public, rather than just sending its funders an apology letter and a credit for a free game.It is shameful for Double Fine to call this a finished product, and the fact that they did so says a lot about their business practices as well as their apparent lack of commitment to quality.

												Previously I would've recommended it, until the developer announced that they were dropping the game so soon.I was a backer since the start. Although it had been left in a playable state, with the code made open source for the community to develop on, it's still a kick in the nuts that the game is left at only a fraction of what they promised Spacebase DF-9 was going to be.Everything works you see, but there are issues:-----> AI are still dumb at times. I've seen people stand in a corridor when a meteor shower hits the base, or people outside the airlock suffocate because they're waiting in line and their suits run out of oxygen.> Limited gameplay. Once you've built a self-sustaining base thats it. You're done. No more challenge outside of the occassional random events or purposely putting yourself into a situation.> Limited reply value. You get one save file and one base, unless you manually switch them out in folders. Every replay is building the same base again until you come up with an efficient design that always works - its more of a time waster.> No more official development. You'll recieve support, but any further addons are now in the hands of the community.-----If you're looking for a time waster with simple space-base building mechanics, then maybe this is for you. Its quick to load, with enough advanced features to keep things interesting while you don't have to micro-manage everything.If you're looking for a game to compare to Space Engineers however? I'd suggest saving that money. You'll likely make one base or two, learn the mechanics, develop a strategy to quickly 'win' everytime and then get bored quickly.Its a damn shame this game didn't make enough money so was dropped.

								The game is interesting and could be fun, but its simply incomplete.Unfortunately it seems that it never will be complete, as the devs have decided to go from Alpha 6 straight to release 1.0 and never updated again from there. Don't spend any money on this, its abandoned, buggy, and lacks a vast amount of the content the devs were promoting as reasons to pre-order.			"

								Double Fine decided they had taken enough money to delete the planned features list and give up on the game. It is being released in a far from finished state and they are slapping a 1.0 on it just so they don't have to work on it any more. Do not buy this game and treat any other DF early access with suspicion.			"

								Never thought I'd not recommend a product from Double Fine Productions. Spacebase DF-9 has  a very interesting concept behind it. Even in Early Access I had my fun, besides some very screwy bugs. But that's to be expected. Lots of features weren'timplemented, so it only could get better!But, no big monthly updates as promised. And now suddenly they pull the plug and willjust slap 1.0 on it and 'yeah!' a release has been born!Which is really a kick in the nuts for every one showing faith in them to give money alreadyin Early Access stage. Early Access isn't supposed to be a risk and isn't supposed to be funding model at all. But it was used by DF that way. Gambled and lost. Investors got money back.We are left behind with an empty shell of a game.So nope, don't bother with this game at all.			"

								It was once a very promising pre-release title, great goals, great plans, sadly, thanks to the developer paying himself more than any normal developer earns (significantly more) and the typical miss-management that DoubleFine has become famous for the game ended up being far from what it could have achieved...The promise was a Dwarf Fortress meets Startopia, a Dungeon Keeper in space with the ""fun to fail"" attitude that Dwarf Fortress brought to the building genre. What we got was a good and entertaining simulation that grows boring after a few hours, repetetive and chaotic. With too many downsides to really enjoy the game.Simple things like not being able to rotate items, or not being able to place specific items on two of the four walls (either due to the inability to rotate, the lack of graphics for the other two walls or other design failures are not known). Or like not having a better control over what is done well...If you like games like this, play Prison Architect instead, it already contains easily three times as much, and their developer is doing a great job. And it costs less... this game would be a nice game for ten bucks, and if it's on sale, pick it up. But for how much they want... hands off.			"

												It has many bugs and not a lot of content. If you don't have high expectations, there is some fun to be had, but be prepared for potentially game-breaking bugs. For example, in my first 1.0 base, one of my first colonists got sucked out of the airlock because it opened for someone else after he had taken his suit off. That left me down a person and made the early game much more difficult. In my second base, the seed pod didn't spawn and one of my colonists spawned stuck in part of an asteroid. I decided to just restart at that point. My third base is going better, but the AI doesn't work very well even when it isn't bugging out completely. My builders will often stand around chatting or working out even though they have a bunch of stuff to do.Ultimately, it just doesn't feel like a proper release. I can see building a few more bases, but there's just not enough content to keep me coming back.			"

												Unfortunately, the game is being released WAY before it's ready.The worst part is DoubleFine is playing it off like it's such a wonderful thing, and aren't we all so lucky. Why not just tell us ""Sorry, we didn't get enough money to continue development, but here's what we'll do - giant bugfix/polish patch, release sourcecode. We hope you guys can make the game we couldn't afford to!"" That would at least have had the respect for the players and Early Access supporters that seems ""right"" to me. Deleting the old ""roadmap"" seems particularly dishonest at this point as well.However, that's just me with my silly morals and standards and respect and honesty. I don't have to run a business and make decisions like ""let's pretend this is great when it's actually crap."" Sorry, DoubleFine, but you've managed to massively damage my opinion of you with the way you're handling this. I know you're just publishing GangBeasts, but there's now NO WAY I'm putting money into that until it's actually finished. And if too many people feel that way, will it stagnate and suffer the same fate as DF-9?-----I'll try to make an update to this review once the so-called-1.0 version comes out, and see if it's actually some working skeleton of a game.As it is now, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME AT ANY PRICE.It simply does not work as a game. Stuff happens and your base will die, and there's nothing you can do about it. Just after the latest patch version, I lost an entire base to one raider, because the security team was either standing around and getting shot, or running away (and getting shot). None of them ever bothered to attack the intruder. Not even once. Your base will catch fire from asteroid impacts and your inhabitants will gleefully panic-run right into the flames and die, instead of grabbing the fire extinguishers you've placed across the base and actually doing something constructive. Someone will decide that they absolutely need to do floor pushups right in your airlock door, and then everybody will suffocate to death.These things are quite forgivable in an alpha game. Frustrating, but understandable. It's alpha, I get it. Things might be broken or unfinished. I'm fine with that. But if ANY of this crap manages to slip into the 1.0 release? That's just garbage.(Edit: Apparently The S-Word is too raunchy for a review. Sigh.)----1.01 UpdateIt has improved nothing at all.No. I absolutely do not recommend. It continues to just not work. I started two bases today after the 1.01 patch, the one designed to ""finish"" the game. I see no significant improvements. Build orders are randomly followed, regardless of importance. Citizens start ""running away"" for no obvious reason. Random station boarding parties still utterly annihilate you base regardless of the number of security personnell you have assigned. Security teams clearing derelicts still seem to think that actually shooting the hostiles is a silly concept.But hey, at least now there's a tutorial! A rather unnecessary one, since the game mechanics are not at all complicated, and I felt were very obviously conveyed through normal play. The problem isn't the players misunderstanding the game mechanics - it's that the game simply doesn't f-ing work.----Final Final recommendation:DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. EVER.Secondary recommendation:Never trust DoubleFine again. Only buy a product once it has been actually released, and you've tried it, and it actually works, and the community is being treated well. Do not give support (either financial or social) to companies that make bad decisions. And especially not companies that make bad decisions, then try to tell you how great their decisions actually were.			"

Posted: January 4, 2015
												After playing for several hours, all I can conclude about this game is that it's excessively frustrating.First off, the tutorial lacks a lot of important information.  No mention that you have to build aesthetic stuff all over to keep up morale, no proper explanation of what most of the structures/objects do or why you should care about them.  I lost three bases to everyone flipping out on each other before I pulled up the (terribly-made) wiki and a starter's guide said to scatter cosmetic stuff everywhere to keep people happy.The interface, while thematically good at first, gets very old very fast.  Every UI element is oversized, and everything flickers like an old TV set with every interaction, and everything has horizontal lines through it like an old computer monitor.  It gets grating and hard on the eyes rather quickly.  Event warnings on the right side of the screen can be minimized (usually), but not dismissed, even for minor alerts, or ones that no longer apply.You have no direct control over the citizens of your station, which is fine, but it means that when they're all ignoring your orders - which happens fairly often - you can't do anything about it.  The closest you can get to controlling anyone is setting people to the ""security"" job and setting a beacon  - they'll jog over and stand near the beacon, but that's all you can do.  You can't prioritize commands, or set a ""do this first"" type thing on anything, so if you need a room built NOW, you have to go across the entire map and cancel every other build/dismantle task.  If things fall into disrepair, technicians take FOREVER to fix them - each time they work on something, they only improve it by a few percentage points, and then wander off again.  You also can't set anyone to do more than one task - a guy can build things, or repair things, but not both unless you constantly toggle his settings in the roster screen.Raiders and derelict ships spawn far too often and too regularly - it's not at all random.  If you don't get ""security"" to respond in time to raiders, your citizens will just wander through and drop one by one.  Seriously, multiple times I've lost almost my entire station's population to single raiders because nobody has the sense to run away when they're being shot at, or security gets there one at a time and just drops.A known bug (I'd say it's a bug, anyway) with derelict ships is that sometimes they'll just ""drift away"" with your people still on-board.  What this means is that the derelict despawns - taking your people with it.  This means you have to very quickly ""claim"" every part of the derelict to prevent that, at which point it's treated like part of your base - including constant alerts that it's not connected to the power grid, and citizens will wander over to it and just hang about, making it impossible to safely dismantle.  This also includes warnings about rooms on the ship not being tended to properly, even if you've already flagged everything to be dismantled for materials.  Heaven forbid you don't tend the garden on that ship you plan to scrap (by the way, it mentions this only in passing in the tutorial, but you NEED a garden - it provides food that doesn't eat through your resources like the food-dispenser does.  And you need a bar with full facilities to serve/store that food properly - also only hinted at).Researching new technologies/illnesses isn't discussed at all in the tutorial, nor does it say how gardens work, or what to do with incapacitated-but-alive raiders.  It doesn't talk about building a brig, or whether you can ever do anything with these raiders - you only find out on third-party guides that EVENTUALLY these raiders can convert to citizens if they're confined long enough.  And your own citizens will freely wander through the brig, even if occupied, and get injured/killed by captured raiders.""Passing ships"" also happen like clockwork, and get spammy.  The sense of humor in all the dialogue is great and everything, but it wears thin after the 200th ship in a 2-hour session, especially since most of the somewhat-limited encounter types seem to play out the exact same way every single time - either they give you more citizens, or they send raiders.  If you tell them to go away, they either go away, send citizens anyway, or send raiders anyway.  And you almost always know exactly what it'll be the moment it pops up.  Passing ships also turn off timelapse - you'll be going along at 4x speed to get something built, then it pops back to 1x so you can tell some guy to bugger off because you have no more room for more people.  And he may still send more citizens, in which case you have to quickly build beds/rooms for them to stay in or they'll start throwing tantrums and send station morale into the toilet.I'm sure there are other issues I've forgotten to mention, but I think this gives a decent idea of how obnoxious this game is to play in general.

Early Access Review
								I feel like I am jumping on a bandwagon, but whatever. The devs just bailed on the game, leaving me with mixed feelings. Releasing the source code is kind of nice, and at the same time is quite useless in itself.This is a game which was ""prototyped"" in a fortnight. Which meant it was written on a language enabling quick prototyping. In this particular case, Lua, which I don't think is precisely the best programming language to develop a project so ambitious as this one was sold to us as being. What sold me the early alpha back in October 2013 was the vision. If I knew the vision was backed by that, ehm, questionable technological foundations, well, certainly my scepticism about the whole enterprise would have been higher.On the other hand, the writing was on the wall for all of us to see. The development team promised monthly major updates and a continuous stream of bug fixes between updates. That development wasn't going quite right for this title was obvious when those updates started to lack regularity, at some point after February 2014, right after the ""Amnesia Fortnight"". Indeed, Double Fine seemed to forget about this one, since the fortnight turned out to be a couple months. Since then there have been ""major updates"", but to be honest, I am not sure that the new features added since May are that interesting, well thought out or functional, as the ""backbone"" of the game. Which I now reckon hadn't changed much between February 2013 and February 2014.I'll look forward to the source code release. It will be good to see how things were implemented, and probably will inspire others to take up the concept. It will also, to be blunt, allow to rewrite the f*cking thing using tools actually meant for this kind of job (say Unity and C#, or Unreal/Cry Engines and C++). In that sense, hats off to the devs of Spacebase DF-9 and to Double Fine for putting this into the public domain. Of course, this last paragraph will only make sense to people like me, who understand and appreciate the real hackers' ethics. What I don't appreciate at all is that this comes out of the blue, without saying a ""we're sorry but the early access revenue wasn't enough to support development"". Which would have been a very a straight way to approach the community, without giving excuse to people to think that they have been duped. I also see some astroturfing going on: it seems like some community management person is trying very hard to spray a giant smiling emoji on top this. And failures like this one are sad.So I'd say that Double Fine doesn't deserve a sale of this title unless  You appreciate the release of the source code to the public domain as an inherently good thing. You look forward to someone to take up the torch and actually take this ball all the way to the touchdown line.If you're just interested in a game that you can play now and you can get value for money, just stay away, and look out for that rewrite I mention above.DISCLAIMER: if the source code turns out to come out with a very restrictive license, i.e. one that prevents people from doing what I suggest above, then I'll be sure to come back to this review and use very different terms.

Put out a dev post that states that updates are going to improve;4. Run a 50% Steam sale to judge further interest;5. Dump unfinished, incomplete game as a ""1.0"", state modders can take it from there when sale evidently doesn't make you enough cash;6. Prove your studio is an undirected ship running onto rocks, dump all over the EA model, ensure that I will never buy a DF game again.7. DO NOT PROFIT!!!edit: And now 1.0 is released.  Guess what?  It's still basically a tech demo in terms of content, and is still buggy as all get-out.  You ripped off a lot of people, Double Fine.So you like games that do what SB-DF9 couldn't be bothered to do?  If you don't mind older graphics, you will likely enjoy:- StarTopia: very similar in scope to DF9, but miles better- Space Colony HD: leans more toward ""The Sims"" in peep interaction, but still a worthy effortYou can buy both of these cheap over at www.gog.com.  Let DF-9 sink into the oblivion it deserves.  Hopefully DoubleFine will meet the same fate.			"

								I payed $25.00 CAD for an Early Access game. More than most EA games but not something I have a problem with so long as they stick to their goals and finish the game. I excpected that since it was a known company, Double Fine, I would be safe from cash grab type marketing.It has already been stated they have NO INTENTIONS of finishing the game. They have cut development with what features they have in at the moment. They WILL NOT finish their planned features listed here: http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplansThe game is horribly broken, incomplete, buggy, and they have no intentions of finishing it. I expected more from double fine. Do not purchase.			"

								Devs have said they are going to rush to release and might stick around to bug fix.  DONT BUY this and any future titles, actions like this hurt the gaming industry and also Early Access titles that actually keep trying to improve their games even thru release and beyond.This is Ballistic Muppets review and spot on ""The updates are very very rare, tbh this has all the signs that it will be abandoned, they also ignore the players and put stuff in that we dont want and vise versa, there love for Dwarf Fortress (good game btw) has dragged this game to its lower limits.It is currently very buggy, pretty much unplayeable, but i dont expect many fixes anytime soon.UPDATE:As many predicted the Devs have given up and will not finish the game.AVOID NOW AT ALL COSTS""			"

								Last week I would have recommended this game, but after Double Fine's recent decision to cease developement everyone should steer clear of this game. There are numerous bugs and glitches that seeminly won't be fixed. The game just isn't worth it. Stay away from this game and keep a wary eye on Double Fine from now on.			"

 Overview  Spacebase DF-9 is a survival game in the wide-reaching void of, you guessed it, space. Your mission is work with a trio of astronauts and build the most sophisticated, comprehensive and long-lasting space station anyone has ever seen. That sounds amazing on paper, and being developed from the veterans over at Double Fine Productions, you’d almost be assured a great game. However, the product falls short and development has long since died for this title, leaving an ugly mess in its wake. In space, nobody can hear you complain.The game opens up with an interesting concept at first – a map laid out with all the locations in the galaxy, letting you pick where you want to start and factoring in variables like meteor showers, derelict ships, traffic for earning more crew members [good and bad] and resources. Once your base is selected, you’re launched into space with three crew members, a space pod for power and oddly, no spaceship; the game starts you out in the dead of space with limited oxygen, limited supplies and a very short time span before your whole crew perishes from asphyxiation. From a logical standpoint, the start of the game makes absolutely no sense and it only gets worse from there.You must quickly build a functioning center with enough life support for your crew. You’ll gather material from nearby asteroids that oddly resemble play-doh, which you will ingeniously craft into oxygen recyclers and stations for power with nothing but a blowtorch and your wits. As the base grows, you’re able to expand, making different rooms that can be retrofitted into housing, laboratories, pubs, infirmaries and more. I like the aspect of building a base to my own liking, but Double Fine really chokes the life out of personalizing it as you see fit: limited items to use, each room can only use furniture from one list of items [I.E. only residential furniture in a residence] which forces you to build a lot of unnecessary rooms for no reason at all. However, my biggest complaint is being in space and not being able to build along the Z axis; you can only build outward, not vertically, which seems like a huge oversight since you’re not hindered by the laws of gravity.As you continue playing, you’ll encounter hazards that you must overcome, such as illness, resource management [marginally], machine repairs, raiders [space pirates] and meteor showers. Most obstacles aren’t all that exciting: meteor showers are not impressive and barely noticeable if the game didn’t tell you it was happening, space pirates have terrible AI capabilities and can easily be killed with a few well-placed defense turrets and most ailments can be cured by simply sending them to the doctor, curing them nearly instantly. Oddly, some of the ailments have auto-cures, such as when I was afflicted with “Space Blindness”, which I was promptly told there was already a cure so I didn’t have to do anything.The real gem to this travesty is the writing, or the lack of a proper writer. Here’s an example of the type of “communications” you’ll received while in space:


My first hail and it was some 13 year old frog who spends to much time on Tumblr. God this game needs a writer. STAT! 
A Screenshot of Spacebase DF-9
By: ErickaUnlimited




I felt secondhand embarrassment just reading it. The writing is dreadful, out of place and just downright terrible. Couple that with other gems like my dead astronaut having a “kinda happy” job satisfaction while simultaneously being dead, but the real winner is that her location is “space”:


Job Satisfaction: ""Kinda Happy"" - A real optimist considering she's, well, you know, dead. 
A Screenshot of Spacebase DF-9
By: ErickaUnlimited




Yes, everything in this game has ""space"" attached to it. Your location, beds are called ""space beds"" and even rugs are called ""space rugs"" because your typical Ikea rug is not suitable for the vacuum of space apparently.I could go on and on with all the issues with this game, but in the end it has been abandoned completely by Double Fine and is left at the hands of 3rd party modders if they feel like investing their time in such a project. Much like my crew member Nashira Corrino, this game is dead, asphyxiated by its own mediocrity.  Pros   There are none. Cons    The entire game is a con. There are too many to list. The game has been abandoned. Stay away.Overall, Spacebase DF-9 is an absolute mess with broken AI, poor graphics, terrible UI and even worse sound effects. There is literally no reason for you to play this unless you’re punishing yourself and even less reason to buy it unless you’re sending it to someone in hopes of terminating a friendship.			"

Early Access Review
								Plenty of people have already said this, but more voices never hurt: do not buy this game. It has been pushed from an ALPHA build to 1.0 in ONE UPDATE because the developers ran out of money. The game is mediocre at best - I managed to get almost thirty hours of fun out of it, but I really love this genre. It feels like a hamburger without cheese. You can enjoy it, but the entire time you feel like something essential is missing. Paying 25 dollars for a less than half-finished management game that still suffers from issues it had in the first build ever released (people forgetting to get out of their spacesuit in an airlock and suffocating, panicking when there's low oxygen and running until they choke instead of building more oxygen generators, trying to stomp out fires when there are extinguishers nearby) is a joke. Spend your money on the unfortunately-named RimWorld instead.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS UNFINISHED GAME - Well, I can say that I will never ever buy a single double fine game again ever.  This is the biggest INTENTIONAL slap in the face to a fanbase that I've ever seen a video game company do.  Move over EA you've got competition for biggest scumbag video game company now.  As someone who bought into the 'early access' scam they were doing for this game, I can't even begin to tell you how far off the 1.0 'release' is from what we were promised a year ago.  To simply say that they're not going to follow through on their development promises because it's not cost effective?  That's sickening.  They had a lot of people give them money based on their development plan.  Are those people getting refunds since they aren't getting the promised product or anything even remotely close to it?As to reviewing the actual game, it's got the great bones for a game.  It is what it is...  an ALPHA build for an unfinished game.  DO NOT BUY.			"

The company's official line is that they are no longer going to work on this game, and they've fired everyone involved. Your money would literally be better used as toilet paper... What little they bothered to make of the game plays even worse than it looks. I don't give negative reviews lightly, but this one earned every terrible statement.			"

Early Access Review
								It's probably best to avoid this. The game was apparently reliant on early access funding and didn't sell enough copies to continue development past an extremely barebones set of features. Not sure why Double Fine decided on an extremely risky business model.It's worth noting that I haven't been able to play for more than about an hour without some kind of show-stopping bug as of the patch before they call the game complete. The AI is dreadful and has a habit of doing the worst thing possible, like suffocating when there's a working airlock and oxygen generators. It's not very likely that all of the issues will be tidied up in the month or so they had left on development.It's a genuinely great idea and with another year or so of dev time I could really see it shaping up to be worth the money. For now it's not worth the money, and likely won't be once it leaves early access.			"

												Another in the recent series of mismanaged games that ran out of budget. Between Hack n Slash being a major disappointment and Broken Age being mysteriously broken in half and the entire budget being blown on the first half, I'm really beginning to doubt Double Fine's ability to publish games these days. I got this for free. FREE. From Double Fine. They sent owners of Hack-n-Slash this game, and the other way 'round, as some sort of twisted joke.The game itself has been abandoned and the lengthy list of features that would possibly make this into a compelling and enjoyable game was scrapped. It's not even to what I'd call a true beta stage yet (i.e. feature complete, only fixing bugs) and they just slapped a 1.0 on it and left everyone who paid full price holding the bill.At this rate, I'm seriously concerned about them being able to pull of the HD remake of Grim Fandango.

												My review will look similar to what most other people have probably written, but at any rate the developers for this do not deserve your money.I bought the game when it was still in Early Access. It had some cool functions to it, was fairly simple, and felt almost like a simplified, more accessible Dwarf Fortress in space. I wasn't too concerned with the lack of available features or amount of glitches, as most of what I wanted was to be released anyway through updates leading up to the final release.Well, as you probably already know, the developers essentially shredded up their list of short/medium/long term goals in one night, and suddenly the game ""went gold"". It was a very disappointing turn of events, to see a title with such promise basically wind up as a hollow shell of what it could have been (and should have been, based on what was promised the gamer base by the makers of the game originally). Basically, don't waste your money - you'll get maybe a couple short, bugged-out playthroughs of the game but it's just lacking any amount of depth to really get you playing up to even half your money's worth.

												Fact is, this game is not complete.That aside it is amusing/fun for a while (2-4 hours) then it just becomes frustrating. There are so many bugs in this game it begins to get on your nerves. On top of that, crew members regularly go on a rampage killing multiple people making it rather difficult to keep your base running. On my last playthrough a week or so ago, walls kept randomly disapearing. This wasn't caused by some random event, they just left, gone never to be seen again. When this happens to both your airlocks at the same time, GAME OVER.			"

This is especially ""great"" after they expressively stated that they are ""not some kind of fly-by-night developer"" who would just abandon a game in early access. Well this is exactly what they did. The game itself is quite buggy and unfinished. DF relased the sourcecode and just left it up to the fans to fix it.

												I want to like this game, I really do. But I just can't.There are basic bugs and glitches with the AI and a failed priority system for tasks that add up to more frustration than progress - long before you get to the core balance issues. The biggest flaw if I need to point at any is a seemingly over-complicated mood system that is dependant on too many factors that lets it easily sway too far too fast. Early expansion is a difficult grind struggling with a  crew that doesn't work into that mid to what I think is later game starts to drag on far too easily as it gets harder to manage even basic needs with the limited resources income.I admit it does sound nice, and can have promise - but it just doesn't seem to have enough behind it at the moment to get it there, or at least in the direction the game wants to go without doing something of a major overhault to some key aspects to smoothen the gameplay.Try it out maybe on a cheap sale, but this is definetly not one I'd be willing to reccomend at a higher price.

Posted: June 14, 2016
												Dissapointing....  Back when the game was in early development I fell victim to its ""appeal"".  I saw a game with potential and I was all and all hopeful.  In those ealier days the game was riddled with bugs and glitches, and when I found out they were dropping the game and rushing development, I was hopeful they would eliminate those bugs and glitches in the game.  So as a review of the official release of version 1.06 here is the breakdown.  I'll have a simple review and more in depth... or in this game... anger driven review...----- Simple ----The game is crap... It had so much potential but since it got the axe and a speedy release... it has so many issues.  I honestly tried to play the game again... but yet I wasn't able to play longer than 10 minues.  I would not recommend this game to anybody unless it's less than a dollar or given to you free.  It's buggy... rough to control, and just honestly crap.----- Angered Version -----Graphics:As this is not a ""Highly graphical"" game I wouls say they are acceptable.  The sprites perform actions that is befiting, and nothing to standoutish.  However in aspect of gameplay the ""isometric"" angle makes the game difficult to know exactly what is going on.  In the typical fashion the walls disappear in a way to allow you to see in the rooms, however being able to roatate the camera would be nice.Gameplay:This is where the game loses me.  Although the controls aren't ""hard"" they are difficult in there own way.  I've played many builder games, and most games play similarily with minor adjustments to the controls.  In more recent terms since the era of shooter games almost every game depends upon the W-A-S-D model.  This game doesn't stray too far fram that idea and it feels comfortable... at least until you start building.  At that point the game takes a turn for the worst.  Edge scrolling doesn't feel like it's in existence, so your dependant upon the WASD model, but once you open the construction menu, foul language fills the mouth as when you click with your mouse to select the item and press ""D"" to move your contruction item changes.  As soon as that construction menu comes up the game shifts from a comfortable WASD model to a point and click model.  This wouldn't be a problem if they didn't establish you could use the WASD in the first place....   So that is annoying.  Then it gets worse.  As you play you decide to speed up the game, and most games using some button near the WASD (tab, 123, something) changes the game speed, but in comes the mouse model, and you have to click the speed options.  Now I wouldn't have an issue with this, if it wasn't for the fact that when any ship arrived or any notification appears the game switches back to speed 1.... and DOES NOT RETURN.....I find it quite annoying because I'll be in the middle of waiting for my characters to build a room... then all the sudden a message... then the question, ""Why are my guys moving so slow""... then oh gotta click that speed... then the game goes NOPE... and another message.  It just continually pesteres you until you get so angry that you give up.AI:I don't normally judge AI as it's always an issue with all games.  It is always about finding that right balance between what the computer needs to process and what the character prioritizes.... unfortunately it appears that this game said, ""F*$k it... have the guys do whatever.""  And like loyal programs they do whatever.  You have absolutely no control over the individual character, so when your trying to finish that bed... your have to wait until the game decides... ""know what I think I should build that bed.""  But at that point your characters are now falling over because they are so tired... that they have no energy... then get depressed and not want to work... so now that bed will never get done.... it annoying the bleeping crap out of me as I was just trying to enjoy the game.Glitches and Bugs:Yes I'm bringing it up... as a ""fully"" released game you would expect most of the bugs and glitches to be taken care of... in fact thats what most of the follow up forums established... but know what.... turns out that your characters get stuck (dumb AI) and because you can't do that they sufficate.... yeah... so just started finished the basic build... airlock... air... and such... but oh no... two of my guys just sat there... doing... NOTHING... could it be AI? probably... but to me that's a bug.   But it's not the worst oh no... in my honest to goodness no opinion try I got ""invaded"" another ship attached itself to me, and I was assulted.  After killing the AI I noticed, Hey there is a gun outside...  Then I slowly watched one of my security guards go out to take care of it.... two shots later dead.... ok..... so what does the AI do?  ""Well he's dead... probably should take care of that... but naa....""  Guess where my miners had to go to get resources?  Right in the line of fire.... so there goes two of my miners...  Well maybe I can control a security... oh wait can't control the guys so whoops... maybe set a security point for them.... nope... dead... dead and dead.....  I'm happy they incorperated the guns for defences... but when a gun is established as enemy and even if you took over everything it appears that that guns still acts hostile....  My frustrations knows no bounds.Overall the game is fine.... just fine.... not great... not good... just fine.... if you want something new to distract you for 10 minutes... here is the perfect game for you... but don't buy unless it's on uber sale.... and by uber sale like... I dunno $0.99 per copy... or heck maybe if the company pays you to play... becuase honestly this game isn't worth anything more.			"

												As of 1.01 This game is a buggy mess*. You can't say still, because prior to 1.0 it was an alpha build. So: alpha -> release. This ""release"" is just a giant finger for the backers, a disgrace for DF, a disservice to Early Access and alltogether shouldn't even be allowed on Steam. It certainly would not have been greenlit if it had tried.Besides the buggyness, there are a lot of design-issues which would have needed to be ironed out before release (no building priority, crew-AI, control over security, ridicoulus menus...).The idea was good and the prototype (not the alpha) fun to play. It is still, more so than this game.tl/dr: Please don't buy it.*To give some examples:-pathing is bugged, making at times airlocks not functional, killing all your crew currently in space-hostiles appear frequently with mostly no time for you to prepare, decimating 3 out of 4 attampted bases of mine in 5 minutes after start-builders pop out of their space suits randomly, ending up in rooms connected to nowhere, slowly starving-bad seed-generation, starts you out with your crew and/or seed-pod encased in astroids and nothing you can do about it			"

 This game is a scam. Do not touch this game. It has been rushed to ""completion"" after the developer failed to deliver promised monthly updates and supposedly ran out of cash. They returned their original investor's cash mind you, but they banked on using gamer's (Early Access) cash to subsidize the development, greatly overestimating the monthly sales for an unfinished piece of garbage. Maybe if they had kept up with updates it would have sold better, that seems to have been key in most other successful Early Access titles.The greatness of the game's concept (found at http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplans) pales in comparison to the terrible nature in which this games development and budgeting was handled. Avoid at  all  costs, developers should receive no incentive to pull these types of moves on fans and consumers.This game is unfinished, awful, and I'm ashamed to have supported it in any way. The pride with which they present this abysmal product that cashed in on their own fan equity completely turns my stomach. ""We’ve learned a lot and are proud of what we managed to accomplish, and it’s all thanks to your support."" Double Fine, I think a lot of your fans can also say they learned something during this escapade and I doubt you'll like what effect that's going to have on future support for any titles bearing your now tainted brand.TL;DR / What should I play instead? - Don't buy this unless coerced through physical violence. Instead, try Prison Architect or actually try out  Dwarf Fortress. [www.bay12games.com] "

												This is a post-release review.  Previously I had recommended it while it was in early Alpha.  In early Alpha, I did recommend it because it showed great promise and looked like it was going to be improved greatly as development continued.  As it was Double Fine - I had high hopes.  Admittedly, I probably shouldn't have gotten my hopes up for any game that is early access.  I highly encourage you to buyer beware for any early access games you may wish to fund in the future.A note on the current status of Spacebase DF-9: It is considered, by the developers, to be complete enough for a full release.  Currently they're bug squashing and finishing some other small details on their development list.  That's it.  They're done after that.  There will be no future development done to this game for the foreseeable future, according to the developers.  They may not get back to it for at least 2 years, at minimum.  Buyer beware.On to the review:I have only played it for about 2 hours since it's official release.  While it still retains the charm and brutal difficulty as most games of this genre (ala Dwarf Fortress), there hasn't been that much added since the last builds of the early access Alpha.  The graphics are passable, the sounds are passable, the text and artwork definitely has the Double Fine touch that many love and enjoy.  The actual game play and game design is a hollow shell, crying for more.  Should you survive for at least an hour to hour and a half, you will have built everything that is needed.  The rest of the game is simply adding more space for more crew members, taking care of their needs, fighting off the occasional raider/parasite, researching the lack-luster tech tree, and preparing for the “end game” fight with the raider mega-fleet (which also completes the game; I believe).  I'm unsure if the raider mega-fleet actually ends the game or just scores you as I simply got too bored waiting for the mega-fleet to show up.  I built everything I wanted, I raided derelicts for tasty materials, and I threw the troublemakers in my station in a brig or two.  Not to mention dealt with some of my own bugs that are still hanging around since the Alpha builds.Amongst some of the issues with the game: No varied save slots for more than one base at a time, vague tutorial, unrealized or fully implemented concepts, inability to clean up blood stains (at least no way I have found out), questionable fairness (random spikes in difficulty or events that have no lead up; bad things just happen and they're absolutely devastating), and AI having no way to prioritize important tasks (so they just stand around building the room while they suffocate instead of building the single oxygen recycler they need to survive).Elaborating on the unrealized/fully implemented concepts: There are a great deal of the beginnings of production chains, rooms, etc. - But they're just lacking.  All those things you would normally build in other games to fully flesh-out a production chain just aren't there.  You just build a room and get the end product immediately.  For example, instead of building a whole bunch of different machines and making an actual factory that takes raw ore, crushes it, purifies it, refines it, and then makes it into usable construction components – You just get a single shot “matter” resource that you use for everything.  The developers didn't want the game to be too bogged down in these systems, but you never need more than one type of room with their setup.  There's not enough décor for the rest of your base, so you're just stuck with single blocked out rooms at a minimum size to hold just what you want and that's it.  It just leads to boring designs and an uninteresting base to look at.  It's visually boring.If you're dying for another Dwarf Fortress game, set in space – I highly recommend checking out Rimworld or even looking into Gnomoria for your Dwarf Fortress needs.  Let this derelict game drift away.			"

												Could have been a great game, but was abandoned by the developers. This is not hyperbole or butthurt exaggeration, the developers saw their sales for the game slow down and just threw their hands up, declaring the game completed. Do not buy it. This is one of the games that caused me to abandon purchasing any more Early Access games on Steam (thank you Doublefine -- I hope you're satisfied with the reputation you're purchasing for yourselves. The free ""I'm sorry"" shovelware game you gave us early access supporters sucks too, by the way). Do not buy this game.Awesome graphics and sound are ruined by the crippled AI -- your citizens will literally charge past a fire extinguisher hanging on a wall to stomp on a huge room-sized fire to promptly catch on fire and burn to death. Technicians will do pushups in front of a failing oxygen scrubber, then their air will run out and they'll panic and die. Everyone on your station is mind numbingly stupid, but there's no way to directly control them -- you'll just watch them helplessly as their lack of regard for their own safety causes them to die in a variety of ridiculously preventable ways. At first it's funny, for a short time. Then it's annoying. Then it's frustrating. Then it becomes infuriating.Do not buy this game. I'm somewhat convinced that it is not actually a game, but an elaborate psychological experiment to determine frustration thresholds. Do not buy it.			"

												I'm going to focus on the AI aspect here. In the beginning, there was Early Access. In its Alpha build, DF9 AI was rudamentary. It made bad, often comically bad decisions, and it was like watching a child grow and interact with a world we knew it would adapt to. Like parents, we told our friends the marginally interesting tales of how the children stopped to chit-chat about Moonbeef and whatever while oxygen recyclers caught fire and firefights happened around them. And it was funny because we assumed that it would improve with time, development, and attention.Then DF noticed. They thought this is where the charm of the game came from, and they pulled the plug. Our AI children stopped growing, and were now going to stay stupid. ""You enjoyed the stupid AI"", they say, ""and now that's where we decided to leave it."" We enjoyed the AI because it was temporary and had some amusing quirks in its broken state. Being forced to deal with the game in the shape that it's in is not fun. Building a base for inhabitants who don't know how to live in it is not a sim, it's an exercise in futility.			"

												No, no, no. At the moment this game is unplayable, AI is broken. This game was abandoned by it's studio. It was at a state of early beta, but they decided to release it as full game and fire all it's developers. They refused to sell rights to it because there are community updates and game will be playable in the future perhaps, so they are just waiting for that moment. If anyone wants to play this I recommend to pirate it, otherwise it's not worth it. They don't deserve money for the work of the community. Sadly, I bought this from the BYOB on Humble Store so I can't refund it, as if I could, it would be an instant refund.			"

												This game had a lot of potential. While not a deep as initially promised, there was still a good amount of things to do, and I could imagine just maintaining a large base over an extended period of time would keep me pleasantly occupied. Sadly, the final release is riddled with bugs and is not balanced very well, making it impossible to play beyond the initial stages of the game. The developers have said they will provide patches for the game, but thus far their updates have done little to improve the faults with the game and seem to have spawned new bugs. It is hard to imagine that they will have the time to actually fix the game properly given their claim to have run out of funding and their stated desire to wrap up support within a couple of weeks. At this point, avoid this game.UPDATE: It's now February and support for this game including bug fixes is officially over. Update 1.6 was DoubleFine's last patch, and they have stated on their own forums that no one is working on patches anymore. The above review applies to patch 1.6. This game has too many bugs and balance issues to warrant purchase.			"

								This game was the most feature-bare, bug ridden alpha of an early access game I've ever purchased. Over a year later the updates have been lackluster and far below the minimum standard I'd expect from any early access game. Now the game is being written off, the plug is being pulled, they're taking the money and running. They can call it 1.0, but that's just not true. It'll be Alpha 7, and that will be the final version of this game.I own dozens of early access games, I love them dearly. This has been my first and only ""huge disappointment"" out of early access, I straight up feel scammed. Not only does this hurt the reputation of Double Fine, but early access as a whole.Don't buy this, and don't trust Double Fine with your early access or kickstarter money.			"

Early Access Review
								You too Double Fine? An Early Access game falls short again but this time it is a pretty well known developer that decides to under deliver.  DF stated that it simply wasn't making enough money to warrant continued development and from a gamer's perspective, there's not much of a game to warrant purchasing, especially at the $25 price range. What we have here is a stalemate in which both parties lose. Gamer's lose money and the developer loses face.As it stands, Spacebase DF-9 does let you create a base and manage some resources, it does have some random events to throw at a player so that the game isn't completely boring however, there are no end game type things to work towards, no objectives to ultimately strive towards.  In five hours, a player can pretty much run into everything the game offers and after that, the game will just keep repeating itself.The lack of gameplay issue is compounded by the fact that the beta phase of game testing is being skipped over entirely.  DF is going to tack on a tutorial, wrap up some issues and then release the code in hopes that modders will run with their..un-game and make it better.What was supposed to be a game that was to be in continuous development over the next five years with gameplay tweaks and additions is now kicked out the door in its current shape. I guess in space, no one can hear you break promises.			"

Plus rumor has it that they want to go straight from Alpha 6 to version ""1.0"" and release it as complete. Which is more than a little odd. They even stripped their roadmap page of planned features to go with this.Edit 28th October 2014: Double Fine started giving out free copies of their other game ""Hack 'n' Slash"" to owners of Space Base DF-9, as some sort of apology I would assume. That doesn't change my opinion that this game is unfinished, but at least they did something to appease their customers.			"

												*I recommend this game only if it goes on sale or gets a serious update*As of right now I've put about 30+ hours into the game. (Offline play, that's why the hours don't match up.)I purchased this game very early on at a reduced price around $10 or so and at that time it seemed tottally worth it. What was promised seemed awesome and backed by a developer I actually liked how could it go wrong? Well it sorta did and didn't. The game had serious bugs like:Being wiped out within 1-10 minutes by a parasiteBeing wiped out within 1-10 minutes by raidersSave files being deletedGame crashingOverall difficultyPoor performanceNo direction/Story/LoreNo basic tutorial (now in game)Promised missing core featuresNo really settingsWhile I won't get into specifics a simple google search can easily confirm every one of these points. While some of the perforamce issues have been fixed, gameplay ""bugs"" still remain. It is incredibly frustrating to spend hours building a large base when within seconds, Because of derpy AI or crazy strong raiders/parasites/space debri, everything you built is gone with no real feeling of acomplishment and a feeling of being cheated by the game. Right now $20 is a crazy high price to sell this game at, especially when starting a new game could last a handfull of minutes to several hours after being cheated and killed. I really hope this game gets some serious gameplay options and core function updates soon. When the game changes significantly I'll update this review to hopefully something more positive.But seriously Double Fine? $20?!			"

												Full Review:Big discussions arose about the Early Access programm and kickstarted games. Leaving that aside I wanna focus purely on the game, that I got bundled in a Humble Bundle when it was still Alpha and played several times until its current version.The premise and style of the game seemed enticing to me: Build and manage a space station with room for crew and their needs. I like space and sci-fi settings, plus the whole base-management had a Theme Hospital-like feel to it, which was also a great and creative game.So I started out in space and began building. The game doesn’t offer a campaign, you basically free-build and manage your base from scratch. After a few basic rooms for living quarters, refining asteroids and oxygen supply your base begins to take shape. An intercom window pops up: other space drifters saw my station and want to join my effort. Randomized events like this keep things interesting and challenging. Not all encounters are friendly and you need to be ready for intruders - or pay the costs.The building and managing is fun and keeps me entertained: There are some fun ideas in Spacebase DF-9 that I really like. Your base-dwellers for example post about their wants and needs in their social media “Spaceface”, where you can read how they feel and if they are happy with their occupation. The rooms and objects have good ideas that tie into each other: Plants can not only produce food but also oxygen. The food you produce can be brought into the pub for cooking. When fire breaks out you can not only use fire extinguishers but you can also cut off the oxygen supply to a room - though this usually takes longer and damages your equipment.All these ideas and concept sound fun - on paper. In the game however they can get buggy and very frustrating. The power management for example can get very messy as the only data I have is a bunch of colorful lines across your base. I don’t see how much reach a generator has and how much power is being drawn. New derelicts appear out of nowhere that are so close to my base that my building plans are screwed. And several times my crewmembers kill themselves by simply staying in space until their oxygen runs out or not fleeing a empty vessel that runs out of oxygen. This is very frustrating and something that doesn’t feel like its the players fault. The build-queue is also not very clear as my crew builds rooms but just doesn’t make time to build the door that would connect them - ordering them useless.All in all Spacebase DF-9 is a game that had great promise but will never live up to it because bugs ruin the experience. I tried, I spent the time to build a big base and train my crew to fight back an alien invasion - but when the same men later just suffocate by standing in an room without oxygen, I just feel like its not my fault, its the games. And I don’t want to play it any more.			"

												This game has about 1-2 hours of content. Build some items and that's that. There is next to nothing to actually build, no progress tree whatsoever and to counter the lack of content they have just increased the rate of events. Raids or aid arrives basically all the damn time and there is nothing to actually do at all beyond building a few turrets so you're immune to raids. Almost nothing to achieve at all, so you will built at least one of each item the game contains within half an hour. The research is useless, you will be fed up with the game by the time you have researched two or three items, which you cannot even manufacture, they just ""are"". Complete vaporware, do not touch. It looks fancy and has a lot of potential, but don't spend a penny on this until they've actually made a real game out of it. I've played demos that have more content than this. Hell, sneak peeks have more content than this.			"

												This game has so much potential.  Unfortunately, that is all it has.  If I had spent money on this game I would be uspet, however it kind of just ""showed up"" in my inventory one day.  There are several small that are annoying, but the biggest, most game breaking part of the game for me is what happens after about 30 minutes of gameplay; total destruction by bandits.  Regardless of where I build my base or how many defences I have in place, my base is always destroyed by several waves of raiders.  A single wave would be manageable, however, the game seems to think that I have played long enough and sends endless waves, ensuring that nothing can live for more than a few moments after arriving.   This by itself makes the game unbearable.My final thoughts on this game are that this game is dissapointing and someone somewhere should be ashamed.			"

												I quite loved the potential for this game, but in practise it is horribly disapponting!My first playthrough went fine, pretty basic management fare but then a raider showed up and I discovered that the 'security' crew assignments I'd made meant people couldn't last two seconds against the lone raider..Alright then, it was the first go and in tutorial so I can accept an hours play lost and decided to start a new game.First realisation, there was no ""this will erase your data"" or ""do you want to save"" warning. Surprising and not great, but as said, I hadn't planned to anyway so I went ahead with a new real start.My hopes for the game returned, I enjoyed starting anew and building up the base and this time I had a plan for raiders!My plan... reassign every crewmen to security and overwhelm in numbers! XDNot great I know.. but it worked, though highly tiresome to have to remember and reassign everyone back to their old jobs as you can't assign saved positions to default back to.Then of course, things went bad again...I find a derelict ship, so badly laid out it could've been a rushed post-battle vessel from Galaxy Truckers.So of course, I decide to tear everything out as salvage materials.Unknown to me, one crew decided to remove the ships oxegen generator and then the door of another room from the inside.. leaving him stuck and likely gormless, as there was no notification of him being stuck.I'll admit a possibly mistake on my part: Not painstakingly watching and assigning each item removed one at a time, but when I tried that previously the crew had a habit of just heading off to bed or returning to my base for a minute to build some shelves I'd requested another builder to build, before coming back.. which is why this time I just left them to it.Anyway, I found Mr.Gormless and got him to let himself out of the room but before he got any further the oxegen in the ship got too low and it turns out people panic when they realise the oxegen is low (fair enough I'm sure).Unfortunately, this panic was apparently too much to allow the builder to obey my orders to rebuild an oxegen generator.Close to frustration I see my second builder heading over in a space suit to save the day..Unfortunately, Gormlessness is clearly contagious as our superhero stepped out of the airlock, went into a panic himself, rushed back into the airlock and flushed himself into space...So yea, there you have it. My adventures in Spacebase DF-9. I advise you against having any of your own.			"

Early Access Review
								Bearing in mind the game is still early access, DF9 has some great idea's, interesting mechanics and the possibility of becoming something very fun to play. However, it's current lack of depth combined with the developers lack of updates make this a difficult purchase to warrant. I personally feel like the latest updates have ripped idea's directly from Rimworld as well. Nevertheless, it may be one to watch, as there are plenty of interesting ways the game could go. As it stands, it's not worth buying right now, you will get perhaps 1-2 hours of content, and even that is very basic.			"

												This game had huge potential until Double Fine cut it loose and ran off with the money from the early access. It was a decent start to what could've been a great game, but the devs decided to run off with the money and leave us with a half finished pile of garbage. They keep releasing ""patches"" that barely fix any of the problems, lied about all of the insanely cool sounding features that were supposed to be added, and then have the gall to charge $20 for a game that's got about $5 worth of content in it.This game could've been another colossal hit for DF, but instead it turned into a colossal mess. Don't buy it. Pirate a copy if you have to play it, but don't bother buying it. DF doesn't deserve another cent for this train wreck.			"

												For shame, Double Fine. After Psychonauts I was thrilled to see this release. But after your decision to take your money and tell us all 'Oh-well, so sad'... That was some truly cutthroat business. Sadly, your managers will probably go on to make similar decisions, but it's your name they dragged through the mud, and I will never purchase another Double Fine title.The game had promise, but the bugs make it practically unplayable. There's no real way to stop rampaging citizens, as the jail system doesnt seem to do anything about their attitudes. Wounded people will lie around on the ground because the Medics cant be directed to go to them and will instead carry on about their daily lives, meanwhile everyone takes a morale hit. Would have been fun, but as you can see from the nosedive in reputation the game has taken, ""would have been"" doesnt sell games.			"

												This game is fun, I really enjoy it. This game also has a large amount of game-breaking bugs, which are not fun and will kill everyone in your base. Sadly now that it is officially released these will probably not be fixed.Things to enjoy: SPAAAAAAAACE. Also base building, planning, and generally keeping everybody happy, fed, and safe.Things to hate: Terrible AI. This includes having all your technicians/Miners/Scientists/etc go to a raider ship to pick up an item they want... and then being killed by raiders. It's like watching lemmings. Speaking of raiders, they have a tendency to outmatch even the toughest of 5v1 battles with your security forces. Other things to look out for are Builders bothering to install some more flooring, taking a break, and then suffocating to death because they forgot to build some air recyclers before taking said break.What this game needs: Able to queue up actions, or prioritize building. Being able to tell your citizens to STAY AWAY from scary people in scary spaceships. Or fires. Or vacuums. Theres a lot of room for both necessary, and quality of life AI improvements. Theres a lot of work put into this game, and I happen to think it's fun, but it is clearly not finished yet.			"

								Perhaps, half a prototype.I'm not upset that I spent the money on this, and I feel I payed for an adequate amount for playing what content there was to play--but I wouldn't recommend the game with the content that is going to be called a 1.0 release. Putting aside what was promised that didn't make it into the game, what's currently there will only get you a few hours in, before you're wondering what there is left to do.It has a few clever ideas in there, and there is a very lovely amount of polish to the product--which is why it seems like such a waste.I wish DoubleFine the best of luck for their other projects.

												This game concept sounded awesome and the graphics look nice enough to rope me into paying $20 when it was in alpha. It was pretty bad and lacked a ton of features. Now that they have moved out of the alpha stage this game is still really hard to play and lackes most of the features that made it interesting.  Not being able to control a persons queue is agravating to no end. The AI is horrible. Normally what happens is I play for 2 hours until everyone in my base gets locked up some how. Either an incopasitated bartender cant serve a security officer and technitian waiting at the bar and those people are stuck their forever. Then a raider comes in and kills everyone while my maininary is slowly destroyed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS NOT FINISHED AND NEVER WILL BE.			"

Make sure not to buy early access from these devs on future titles, since they abandoned this one to toss out another one. Its hard to believe the same company made Psychonauts, but that was a decade ago so it might be all new people working there or new ownership. This game looked like it would be pretty cool, so I bought it early on. They scraped together a few last minute patches when everyone was complaining, but they didn't implement any of the missing features.			"

The amount of bugs, flaws, and outright dumb features leave the player wondering if they're actually playing a game, or watching a bad episode of Star Trek: Deep Space-Nine.If it's on another humble-bundle sale, think about asking someone with a lot of money to buy if for you.But not for $20.

												Unfinished, abandoned game. Devs did a quick cash grab by putting the game on sale a week before announcing they would stop production and release the game as was. Which was an alpha 6 stage. They went from alpha to release and never even patched it again. They actually expected the game to be fully funded on Early Access alone and tried to treat it like a normal release. Meaning they had an overhead of thousands of dollars. A completely unrealistic way of making and funding a game, by a developer that really does not care about their customers.I will NEVER buy Double Fine games again. They are the lowest of the low when it comes to money hungry developers.Update: Turns out I eventually did buy another DF game: Massive Chalice. DF seems to have learned from their past indiscretions and I am not someone to pass up a good game just because reasons. They also patched Iron Brigade as soon as they regained control from Microsoft who was apparently hogging the game. DF is making some steps that are actually restoring my faith in the company, a bit. It's something.This is not to say you should ever buy Spacebace|DF9 because this one is beyond repair. ;)			"

												To me, somewhat enjoyable I play it from time to time when I am extremely bored. However there are lots of fustrating issues with it. Prioritization of work is non-existant (ex. running out of air, so I put plans on building more air recyclers, but builders instead were chatting, eating, and sleeping and did not get to it for a LONG time). Combat/action pretty boring and worthless, takes security like 10 shots (mostly missing) to kill a raider. Bugs everywhere. Base location unbalanced (basically, some locations have lots of matter to harvest, or barely anything. Nonstop citizen ships/raiders practically everywhere. Just a few examples). AI pretty pathetic. Basically, a lot more Cons than Pros. I wish that the devs would improve on these issues to make a more enjoyable and exciting game, but it seems that they washed their hands on this product. This could be an amazing game if they get updating and fixing it.			"

												This game has cute points, but overall it is too shallow to be worth the price. Some examples: You mine ""Matter"" which you use to build stuff. There are no different types or ores, or complex manufacturing steps. You have two basic paths to feed your colonists: Matter replicators to start with, or a mini-production chain with botanists growing plants which are served by bartenders. A simplistic research chain. There are several types of rooms, but each has just a few types of furnishings. The whole thing is just --- I guess superficial is the word I am looking for.I started playing during Alpha-3, and through it had a promising beginning. Unfortunately, what I thought was a concept outline which would have a lot more stuff added to it turned out to be it. Space-sim lite. Not an awful game, but no where near worth the asking price.

Early Access Review
								Here's a game that had great potential. Then, after alpha 6, the developers suddenly decided to skip beta, fix the remaining bugs and call it 1.0 and let imaginary coders from the community finish the game by releasing the source code. They'll still take your money, though, thankyouverymuch.In its current state, the game is bug-ridden, which is understandable since it is (was) still in development, and you'll be lucky if you can play for more than a couple of hours before you encounter a game-breaking bug.When/if said bugs get fixed in ""1.0"", you'll get a bug free empty shell of what could have been a great simulation game. It'll be fun for a while and then you'll realize most of the advertised content and features have never been implemented.There are probably some valid reasons why Double Fine chose to abandon this game, but in the end, it also means that they chose to let down everyone who chipped in to help funding its development. Not a very nice thing to do.TLDR: Don't waste your money, there are many good simulation games out there that have actually been finished.			"

								The developer recently announced that they're dropping this game - they're putting out a ""1.0"" version straight from the most recent alpha, with no beta and very little content. Promising early access project, but if what's in there now is all we're getting, definitely not worth $25. If you see it on a Steam sale for $5, it's worth that; got a couple hours of fun in it and that's about it.			"

When I bought this game 3 years ago, I thought I would be participating in helping out won of my former favorite developers Double Fine, the makers of greats such as Psychonauts and Costume Quest. I wanted to love this game when it came out, and it showed alot of promise. But unfortunatly it has been abandoned, and the developers have released games since. I never expected a kick in the balls like this from Double Fine, honestly makes me sad.			"

												Game is not finished, its one of those abandoned early access games that went way over budget and then was never finished. This is of course always a risk with early access games and fair enough; however it is beyond med how it can now be sold as a finished game. Im very disapointed that I bought what was sold as a completed product only to  realise its abandonware in alpha. It should have some kind of big warning stickers on the store page or something. Of course it feels a bit worse due to the huge potential of the game. It feels like the beginnings on a really good, modern take on old classics and I really want to love it. But it really does need a LOT more polishing and bugfixing to be called a full game. TLDR; Its a scam - alpha game sold as finished product.			"

Almost like it was designed to be pay to play... but they forgot to add anything to pay for to make it fun.Although this has promise and I got it free I would not recommend it at all.It's as though nobody on the dev team st Double Fine actually played this game for more than 30mins. After the first few minutes it just becomes frustrating and annoying. Examples: - 7 botanists, all in one small Garden zone totally ignoring two other large zones. Game tells me I need more botanists. - 15 technicians (meant to repair stuff), EVERYTHING is sparking blowing up and not getting fully repaired. The only way to fix this is the reclaim the damaged equipment and build it again. This is totally STUPID. Game tells me I need more Technicians. - Sometimes people flip out which is fine, but assigning security to them, trying to cuff them, nothing works. They will destroy half your base, kill as many crew as they can and then eventually hopefully be subdued but some passing person as your whole security team run around them doing nothing. - Invincible aliens that wipe out your crew, eventually your security team turn up one by one and get killed off. Restart game. - Space debris damages a reactor and take out the power, nobody repairs it, builders take ages to get to it to reclaim it, will not build a new one as they are freaking out about oxygen. Restart game. - 7 member security team wiped out down to the last man by raiders. All 5 stars. - More raiders straight away. Restart game. - Give the hell up and go back to a decent game.Play this if you want a lesson in total frustration and how to never ""finish"" a game.			"

I was hoping for an elaborate technology tree, more interesting characters and a cool space-adventure feeling.Although I haven't played very long, Spacebase is a game that feels somewhat empty from the very beginning and graphicly very neutral. You would think a game with alien creatures could be much more funky as Back to the Futures' 2015 vision. There were good ideas put into this game, but it's definitely not finished.			"

												I purchased during the very early days after it was released on Steam and I did truly enjoy the game back then even with its terrible game breaking bugs. Every update added new features that made it both easier to play and easier to get everyone on your entire base dead within minutes.  I still see a single raider take out 5 of my level 3+ security staff and also win several matches of fisticuffs with civvies... what the F..? Also, the AI is strange... SO stange! And possibly sociopathic... with not so subtle rage issues... and a long line of family mental health problems... Someone will freak over something, probably quickly, and go around smashing half of the base until someone else smashes them in the face enough times that they pass out.  If your unlucky, which you usually are, they will have trashed your oxygen recyclers and no one will repair them before the levels get low enough that everyone runs around like chickens with their heads cut off until they asphyxiate instead of solving the issue like a boss.  Sorry, that got dark.Unfortunately in its broken, unfinished, never to be finished state I cannot recommend this game.  If it goes on sale for $1 or something similar depending on your region it may be nice to pick up to see how good the game could have been eventually, when it was properly finished, but that is just about it.

												Game is incomplete and devs ditched it. They wanted to do the Minecraft-style development where they keep improving the game and people keep buying it as they add more and more, but they had a barely-functioning skeleton of the game, not enough people bought it to justify them continuing, so they shut it down. That's just pathetic behaviour. Small indie studios get crucified for that kind of thing, let alone a bigger established studio like DoubleFine. As a bonus they put it on a big steam sale a week before announcing the end of development, just so new buyers felt extra shafted. They tried to buy some goodwill back by giving purchasers a free copy of Hack n Slash, as well as by putting out tools for modders and asking the community to finish the game for them(!), but buyer beware. This game was halted a brief way into development and never even remotely came close to being a releasable product. If Broken Age's double-kickstarter shenanigans weren't enough, this is proof that DF cannot be trusted with early access. Just stay well away.			"

												Before I start. Isn't it a bit disgusting that Double Fine is the curator for their own project? Anyway it's a bare bones Space Building game in the vane of Dungeon Keeper, Theme Hospital and Startopia. You build stuff and people rather stupidly suffocate in Space because you can't give people a slight nudge in the right direction to avoid their terrible deaths. The AI is very stupid, and the Building is a very bare. Worse yet is how much DF are asking for, while it's not quite the price of a AAA title, it's by no means cheap either which is yet again is another reason to be critical because what you're buying doesn't add up to £20/$30 worth of content. And to add salt to a fatal wound? DF have decided to just straight up ignore Beta stage and release the game into 1.0, that's right a full version from Alpha where there's been a startling lack of updates throughout it's year of development. Poor show.After the jump into V1.0, my impressions are still disappointing. The game is not fun to play, the citizens now know how to not suffocate stupidly but their prioties are extremely messed up. The UI is counter intuitive and really clumsy and hideous as a result, the game is unimpressive visually and you'll find that the game doesn't do enough to hold your attention. This is further signs that money should not be given to DoubleFine, a company who do not deliver on their promises.			"

												At first I liked the game very much, but then I started running into bugs and not the smartest AI.  Be warned, it is not a finished game yet, so you will run into problems from time to time. Even with bugs, I did enjoy my time with this space station simulator of sorts. Since most users are looking for a finished game I unfortunately cannot recommend this game.			"

												Was hoping the playerbase would be able to make the game more enjoyable with mods after the devs bailed and launched their pre-alpha as a full release.  I was wrong, it's still lacking in content and the AI is still suicidal.  Get used to watching your crew asphyxiate while hanging out right by the airlock, as this will occur quite frequently.  After trying multiple times to try and get into the game then not being able to get past 30 minutes of gameplay, I can say this game isn't even worth $1 on a steam sale.			"

												This game has a nice concept. But it is currently lacking many ideas first planed for it.In fact, despite it being version 1.***, this is not a finished product at all.This is still very buggy, with the PNJs often being stuck somewhere or stupidly stacking in a room with no oxygen, and dying for no reason.I don't recommend buying it, not before a good bunch of patches, and hopefully some future mod.Excuse my english.

Early Access Review
								This game is kind of like Dwarf Fortress in space, a little simulator where you design rooms and manage the roster for your space station.  You don't control the citizens directly, but instead you put down work orders, and the citizens will handle it on their own.  You sketch out rooms and order furniture and so on and your citizens place it.The first few mintues of the game were a lot of fun for me.  You're kicked out of your life support pod drifting in deep space and have to build a little self sustaining environment with an airlock and some life support systems before your citizens run out of air (about 5 mins).  This was an encouraging first glance for me, because it's pretty hard and will probably require a few resets if you don't know what you're doing, and the systems seemed interesting and complex.  Eventually, though, I figured it out and started branching out, putting up a refinery to allow my miners to mine nearby asteroids, using the materials to build a residence and a bar and a garden and a lab and stock it with furniture.And then the game ended.I don't mean it dumped me to a ""game over"" screen or anything, there just wasn't anything left to do.  Once you've got a half dozen rooms down and functioning, which takes maybe an hour, there's nothing else you can do except wait for your science team to sloooooowly research some unnesescary upgrades, or maybe have your security team scrap with some raiders (note that this isn't an RTS, combat in this game is just a matter of setting a point for your security team to defend and maybe they will if they're not on break or hungry or tired or sad).  Sometimes a derelict will show up and you can... well, tear it down, nothing else to do with them really.If you've ever played Dwarf Fortress, basically imagine that game but with no workshops.  You can make rooms and designate areas and place furniture, but there's no crafting system, no economy, no trade, resources are all boiled down to a single currency which is used to buy everything from walls to furniture.  The game just has no depth at all, and it's competing with some of the most complex and deepest simulations on the market right now.The devs seem to have responded to this by ramping up the challenge, which makes things a bit frustrating.  Colonies can die from parasites before you get a doctor, waves of raiders can annihilate an underequipped security force, and once things start to fail, it's pretty much a chain reaction to an abandoned base.  Colonists freak out and refuse to do their jobs so vital equipment isn't maintained or repaired so colonists freak out even harder and things just spiral downward.  For example, if the air supply gets low, colonists will freak out rather than do their jobs, so if the area with the life support systems has air problems, you can't ever fix it because whoever goes in there is going to panic instead of fixing the air generator, and the problems get worse.  And this doesn't really do much to fix the problem with the game being short, because once you've got whatever it is you need to counter them, then they're not that big a deal.  The 1.0 update added a lot of nice features, but the game still has serious issues with longevity.  There are still occasional glitches with draw order and some AI issues, but the game works pretty well mostly.  I've only played a bit, but pathing does seem improved and the interface does make things clearer now.I don't want to sound excessively negative, this isn't the worst game ever.  I had a lot of fun with it.  It's just really short, and the asking price is kind of high.  On sale, for $5, I'd say this is a good deal.  At full price, I don't think it's worth it.  I'd recommend looking at something like Startopia or Space Colony or grabbing something like Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress if you're not in love with the sci-fi aesthetic.  All of these games are cheaper, deeper, and more fun in the long term than DF-9.			"

												Here, I made an analogy of this whole situation for you:What they've basically done is told people about a wonderful mansion they were planning on building for everybody; it would have a waterfall, and monkey butlers, and regular butlers too. If you want to get in on this; drop us some money! You can watch the work come along!Except, it turns out, they basically have about two walls, and maybe a bit of tarp stretched over a corner or something. Not exactly inspiring stuff; so uh, they're having trouble getting any more people interested in it. Time to cut it there, they figured, we've made some money on this; let's wrap this up before we invest any more money into it. It turns out they were only planning on building a mansion. Planning! Obviously what we meant by that and what you thought were different things. Our apologies.But no worries! You have full use of the two walls and tarp. We never got around to adding plumbing, though, or electricity. Also, there's this hobo who keeps trying to shiv people. Finally, uh, the site is contaminated by deadly radon gas, (interesting, because there isn't even a basement) and some of you may have progressive pulmonary fibrosis.We'll leave a few nails and boards around, if someone wants to improve on things, though. Also, the president of the company is just as bummed about this as you guys are, except not really, because he's got a bit more money out of this deal!Bottom line: This company has made some good games in the past, but not recently. Early access might work with small studios, but when you've got 60 plus people to support, it doesn't seem as financially viable... Especially when you repay the investors with the early access sales, before the game's even released!I accept this risk for early access games, but this is the first time I came across a situation quite like this one. I was treating DF by the reputation they had built long ago, not by what they are now. Double Fine? More like Doesn't Finish! or, uh, Don't Fund, or whatever. Boo this company! Boooo!			"

												Look, I love this game, it's very unique, and I'm still giving it a thumbs down, here's why;1. AI occasionally breaks, leaves the game unplayable2. Buggy3. There is only like 20-30 placables from start, and to unlock more you have to research which takes forever, and can be expensive4. When citizens die they drop stuff on the ground, and that stuff, almost never disappears or is picked up.5. Devastating to lose everything (Just save A LOT to avoid this.)So there ya have it. Those are my top five reasons I'm leaving this dislike, I love this game. Love it. It will always have a special place in my heart, BUT unless you're willing to put up with these, like I was,  then this is a no buy. Or if its on sale, its a great buy to play for a couple of hour, but I don't think I'll ever reach 48+ hours on this game.			"

												This game is probably the most notorious vaporware game in Steam history. The developers at Doublefine were on a roll with a great game, and out of nowhere cancelled the project without finishing the game due to funding issues. Not to mention they didn't even open up Steam workshop support so Steam users could finish it for them. The worst part is that it was a fun game a couple versions before Doublefine abandoned the project. However, when they abandoned the project they released a final patch that sends swarms of raiders to attack your base so frequently you can't build, and your citizens are constantly sad or angry. It's unplayable now because you can't send your citizens outside your base to build,mine,explore,etc without them being killed. And I'll point out that this is in the Extremely Low threat areas of the galaxy map. To me this seems like a final insult to all of the people who paid good money for what was a good game. I for one will never purchase anything from Doublefine again, and I can't see how this could fix their ""funding"" issues because the PR nightmare of this game has killed their reputation. My recommendation to Doublefine is to reopen this project and satisfy their customers, as it's the only way they will save their company. My recommendation to anyone thinking of purchasing this game in it's current state, is don't!			"

Spacebase DF-9 is a casual building sim-tycoon game. You are put in charge of a few colonists to build, maintain and protect your own space station.Pros: The game is easy to pick up on: you start with a power source, minerals and a handful of colonists whose first priority is to build a modest space station with oxygen supplies, and expand to a small variety of room types while mining and refining minerals. As your crew grows and time passes, additional needs will surface, needs that you must address or risk your crew to lose its temper. Derelict ships and additional travelers will want to join, some whether you like it or not, and you must deal with meteor showers, raiders and other threats, all the while researching better equipment.Cons: There is a severe lack of variety in every way: Only a couple of room types with very little content or options, while general furniture offers a scarce selection. Travelers will often discard your rejection, and you quickly become over-populated. You barely have any control over crew morale. The game become repetitive as you are constantly facing the same issues: need more resource or oxygen/power, raiders come over to kill some of your crew, crew member goes berserk, rinse & repeat. Even tech research is rather limited.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itSpacebase DF-9 drops the ball. While not a bad game, it had the potential of being the next Space Colony, but doesn't come even close. Games of this genre require variety to make it interesting to build and grow, and this game doesn't have what it takes to give it the replay value it would need.P.S.: I do not recommend this game as it is offered on Steam. There is, however, a dedicated team of developers at http://spacebasehub.net who have taken it upon themselves to enhance the game and its content. There is still a long way to go, but should the game's potential actually come to fruition, my opinion of the game could change.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Ignore the part of this game being unfinished and abandoned, despite that it was fun.Now, there is a game breaking bug, where airlocks are awful. Sometimes, when a person steps near an airlock then can break it essentially and whoever was trying to get in will slowly die to asphyxiation, THEN you have lazy builders not finishing the airlock so you'll die before you even got started. I restarted five times, and nothing, nothing works.I don't know what they did, but after the last 'major' update they broke the game, when I tried using my old base, everything was broken, my reactors, my production, everything.This was my first base builder game and I loved it, then, double fine did something wrong and broke it, I don't know what they did, but they broke it.This game needs a way to revert back to an older version so I can play this again, the only thing you got out of this game if you got it early on was a free crappy game to go with your payed game that was broken.Don't let this discourage you from buying other doublefine games. This one in particular however, was something good, before they broke it.			"

												Okay, I got this in a Humble Bundle or bundled Steam sale or something. Gave it a try last night.It's not that it's a bad game. It's that it's... disappointing. There are clever mechanics and clever concepts going on, art I found charming, but it's clear that it's just unfinished. I don't know the whole history with this game. I see other reviews talking about a Kickstarter and broken promises from Double Fine. I don't know about all that. What I can tell you is that this game has SO MUCH potential but never lives up to it. So many little things about this game hint at a larger story, at a more in-depth gameplay, at a game that could be but isn't. If someone could take the concepts of this game, with a living crew to manage and a procedural storytelling system and an expansive sandboxy space construction system, and actually FINISH it, it could easily be one of my favorite games.I want to like this game. I really do. But it's just not finished, and from what I'm reading in other reviews, never will be.Sad I will never get the Star Trek Deep Space Nine simulator that I was hoping for.			"

Early Access Review
								This game was billed as Dwarf Fortress in space. It might have been just that, had it not been developed by Double Fine.Unfortunately, Tim Schafer thinks that Early Access exists to test the waters rather than to operate as a platform for developers without solid capital. They honestly wanted to develop this game for 5 years. 5 years. And Tim says since the game isn't bringing in enough money on early access that they're going to have to push it out as 1.0 with most of the features on the devplan unfinished.So Tim honestly thought that they were going to make profit on an unfinished game for five years. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the CEO of Double Fine. That's the man that couldn't finish a point and click adventure for 3.3 million.I've got some advice for you, Tim. And it comes from Gabe Newell.""Do not focus on anyone but your customers. Your reputation will follow you forever so always be fair to your customers, and certainly one thing you need to always remember is that your customers are not going to be fooled. Some people think they can get away with something and just hope people won't see through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The internet is way smarter than any of us.""You've been exchanging your reputation as a game developer in for cash, and given your recent default on Spacebase DF-9 it is with regret that I must inform you that we, the gaming community and responsible consumers, can no longer extend your line of credit.The next time you want to build a game, like oh, say, Dear Leader, don't come to the community with your hand stuck out and nothing for collateral but promises.I feel bad for the people who worked on this game. Who wanted it to be something more only to have its legs cut out from under it because it wasn't a profitable Early Access game. To be honest, the updates were too far apart. Of course no one was buying it. It took too long to see progress, and your behavior and glibness on Twitter and other formats has been intolerable.Sorry, Tim. You can't ride the success of Psychonauts, Day of the Tentacle, and Full Throttle forever. You could have been one of the greats, but instead you're going to end up like John Romero. Only John only screwed his fanbase over once, while you seem determined to make it the remainder of your career.Do not purchase this game. Do not purchase Dear Leader, an Amnesia Fortnight winner like Spacebase DF-9. Do not buy Costume Quest 2. If Tim Schafer comes onto Kickstarter and is like, ""Hey, Psychonauts 2 - I need cash."" Do not give him money. Double Fine cannot manage its finances, and has abused a system that was put here to help unestablished developers as a way to decide whether they should bother to finish a game based upon its profitability before launch.

								When I bought the game I figured I'd love the vast base-building. I'd hoped it would resemble something like Prison Architect, and to an extent; Banished. But it seems more appropriate to say it's like Age Of Empires, as, with limited build time, I'm forced to hapazardly prepare for an attack from raiders, parasites, or one of my own crew. Taking into account this was in the easiest area of the game I could find.After multiple restarts (I've barely played a single playthrough for more than 30 minutes), I gave up. This kind of game could steal hundreds of hours from me, but with the trouble I'm having constructing a fuctioning populace, and a decent-looking spacebase, that's not going to happen.			"

												Do not buy this game.I bought into it early on, trusting and respecting Double Fine as I enjoyed many previous games from them and I enjoy games like this so I decided to support the project.It was developed reasonably well from that point, up until recently. See they did not finish it.  Nor will they.  They decided to abandon the game in an unfinished state and push the code out and hope some modders are awesome enough to finish it for them.Not only did this ruin the potential I felt this game had but it has ruined me on double fine.  I will no longer make purchases if it has their name attached. This game is a very early state, it is unfinished but they are calling it version 1 and walking away.Do not buy under any circumstances. Sorry double fine, but your handling of this has just poisoned you in my eyes.  I used to love your stuff but I refuse to let this pass.  Maybe in future if I catch wind of you updating this game in major ways like you were meant to I will give it another chance since I already own it but as it stands you guys lost a customer.

												Stay away from this game!I purchased it when it was in Early Access and thought it showed promise.  I would revisit it ever 6 months to a year to see if anything had been updated.  For the first year or so there were updates to mechanics but not many bug fixes.  After that progress started to slow and I held off on playing till they got more of the major playability issues taken care of.  I downloaded it again recently only to find that the developers had put a rush patch out a couple years ago and called the game done.  The game by no means is done.  It is in almost the same state as when I purchased it years and years ago.  Their website and Wiki are the only pages left up as well.  The Blog and Wiki seem to have been deleted entirely which suggests Double Fine are trying to bury this.  The sad thing is they still have my money.			"

Given that so many people complain about the base game, I'm reviewing the patched version.Its not great. The UI is clunky, its difficult to figure out what you need to do in the tutorial level to a certain degree. I lost a guy in a derelict spaceship cause one of the survivors stole his space suit.So sorry mod makers, I'm sure the mod fixes many of the game's problems, but if something is that bad to begin with, you're not gonna be able to fix it that easily.

												I bought this game a few years ago for $30 when it was still in early access. Thirty dollars might as well have been burned. Don't get me wrong, I like this game, and I think it could have been so much more than what it is. In terms of gameplay, it's decent. There's lots of options for zoning, wacky randomly generated names, and a unique art style. But it's obvious that the game's been abandoned by double fine. There hasn't been a major update (or even an update at all, correct me if I'm wrong) in who knows how long. Then there's balance. When I first played this, I was extremely frustrated with the raiding and pirating system. There was really no correlation between base level and defense systems and the difficulty of any enemies. Seriously, you know no effort has been put into balance when you have 2 entirely unrelated raider boarding parties entering your base when you're barely 10 minutes into the game.In terms of replay value, I struggle to find any.In conclusion, I think this game is a bit of a lost cause. It had potential, but it was thwarted by bugs, balance, and lazy devs. It's a shame, really. I recommend taking a look at Prison Architect if you still want a game similar to this, but far more in depth and absolutely worth the price.			"

												Lets see, the first time i loaded up the game i decided to run the tutorial. I was greated by roughly 100 frames of intro (please keep in mind these 100 frames were spread over 20 seconds or so). So i turn my graphics setting all the way down, ditch the second monitor and lower my screen resolution as low and the game allows. Well I can now move fairly unhindered. Go through the tutorial up until I have to fight 10 ish enemies. imediately my frames drop to 10 or so. I have a mid range PC that runs pretty much every game i have in at least a playable fashion (IE ARK and Squad), however this unoptomized POS can barely pull 10 frames?F**K it, me and some friends already have bought and installed the POS so lets try it out. After about 15 minutes of loading screens were finally into the game, well 3 out of the 4 of us. So another 10 minutes go by while they restart and load into our game. Alright lets rock n roll! To be fair the gameplay is pretty decent and it definitely is what i was expecting. That being said there's a solid chance your gonna get dropped from the game mid session, or want to play with some weapons that were in the beta but removed from the actual release for umm idk a reason i guess. The game has so many glitches i can't even recall them all. Our favorite of which is when you interface with a door and afterwards cant use any of your buttons besides movement. This can be solved by running(you know without actually running cause the sprint button doesn't work) over to a door and interacting with it again. Some times it seemed to just happen randomly. Once we were running two auto Cannons and both just happen to get glitched for no apparent reason what so ever. Pretty legit.All in all not that bad if you enjoy 5 frames, of unoptomized graphics from the 90's, a second while not being able to use your weapons after spending 15-20 minutes of time in loadings screens. But hey its a 40k game!The emporer protect anyone who buys this.			"

								Double Fine is abandoning development of the game once they have rushed it up to a 1.0 release version. They will continue to make bugfixes and support the game, but they will not add any more content The game as it stands now in Alpha 6 is very bare bones in of terms of content, ♥♥♥♥ing minecraft is more complete than this.  I haven't played through all the game's content yet, since I've been busy catching up on my backlog of games, but rest assured in that it seems most people have played through all the game offers within a couple hours. Double Fine expects modders to make up for the lack of content, since they can't be bothered to add it themselves, while still charging $25 that could be spent towards a more solid, longer lasting, and ultimately more entertaining game.

												Nice try ... but not finished.Playing sims/strategy/rpg genre quite often my expectations of this game have been too high.It has a nice setup how you interact with your crew, fulfill their demands, but dies under too many random factors. For example, the perfect bartender has as psych attribute ""quiet"" and ""shy"". It is not funny and will lead unexperienced player straight to a loss.The ""morale"" system is very raw. People will get happy when you built many small rooms filled with monitor/plants. That means long hallways and big rooms are game breaking. You will lose every time cause of low morale. A drawback of many small rooms is the micromanagement in case of emergencies. I do love their humor ... A chicken alien beat up a human who was eating because he thought the chicken legs have been from his race/planet.Conclusio ... Play Dwarf Fortress ....  It free but not that fancy and includes all the things Double Fine wanted to realize but didn't finish.			"

								This ""game"" is basically unplayable because you can't control the people in any direct way, and they're too stupid to do anything right. Also everything is broken far beyond the usual early access glitches.EDIT: well I guess now they want to release the game without adding any of the features it should have had and still with worthless ai. They could have at least added micro-management so that we could make up for the ai issues, but NOPE.			"

								Full disclosure: I had fun in the ~30 hours I spent on various Alpha builds, but it is by no means a complete game. It's pretty, and looks promising, but is ultimately shallow and lacks replayability.With Doublefine's decision to go straight from Alpha 6 to 1.0, I don't think I can recommend this game to anyone at it's current pricepoint. Save your money and wait for a 90% off sale if you're at all interested in it. $2.50 is about the right price for the features this game will ship with.			"

 GeneralFor what little it is now worth, I did enjoy playing the game and exploring the changes in each new Alpha update. This game had a lot of potential and was very exciting. With gorgeous artwork, a decent attempt at UI design, atmospheric music, and an absolutely delightful sense of humour, all of which contributed to an interesting universe of different species and way of life. But the fact remains that this game was abandoned, never finished properly, and at the time of writing can not be considered a complete game.They did go in and include a tutorial for the game, and I was very impressed with the tutorial until it suddenly ended. Although it felt like it ended abruptly and too soon, I can see why they did limit the information provided. If they don’t leave you to figure out the other rooms and the way the spacebase generally functions then you would have played all there is to play of this game in the tutorial. Ultimately the tutorial just seems to highlight the lack of depth to the game.Spacebase has a rocky history so far, and I feel I really must include a discussion of this so that you can make an informed decision. However, as you will see with the format of my reviews, there are plenty of sections which allow me to consider the game for itself regardless of the surrounding drama.In the interests of full disclosure: I was an early access purchaser, and yeah, I did get burned with this game. My experience with Spacebase truly set my mind to never buy an early access game ever again, no matter how wonderful it looks and tempting it seems. Nothing is a sure bet, and I will only be spending my money on finished products from now on. I can accept that I took a risk by purchasing an EA game and that it did not pan out in this case, but the end result is still a bad experience with Spacebase and Double Fine by extension. Things did get very dramatic, but I don’t think the company did a very good job of handling things. I’m not going to go on about it, so suffice it to say that I’m not an admirer of Double Fine any more. If you want more information regarding the drama I refer to, please check out TotalBiscuit’s discussion on the subject.GameplayThis is a base building game. You build a space station from basic building blocks (floors and walls) and zone different rooms. You fill those rooms with things like oxygen tanks, plants, beds, exercise equipment, tables, food, defence turrets, fire extinguishers, science labs, and matter converters. Mine asteroids to refine into matter, the basic building block/currency of the game in order to build everything else.There isn’t exactly a tech tree to this game, and there aren’t any crafting recipes (although there is scientific research). It seems to be more about the simulation of how people interact with one another, but there are so many characters that join your base that it’s impossible to really follow many interactions in a very meaningful way. So I end up concentrating on building the base and trying to see just how big I can make it. Once you get a vast crew though, things start lagging up and the bugs start to get obvious. Ultimately you will find that there is an imposed limit on how big a base you can create and keep running not by design, but because (I'm afraid I must repeat) this game wasn't really completed.I really desperately wish that there was a blueprint function (like in prison architect) so that one could plan their base out before starting construction.ControlsAlthough you can use the mouse to do everything, there are thankfully plenty of hotkeys. Some of them aren’t as intuitive as I might like, but I got used to them over the course of many hours of play. I found the camera controls to be fairly good, with my most appreciated camera functionality being the ability to pan around. It’s also always a plus to have a simple pause/start button to hit, which is good old spacebar.StorylineI can’t say there is much of a storyline. I think the original intention for the game was to immerse yourself in the lives of the different people on the base and sort of imagine your own story. However, there isn’t sufficient depth and breadth to the rest of the game to allow you to direct any sort of imaginary storyline. It was an interesting concept which didn’t really get developed or thought through well enough.SoundI really like the sound in this game. The music is quite atmospheric (appropriate to the universe they created) and interesting to listen to. It may get repetitive after a while, but it is more like it fades into the background of your awareness rather than becoming irritating. Meanwhile, the sound effects are pretty much functional, nothing much to warrant remark.GraphicsThe artwork in this game is really very good. It’s certainly got a specific style to it, however that style is stuck to throughout and that consistency helps to establish a weird and wonderful universe. I really only have good things to say about the graphics, it’s a shame that all this creative work is now trapped in the wrapper of the rest of the game. Alas.Pros+ huge potential, great concept+ easy to read and navigate the UI+ gorgeous artwork+ interesting universeCons- EA = Early Abandonment- an unfinished game- no real end goal- not enough depth to make it a decent sandbox- still rather buggyHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

												Started playing this game, having startopia and other similar games in mind… it could have been a great game but it somehow misses the motivational part. If you enjoy building something next to an angry toddler who destroys all your work randomly… then this mightbe a game for you. I've played it some hours now and found it quite frustrating. Even in the supposedly easier parts of the galaxy you can barely construct a base, at one point the game starts to throws masive waves of raiders - way more than the population of your base - against you. Just after you barely survived a couple of killerbots arrive. This might be something to handle and to enjoy if the games worked as intended. But you only have one ""security"" beacon (but probably about 6 differend intrusin locations) and if you are lucky the citizens respect the emergency alarms and the security comes to the beacon. one by one. to get slaughtered. But about half of the time they don't do anything when they arrive at the beacon. There are construction bugs and fire extinguishing things as well.After all, it is hard to actually have fun playing this game.			"

 I want to rate this game well I really do but I simply can't at the moment  I have had it before where I have made a great base and all has ended well and that feels great but its getting to that point that makes me want to scream in frustration. The AI in this game to put it simply is suicidal. In my latest playthrough a raider has calmly floated outside my base and shot my miners. I think wait I put a beacon on him why did my security force do nothing? They got stuck in the airlock. They were in there so long I had to build a second airlock in order to save a small building team I had working outside. On numerous occasions I have had builders who were working on unfinished rooms in space simply take off their space suit and die from a lack of oxygen. Normally in a game like this I think well its an early access game give it the benefit of the doubt it will be fixed it may even turn out to be as good a prison architect  'Double Fine Productions is releasing a final version of Spacebase DF-9 next month, the studio announced last week. The decision brings an end to the studio's plan to continuously expand the game over a few years' Yep the devs at Double Fine abandoned it. The concept seems really cool to me its just so frustrating I can't recommend it			"

Early Access Review
								Spacebase DF-9 is a fun little rogue-like Dwarf-Fortress-ish game where you build and control a base in space, while fighting off potential invaders. It is a good-looking game filled with potential that is never quite realized and, in the end, it eventually feels very shallow.It's easy to recommend Spacebase as an amusing little distraction, but not as an in-depth game of strategy or exploration. Unfortunately, it is in a price-range that demands far more of it. I can not recommend this game at or anywhere near its full price of $25 USD. There are numerous similar titles out there that are only a few bucks or even completely free that accomplish far more.Pretty, but empty. "

								Since the original Early Access, barely any features have been added, and updates were months apart. The game is far from complete (and even further from what was promised), even though DoubleFine seems to think it will be from just adding a tutorial, wrap up the major bugs, and calling it ""1.0"".DF continues to look highly mismanaged, especially financially. E.g. Broken Age was supposed to work with $400k funding. They got six times that and still they ""ran out of money"" and had to release what they had as ""Act 1"" (i.e. ""Incomplete game, part 1"").This was the last time I trusted DF to make a good game with my money. The only time DF is getting any money from me is if they've actually released the game with all its features, and even then I'll think twice if there's nothing better I can do with my money. Like lighting it on fire. I get more enjoyment out of watching a brief flame than playing this husk of a dream of a game.			"

												SDF9 is not very amazing at all. In the past I've held Double Fine in somewhat of a high regard, but this game just isn't very good at all, for a multitude of reasons.Namely, it is unfinished. It is abandonware. And yet DF have the gall to keep selling it. On top of this, there are people making mods in order to fix the game. This should not be necessary, and sends red flags from the get go.Playing some of the game you immediately see that it has a very unfinished feel:The controls are rather clunky, and there are quite a few problems with the graphics. I can't find out how to rotate the display, which means [as it's in an isometric view], lots of stuff are hidden and can't be easily accessed. Many of the elements end up 'overlaying' themselves on each other, evidence of problems in the graphics engine itself.The gameplay is rather boring, frankly, and the game lacks flow. You're just dropped in without any real explanation of what the point is. Every now an then a passer by might interact with you with some, well, 'odd' dialogue is probably the nicest way to put it.The sound design in this game is probably the best part, honestly. It has some nice background music.Just to TL;DR, Don't buy it, its a shambles.			"

								Spacebase had the potential to be a cool game and I liked the concept. As of this writing (and I don't see myself opening it up again) I have 5.7 hours of gameplay over the course of development; that's about as much gameplay as you can squeeze out of it. Truth be told you can run through about all the game has to offer at this point in one two-hour sit down - and that's fine - but definitely not for $25.00. I think the price tag is what really bugs me and, personally, says a lot about the way the higher-ups at Double Fine truly feel about the whole situation. Yeah, the whole rush to 1.0 is a bit of a joke and there won't be much to the vanilla full game. But to have the audacity to charge $25.00 in Early Access! And given that the time between now and its 1.0 release is mainly for bug fixing means you're not getting any more bang for your buck in terms of gameplay (i'm not sure a tutorial counts).This game was gifted to me nearly a year ago and bought by the giver for about the price of a movie ticket. I got nearly 3 movies-worth out of it, so by that reckoning we're doing alright. That being said, I would be incredibly angry to have bought this for $25.00 only to find what the game holds (and more or less will hold at release). It all seems like ""poor sportsmanship"" on Double Fine's part. So your game lacks polish and contains less gameplay than some free Flash games; at least be honest about what it's worth. In any case, post-""release"" sales performance will, over time, likely drive the price to where it should be...somewhere around $5.			"

Early Access Review
								This game will never-ever be worth the full price now that DF have announced that they're abandoning development. It MIGHT be worth a quater of the price IF the community gets into modding it to fix serious issues and add much needed content.MIGHTIF---I guess i should update this review now that the game has been released and has been updated to 1.05.I still play this game, and at the time of the edit to this review, i've invested about 70 hours into countless new games. The updates have helped a whole lot, but the game still has some playability issues: Doctors will often ignore corpses, which leads to bad morale, which leads to violence which leads to drastic crew loss.Raider events are too randomised, and can often lead to base failure in the very early game, or general drastic crew loss.The added raider mega-fleet event is a good idea in principal, but is vastly over-powered.Construction crew often take huge detors to the next block to be built when in space, which can lead to a new base failing, or causing unrecoverable crew loss in the very early game.Even with my reasonable system spec and the relative simplicity of the game, it tends to lag-out far too much.Generally; Base failure seems to be down to chance rather than skill.There are positives, howeverThere are mods appearing now, which is great. The community is addressing balence issues and adding reaseatch and similar. Workshop support is still very much missing, sadly.Overall:Has the potential to be a reasonable casual game, but really isn't worth the full price at all. Perhaps at a quater the price, it woulnd't be so bad.			"

												Look at my game hours and you can easily see how much testing I did for the game in EA.  I also enjoyed the game even with all its bugs.  Then the Dev's supposivly ran out of money since they Dev out of San Fransico.  IKR, it sounds like an excuse from some teenager and that is the maturity level I think Tim Schafer is working on.  Dont get me wrong, I love his creativity just not his business practices.That type of Game Developer behavior cannot be supported as it is running amuck here on Steam's EA.  Therefore I recommed everyone to run for the hills from Spacebase DF-9.  I personally no longer support any games developed by Doublefine due to their missleading remarks before pulling the plug.  I dont even tolerate this type of manipulation in person let alone from a business.I not suggesteing you do the same unless you have also been burned by them and your eyes are now open.  I apply the same principles in RL when I am burned by a buisness or person, they get blacklisted in my book as well as possibly my friends.  Most of my friends are smart enough to heed my warning or at the very least causiously aproach and use that business.   I know some people still enjoy many other Doublefine games and thats fine for them but I hold people around me to a high standard and company's I support I hold even higher.This is one company I have blacklisted among many other new moneygrabbing Dev's I have found on steam in the past 2-3 years.  I whole heartedly love the premise behind EA and how it could help the little new Dev but all these other Steam EA abuses have near ruined my outlook on most if not all EA listed games here on Steam.Below I am linking a Steam Watchdog Group for Develpers we have Identified as problematic either for Forum Censorship or other unethical business practices similar to Doublefines abandonment of Spacebase DF-9.[Dissenters Anonymous]http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dissenters-anonymous "

												Unfortunately for all the potential depth the concept of a Dwarf Fortress style management game in space has this game gives you a very shallow puddle to play in. Also the puddle is full of dirty street water. And the puddle evaporates after 10 minutes.The fun abrudtly halts when you've completed everything the game has to offer after only a couple hours of play. At that time you've constructed every building and have staff working every job to the happiness of your citizens. Your little humanoids run around your base with a dozen different statistics being tracked that you quickly discover are largely completely meaningless. You are attacked by the same copy paste RNG enemies over and over. It is quite frankly boring and extremely unrewarding.			"

												A real shame.This game had some real potential. I love playing it but without finishing the game properly you run into the same issue with every play.You build, you research, and you run out of things to do. By the time you have researched all functional upgrades your space base is sprawling and you spend your time reassigning all staff to security detail when the multiple raider attacks start happening and then reassigning them back to their positions after the attack.Eventually you cannot look in all places at all times and ""questionable"" things begin occurring when your not looking in an  aggravating attempt to ""fake"" difficulty ala' MarioKart.The game itself is really not much more completed than what I played when I first purchased the Early Access version.The AI is shoddy, the dialogue feels very much like placeholder dialogue, and there are items to construct that seem to have no real bearing on game play (can anybody tell me what exactly reactors do or why my turrets don't shoot raider ships out of the sky before they board?).Feels bad to give this game a negative review, but it's earned it.

												Double Fine got the ball rolling for crowdfunding because it was of their use of it for Broken Age that got the media talking about it and it ushered in an explosion of new games that wouldn't have been otherwise, which was awesome,  but after the Broken Age fiasco and now with Double Fine quitting on Spacebase DF-9,  they're pretty much undoing all of that awesomeness by crapping all over it. WTG!Even after all the sluggish updates that seemed to cause more problems than they fixed, and with all the features that never came to pass, Double Fine is washing its hands of this game and are moving on.  I cannot recommend this game because it's being released unfinished.Do not buy Double Fine early access titles!!  The risk is too great that they'll pull the plug like they've done with Spacebase DF-9.  Your money will be left in the hands of Tim Schafer, probably the worst businessman in game development today.DO NOT BUY!			"

												I do not reccomend this game in the slightest, this is a disgrace to the early access system, it has a few good features but this is now a 1.0 released game, it's bull♥♥♥♥♥♥that it was even allowed to be cancelled like this, it was a rushed game and they know it, if you like rushed games with lots of bugs, go for it, within a few minutes of playing you're most likely going to ssee a bunch of bugs, such as people getting stuck in your seed pod on startup, a couple graphical issues, etc.I know it seems like I'm just bagging on the game because it was rushed and blatantly obvious, but I'm not, I tried to like this game, I erally did, but I was unable to with all the bugs and that it was very obviously rushed, I don't blame I developers in the slightest, I blame the♥♥♥♥♥holes that forced it to be released early, but it is still a decent game none the less, if it goes on sale for 6-10$ around Christmas, then I highly reccomend picking it up, or if it goes on sale like it is now for $12.00 (as of 10/27/2014).

												TL;DR Don't bother, it doesn't follow it's own rules.What a steaming load.  I bought this for 99 cents and I still fell ripped off. sure, it looks okay, sure, it has it's atmosphere but the game doesn't understand what a ""low chance of being raided"" means. I played one game for ~4 hours today and I was actually starting to have fun. theeeen raider after raider after raider, waves of the scrublords killed my workers, so I had to assign people who were not workers.. they were murdered, eventually my security was killed off and everything fell to pot. This isn't a strategy game, this is an exercise in futility and it desperately needs fixing. (but its not being  developed any more, ohnooes) And if you think I'm just being salty over this, I moused over the galaxy and found the most ideal spot I could. (which is near the galactic center) I was looking for the easiest of easy modes to get my feet  wet before I tried any of the other areas. And it was decently easy! uuuntil the game decided to start throwing raiders at me like they were party favors. seriously, I couldn't even keep up with  the info box because it was all ""hey, raiders. look, raiders. oh hey, guess what? raiders!"" Maybe there's some sort of infinite loop, maybe there's some sort of size threshold that this happens at but I never even got my population to 40. On top of all of this I was unable to do any research, medical or tech related. I couldn't assign anyone to do anything like that even though I had a huge research bay with 16 or so research tables and at the peak, 4 scientists.  And can we talk about unhappiness? nothing  I did seemed to help them, they'd just go off and sulk and get into fights n stuff. All in all,  not as bad as Kirk Cameron's Saving Xmas, nor is it anywhere as awful as Depression Quest, but it has some serious coding and feature-related issues that really need to be looked at (if not by DF, then by allowing 3rd party patches to fix it.)

I will no longer buy any product from this company again.The game itself is alright, but you can clearly feel that after an hour a sense of nothingness and bordom because there will be nothing to do. Conversations become samie and Building your base feels like a chore.2/10			"

Early Access Review
								Early access brings the unfortunate risk of being burned and this game is the first one to have burned me badly enough to write a negative review. First of all, this is practically a demo that absolutely does not capture what makes this genre ""fun"". Generally the interesting thing about base building games is not about how you can create a utopia where nothing goes wrong, but how your base will eventually come to its inevitable end. Spacebase DF-9 fails to spark any continued enjoyment because of how quickly one can create a stable base without having to worry about anything bad ever happening. One playthrough was all it took to figure out all the kinks for the next time, where it is entirely possible to reach a state where everything simply balances itself out. This can be attributed to the fact that the game has a very short list of features.The short list of rooms have an incredibly short list of items one can add to it, so constructing a base on the second playthrough provides almost the exact same experience. It is not surprising how shallow this game feels compared to other games from the genre, even before you are hit by the realization that the learning curve is really just a horizontal line.The random events and the citizens ""dynamic"" behavior do not add a lot of variety, which is something that also quickly realized as you build your base. Understanding the patterns of the short list of events the game throws at you does not take a lot of figuring out, which is not surprising given the fact that you can count these on one hand. To make things even worse, any negative event that can happen is easily preventable with the aforementioned short list of items at your disposal. The only challenging element this game presents, is the incredibly stupid AI that is set on destroying itself as early as building the very first airlock for the base. God help them if they are apart of your mining crew and there happens to be two airlocks to your base, because they are more likely to asphyxiate in space than they are picking which one is closer so they do not die.Again, all these negative aspects can be attributed due to the fact that this title is feature INCOMPLETE and will probably remain so, unless it builds a decent modding community (which is incredibly unlikely to happen given the current state). The keyword here is short, as in the feature list, the amount of time this game was given development time until its ""full"" release, and any enjoyment you can get out of it.I would be lying if I said I had never been so disappointed by a game before, but certainly not with a game that I was so excited to see completed. In the end I, and several other hopefuls lost out on $20-25 on a game that will never be finished. And while they did not lie to us about ""silently pulling the plug"", but they certainly lied about delivering us a ""complete"" game. With them violating my trust, I will never be purchasing another early access title or Double Fine game ever again.			"

												Yeah, nothing new to add. The game is fun for a while but it lacks finish and as everyone in here tries to tell you: don't buy, it will never be finished and it just doesn't work.(BTW. the only reason I have so many hours is because I wanted to test every new release to see that bugs had been removed, but alas, after several hours, the game becomes unplayable and nothing will help to continue)Update:The game has been released now and they promessed that the bugs would be fixed and the game would be playable with the features they added until they decided to stop. They failed: within 5 minutes of play time, I encountered 2 bugs already and I had two (unsolvable) life threatening situations making the game unplayable from the start.			"

												Today I thought I would write a somewhat higher quality review for this game.Gameplay is utterly horrible. The interface is very clunky and you will be lucky if you actualy do get a base up to specs. To begin with the game is so full of game killing bugs that 9 out of 11 games I played were ended NOT because of a disaster, but because of  a major game killing bug.  I even had to restart the game 6 times in a row one time just because there was a bug that was killing it shortly after launching.. Moving on we now go to the general aspects of the game itself: Support 0/10This game was released in an unfinished state and is abandoned yet sold on here for $20 (at the time of posting) I can not give a game in this condition or state any kind of rating at all.  Moving on, the devs are not freindly at all and have banned people for expressing their opinions that the game was a piece of vaporware.  You can take a look at the discussion forums for yourself on this and get a good idea of just how much censorship that is going on and make up your own minds on this . Graphics 5/10I am really not impressed with the graphics.  They are not impressive at all and were somewhat below average. Sounds and Music 1/10This is an area that is bare bones.  Obvioiusly this area of the game also did not get fnished.  What little music and sounds that there are  annoying as it is repetitous. Gameplay 1/10I tried. No really I tried and I got 1 decent game out of 30+ hours which yielded  constant frustration from game killing bugs.  So I give gameplay a 1 because it was fun until the game was killed by a bug. Fun 2/10What time I did play that was not killed by a game killing bug was fun so I give it a 2 in this area. Price:  due to the bugs, unfinished state, and unfrinedly devs it is my opinion that this is one game that definitely NOT worth more than a few pennies. Bugs and Execution:  The interface sucks, the game is full of game crushing bugs. I hope this review has been helpful to anyone looking for a new game. Feel free to comment.Overall :  This game is not just an epic failure but truly IS  vaporware.			"

												Very promising idea, however, the game is unfinished. It has so many glitches, that it is bound to break after some time of gameplay.To be honest: I'm sick an tired of constantly being the alpha- or beta-tester!The game lacks the very basics. You can only save your game by quitting. If you accidentally click on ""how to play"" or ""New Base"" you lose everything regardless if you have saved previously or not. You are not even asked ""are you sure?"" or be warned the your current game will be lost.In terms of gameplay:It is quiet unbalanced. Constant attacks don't give you much time to breath if you have not found the right area in the galaxy for building your base.Sometimes ships dock at your station and there is nothing you can do about it. If these ships happen to have exterior turrets you might as well start from scratch. Because these turret will tear your crew apart and you won't have a chance to disable or even destroy them.Again. Haven't the developers even played the game? Other players keep having the same problem. There seems to be no answer accoring to the double fine board.You have to start over several times in the beginning until you have figured out what to do. There is a tutorial, but everything it does is presenting you a half finished base. There is nothing that explains the building items, what to take care of or the basics of managing the station.Sometimes some of your citizens just stop doing their duties and telling you they are bored. You send security to a place where pirates tried to break into your ship and they just keep patroling the base. On occation citizens refuse to enter a room and do maintainance... which results in suffocation of all citizens on your station.So, what do you do against those pirates raiding your base? You build some turrets of your own. Then one of your scientists goes mad, usually you would stop him and throw him into the brig until he stops acting up... but the turret has a better idea: it shoots him.Conclusion:Under no circumstance is this game in a ""release""-state! Beta at most. I feel violated as an alpha-tester again by a company which obviously did not even bother to try and play their own f***ing game! It reminds me a lot of the initial problems of X-Rebirth. But this company does not even show effort in fixing these issues.			"

												While the game starts good and has many interesting aspects, the dificulty simply ramps up too fast. After a few minutes of game play it gets hard to keep up with the number of negative events that happen, even in an easy zone. Interesting mechanics do not make up for broken dificulty scaling. On top of that the number of bugs present is astounding. I had to restart the tutorial mission four times because it kept getting stuck on different parts.

												This is it.  I'm done with this publisher.  So many games from them are just half done.  Example in this game:""Your crew member is ill with an unknown disease.  Research the disease to cure it.""  To bad you can't because scientists don't actually work.  ""Your being attacked!""  Turn on the alarm to alert everyone.  - Doesn't alert them, they continue on doing what they are doing.So many more dumb things that just aren't implemented.			"

												I really wanted to like this game and to a point I did (26 hours worth) but I can not recommend it as it feels unfinished, left out in the cold of space to die and the developers are missing out on a huge potential if they had put more into it. It's quirky, interesting, not very challenging but at best gets old once you've created a few bases and start to notice the patterns. Pick it up if you can get it on sale for $5 or less. Don't be duped like I was into paying a penny more.			"

												I loved the concept of the game, so I spent $20 on it thinking it was money well spent on a trusted company. Bad move. This game is the biggest example of why not to buy games in Early Access: it's unfinished, buggy and borderline unplayable. It's also become the reason why in future I'll be avoiding Double FIne games. The fact it's still being sold on Steam for $20 is just thievery. Of course, I'm not expecting this review to stay up very long- in a move guaranteed of course to even further please the irate buyers of this game, negative reviews of it are being deleted by the thousands.

												Still unfinished, San Francisco has to be too expensive for game development. If you want something similar I suggest Dwarf Fortress(free), Prison Architect, Space Station 13(free) and RimWorld. When I first played Dwarf Fortress I remember the wiki telling me that it's fun to lose.  The two bases I built in my 2 hours of playing had very similar ends, where some creature would enter my station and defeat my officer and I'd be essentially defenseless. It's been a while since I last played but that's what I remember. DoubleFine would do itself well to become a subsidiary of a real publisher, hopefully then Tim's coke addiction could be maintained long enough to make a finished, solid game.			"

												Super disapointing. Like many others I purchased this game in alpha with high hopes. A company like Double-Fine wouldn't let us down, would they? Appearantly they would. Because of  the list of features that they  ""hoped"" to implement, I would jump on every time I saw they had another patch. After a few hours, I'd log off frustrated by repeated raid in a ""low threat"" area or constant meteors where none should be or a dead guy blocking my airlock. Every patch the game got a little better, but nowhere near what it could have been or what DF implied we were investing in. I understand that they need to make money, but bailing on a game that people invested thier time and money into won't get them any repeat costumers. Not this one anyway.			"

								Double fine has decided (in their infinite wisdom) that it is acceptable to simply take a 0.6 alpha build, and jump straight to a 1.0 release build and stating that they are ceasing all development on a game that is by no means feature complete, has major bugs and performance issues, as you would expect from an alpha. Simply releasing the source code is not an acceptable remedy for this, they are basically saying they can't be bothered to finish this, so the community should. No, that is not acceptable. We invest in an early access title to help ensure the project is complete, and all we expect is a game to be developed to the best of the companies abilities. This is obviously just double fine wanting to cut corners and save money by screwing the consumer out of a finished product. Do not buy! Do not support companies that want to screw the consumer out of their hard earned cash.			"

												I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. It's kind of obvious why I can't recommend this!* Updating my review as this game is out of Early Access now *In the good old days of games, companies would invest money into developing a game. Sometimes these investments wouldn't pay off and the game would be unceremoniously cancelled. Remember Snake Plissken's First Escape for the PS2? Me neither. How about the next MMO from Blizzard that was recently canned?With Spacebase, not only do you get the experience of a game cancelled in mid-development but you also get the luxury of paying for it.Without chasing the rabbit about the dubious nature of the way this game was funded, it's fair to say that I and everyone else who bought this in early access took a risk that didn't pay off. That doesn't mean I can't and shouldn't have expected better from an established development studio.			"

								There are dozens of posts explaining their blunder. Poor money choices, they desperately need an accountant. And if they have one, dude should be fired and his degree sent back to whatever cracker jack box he ""earned"" it from.... That, and this should be proof that more developers on a project DOES NOT mean more success.... just more failure. GG guys, GG. If a game has Double Fine on it, I'll be skipping it from now on. Your rep is not great or even good at all, the days of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle are long lost, and I'm saddened by this - Like you were paid to prove these sorts of games AREN'T successful, when I have seen a lot of success in them. FTL is amazing, just to name one. And it is recent. And indy built. DF isn't indy... They just aren't professional anymore. I'd scale them with the wierd uncle who claims he could do all this great stuff, but when he shows you, claims he isn't in his prime anymore when he falls on his face. Repeatedly. Because he doesn't get that then and now are two different times, and his pride won't let him stop. But people want to keep seeing him try in hopes that he can do what he used to do. And we spend hours over the dinner table listening to ""back in the day, I used to..."" But what now? He's old and worn, and can't get back to his proper feet anymore. And it saddens us, because he used to be the cool uncle, now he's just the weird one.			"

After a set period you're inundated by enemies that you basically can't recover from, and even if you let them destroy you and try rebuilding, they'll just come back in overwhelming force. I even tried cheating to build, and rebuild quickly, but the game still became unplayable after a certain point.That being said, and even though I'm giving it a negative recommendation, if mods become available, or it's patched, or it's on sale for cheep, pick it up, it's worth a couple of plays.

There is also no support for fixing the new bugs that appeared. It has so much bugs to the point to be unplayable. For a veteran that was able to keep up a nice base in a ""very low threat sector"", there are too much raiders coming, and if you go to change some jobs while being invaded, sometimes more raiders come. I've come across 5 raiders at once. Ah, and not great news too, the support/bugfixing stopped.

								just as they promised not to, this fly by night dev, has rather loudly pulled the plug on Spacebase. It has been disastrous to their reputationand it has killed the games fanbase emotionally.This game is Early Access AbandonWareIt is DEADIf I were in Double Fine position, id drop the price to $5 and see if that could help generate sales. BUTThis is why you shouldnt buy this game.NOW as for why you shouldnt even play it. Its undercooked and unfinished and will never be finished,the core gameplay that is here is lacking, and there are much bettermanagement sims available than this, go play SimCity instead, The worst thing is, whats here isnt bad, its a fun game ( not £18.99 fun however) and there clearly was a lot of promise here, but it lacks a cohesive and complete designa victim of the early access nature of the game, very basic systems were in place herewith no real central mechanics, while it is noticably graphically superior to the amnesia fortnight prototype, mechanically it is almost just as under developed andafter 18 months of development, a lot of promised features are completely missing.While I understand Double Fine has a passion and a penchant for making unique andinteresting games, they absolutely shouldnt not start making a game that they cannot gauruntee to finish. Spacebase DF-9 should have never been greenlit, I love the idea butthe project completely failed, and Double Fine didnt gamble their own money on this, or even their investors money on this, they gambled OUR money on Spacebase. The game made its initial investment back pretty quickly, but due to a high price and lack of featuresonly a small subset of dedicated fans jumped in. Early Access is supposed to be a tool for devs to make a little extra money before a game is finished. The game should be planned and financially secure for completion before coming to Early Access and in spite of it. It absolutely should NOT be the primary form of financial resource for a game, ESPECIALLY for a professional studio like Double Fine that is located in a city like San Francisco that has a high cost of living. This game shouldnt even existand poor management has cost me and many others about £19 and it has cost Double Finemy trust and future trade.Im Sorry JP LeBreton, I really wanted Spacebase DF-9 to succeed, but you gambledwith my trust and now Double Fine has lost it.

Early Access Review
								Developer Double Fine has posted that the final release of the game will be version 1.0 and that no more versions will be released.  This comes at a time when the game is still in alpha and lacks considerable depth.  Be warned, if you are buying this game after 9/18/2014 you are potentially buying a dead game.  You can plow through what little content is there in an hour and from Double Fine's last post it seems unlikely much content will be added for the ""final"" 1.0.--Spacebase DF-9 is an interesting play on the Dwarf Fortress formula.  Instead of carving out a kingdom from rock you are inversely adding a ""kingdom"" to the vacuum of space.  Similar to Dwarf Fortress you are given little control over your citizens.  Instead you play the role of macromanager, assigning citizens to tasks and watching them go about their day.  Certain events will trigger at random times forcing you to deal with raiders, parasites, killbots, and meteorites.While all of this sounds fun in theory the problem is that Spacebase DF9 is competing with 10 years of Dwarf Fortress development.  As of Alpha version 6 there is still relatively little to do.  You can speed run through an hour of gameplay and basically see all that Double Fine has to offer, afterwards the game offers little reason to continue playing.  Unlike Dwarf Fortress, Spacebase misses the boat on simulated empire building.Don't let my number of in-game hours sway you, 40 of those hours are from idling the game while I did work.			"

								A few months ago I likely would have recommended this game. While development was fairly slow, they were making progress and the game was getting better. I was hopeful for the future as the game had, in my opinion, a very solid foundation.With the news that this game is now only getting one more major patch; I can no longer in good faith recommend it to anybody. This game was initially touted as a 'Sci-Fi Dwarf Fortress,"" but make no mistake, it offers nowehere near the complexity or longevity, The feature list is incredibly underwhelming for a sim game of it's type, and you will very quickly lose interest in the little this game has to offer. After a few hours you will have experienced absolutely everything. They could have done so much more with the concept, (and planned to,) but nothing in this game will strike you as particularly unique or groundbreaking. The fact of the matter is this game seriously underdeliverd on the features that were going to distinguish it from other games in the genre. You can go back and look at the archived dev plans to get an idea.Of course, this was always the danger of early access. There's no guarantee that the game you fund will make it to it's fully realized state. If a game becomes unprofitable; they'll ship it in it's current state regardless of planned features. As far as I know, this is the highest profile early access game that has seriously underdelivered. Let it serve you as a warning when buying other early access titles. After this I don't think I'll be putting money behind any more games that have a chance to be released so woefully unfinished.			"

Early Access Review
								Developer Double Fine has posted that the final release of the game will be version 1.0 and that no more versions will be released.  This comes at a time when the game is still in alpha and lacks considerable depth.  Be warned, if you are buying this game after 9/18/2014 you are potentially buying a dead game.  You can plow through what little content is there in an hour and from Double Fine's last post it seems unlikely much content will be added for the ""final"" 1.0.--Spacebase DF-9 is an interesting play on the Dwarf Fortress formula.  Instead of carving out a kingdom from rock you are inversely adding a ""kingdom"" to the vacuum of space.  Similar to Dwarf Fortress you are given little control over your citizens.  Instead you play the role of macromanager, assigning citizens to tasks and watching them go about their day.  Certain events will trigger at random times forcing you to deal with raiders, parasites, killbots, and meteorites.While all of this sounds fun in theory the problem is that Spacebase DF9 is competing with 10 years of Dwarf Fortress development.  As of Alpha version 6 there is still relatively little to do.  You can speed run through an hour of gameplay and basically see all that Double Fine has to offer, afterwards the game offers little reason to continue playing.  Unlike Dwarf Fortress, Spacebase misses the boat on simulated empire building.Don't let my number of in-game hours sway you, 40 of those hours are from idling the game while I did work.			"

Early Access Review
								A few months ago I likely would have recommended this game. While development was fairly slow, they were making progress and the game was getting better. I was hopeful for the future as the game had, in my opinion, a very solid foundation.With the news that this game is now only getting one more major patch; I can no longer in good faith recommend it to anybody. This game was initially touted as a 'Sci-Fi Dwarf Fortress,"" but make no mistake, it offers nowehere near the complexity or longevity, The feature list is incredibly underwhelming for a sim game of it's type, and you will very quickly lose interest in the little this game has to offer. After a few hours you will have experienced absolutely everything. They could have done so much more with the concept, (and planned to,) but nothing in this game will strike you as particularly unique or groundbreaking. The fact of the matter is this game seriously underdeliverd on the features that were going to distinguish it from other games in the genre. You can go back and look at the archived dev plans to get an idea.Of course, this was always the danger of early access. There's no guarantee that the game you fund will make it to it's fully realized state. If a game becomes unprofitable; they'll ship it in it's current state regardless of planned features. As far as I know, this is the highest profile early access game that has seriously underdelivered. Let it serve you as a warning when buying other early access titles. After this I don't think I'll be putting money behind any more games that have a chance to be released so woefully unfinished.			"

												So this game is supposedly complete.... I dont see it, I bought it knowing it was incomplete, they added like, 2-3 features and that was it.its like dwarf fortress, set in space, with nothing to do except build your very limited base, and then let the game play itself, once the base is built, the game is pretty much over.nothing in terms of adventuring, just wait until something shows up in your neighborhood, and I guess you can react to it if you want, not that it matters.Double Fine, you guys.... how do you go from psychonauts, to Brutal Legend, to the adventures of 3.3 million dollars, to making a game with less content than other games still in alpha.i just came up with this awesome pun, MORE LIKE SPACEBASE DNF-9			"

												The fact that this game was one of the ""Early Access Cons"" by PC gamers, should say all you need to know. The developers abandoned development of the game, and there is just a buggy mess. I mean, if you hit escape too many times while trying to close menu's ingame, it'll actually exit the game altogether, losing all your progress since the last (manual) save. It's honestly just frustrating to play, and definitely not enjoyable.If you really, REALLY, want to buy this game, wait for it to be on special. Anything over 50c is not worth it, in my opinion.			"

The game has a good foundation but its completely unfinished. So many features suggested that would make it an actual GAME instead of a weird space station life simulation. I feel robbed and betrayed. I used to think Double-Fine made well-made and frankly BRILLIANT games and now they do this to me and im completely disillusioned. Dont buy this game.

								At first glance this game had much potential, asking for a small amount of money on kickstarter the developers recieved 8 and a half time of what they asked for. And everything seemed pretty good so far, they released an alpha version to play and test with, and as it is with alpha versions there were some bugs. But suddenly their money ran out and now they're releasing a game without the hundreds of features they promissed their supporters and in it's currently unfinished alpha stage, presenting it as if it was a full on game. That is a no. Do not buy from double fine. Bad reputation will be worse than doing a little over time, and they have to learn that			"

												Spacebase DF-9 had high hopes and dreams that were crushed when it was abruptly moved to release due to the game not making enough money to sustain development.  If that's not a kick in the balls then I don't know what is.In addition, Studio Head Tim Schafer has proved his pig-headedness once more at the Game Developers Conference of 2015, where he flat-out denied the existance of the women and minority gamers who have been calling for improvement in gaming journalism-- so if you fall in one of those two groups (or both), then you should probably think twice about buying any game made by Tim Schafer.  Otherwise you're just fueling the ego of a man who, quite literally, sock-puppets.

A remastered remakes of old quests like Day Of the Tentacle and Grim Fandango.

Early Access Review
								Unfortunately the final release of this game is not an improvement on the earliest alpha at all. Throughout the alpha the gameplay did not change at all. Instead each alpha update added some tacked on crap that contributed very little to the game. GoodThe characters you construct a base for seem to have depth. They have feelings and thoughts and you can read about them and so on. The basic gameplay elements for a base builder are there and function.BadThe game seems to be caught somewhere between Dungeon Keeper and the Sims. Unfortunately, the emphasis seems to be on Sims gameplay. The station inhabitants have clearly had more effort put into them than the actual gameplay. This could have been a positive thing, as it is in the Sims which is a great game, except without a base and proper neccessities all your inhabitants will die. So you find yourself in a panic to build a base early, made all the harder by the fact that your workers spend more time socializing and posting to their ""spacebook"" than building things essential to survival. This is made even more frustrating by the single most terrible UI I've seen in a modern game ever. In conclusion, the game isn't finished. The gameplay in Spacebase is incredibly underdeveloped and clunky. There isn't even anything to do. You build a small base and then there's nothing. You could make a bigger base, but there's no reason to. There's no challenge. Despite a year and a half of development this still plays like a terrible demo.			"

												I started with DF-9 very early on, the updates were consistent and beefy enough that it kept my attention and I didn't feel I wasted too much time with a few new stations every build. New problems would of course pop up every Alpha release, but that is to be expected and for the most party they were ignored, yet underlying and game breaking issues never seemed to get fixed that made the end game for the most part pointless while cosmetic and uneeded areas were implemented. The game is playable for the most part but feels to have been abandoned after being pushed into release after it seems it ran out of money. I would have even recomended the game had the Devs fixed what is there, I could have forgiven the game missing many of the promised features but as it stands now until it gets some much needed attention the review is going to remain negative and I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone which really is disappointing as it had such promise and I did enjoy it despite being broken and unplayable past certain points.

This game had so much potential, it could have been one of the best out there, instead it will be forever known as one of the reasons why you don't buy in Early Access. It's utterly incomplete, you can do and see everything there is to do in the game within 4 hours easily, and even that might be stretching it.

								If it wasnt for bad optimization on the Pathfinding and other core parts of the game, you would be through with it in aprox. 10 hours max. Comparing the current price (~20 €-ish) with what you would pay for an Alien Isolation key and the tense action and story telling, well lets just say go for A:I. To make this review more helpful, I will shortly tell you what is currently in the game: Build a base with oxygen-generators, a simple airlock and some rooms. Create a food source. Mine Asteroids around you and enlarge your base. Upgrade food source and build living and recreation areas. Research stuff. This, all the while you are defending against Pirate raids, that wouldnt be a problem, if not for the bad Pathfinding and AI in general, that paralyzes your security officer on duty, unable to shoot at the invaders.

												You can tell painstaking amounts of work went into programming how things could go wrong. You can also tell that not a single thought was given to how to keep thing running. My techs hovering around the research room and refigrerator while a malfunctioning airlock slowly kills everyone on my station is just hohoho funny. Something as simple as the ablity to set priotiries on jobs could have saved this game. As it is, it sucks. It's not hard because it was desgned to be hard, it's hard because the programers are lazy.			"

												I bought this game for the double fine label. That is a choice I regret. I am careful most of the time with anything that was early access, when I saw double fine's name it give me some hope for a game that would be saw through till the end. I regret my purchase immensly. The game I enjoyed in alpha still lacks many features that where listed and never will be add it leaving it to the modding community to fix up. This is not the practice of a games developer but of a lazy studio who cannot budget.			"

												Spacebase DF-9 is a great proof of concept for a colony management sim ala Dwarf Fortress. However, as Double Fine has essentially dumped it out hoping that modders will finish it after promising more updates than delivered, I cannot in good conscience recommend it for purchase. It is fun for about an hour before there is nothing else to do and no meaningful ways to interact with the world. Rimworlds or Startopia are suggestions for similar, more full-fledged products.			"

The idea being that people will buy anything Tim makes as he is a old school developer. However since it did not sell well enough to justify more development and thus more sales it was abanoned in favor of the next take.

								This game is in ALPHA. You should expect bugs.If you are surprised by the fact that there are bugs, I honestly don't know how you're breathing right now.Spacebase DF-9 is an excellent concept for a game. It's like a space-themed Prison Architect: you micro-manage the needs of your crew, build/destroy sections, new world events happen, etc.But that concept has been poorly executed. The updates seem to be coming fewer and farther between, with not much added to keep your interest. It seems Double Fine have put this game on the back burner.And as I said, it contains bugs. The AI of characters is still a bit dumb, but it has improved since I started playing.All in all, if you're very patient, and don't mind waiting around for updates and waiting for the game to figure out what you want, it has potential. Whether that potential is worth 25 USD is a personal choice.			"

								Since everyone's reviews are solely their views on Double Fine's recent announcement, I'll go ahead and take a look at the game in its current state.As it is right now, Spacebase DF-9 shouldn't be called anywhere near completed.  I mean, the game works and all but there are a lot of glaring problems with it.  After a few runs through the game, I couldn't help but notice that every space sector you play in has almost zero differences between them.  The astro density determines how much asteroid is in your area to mine from, which is appreciated, but it hardly makes up for everything else.  The threat level has very little difference, as it apparently suggests how often your base gets showered on by meteors and debris, while warpgate proximity indicates how often you get potential new residents passing by.  What is evidently missing is where Raider occurrences would be placed, since they happen fairly regularly.The Raiders themselves are stupendously overpowered.  The raiding parties vary between one and three Raiders that *will* decimate your population, no matter how well-trained your Security staff is.  The reason for this is because they tank damage like it's nothing while killing a majority (if not all) of your residents in less than five shots each.  The defensive turrets don't offer much by way of defense.  As the camera is locked to only one perspective, you only have the option to face the turrets downward (i.e. towards the bottom of the map) to either the left or right directions.  Seriously, you can't really use them to shoot at the approaching vessels since they have to be *inside* the base.The base amenities are also a joke as follows:- Despite having oxygen capacity for X number of people, the second I fill the base to capacity, the oxygen recyclers eventually fail as if I was overbooked (despite each recycler to be working perfectly at roughly 80-85% durability).  This caused my residents to panic and run around, abandoning all jobs and waiting until they either starved to death (because they used up all of the matter in stock) or waited until the next Raider party exterminated them all.- The bar doesn't offer much, since it's the only thing that works in the Pub zone.  I have seen neither the fridge nor stove used at all so they're essentially useless.- I set up a Reserch Zone and set a tech to research but my Scientist was busy doing everything else while on duty rather than actually research anything.Overall, the game pretty much sucks since each playthrough is just the same thing: see how big your base can get before Raiders kill them all.  And given how Double Fine's treating the game now, I'd have to agree with everyone else.  The developers are basically dropping the project and turning the rest of the game's development over to the community after announcing that they're releasing the source code for the scripts and pushing the game out the door with a 1.0 full release version.  Avoid this game and pick up somthing better instead, like the classic StarTopia or even Prison Architect (which I also have). Spacebase DF-9 is simply a waste of time and money.			"

												UPDATE: The game is basically ""Beta"" now. From the release of 1.0 there were no new features added. They finally fixed the 3FPS that plagued linux/mac OS, but the game now randomly crashes.  The AI when building will get stuck in walls regularly. Have to close and re-open to fix. This hasn't been fixed from alpha 6. Two months ago. The tutorial is complete crap. There is no audio queues and it is VERY uniformitive. All they did was have text on the bottom and hope the random event generator triggers what to do next. Crew members will walk back and forth until they die - refusing to either fix/build oxygen supplies.  There is  no way to keep track of power usage.  Just build until you run out of power. THAT WAY when something breaks you'll be completely screwed.Proximity to the warpgate things don't make any difference on how much spam you have to put up with for people constantly trying to join your base. Everything I listed has been a problem since alpha 5/6. No fix. All they did was just plop on some text call it a tutorial and fix the 3FPS issue for linux/mac.Don't buy. Complete scam.Below is my original review.Early access linux backer. (Same review would thereby apply to Mac to some degree)Game is in last Alpha stage. They are moving to have it be labled as ""1.0"", aka finished. However. The game is completely unplayable in linux and barely works (from what I understand) in mac. There is no support here for it, and the developer is just claiming ""modders will fix it"", and we have to rely on the developer to test the game themselves, when, after this lastest aplha stage, TWO platforms that are supposed to be supported do not work. Do not buy this game. It is completely unfinished, and will likely not even work on your system due to lack of testing in development. They have completely skipped beta stage of development.			"

I feel like I am cheated, betrayed. I found that game on youtube in a video and I saw the potential where the game may develop. I read stuff on their web with long list of planned features and I liked it despite the fact there wasn't much to do in the game itself. I purchased it because of ""early"" alpha state with only 6 bigger versions and huge planned features list. It indicated it will be still in progress and had much more content ahead, so I decided I will support them. Not too long from that day, they want to release the game which is still more ""prototype"" than full game. If I knew about that earlier, I didn't purchase it.

Whats the point of modding a piece of garbage game like this? It will never be 'finished' and they have broken laws in several countries by releasing it in this state.TL;DR DONT BUY THIS, IT IS UNFINISHED AND WILL NEVER BE FINISHED (1.0 Releasese next month and then development will stop!)

								This game is not finished, and it has come out that it never will be.  There are a handful of hours that are enjoyable, but not in the way you think.  It seems to be building up to something.  You gather resources and put together a station, and at no time is your progress ever really threatened.  Then, you have everything built up, you've put lasers on the walls and have a small army of security and... nothing ever happens.  There are no truly challenging random events, there are no barriers that you have to work around to build your base, there's never any challenge at all.  And then there's no kind of endgame after this, you can just keep expanding and staring at your stable, boring base (that is in itself neither complex nor complicated, with no tough systems to learn or figure out) for eternity.  And Double Fine has come out and said that this is all that there ever will be.Don't buy this game.  It's all build-up, no climax.  No challenges.  Even the resource gathering and base/population management isn't difficult because it's too simple and easy.			"

Seriously, you can't really use them to shoot at the approaching vessels since they have to be *inside* the base.The base amenities are also a joke as follows:- Despite having oxygen capacity for X number of people, the second I fill the base to capacity, the oxygen recyclers eventually fail as if I was overbooked (despite each recycler to be working perfectly at roughly 80-85% durability).  This caused my residents to panic and run around, abandoning all jobs and waiting until they either starved to death (because they used up all of the matter in stock) or waited until the next Raider party exterminated them all.- The bar doesn't offer much, since it's the only thing that works in the Pub zone.  I have seen neither the fridge nor stove used at all so they're essentially useless.- I set up a Reserch Zone and set a tech to research but my Scientist was busy doing everything else while on duty rather than actually research anything.Overall, the game pretty much sucks since each playthrough is just the same thing: see how big your base can get before Raiders kill them all.  And given how Double Fine's treating the game now, I'd have to agree with everyone else.  The developers are basically dropping the project and turning the rest of the game's development over to the community after announcing that they're releasing the source code for the scripts and pushing the game out the door with a 1.0 full release version.  Avoid this game and pick up somthing better instead, like the classic StarTopia or even Prison Architect (which I also have). Spacebase DF-9 is simply a waste of time and money.			"

								DO NOT BUY.Investment in an Early Access game may carry some measure of risk, sure. But from an established studio like Double Fine, there's a reasonable expectation of not only a certain level of quality, but of a completed product. With Spacebase DF9, we're getting neither of those.Deciding that pre-release sales aren't up to their expectations, Double Fine has opted to cancel further development of DF9, label the next version 1.0, and abandon it. Sure, we'll get some bug fixes in 1.0, but the game isn't nearly ready for release. Between miners who refuse to stop working and suffocate before reaching the airlock, doctors who can't be bothered to retrieve dead bodies, construction items that builders ignore, and a notable lack of features and variety, DF9 is an incomplete and sometimes outright broken product. That never bothered me much because I kept telling myself, ""It's still alpha. It'll get better.""That Double Fine is using sales of an alpha to determine the game isn't promising enough to finish is astonishing. The lack of commitment to invested fans is even more so. Of course it's not selling well; it's not a good product yet. This almost makes one miss the old days, when games didn't sell at all before release. Then no one could complain, ""it didn't sell well enough before we finished it.""This is the kind of thing we've come to expect from no-name, fly-by-night indie devs, but from a studio like Double Fine it's all the more shocking, if not more shameful.

								As an early access game, DF9 was decent. There was definable progress. I'll admit it, it was fun. There were bugs, and early access gripes, but the EA rule I use is that ""As long I can visualize this being finished, done, and fun, I can consider spending money on it."" DF9 met those criteria. However, as the game has moved abruptly to a ""release"", and with the complete stoppage of new features, Double Fine has fallen far, far short of even approaching their planned development milestones. Further, the lack of believable rationales, detailed explanations, or even breakdowns about why this came about mean that I can't in good faith recommend that you purchase this game, or any future titles from Double Fine productions until some form of publically disclosed management shakeup takes place. They reportedly raised approximately half a million dollars to develop this game. They then stopped development, citing financial reasons. They do not appear to have then offered any breakdown of where said money went. They are now confused, as people are angry and asking ""WHERE DID THAT MONEY GO!?"" The statements I have reviewed do not appear to show that this logical connectoin has been made.The final nail in the coffin was a ""AWESOME DEV PROCESS GREAT JOB"" timeline that was issued as a ""We're sorry we took your money, but don't pay attention to the archived feature lists we pumped for months about what we were going to do, instead read this sleek graphic that shows what we DID do! JUST DONT COMPARE THE TWO!"" Their conduct in this and other products leads me to the following unfortunate conclusion regarding Double Fine Productions:They simply are not a worthwhile investment for your consumer dollars. This is not the first time this endgame has come about for one of their product. That is not to say Double Fine is an intrinsically bad company, or that they cannot make good games. But I simply cannot justify spending money on early access titles from them now or in the future.At this point, Double Fine serves as an argument for Valve to more or less micro-audit game development companies, even basic indie ones, for management practices. Whether that is feasible or a correct response is a different matter, but Double Fine's performance definitely elicits that reaction. That or open up a ""Developer Review"" page to trash talk developers (This would also be a bad idea, but it is my inclination in response). A more reasonable option would be for Valve to construct a form of ""Warning Stick"" that it can publically shake at developers who mis-behave in such a fashion. A ""We're reviewing their sales agreement"" or ""We're considering yanking their priviledge to post on early access"" type of statement, to remind developers that Early Access is not a kickstarter equivalent, but is rather an opportunity to generate interest and feedback on your products.

								This game is in ALPHA. You should expect bugs.If you are surprised by the fact that there are bugs, I honestly don't know how you're breathing right now.Spacebase DF-9 is an excellent concept for a game. It's like a space-themed Prison Architect: you micro-manage the needs of your crew, build/destroy sections, new world events happen, etc.But that concept has been poorly executed. The updates seem to be coming fewer and farther between, with not much added to keep your interest. It seems Double Fine have put this game on the back burner.And as I said, it contains bugs. The AI of characters is still a bit dumb, but it has improved since I started playing.All in all, if you're very patient, and don't mind waiting around for updates and waiting for the game to figure out what you want, it has potential. Whether that potential is worth 25 USD is a personal choice.			"

								This game is completely unfinished and is going into full release without being even close to completion, which is just an attempt to squeeze some money out of an abandoned game.They also promoted the game on Steam to try and lure people to buy it just before they dumped all the promised features and abandoned development, which in my eyes is sneaky and deceptive and best, and borderline criminal at worst.After trying repeatedly to start building the base. Just *start* the base that is, I encountered a series of bugs and issues which meant that my crew didn't go into the base I had built, died for no real reason etc etc. There is no guidance to indicate what is wrong, so it is hard to tell when it is a bug or you have made a mistake. The answer is probably both.Avoid avoid avoid.			"

Perhaps some should tell Double Fine a Tutorial stage is supposed to be easy?The Tutorial stage is actually quite difficult for a newcomer - the 'area' the tutorial station is placed in has a 'high threat' level, and any time I tried to expand my station by adding a new feature, I found myself swarmed with raiders so that any residents I had out in space suits were inevitably killed. I cannot count the number of times my space station found istelf down to a tiny crew due to the rest being killed off. You will have much more satisfaction with the 'New Base' option.This is a game with  basis, but too many frustrating points. What would help:- the ability to 'jump' to a location on the map when a message is given, ie, a derelict has appeared, so-and-so is under attack, etc- the ability to 'jump' to a resident from the roster- a clearer indication of residents' moods and wants- more options for decor/entertainment- a help menu that lists the different features and what they do, instead of a too-difficult tutorial- more features!!!!On the whole, I know I will keep playing for the construction aspect, which is why I bought it, but I cannot honestly recommend it to anyone yet. Perhaps Double Fine will come back to it at some point; in light of the negative reviews it's getting, though, I rather doubt it.			"

								I hate writing such short reviews but I simply wish to express my opinion after many hours of gameplay (I do get to give a post 36 hour review, regardless):Post 18 hour review summary (terminated as of release information until 1.0): I would STRONGLY recommend not purchasing this project until you see what comes in at 1.0 release. The ship has sailed, so to speak, on spacebase DF-9. The money brought in for DF-9 was considered insufficient to continue the project and the developers are going to ship the product as is.  You are welcome to receive a product that, with slight and fully justified speculation, will remain permanently as an alpha (it never reached beta) in support of double fine but I would be cautious.I do recommend to all early access payers, however, to recognize how frequently we receive products that are not even identified as ""alpha or beta"" and to be kind to double fine. I would suggest most players refer to many battlefield and call of duty releases to see how beta's can be pushed out as ""final projects"". Double fine has to begin to regain some form of capital from this project and the only way they can is by releasing the game. I commend the team for being open and honest about their decision, as hard as it is. Positives:+ Double Fine was open and honest+ Graphics are well managed+ Concept well thought out and fun+ Obvious love and commitment put into the projectNegative-Game is being accelerated to final state with obvious, often game ending, bugs-From the developer: ""Spacebase DF9 is still a fun, clever, hilarious, beautiful and complete game.""

I even helped other people on the steam forums and DF forums.And yet, i was hesitant recommending DF9, because Early Access isn't the same as buying a released game, it's not even kickstarter, you can't get a refund or the money back if it fails, you have to accept a shining pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥and hope the developer has the stomach to make it better over time when you buy a game through Early Access, That's the primary condition Steam sets for you. That all changed on the 19th September, 2014 when they abandoned the game, saying there was no more money in development. If you're going to get this game, wait for a humble bundle and pay $2, that's a little high for what it's worth, definitely  not the $30 i paid to test out a failed experiment.♥♥♥♥ you Tim Schafer. ♥♥♥♥ you.

There are good base mechanics in place, but after about an hour you will have seen everything the game has to offer. If this type of game sounds interesting to you, I'd pick up RimWorld instead.			"

												DO NOT BUY! This game is buggy and unfinished. There is nothing much to do after even just a couple of hours. The developers have no intention of ever finishing it because apparently people did not give them enough money. This is the game that has totally put me off early access titles. I repeat DO NOT BUY!			"

												Spacebase DF-9 does not come close to the quality of other games in the genre. The lack of features and frustration with the game mechanics demonstrate that Spacebase DF-9 was released before it was a complete game.			"

												Buy early access, realize it has problems, but it's okay..,Come back half year later, to play:Step1: build my first airlock with a space suit locker. Step2: the mentally challenged builders finish the room, except the lockers. Step3: game notices me, when all 3 of my crew have less then 20% oxigen left, that my crew can't in.Step4: panic&realize the builders can't open the airlocker door, cause it has no no lockers, also can't reach them to buildStep5: the time i get to the tear down the wall, and finish the airlocker, 3 of my 4 crew members dead. (asphyxiation :) )Step6: last survivor gets into base finally, parasite infection.This is just so ♥♥♥♥in sad.. :(			"

								In this game you essenitally layout rooms on a 2d grid made to look like space.  People randomly come up and ask to join your station where you have to keep them alive and happy and also use them to help keep your station running.  Sometimes you get invaders.  The core features to make it a base-building game are there.While the developers had some good ideas, they did not get fleshed out nearly enough and there is very little content otherwise.With the announcement of release just a month or two away it's clear that the developer abandoned this title well before it was able to reach it's potential.   Fun for a couple hours but not worth the $25 asking price.  If you can grab it for 5 bucks or less it may be worth it.			"

												Review for version 1.01Its ♥♥♥♥in horrible. Still buggy as hell. Still very little to do. The goals are pointless and more like achievements (get 50 people, kill 50 raiders, build every object).My 45 minute experience on the new 'release' included such highlights as:My best tech sufficating because they were outside shooting at nothing, and nothing that I did stopped them (changed role, cuff, send to infirm/brig)The 'holdables' littering that map from the countless people that just 'died' for bugger all reason.A part of my station catching fire, and 5 people dying because I locked the room down and opened it to space to clear the O2. What did everyone do? Jump in their suits and go around through the open door, start fighting the fire AND THEN GET OUT OF THEIR SUITS IN A ROOM WITH NO O2.Fire animation remains after the fire is extingished. Now my base has a bunch of camp fires around it.In a area with 'Very Low' raiders, had 10 raids between new colonists (not including the potental raids in the form of message that I know the answer to to make them not raid)Colonists are still stupidly difficult to please. I have to click through 3 or 4 menus to figure out whats wrong with them.Construction workers die pulling down a wreak because it had a alien in it. The alien attacked and killed a construction worker (who, I would like to point out I cant control to make him run away) dispite that fact that the 'room' the alien was in was open to space along the entire lenght of it. About 15 squares open to space. After killing my construction worker the alien ran FURTHER into the room, and only then was sucked into space.Raiders still use the airlock, which means to beat them: wait until the raiders desuit in airlock > pause > unzone room > lock door to base > open door to space > they get sucked out. There is no reason at all to ever fight these raiders. This is the single best way to beat them. And it sucks.Honestly Ive got like 100 more gripes just from the last 45 minutes I've been playing the new update, but I can sum it all up with:Game sucks. Feel half finished (because it is). Wish I didnt buy it. Dont buy it.			"

They're ""generously"" releasing the LUA code, meaning you can modify the existing game - but not the engine, and there's barely anything there to tinker with and no real emergent situations.Yet another KS/EA grab for cash by Double Fine. Between this, the Broken Age management fiasco and the gross misrepresentation of Brutal Legend in the demo version, Schafer is not getting another dollar of my money.Avoid, do not buy.

												I've logged a lot of time into this game, and pick it up every now and then and play it for stretches at a time. You'd THINK that would lead me to recommend it, but no. I don't recommend this game to purchase.I started playing the prototype that released with the Double Fine prototype bundle, and I really, really enjoyed it. I was so thrilled when the game hit Steam, and couldn't wait to see where it went. Well, it did add features to the prototype game, which I was playing regularly, so in that sense I'm still enjoying it. However, the game is extremely unfinished and buggy. Asking $10 for it is a slap in the face to consumers; they should ask no more than $1 or so for an unfinished game, if that. Basically, I've played more completed games from Pyweek, and that's folks slapping together games in a week -_- All that said, I do like playing this game; I enjoy the space sim aspect, and since I've never really gotten a successful, self-maintaining base running it's sort of a perpetual challenge. But I can't recommend it to others because it's so broken. I'm surprised Double Fine has the balls to keep it in the Steam store at $10.			"

												I recieved this product for owning one of  Double FInes other games, Hack and Slash and for a free product this would have been a great game, but the $9.99 does not justify the lack of content that the developers have put into this game. It was dumped halfway through its production and the developers haven even tried to fix the prooblems everyone has. This game is slightly decent though if you install the fan made patch https://forums.doublefine.com/topic/16066-the-unofficial-v107-patch/ which fixes most of the broblems many people had.Overall this was a fun game for a free experience but the lack of content doesnt even come close to justifying the $9.99 price.

												Being a fan of the old “Tycoon” games and “Theme Hospital” I was really excited about Space Base DF-9. I thought for sure reviewers were being too hard on it, so as soon as I saw it pop up in a Humble Bundle I was ecstatic… But, all of my excitement was for naught. Almost 6 hours wasted and I can pretty well guarantee I will never touch this title again.TL;DR There is a ton of promise here. When the game is running smooth there’s not a lot to complain about (except maybe lack of construction options), but eventually that smooth ride will be over and you’ll realize nothing works like it should, if at all. So while playable you’ll hit a point where the effort to advance isn’t worth it. If you still think you want to punish yourself by playing this game make sure you check out http://www.spacebasehub.net/ for the unofficial patch, the mechanics are still broken but everything else has been improved.In-depth ReviewOverall Gameplay: The basic construction and management section of the game is fairly well done. It’s very similar to “Theme Hospital”, but with a slightly improved interface. That’s where the positives end. So many things are broken that it becomes unnecessarily difficult, and not in a fun, challenging way but in a “oh there’s another thing that doesn’t work right” kind of way. Here are just a few examples of things you’ll see characters do:- Die of suffocation despite being surrounded by rooms with oxygen and having access to an airlock with space suits, - Become incapacitated (not dead, just lying around uselessly) indefinitely. If they’re Raiders they actually might be back up and start killing people!- Be marked for the brig or infirmary but never go there- Scientists not researching (despite being assigned research and having a research station).- Ignore the 3 fire extinguishers near the fire, and instead stomp on it until they catch on fire, then run around the base being ignored by everyone else until they burn to death… Actually that might’ve been the most entertaining part of the game!Presentation: The user interface is easy to navigate but overly simple. You only have 1 save slot and the game auto saves by default, so if you’re not careful it’s quite easy to erase a save game by clicking on the wrong thing and not exiting before it overwrites your game.The graphics are fine. They’re quite obviously a throwback to “Theme Hospital” (how many times can I name dop?). It works well for the genre, and they’re fairly sharp. The sound is outright boring, the music is nothing impressive and off the top of my head I honestly don’t remember any sounds other than that and the chirping alarm if you zoom in far enough.Summary:This game could be so good, but as in so many cases now it looks like the developer took their money and ran. In my love/hate relationship with Early Access this is why the hate portion exists. I’d give it a 3/10, it’s playable and as long as things work right it’s quite enjoyable, but the unpredictable and frustrating broken mechanics make it another EA Trash title. Pick it up in a bundle with some good games or for $1 or less and get a couple hours of fun… But DO NOT, under any circumstances pay any more for it than that. Especially when you could get the vastly superior Theme Hospital and forget this all together.			"

As well, with the current amount of content it's just not worth your time and or money. Thank you for reading my review on SpaceBase DF.Final Score: 4/10 "

												Do not buy this game. It is buggy, unfinished, and will never be finished. Wait until there is a good modding scene, if that ever happens considering how many people have been burned buying this, and then pirate it for yourself.Don't be like me. Don't support Double Fine, don't support early access.			"

												Got this game for free all of the sudden today. So I said, ""why not""? Ive played many isometric strat type games like this and this one is pretty horrible. Right away glitches with people in space suits, glitches with building, glitches glitches glitches. So naturaly I head right to the bugs report / forum for this early access title to report it. Come to find out, its NOT early access. This is it, this is what ""shipped"". I'm going to give it another try just to make sure I wasn't too far off the mark. But ya, it's pretty horrible. Building anything is a chore, rosters are a nice idea but the UI leaves something lacking, te game ""feels"" like a poorly made reboot of an old game I ued to play in the late 90's. (It's actually 90%+ desgined like that game, just poorly executed.) In short: If you get this for free, try it so you know what you wont like in a game. If you paid money for this, i'm sorry. I'm so so sorry.			"

								Can't really recomend at this stage of develpment. Too little to do right now, you just build a larger and larger base until something goes wrong. Not to say that i didn't enjoy the little i played i just found there was not much to do arfter a while. As with all early access games, do NOT but unless you want to actively support the developers.			"

It was ok, there was a decent core game, but there were some bugs/glitches etc.This was when the developers were updating the game.Since that time, there have been very few, limiting updates. To my mind, there is no real point to the game. The whole thing about choosing where to have your base is very cool, but in reality there is little to no difference. There are lots of rooms you can put down, which is great, but I can find nothing to do apart from put all the rooms down and defend myself against the waves of baddies.Which leads us onto another problem: CombatIf I was to be nice, I would say that the combat was... flawed. The truth of the matter is that even when you assign people to security, and give them a place the have to defend, if they are talking or playing a game or eating etc, they will simply ignore you while the baddies are quite happily blowing the c*** out of your base.There are many bugs with game, including the priorities problem as outlined above. This was ok when the game was in development, but now that the developers seems to have abandoned it, there are too many for it to be considered a full game. That basically sums up my review.

												This game could be so much fun but it needs rebalanced and tweaked a bit.  Raiders attack far too often and are too hard to kill before they decimate your base.  Then after one or two such raider attacks all of the citizens fall into a deep depression from having their friends killed that they go on a rampage and make a bad situation even worse.  When this happens the only solution is to abandon the game and start over again.I have tried building a decent base 7 or 8 times at varying locations in space and become equally frustrated each and every time.  I'm done playing this game unless a future update makes it more enjoyable.  Perhaps allow doctors to double as psychiatrists or something.			"

												Like so many have already said, this game was abandoned. They've simply polished the game to look appealing but the game play is downright unpleasant. It's very apparent that some of the decisions that were made in game play should have been better thought out. My advice to the creators: you should have looked to games like Evil Genius to get a better understanding of what's wrong.Some things that bothered me while playing: - no prioritization system in place for construction ( example: watching your workers finish building an empty room before constructing an oxygen recycler can be frustrating, especially when people start asphyxiating)- I watched a worker box themselves into a sealed room and then remove her suit. Instead of finishing the job and building a door to gain access to the base, she preffered to starve to death. In summary, unless you see any news about much more development in this game, don't bother. It's sad to see a game with such potential be abandonned like this.  "

												(I wanted to redo my review for a better viewpoint and whatnot. This review also comes from someone who played early access, and played post realease)I can say, that the concept for this game was great! A spacebase that half the time acts nicely, and runs like clockwork, then raiders show up and wreck s**t up. I was really excited when I heard this, and boughtit in early access. When I bought the game, I thought it was doing quite well for an early access game, and I enjoyed it!But, there were some signs that the game development was having problems. Updates, weeks and sometimes months apart. And these updates were adding barely anything to the game, and even bug fixing was quite slow. The AI, was and still is unbearable. And will do stupid things. The variety of things you can build in specific rooms is extremly limited.And, of course, this game was pushed out the door, being realeased way to early. An example, was that your station's power supply. That was not even a factor until the update before realease. Reasearch was the same story, the update before realease. And the tech tree is pretty much worthless in the game anyway. If you looked at the planned features for this game, they say that they were possible ideas, but some of the content they said were possible are needed in this kind of game!My last words on this are, Don't buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ in fact, don't buy any sort of thing from Double Fine, unless you can at least make sure that production will finish on the game fully2/10- Fun for an hour or two, but no storyline, not enought content, and lack of any new things happening after half an hour of gameplay, makes this game awful. Classic example of why you should buy early access games unless they are dirt cheap and you like the idea, or if you have a undying love in your heart for a concept that someone using early access is trying to make. Long story short- STAY AWAY!!!			"

												Although its been released as ""finished"" the game is still broken as it was in alpha 6, the alleged hundreds of bug fixes are nowhere to be seen and the game is now abandoned, i highly recommend you stay away from it and rather buy Startopia or Space Colony, even though both games are older they are far superior to this when it comes to gameplay and you can be sure you wont run into nearly as many issues than in this game.  Double Fine had no problems lieing to us a few months before the game was abandoned and thus i can only recommend to avoid any Double Fine kickstarters or early access titles. You are better off  investing your money into a company that actualy cares about its customers and finishes what they started.			"

												Bought this on the starting day of Early Access, was so excited for the game. Played for hours until the broken features rendered efforts moot. Planned updates were few and far between, and I kept hope that down the road the finished product would be better. Then the cut=and=burn announcement came from DoubleFine- they'd completely misunderstood the Early Access model and were dumping this game essentially 'as is' and hoping the community of people that were originally excited about it will fix their game for them.On 1.0 release day, I find I now have a gift copy of SpaceBase DF-9 *and* Hack-n-Slash, another of their games I wasn't interested in, as if this solves their failed problem. Pay for the promise of one good game, get two crappy ones instead?No Thanks.This isn't the first time Double Fine has played me for a fool as a customer, but it will be the last.			"

Early Access Review
								The only thing I like about this game is the concept.What I don't like about this game?  Where to begin.  I can start with the big problem I noticed right off the bat.  This game has no tutorial.  I still have not figured out how to start building the base so I can get oxygen, power, and refinement up.  The worst thing about this game is that, even with all of the bugs, the full version has been released.  What this means is that the game has basically been abandoned by the developers.  I wish steam offered refunds, if steam did, I would get a refund for this game immediatly.  To sum up: THIS GAME IS A WAIST OF MONEY.			"

								I only have a couple of early access games because i worry it will fall flat on its face, but i felt confident that double fine would deliver...The 2 hours of play i have is all it took me to complete all of the content they had in the game when i tried it out not that long ago, to find out now they are finishing it and releasing it as a finished game, where they haven't added a whole lot of content shocked me. I'm really disappointed now with DF....shame on them...This game in its present form, is just not worth the money.			"

And most of those they did implement are bugged. I still like the game idea though, hopefully some other company will create a game along those lines that does work and gets finished. This company I will stay away from as their notion of a ""finished"" game and mine are not compatible.			"

								Ignore the claims made on this games page: It is NOT version 1.0, it is Alpha 6.This game WAS going to be glorious! It WAS going to be a testiment to why Early Access works as a promotion system, and the Double Fine let us down by abandoning this title while it was in ALPHA!!This game had so much potential! It had so many great planned features but now they're probably never going to see the light of day. Because of ""Funding Problems"" Double Fine games has decided to stop production and release a stable version of an unfinished game and claim its a full game, it ISNT.Double fine have lost a member of their fan-base with this one, I'm going to be steering clear of them in future, and suggest you do too!

												I have played the game in the last beta, and I have been very disappointed. There were numerous bugs that made entire sections of the space station unusable. I highly doubt they will truly fix all of the bugs in time. The amount of good will this has lost double fine is immeasurable. They're releasing the entire source code for the game shortly at which point there will undoubtedly be many fragmented free versions available. Absolutely, do not buy this abandonware. I can't even imagine where all the money went for this project. This isn't the first project from double fine where the money came up short. Perhaps this is their strongest trait in action: financial mismanagement. I honestly believe if they had continued working on this project for another year it could have been fantastic, but the plug was pulled.They have posted their sob story on the forums, and now I have posted mine in the reviews.

Early Access Review
								Not worth the money.The game started nearly unplayable. The menu system is hard to use, the citizens would run to their own death, it was impossible to keep things repaired, and there was little to do except wait for the inevitable collapse. Too many people in a room? The oxygen drops low and they become unable to leave the room because the game doesn't distinguish pressure from oxygen. Some of the issues were fixed; most were not.Going in, I expected many more features by this point, and for development to continue for at least three years. The game simply did not deliver. Instead of fixing core design issues (like oxygen/pressure not being split, inability to respond to crises, and terrible AI), the developers just added on a few features (like asteroids, which quite simply make the game more annoying) and fixed the easy flaws (like technicians doing lots of damage, flying off to repair derelicts, and taking too long to train).

												While there are still many issues in Spacebase DF-9(such as bugs, outdated graphics, and so on), despite the years of production and work, I understand that this is still an incomplete product. Therefore I am not reviewing this game as a complete product, but rather I am reviewing its creative process. As a building management and construction simulator, Spacebase DF-9 fails the most important criterion in any simulation, uniqueness. Uniqueness is a core aspect in simulation games because it is there in which specialties and creativity come together to make an enjoyable and memorable simulation game. Examples of popular simulation games are Goat Simulator, The Sims, and Train Simulator, which all can be easily identified by each of their unique points. That being said, it is hard to find unique points in Spacebase DF-9. As I am writing this review, in trying to remember things that were unique I find myself fixated more on the bugs than actual gameplay. Overlooking the bugs, let me break down the gameplay. You build a base, gather resources, and make the base bigger and repeat. You have raiders that attack your base but they don’t present a threat if you properly maintain security. You have asteroid showers that happen every once in a while that start fires and destroy structures such as walls and they need to be patched up. You will get transmissions every once in a while so that people can move in, attack, or attach themselves to the base. The difficulty ramps up as your base becomes larger and more populated; you have to keep track of people’s morale, energy consumption, and security.  That is about it. As I have stated earlier, it lacks uniqueness. The simulation itself is very basic and there seems to be a large amount of creative work in creating the characters. Unfortunately, the programmers made the characters expandable, having them die very easily and having a lot of them makes the characters feel insignificant and therefore, their uniqueness insignificant. As a simulation, this game will not stand out in sales or reviews unless the creative department decides to do some major reworking. Furthermore if unchanged and published, this game will stand out as one of many examples of morale hazard in pre-release gaming.   Note: As I was about to post this I realized that this game was published a year ago. I could not fathom that a game this unpolished and lacking in content could be deemed complete by anyone who took pride in their work. In the end, it seems that DoubleFine just took everyone’s money and fled.  "

Early Access Review
								This is a potentially really good game. It does have the feeling of the old ""Theme XYZ"" games, and it has an overal oldschool feel, which is greatly appreciated.The graphics are neat, gameplay is potentially superb and endless, there even is some subtle, underlying humour which makes life in space more tolerable. The audio is also fairly standard, but fitting and nice.Unfortunately, at this early stage of development, the game is nigh unplayable. The AI is just, well, close to non-existant. ""Events"" are a tad too catastrophic and can easily lead to total failure (usually because AI doesn't do what it's supposed to, though). There is very little control over the space station's inhabitants' actions, there is no way to prioritize tasks. Occasional bugs will result in a lot of citizens dying for random reasons (eg, can't open a perfectly functioning door, or they won't come back from space when low on oxygen, and so on), whose corpses nobody will remove (again, AI failure). I'd say the AI  is what really needs some tweaking, right now.All in all, the game has a very nice backbone and quite some flesh, along with a few interesting quirks, but needs a lot (A LOT) of polishing yet. I recommend you try this game with this in mind.			"

												First let me say this: I have a very deep love for Dwarf Fortress. I absolutely adore that game so I have bought almost every dwarf fortressesque game on early access.However, this game: Spacebase DF-9 is not a good game. Why? Several reasons, but most relate to really bad controls. To build stuff or select or anything is really fiddily because it has a hard time registrating where the mouse is pointing on the grid - so you have a really hard game just controlling the damn game. Also the UI is hard to understand sometimes. The citizens all have their own individual ""twitter feeds"" where they write what the think of your space station, but the problem is that it's hard to understand exactly what their problems are. The game is also very unbalanced so it's hard to get a space base running and the nature of space means that it's important to make sure that you build correctly the first time. More so than in dwarf fortress where you can occasionally correct mistakes or convert rooms. Here your items often take more than 1 space on a grid so you'll find that its harder to convert rooms to other things. Also the rooms needs to be substantially bigger and you cannot put stuff like beds beside walls because they need all of the bed's adjacent squares to be free.EDIT: It has been a long time since the developers decided to abandon this project. I think I speak for all of us who bought this game when I say that we're all deeply disappointed in them. We all think it's a scam, and that it was not finished like it should have been. They never fixed the interface or the controlling problems. Stay away from this scam if  you  know what's good for you.			"

Now that the devs are pushing for a 1.0 release in October then discontinuing production and leaving it up to modders to attempt to 'finish' their game for them is disgraceful.Do not buy this game and do not support any other/future Double Fine productions; this was the biggest slap in the face to their fans and supporting customers.

Not only is this game overpriced for what you get, but there is no plan to finish the game.

Why im sure its not intentional to fail in the development of the game, the fact they are gonna still release it as a finished project just screams ""I dont care if i scam the uninformed out of there money"".In its current stage, its nothing more then a series of game breaking bugs, and the devs dont care if you throw money at it.

												As a long time fan of Double Fine it hurts me to say that you all should be ashamed of yourself.Not because you betrayed your word, which you did. Not because you essentially scammed loyal fans out of money, which you did. Not because the game is incomplete, which it is. Not because you botched the project at the expense of your fans, which you did.You should be ashamed because you have hurt the entire industries trust and faith in early access, small developers, and where to trust developers.I understand not all early access projects work out, I understand that buying into early access is a risk. This however was pure deception on behalf of the developers.You don't deserve to be distributed on Steam and you don't deserve my money ever again. Shame on you Double Fine you lost a fan, a supporter and revenue.-Adding to this review in hopes it will bump it now that it's been released and on sale. I cannot warn anyone off this game thoroughly enough, if you are considering purchasing this now that its been ""completed"", you are being swindled. Do not purchase this game. Purchase literaly anything else. --Adding again, now that 1.0 has been released DF has given a free copy of Hack'N'Slash to people who supported this game. You think we're all going to be bought off that easily? I'm not playing any doublefine games, even free ones. Get it together Double Fine, an apology would go a long way.-			"

They take the money and run, apparently. I will no longer purchase Early Access games from DoubleFine, nor will I trust Steam's Early Access program anymore, considering they are still selling this game.			"

								Listen, This game was full of good ideas. They had a good plan to make a game, were on track, development was slow. Double Fine Productions has shown that they once were capable to make new games. They have decided to end the development of this game while it is incomplete and call it complete. That is not good, that is taking all trust people had with your products and throwing it into the trash. I do not recommend anyone buy this game, and if this game were like $5.00 it would still cost too much for the content you are getting.			"

All of the features that they had planned on doing just disappeared.This game might be acceptable in the future if any modding community exists that is willing to develop further, but it is unlikely.

								The biggest waste of potential I've seen in a very long time.  The game itself, while incomplete and a buggy mess was addictive and fun and looked forward to every new update, though they came slowly.  Now that the devs are pushing for a 1.0 release in October then discontinuing production and leaving it up to modders to attempt to 'finish' their game for them is disgraceful.Do not buy this game and do not support any other/future Double Fine productions; this was the biggest slap in the face to their fans and supporting customers.

								It's a little insulting that the version 1.0 announcement is worded as if the game will be successfully completed as planned. The simple fact is it's anything but complete, and certainly not worth the price they're asking.Of course, I could be wrong. Perhaps they have some hidden treasure trove of unreleased code that contains the laundry list of unimplemented features and bug fixes. Or maybe the developer planned for it to be an unfinished, buggy mess all along and was banking on the sudden addition of mod support to make up for it.			"

								This game is a scam and should be removed from steam.It's sad really, to see the route this game took. It seemed rather fun, even had great potential for what the devs were promoting it to be. However, I do not recommend anyone buys this game. Not only is this game overpriced for what you get, but there is no plan to finish the game. (although im not sure they intended to lose faith in the project)The devs have basically announced they are cutting all funding to it, and are planning to release it as a finished game, even though its not. Why im sure its not intentional to fail in the development of the game, the fact they are gonna still release it as a finished project just screams ""I dont care if i scam the uninformed out of there money"".In its current stage, its nothing more then a series of game breaking bugs, and the devs dont care if you throw money at it. None of the money will go into fixing the game. DONT BUY THIS GAME!			"

												As a long time fan of Double Fine it hurts me to say that you all should be ashamed of yourself.Not because you betrayed your word, which you did. Not because you essentially scammed loyal fans out of money, which you did. Not because the game is incomplete, which it is. Not because you botched the project at the expense of your fans, which you did.You should be ashamed because you have hurt the entire industries trust and faith in early access, small developers, and where to trust developers.I understand not all early access projects work out, I understand that buying into early access is a risk. This however was pure deception on behalf of the developers.You don't deserve to be distributed on Steam and you don't deserve my money ever again. Shame on you Double Fine you lost a fan, a supporter and revenue.-Adding to this review in hopes it will bump it now that it's been released and on sale. I cannot warn anyone off this game thoroughly enough, if you are considering purchasing this now that its been ""completed"", you are being swindled. Do not purchase this game. Purchase literaly anything else. --Adding again, now that 1.0 has been released DF has given a free copy of Hack'N'Slash to people who supported this game. You think we're all going to be bought off that easily? I'm not playing any doublefine games, even free ones. Get it together Double Fine, an apology would go a long way.-			"

								This is a potentially really good game. It does have the feeling of the old ""Theme XYZ"" games, and it has an overal oldschool feel, which is greatly appreciated.The graphics are neat, gameplay is potentially superb and endless, there even is some subtle, underlying humour which makes life in space more tolerable. The audio is also fairly standard, but fitting and nice.Unfortunately, at this early stage of development, the game is nigh unplayable. The AI is just, well, close to non-existant. ""Events"" are a tad too catastrophic and can easily lead to total failure (usually because AI doesn't do what it's supposed to, though). There is very little control over the space station's inhabitants' actions, there is no way to prioritize tasks. Occasional bugs will result in a lot of citizens dying for random reasons (eg, can't open a perfectly functioning door, or they won't come back from space when low on oxygen, and so on), whose corpses nobody will remove (again, AI failure). I'd say the AI  is what really needs some tweaking, right now.All in all, the game has a very nice backbone and quite some flesh, along with a few interesting quirks, but needs a lot (A LOT) of polishing yet. I recommend you try this game with this in mind.			"

												I have played the game in the last beta, and I have been very disappointed. There were numerous bugs that made entire sections of the space station unusable. I highly doubt they will truly fix all of the bugs in time. The amount of good will this has lost double fine is immeasurable. They're releasing the entire source code for the game shortly at which point there will undoubtedly be many fragmented free versions available. Absolutely, do not buy this abandonware. I can't even imagine where all the money went for this project. This isn't the first project from double fine where the money came up short. Perhaps this is their strongest trait in action: financial mismanagement. I honestly believe if they had continued working on this project for another year it could have been fantastic, but the plug was pulled.They have posted their sob story on the forums, and now I have posted mine in the reviews.

								Not worth the money.The game started nearly unplayable. The menu system is hard to use, the citizens would run to their own death, it was impossible to keep things repaired, and there was little to do except wait for the inevitable collapse. Too many people in a room? The oxygen drops low and they become unable to leave the room because the game doesn't distinguish pressure from oxygen. Some of the issues were fixed; most were not.Going in, I expected many more features by this point, and for development to continue for at least three years. The game simply did not deliver. Instead of fixing core design issues (like oxygen/pressure not being split, inability to respond to crises, and terrible AI), the developers just added on a few features (like asteroids, which quite simply make the game more annoying) and fixed the easy flaws (like technicians doing lots of damage, flying off to repair derelicts, and taking too long to train).

												I honestly thought other reviewers were being a little too harsh and demanding in their comments, and as a big fan of Double Fine, I thought I'd still enjoy this game. Boy was I wrong.It looks amazing, and the idea is fantastic! But the game IS indeed unfinished.

								I really want to like this game, because it seems to want to have so many elements that I like in games - however it is ultimately so frustrating and hard (not difficult) that I inevitably put it down after a short while.  One of the very basic problems is that the 'dangers' feel too contrived.  One starts playing and within a period of time there will be a 'space debris strike' aimed at your balls.  This doesn't feel like randomness, it feels like designers clutching at introducing adversity.  The other problem is that the AI in the game is suicidal at best.  While building structures they will seal themselves into rooms with no air, or no exits.  They will do stupid things such as ignore danger when someone is shooting at them while building or destroying structures.    Also and finally the game's biggest problem of all is that there is no 'border.'  Enemies enter anywhere on the base by attacking in the faux-3d of the game's world.  This means that there is no safe area, no main gate or wall.  The bigger your base gets, the more likely you are to suffer an attack or air leak where you can't contain it and you'll lose half of your crew to something utterly stupid.All in all, I keep starting the game but then I quit in disgust and frustration,  I see what they are trying to do, but it just feels very unsatisfying and annoying to me.  I'll try again later and report back with the new builds. "

												I honestly thought other reviewers were being a little too harsh and demanding in their comments, and as a big fan of Double Fine, I thought I'd still enjoy this game. Boy was I wrong.It looks amazing, and the idea is fantastic! But the game IS indeed unfinished. It offers no goals that keep you excited about what's next, such as unlocking new rooms and items as you progress. There's no campaign, no mission, nothing. You get what you get at the start of the game (and it is ridiculously little), and that's that.

												This game is not merely incomplete, not merely flawed, it is magnificently flawed. It is the crack in a marble statue which serves to accentuate the glorious beauty of the whole. It is ""the flaw as art"". The game it pretends to be, that of building and managing a space station, is a mere cover. What it really is, is a grand commentary on the futility of existence, a plucky crew doomed to be obliterated by the forces of a cruel and uncaring universe, inevitably descending into madness and all-consuming rage, smashing the very machinery that keeps them alive with their bloodied fists in inchoate rebellion against an ethereal tormenter. Your base, which showed such promise, such hope, a seed among the scattered stars, will inevitably become a corpse-choked space necropolis, asphyxiated space pirates drifting, mixed with your own crew's plague-riddled forms in a macabre embrace, a scene of terror and death ruled over by the killbots which inevitably turn up to breach the fragile hull that protects your base from the endless night.And that is just the tutorial level.

												Spacebase DF9 is a space management simulator where a small pod of astronauts set out to create a new space colony. You have to manage oxygen, food, jobs and the happiness of your intergalactic residents. As you progress, you will need to continue expanding to make space for new residents. The game had the potential to become an enjoyable simulator, but fell short in so many ways. PROS: The graphics are decent. The sound is fitting for the game. Most of the astronauts are not human, they are alien, making for more interesting looking characters. CONS: The game is very repetitive. After only an hour of gameplay, all the messages are the same, all your residents are saying the same things, everyone behaves the same etc. The game is severely lacking in variety. The A.I. is brutally stupid. Your colony can die because your mechanic is to depressed to fix the oxygen generators, killing everyone. There is quite a limited amount of things to build. Once you build each type of room, all you can do is keep making the same things as more astronauts arrive. No matter what, the gameplay is boring after the first hour or so. There is a lot of waiting, even when you speed things up. When you encounter problems, there is a fixed solution to deal with them. It gets even more boring and repetitive when you are forced to do the same steps continuously as the game progresses. It all comes down to is repetitiveness and a loss of interest. The game could be so much better if there were more scenarios and problems and multiple unique strategies to use. Unfortunately, this game is not worth the price when there are so many better alternatives available.			"

												Spacebase does well enough for what it is - an alpha build rushed to release - but it lacks the strategic depth that a simulation needs in order to keep the player's interest. It doesn't even have enough pretty distractions to make up for the spartan gameplay. This is the kernel of a game that could have been great, but unfortunately that game will never be completed.On the plus side, Spacebase remarkably stable. I experienced no bugs, glitches, or crashes.A tip for those frustrated by raiders: build at least one turret in every room and leave them deactivated when not needed. When raiders attack, simply activate the necessary turrets and seal the doors. No muss, no fuss. Don't bother claiming derelicts; they are difficult to defend. Rather, explore them to acquire new crew members or loot and then let them disappear.In its current and final state, Spacebase is definitely not worth $20; I would not recommend this game at any price other than ""free"" (I got a complimentary copy with my Hack 'n' Slash purchase).

								The point this game was abandoned at left it with nothing. They claim they were operating at a loss producing the game, and that we can't expect them to produce a game from their own pockets. That is exactly how every game was made ten years ago. It's shamefull they undertook this with no plan for funding their own undertaking beyond taking our money and falling short.The game itself is not worth anything. It is to buggy and predictable to play and recieve anything aside from frustration. It had enormous potential.It may one day be something if dilligent modders shape the gutted husk it is. I feel bitter at the thought of others paying money to double fine for the sweat off the backs of talented modders. Better to donate money to such modders should they arise; and come by a copy in whatever means doesn't pay double fine for their lazy greed built folly.On a side note pay them for their successes in other games, as they do many good titles.

								A great concept squandered by mismanagement. The game is buggy and has extremely shallow gameplay.I played the early prototype of this game that I got with HumbleBundle's Amnesia Fortnight bundle, I liked it the concept but it was clearly in very early stages. Sadly, what we have now is not very different, even though the graphics have been improved.DoubleFine was looking to cash in on games like Prison Architect. They even said as much themselves. They got investors involved (and successfully paid them off with the huge volume of Steam customers) and then when it wasn't as hot as they wanted, they cut development, did some more sales to lure in a few more suckers and then pulled the plug. In that order.Most of the people who hadn't bought it yet were waiting for beta or full release, but DoubleFine wanted to make all their money up front. Their business model for this title depended on it, and it is a flawed and presumptuous business model that screws over the consumer.""Obviously, spending more money than we were making isn’t something we can afford to do forever."" - Tim SchaferConsidering that in traditional gave development the developer puts in all the work up front, making the investment in themselves to deliver a great product. In this case, we, the consumer took all the risk. And they took none, while never intended to deliver a full game if it wasn't a pre-release hit with a cult following. Does this sound like a sane sustainable business plan to you? Well, if it does, then congratulations your name is Tim. And Tim, we can't afford to keep spending money on products that never materialize.I own Prison Architect and its a much more complete game, I recommend getting that instead. It lacks the character and personality of DF-9 and the setting and style is radically different, but its clear that they share the same underlying concept.			"

								I was really excited about this game, I always wanted to get into Dwarf Fortress but I can't deal with the obtuse interface, so this looked great. As it is, you should buy Clockwork Empires instead.I'm really disappointed that devs are abandoning this. I understand why, but they gave no indication that the game was running over budget before they suddenly pulled the plug. If you're going to link a game's development explicitly to sales, tell people, instead of pulling the rug out later from those who have invested in it.			"

								Spacebase DF-9 is a fun interesting concept of a game, but unfortinitly that's all it will ever be. While what is in the game is fun the game is far from being a full game and will be released as such relying on modders to finish the game.  If this barely more then a prototype costed more around the $5-10 range then I would say its definitly worth picking up for that price even though it will never be a full game, but at a $25 price point I can not reccomend this game. Hopefully Doublefine doesn't keep with the trend they are on right now between this game being abandoned and who knows how long it will be untill the second half of Broken Age. Hack 'N Slash was pretty good, but I don't want to see Massive Chalice fall to the abandoned development that Doublefine seems to be doing because Massive Chalice looks like a interesting concept of mixing the reboot of XCom with having your soldiers inheirt good and bad traits (possibly just one side or the other depending on hidden dice rolls) from previous soldiers you retire.

Early Access Review
								This game is an example of how bad the Early Access model can be. The plan of the developer, Double Fine, was to fund the development from the start with the sales of the (prototype of the) game, reduce drastically their initial investment, and hope that their good name and promises on how they imagined the final game were enough to attract customers. The 'experiment' failed completely because most people interested in the game were holding their purchase to see how the developers were updating the game. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure, in which due to the lack of sales the developers were not able to assign more efforts to the game and, at the same time, exactly that slow development was the reason behind the low amount of sales.To come to an end to this grotesque scenario, Double Fine decided to stop the development and release the game as it is currently. The game is still in its bare bones and the experience is lacking in many areas, but they will create a tutorial, tools to create mods, and hope for a nonexistent community to continue its development.About me: I've been a big fan of Double Fine games during the last years. I loved Psychonauts and Monkey Island, funded the Kickstarter of Broken Age and enjoyed other games like Costume Quest, Stacking or The Cave. This is the first dissapointment. It has destroyed the trust that I had in DF and, in the future, I will behave with them as if they are an unknown dev without credentials. I will investigate with caution about their games before buying or I will simply ignore them. Also, I won't buy any Early Access games and advice others to do the same.			"

												I bought this game via greenlight thinking the developers were committed to providing the vision for the game. They stated themselves on their forum before Alpha 6.""Double Fine is not a random fly-by-night indie dev and we are not going to silently pull the plug on Spacebase or any other in-development project. Doing so would be disastrous for our reputation and it would kill us emotionally"" by JP LeBreton @ Double Fine.Oh wait what has happened going from Alpha 6 to 1.0 Release without a Beta. It looks like the developers didnt realise greenlight didnt mean everyone would buy it pre-release and seemingly they have ran out of money. They are to release 1.0 soon so wait at least until that so you can find out what has actually made it into the game.It is a shame because this was looking like a very good little game, but now its to be left to modders to finish. As I don't really have time to search for mods as I kind of play games quickly between jobs, this looks like I'll have to write-off this game as a loss.See TotalBiscuits critique on the matter below.

												Plenty of potential, squandered either by the negligence or incompetence of the studio. This is a game that will forever exist in an alpha state. Stable perhaps, but lacking the loads of content that ended up on the cutting room floor when Double Fine ran out of money.This is only part of a game.

												I really want to like this game, despite it's flaws (it's ceased dev, pre-alpha). However the end game is always the same... even if you manage to survive the constant onslaught of raiders, and space diseases, bodies persist long after death... and corpses have a detrimental affect on crew morale which can prevent crew from wanting to enter areas where these bodies are (which can prevent maintenance and production), or crew end up rioting among themselves. It's a massive shame because it had a lot of potential. If the community gets behind this game and manage to produce mods to fix major issues, then I'd recommend it, but as it stands atm it's only worth a punt if it's going cheap.			"

This game was early access and had private funding so is safe to say ""Shafter"" cant run a bath never mind a company as he ran outa excuses and cut and ran from the game after promising such a thing would ""kill them emotionally"" so you can safely say announcing the game will be released after only alpha 6 days after a sale on the game they were pretty dead inside to begin with but hell we lost money they made money what does ""Shafter"" care about it			"

								Its a nice game, i like the survival systems and all but still.I really like and enjoy the game but still could use ''Some'' fixing.LIKE.Space station got whiped out by one raider, and i had 1 to 8 people.There are very very! rare people that are brave.I dont really see the logic in that 1 versus 8 thing and the 8 good people loose.and a other thing is like that the people keep fleeing around like patatoes even though the alarm is on AND they are getting shot. It would be cool if brave or some what brave people could be more around much more then 1% chance, its really a 1% chance. :PBut still if those things weren't there, i would enjoy it even more then now!

												This game had so much potential. Go ahead and watch Scott Manly play this game on youtube. It was early access and it was shaping up to be a pretty decent Dwarf Fortress style game, but in space. Progress was made, bugs were clipped, and features added on a fairly regular basis, it had every indication that it was an early access game being developed in good faith for your investment. For whatever reason it got frozen, and released, unfinished, warts and all for the world. That's why you see so many negative reviews. This game isn't done, it makes no pretensions to being done, don't buy it unless you are fully aware what it is you are getting, and you don't have any lighters around to burn 10 bucks.			"

												Game showed such promise. I enjoyed what the game was shaping up to be. Loved the premise and enjoyed it and watching it grow.Unfortunately, the game is now ABANDONWARE. I do not recommend purchasing this game unless you can accept the game in an unfinished 40% state the game is in. It is fun, but there is little content, the AI is crap, and will wear out on it fast due to odd bugs and little content.While I do understand when games have to be abandoned, with the new Early Access system, this is one many people got burned, and burned bad with. What was supposed to occur with the game, and what actually happened, were narrow. They released the game from Early Access and called that that. Did a few fast patches to shut people up about the big items and continued on their way. The dollar signs weren't big in front of Doublefine's eyes apparently, and took what they had and ran. I wish Steam would have forced their hands in this situation, but didn't, and Doublefine continues along its way like nothing happened.I'm even more disappointed with Doublefine that they put it on sale right before they terminated development (And I can't imagine them NOT knowing they were going to can it a couple weeks before they did) and continue to sell it with no disclaimer anywhere on the Steam page that it is abandonware and no longer being worked on, AND have also put it for sale as if it's still being acknowledged.I will not purchase another Doublefine title (or anyone who is part of their team if they move on again) in prerelease, and I am GREATLY nervous about buying a title from them ever again.

												I love the concept of this game, but for me there are too many flaws. Raiding parties too early in the game with higher tech weaponry when you haven't got enough time to build your base to defend yourself.The time it takes to switch jobs for characters. I had a builder and needed security quickly, my base was overrun with raiders and my builder/security just carried on building in his security suit.The rate my citizens get peeved or bored. How do I get these ratings back up??The lack of scenic items to raise the morale of the citizensI'll probably keep at this game, playing it and trying out different techniques, but I can't see the level of difficulty changing in relation to raiding parties. I even placed my base in an area where it was ridiculously low for threats, but in three different games got attacked within an hour of setting up a base. I could be playing the game totally wrong, but if that's the case the tutorials need to be more informative.			"

								At the moment, don't buy the game. That doesn't mean don't pay attention to it, just don't put your money into it at this juncture.  The AI pathing is questionable at best (space requirments for individuals to navigate around larger items within the base is different considering the dimensions available). AI would rather sleep then do a job you have assigned them to; AI get's stuck within a structure with no doors or other forms of escape after you ask them to build it. Way too many individuals ask to your base than you are obviously ready for (I had over 10 within the first 15-20 minutes in one play attempt). The mechanics are fantastic. I will personaly be continuing to attempt playing this game, but can't recommend it to others that haven't already paid for the alpha.			"

Early Access Review
								Spacebase DF-9 looked quite interesting, from the Dwarf Fortress-esque room management to the quirky characters and random event system.  Unfortunately, it hasn't had a significant content upgrade since I initially saw it months ago on an Evening with Sips episode or short series.  What is in this game is a wide gamut of bugs combined with sheer stupidity when it comes to the AI, arguably the most important part of the game, and they screwed it up.Not being able to build rooms, place objects, or cancel construction orders without having to move the camera around until the game sees fit to finally let your commands go through was the most common bug, and it persisted in being terrible from the moment I tried to start building a base to my eventual giving up on the game.  Random events seem to pull from a pool of maybe 5 different things, the most frequent of which was a ship encounter that featured a squeal along the lines of ""EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! WE FINALLY FOUND YOU!!!!!!!!  WE'RE COMING ABOARD THIS INSTANT!"" to which no matter whether you select to allow them on or not, you are forced to take on additional crew members, all of which will be more of a liability than a help due to their universally crap skills.  This will culminate in your base having to constantly expand its oxygen suppliers and eventually even building a second reactor, just to provide for these new idiots while avoiding losing your valuable crew members to oxygen deprivation as the wastes of space use it all up.Oh, and if you want to expand your oxygen room to make space for more recyclers, or any room in fact, make sure you set the entire station to become builders.  Because when you have four builders dismantle a wall, immediately head back into the base to go to sleep, and refuse to build the floor in place of the wall you just tore down, your entire base will asphyxiate and your builders will sleep themselves to death, dooming the entire station.  Absolute rubbish prioritizing and programming.Do not buy this game.  Do not buy Early Access games.  Early Access games are a plague on Steam and should not be allowed a store page or a sale until they have a finished product.			"

Early Access Review
								I remember first encountering this game during Amnesia Fortnight 2012, Double Fine's crowdfunded event in which they put out a series of rapid prototypes to test out a bunch of different game ideas.I'm going to bottom line this for you: the game hasn't evolved significantly beyond what was originally shown off as a rapid development prototype nearly two years ago. Updates are slow and add to the backend with new features that increase complexity, but don't actually add content or meaningful gameplay in any way. Worse, the developers have completely removed the ""Future development plans"" backlog from their website with no explanation. This is to say nothing of the numerous game breaking bugs and brick-dumb AI which have survived for release after release.And yet I could deal with all of that if the game were fun to play... but it's not. Games like its inspiration, Dwarf Fortress, are fun because of their emergent gameplay - the stories and situations which unfold around you are completely unique to each playthrough, creating a different experience every time you play. This frankly isn't true in DF-9, at least in its current state. Fire up the game and start on a random map and you'll have built and encountered everything there is to see in around an hour; there's no point in starting a new game since the same story unfolds every time.

								I can't recommend this game.It has a lot of potential and I'd really love to see it done. I also really like the ideas the devs have.BUT and that is a huge but...... I purchased this game like a trillion years ago and hoped for updates. But there are just minor ones like nothing happened.I feel a bit ripped off, because in the state it is, it is not really playable. The AI is just dumb as hell and it gets really frustrating (the citizens are like lemmings).And after a short time you have done everything there is to do. I'd say after a 100 minutes you have seen everything and it gets to the point where you are just tweaking your base or you are eager to fight the trials caused by bugs. I really tried to befriend with this game the way it is but it just gets worse, because the unfinished state and slow development starts to aggravate me more and more.Also there are a lot of known bugs, but they fix them really late or never. Who knows? The devs prefer to remain silent about nearly everything. I just read something about “We’re nearing our goals and the complete state of the game is not far away”, so I decided to write this and warn everyone about this. The way it is, this game could be a free to play iPad thing. I'd pay about 4-7$ for this max, given that I wouldn't know what I know now.For all the people, who think I'm just being pessimistic:Look at their Website, or the updates here at Steam. It seems like they are releasing updates labeled as huge success, which are little more than some minor bug-fixes (or sometimes a bunch of new ones adding to the old ones).  And you can't know whats to come, because the devs decided to delete the ""Future developement plans""-website, which is a huge issue for me and just another indicator, that this game is dead and light years from being finished.

												Spacebase DF-9 would have been a great game, but doublefine abandoned there project, as soon as they had enough money to make another game. For this reason I will never buy another game from doublefine and I hope other people do the same. Doublefine even now consideres this broken and unfinished game a finished product, and spits in the face of early access supporters.			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATE http://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791434732506/announcements/detail/216494030200824180Game is being pushed out the door half finished. DO NOT BUY. Most promised features never  materialized and game is shallow and broken as of 9/19/2014Slow dev, NO communication now, and after nearly a year and maybe 5 updates a complete waste of your time, money, and sanity.This game will never ship - it'll just drag on at a third of the pace of any other game (with a pro studio, I might add) while the devs make excuses like some kid who lost their homework.I'm done screwing around with this - Doublefine may be a good studio but this team is a bunch of slow, excuse making hacks who are in absolutely no rush to make this game (and I suspect the money for it is going to other projects.)Don't buy this game, even on sale. It's not worth it - there are MANY better Dwarf Fortress style games out there who's devs are actually engaged in their craft/jobs. Doublefine screwed the pooch on this one, hard.			"

												I backed this game when it was still in development.  I was really looking forward to a diet-dwarf-fortess-in-space type experience.  Unfortunately, the game was nixxed before it really got much out of an alpha state. The developers did manage to release a fairly playable game (having gone from ver.6 to 1.0 in under a month) and have since released several patches (on ver 1.06 now.)  I cannot recommend the game as it stands at this price point.  Maybe if you see it on sale for $5 or so and you want to mess around a bit, but there's no depth of play here.  There are many other sim-type games out there that are worth investing both the time and money in.			"

It will never be finshed.I bought this game cause it was a great early access concept and game. But its now fully released and its still as it was an alpha.Its unfinshed other than that.It plays well, great concept and idea of running your own space station from scratch and watching it crumble cause you let one person in or broke the wrong wall or no fire extingushers. You pick a spot in the galaxy hoping to find a perfect place for mining and saftey.Its fun but its unfinshed.Hey its got a 100% mod support cause the devs abandoned it and released the soruce code hopping modders will clean up their unfinshed promises.So if its cheap ok go ahead have some fun, but its more unfished than rust.At least rust have a chance of being finshed though, this will never however.

												This game has a lot of promise as a building / management / simulator for space stations but right now it's more of a tech demo. I will definitely take another look once it gets further along in its development cycle but as of right now it doesn't have much that you can really do in it yet.It has various props that could do something in the future (like a reactor) but currently the only real bit of management you have to do is mining and a little building (plus the occassional raider). You can't fortify your defenses really nor can you customize the space station as much as I would expect from a building management game. I'd pass on this game until it gets more content and substance.			"

												Saw all the negative press for the game, so I waited until it was less than $5. Wow it is really sad to see how AMAZING this could have been with, like, an extra year of indie development. Or, hell, maybe even just a few months more.The art is great and the mechanics work fine. It's hard at first, but then you get your base starting to work, some hydroponics, a nice little bar, and your colonists go from mildly sad to somewhat happy.*Then* what?They added in these achievements but they don't feel worth the effort. The colonists have tons of traits and thoughts and everything, but ... What do they amount to? Why should I care? They don't really affect anything other than how pissy they get over time.Raiders stomped my first base, but then I realized I just need a turret minding the entrance, and boom, problem almost entirely solved.There are so few objects, with so little placing options, you can't even really decorate it. The colonists don't even mop up blood from fights that break out.I understand now why everyone was so disappointed. I just don't understand why they would make such a fantastic foundation, if they weren't gonna build on it.I give it 4 sad faces out of 4. Couldn't even keep me mildly amused for more than a few hours (the rest was added on when I paused it to get up and go AFK for a bit).			"

												This quote is from someone called Rhadamant posted on steam forums before Spacebase was announced ""finished"". I complete agree with what he has said. This thread is no longer available.Title: ""Clearly Vaporware""Originally posted by Rhadamant:""A person on the spacebase df-9 forums asked if this game was abandoned back on August 17th. It took over two days for a person NOT on the spacebase DF-9 team to even notice the post and say'Hey - heck yeah Spacebase is still in development! I'm not on the team, but JP and co are working hard on the next update and I think you'll hear more about it soon.'Clearly this game is vapourware, another developer abusing the early access system. Go spend your money on another indie game, that has proper monthly updates. Even if they release an update, it'll be four months since the last one. Prison Architect and RimWorld and a dozen other proper indie games have got monthly updates of ACTUAL content, not the tiny micro-updates of Spacebase where gameplay is not affected at all."" "

												Ugh. All Spacebase needed was time, and that's exactly what ran out. This is a great concept for a game. Build and manage a space outpost with a focus on resource & personnel management and design. It has a great, fun art style, and a cheeky sense of humor. It's also abandoned, unfinished, and now, unloved. Double Fine mismanaged this project from the start, and the result is a ""game"" that has no goal, no progression, and few failure conditions. A ""simulation"" where there is little beyond the most basic needs management that can be solved in a few minutes, with no further complexity or depth to ever grow. A ""product"" that's buggier than The Temple of Doom. If you're really curious to look at what happens when a game project gets aborted but somehow thrown at the public, stillborn, then pick this game up and watch as the first few promising minutes of fun fade into unoptimized monotony. If not, stay away and check out either Cosmonautica for a similar ""Silly Space"" atmosphere, or Startopia for a better Spaceport management simulation.			"

												To be honest, I was entirely satisifed with it's progress as it was being made. Fairly reguar updates adding lots of new content and improvements... and then out of nowhere they ""launched"" straight from Alpha. I have to imagine that this was a hard choice on their part, and left a lot of hard working devs sad that they'd never get to see the finished product. It can be fun, but it's not nearly finished and super buggy, so while I apprecate the effort, I couldn't advise spending more than 5 dollars on it max.			"

												I backed this game when it was still in development.  I was really looking forward to a diet-dwarf-fortess-in-space type experience.  Unfortunately, the game was nixxed before it really got much out of an alpha state. The developers did manage to release a fairly playable game (having gone from ver.6 to 1.0 in under a month) and have since released several patches (on ver 1.06 now.)  I cannot recommend the game as it stands at this price point.  Maybe if you see it on sale for $5 or so and you want to mess around a bit, but there's no depth of play here.  There are many other sim-type games out there that are worth investing both the time and money in.			"

								I do not recommend buying this game. It is being rushed out as a ""final build"" because they have no more money to develop it but make no mistake it is VERY much still in an alpha, feature-incomplete state, and no further updates are coming. DoubleFine have ripped a large number of us off, even accepting the risks of Early Access as we did.			"

												I have mix feelings with this game, i really enjoy it, i've spend a lot of time playing it, and I feel that if the devolperers have not abandoned it could turn out to be the best space base management sim ever.... it's too sad it's basically abandonware.Imagine theme hospital, one of my favorite games as a child, but in a space setting.... you build the base, gather resources from asteroids, set defenses against space pirates.... it's so fun in so many ways. BUT.... Keep in mind before buying this game, that this is an alpha.... a really good alpha, but the game is never going to be finished, so actually there's no campain missions, no goals, no achievements, and lot of features not in game, the random ""encounters"" get repetitive after a while....  in the end you'll end with a big well armed base, and nothing to do but let the time fastfoward till the next ""event"" .... it makes me angry cause the core of the gameplay it's wonderful.yes there's a ""user-made"" update, that fix some things, adds a thing or two (like the happy bot) and also adds bugs (example.. update adds the squad mode for your security personel, cool.... game crashed if you disband a squad, not cool), in the end,  still feels like an alpha, so if you think that the user made path will make the game complete... it's not gonna happen. So be wary.That´s really sad because what is done here...  it's done in a beautiful way, so much potential wasted...And that´s the risk and problem with Double Fine, on one hand they make wonderful out-of-the-box ideas, games with a lot of charm, funny, different from anything else on the market ... on the other.... they have failed the customer more than once before (Broken Age anyone?)Ill update this review if the User-made path is updated and the game gets better.

There are numerous game-breaking bugs and bad ai behaviors that don't seem to be getting fixed, and a number of systems that might do something on day (power generation, happiness, etc), but are useless at the moment.

There are also some weird desighn choices as letting randomly generated AI ships connect to yours therfore your desighn gets ruined for no reason. This also means that their turrets will target your characters without a way to turn it off unless you cut power that they use from you.

												In an hour and a half of play I have encountered most everything the game has to offer, as well as 3 major bugs (disappearing tiles, bugged builder AI refusing tasks, and bugged security AI which finally lost me my station). This game was promised to include many basic features of a management game that were never implemented and will never be implemented. All that is left is a very subpar blend of basic features mixed with a hint of bugs that leaves a final product that tastes poor and unfinished. Were it 5 dollars and still being worked on I would heartily recommend it as with bugfixing and some addition of actual content it would be a very playable game. However, at the moment there is little to be said for it. Additionally, and separate from the review of actual gameplay, I have to express disappointment in Double Fine for letting down their customers like this. I do not support companies that do not live up to their promises and that follow unethical practices like covering up negative reviews, and as such I would like to urge anyone else who does not wish to support these practices to avoid buying this game and to look more closely at Double Fine products in the future.

												Double Fine, for all intents and purposes, abandoned this game and the fully released version is little more than the alpha with a few minor bug fixes and no amount of modding will salvage this derelict.I can in no way recommend this game. It is fundamentally broken and purchasing it only rewards poor behaviour on behalf of the developer. "

								This game is so far from being anything that I don't understand why they're selling it. It's everything wrong with early access. It's not a playable game, crashes a lot, and generally isn't fun. There are numerous game-breaking bugs and bad ai behaviors that don't seem to be getting fixed, and a number of systems that might do something on day (power generation, happiness, etc), but are useless at the moment. Given how long it's been out, and the ammount of development actually happening, this one's probaly just a cash-grab by the developers.			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased this game during a steam sale on september 3 for 50% off early access.I had been following the progress for a while, and was hoping for a more finished product, but when I watched the Alpha 6 video from Double Fine, it looked like this update finally added some more content and there were also certain assurances from JP, the lead developer, that they would strive for better communication in regards to content and issues in the future. I decided to pay up and try it out. Well, it was still very broken. Aside from the known bugs that weren't resolved, the new ""mood system"" introduced some hugely game breaking bugs and it was hard to progress very far at all in the game without having to restart for one reason or another.I frustratingly put the game down for the weekend, and only played it a few more times until they ironed out some of the more severe mood bugs by 6e-f. Once those game breakers were (pretty much) out of the way, I was able to successfully establish a base and build it to fair size before wondering the inevitable.. ""okay, now what?"" of an unfinished sandbox game. The derelict ships provide a little interest, but can sometimes be a pain to deal with. The breaches could be a very fun aspect of the game, but instead balance issues make them either ridiculously easy, or painfully hard with no real explanation as to why one way or another.This lead me to decide (as I have done with other Early Access titles) to ""put the game down"" for a bit, and come back later when they have added some more content to make the game more interesting and challenging to play. It is now two weeks later, and the lead developer has stated that they will be finalizing this game and releasing 1.0 in a month.This is a woefully unfinished game that is severely lacking in content. While the idea and core features seem real enticing, the truth is there really isn't much at all to do and I dont see the developer adding that much more before actual release.If you would like a ""space base"" type game, I would suggest an alternative in Startopia. Yes, it's almost 15 years old, but its funny and entertaining and actually has goals and stuff to do. I guarantee you will get much better gaming enjoyment out of Startopia than this unfinished, yet released product. "

								This game hasn't left Early Access yet and the developers have already gone public with ending support after the 1.0 release.The game itself was a good idea with a lot of potential but obviously the developers either can't do accounting properly (and can't hire anyone to do it properly for them) or they grossly misunderstood how much money a badly bugged early access title would make. An Early Access warning story if there ever was one. Do not purchase.			"

								I read about the game getting canceled. Saw some youtube videos and game looked awesome. Reminded me of theme hospital a bit. It looks fun even with just its existing feature set. Unfortunetly it is super buggy almost to the point of being unplayable. Builders lock themselves in rooms. Cannot place a door until room is built.In one game got raided every 10 mininutes or so, astroids the same. It's not really fun after first 5 attacks, just annoying. I picked average for density and like almost low for (dont remember wording) for raiders. Tells me I dont have any doctors when I do have a doctor assigned. Tells me I dont have a tech when I have one assigned.A pirate ship ""docked"" with me. I could not get inside the ship no matter what I did. I endeded up having my builders tear down half way.  The game crapped out on me before I could finish the rest.I ""pacified"" a raider instead of killing him. I dont have a brig yet. He is now sitting in the hall way just staring at everyone. Everyone and a while I get an alert saying I am being raided. After this happened everyone started doing stuff even slower than before so I had to restart :(People spend lots of time doing nothing. Right now I have 6 out of 9 people doing excerises and chatting in hallway. When I need something done in a hurry I just assign everyone. Like when a dude is about to starve because of being locked in a room. In the you tube videos people were joining left and right. I just have 7 people and no new people are coming :( I picked near to space gate or whatever when starting. Cannot scroll when constructing... This really sucks, literally need to cancel to close construction, scroll, and then start all over :(The starting area selector thing is no good. Why cant it just be like minecraft where you can just pick easy, hard, flat, etc. Its adds no value whatsover having that picker thing with the map. Just annoying each time you restart and want to experiment with different world type.The description of magnetic interfernce is caught off, cannot scroll, and I have no idea what it means in the game.	Wanted to change roll of hallway. Building first generator, room was tool small, knocked down wall, built generator and built new wall that extended one block into hallway. Hallway become ""reactor room"". Tried to click on and change, instead clicked on unclaim by accident. Couldnt reclaim after that, lost all power and had to restart.Builders get stuck in rooms behind objects. Need to knock down the wall to free them.Twice at start of game, I finished my base with working airlock and life support but not everyone comes inside. They die outside.A weird green line tripod/triangle thing appeared in the middle of base. Save/quit and restart and it went away.In one game the refiner didnt work? The tech came around and repaired it but miners just came, stood next to it, and then threw there rocks on the ground :( Had to tear down and rebuild.Twice this has happened, a reactor I built just disappeared. I placed in construction tool and confirmed. Didnt pay attention to see what happened.It would be nice to have more than one save? Especially with a super buggy game like this. "

								So like many other people I had great hopes for what this game would become in the next year or so.  I bought it late in the year 2013, maybe a month after it was available through early access. Initially the game was fun even though it was still broken in many ways.  However I'd just play a game once every month or so to see what they had added or fixed since my last run. I played around the middle of last month for the last time. When I played they had added a total of three new room types into the game since the barebones they had at launch. These rooms were excercise, science and medical. Excercise like it sounds was a gym, but it only has one single item you can place in it, a very boring gym machine, literally nothing else can go in there that actually helps your people excercise.Science was pretty much the same. One big machine that is all you need, and some research projects that are very few in choice, and really don't add anything new to the game once completed.And finally nmedical. Exact same deal, one structure can be built and only one, and its effect is negligible at best.Long story short is this game barely had a years worth of development put into it, and is being released for a tag of $25 !?!?If your thinking about buying a dwarf fortress type game with better UI get Banished or Gnomoria, or even deal with DF's crazy style, but DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Doing so supports a studio that should know better than to treat customer like this. I learned to never buy an early access title from Double Fine, please don't make the same mistake. "

They die outside.A weird green line tripod/triangle thing appeared in the middle of base. Save/quit and restart and it went away.In one game the refiner didnt work? The tech came around and repaired it but miners just came, stood next to it, and then threw there rocks on the ground :( Had to tear down and rebuild.Twice this has happened, a reactor I built just disappeared. I placed in construction tool and confirmed. Didnt pay attention to see what happened.It would be nice to have more than one save? Especially with a super buggy game like this. "

								When you see a game jump from .6 to 1.0 that can mean 1 of 2 things,1.That there was a huge patch that added tons of content.2.That the developer decided to stop working on it because they ran out of money paying back investors to work on the game.The correct answer for this game is sadly 2, which sucks because the future content that was planned would have made this game great, but as it stands right now its a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game that's being polished up a bit to make it look like a full game.  I had fun playing this game but for now, until someone decides to make mods for this game, don't get it unless its on sale for 75% off.			"

Well it was a mistake...Very little game play, very little done... SLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW updates.Early Access folks need to take a lession from folks like Introversion, Indie Stone, Squad...

								As things stand right now, this game is not worth it. Security personel rarely do anthing but flee or try to start a fist fight with a raider holding a rifle, the needs of the colonists shrink so fast that they go on a rampage before you can meet their basic needs, and just too much bad stuff happens to fast.With time and re-balancing it could be better, but I'll stick to RimWorld for a colony sim.

								Update on 19. of September 2014:Double Fine decided to move the game from Alpha to general availability and open the source code to the public. To me that seems like throwing the towel and this is not how early access should be played. Thumbs therefore went from up to down.Very entertaining for us old guys (like 35+), who enjoyed ""Theme *something*"" in the past. Perhaps for those willing to spend more than reflexes, this will turn out intersting as well. Remember that the game is currently in ALPHA stage and is still kind of unbalanced. Like, a single raider plowing through a base where 16 people have been assigned to ""alert"" security duty and beaconed to the intruders - each and every one of them pushing the daisies after. I have no doubt that after some further balancing and polishing this game will turn out to be something of retro goodness.			"

								At this time the game has gone from being pretty fun to annoying:*  Derelicts attach to your base which is annoying for those who like to plan.  Yes you can remove them by de-zoning, and if your builders follow instructions....*  Citizens fight each other far too early into the base development.*  Citizens become depressed over anything meaning they don't do their job.*  Citizens stand about in airlocks meaning people can't come and go.*  Raiders appear too often in low risk zones.*  Security teams run off when you are being raided leaving citizens to fight and die.*  Security just orbit around a derelict when you place a beacon on it.*  Security don't always go into a derelict attached to your base when the beacon is on it and just stand outside.*  Updates are slow in coming.Is the developer more focussed on their other new game now they have the money from this one?

								So like many other people I had great hopes for what this game would become in the next year or so.  I bought it late in the year 2013, maybe a month after it was available through early access. Initially the game was fun even though it was still broken in many ways.  However I'd just play a game once every month or so to see what they had added or fixed since my last run. I played around the middle of last month for the last time. When I played they had added a total of three new room types into the game since the barebones they had at launch. These rooms were excercise, science and medical. Excercise like it sounds was a gym, but it only has one single item you can place in it, a very boring gym machine, literally nothing else can go in there that actually helps your people excercise.Science was pretty much the same. One big machine that is all you need, and some research projects that are very few in choice, and really don't add anything new to the game once completed.And finally nmedical. Exact same deal, one structure can be built and only one, and its effect is negligible at best.Long story short is this game barely had a years worth of development put into it, and is being released for a tag of $25 !?!?If your thinking about buying a dwarf fortress type game with better UI get Banished or Gnomoria, or even deal with DF's crazy style, but DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Doing so supports a studio that should know better than to treat customer like this. I learned to never buy an early access title from Double Fine, please don't make the same mistake. "

								I've given this game a lot of time and it has the potential to be a lot of fun. It sufferes from some very serious flaws however. There is no real tutorial or guide. I had to go to the Wiki to figure out how to really get started. Part of this is not really knowing what to do and part is many of the things the game asks you to do are hidden about 4 menu layers down without telling you WHICH menu trees they are down. Once you know the trees, they make some sense but it is puzzling for new players.The menu options need A LOT of work. It is not easy to understand what you need to do or how to do it. After you suffer through a few bad games of learning how to build an airlock, life support and the associated gear it starts to become fun.  Having the bulk of what you need to do hidden under several menu levels makes the trree feel lop sided. If I wasn't building a floor or wall, I was forever going down additional menus. Once you get past the start, it gets fun. Until you get a larger crew. Even if you give everyone the job they love to do, build all the comfort items and have everything you possibly can, your crew still gets depressed and sad. The crew want to be assigned their own beds but keeping track of who has what bed for 60+ people is not easy. Add to that the new people who come in and the people who die to raiders (or suicide in space) and you never know who needs what. The interface is increadibly clunky in this aspect. There is no way to direct anyone other than security and even then sometimes they just don't respond to a beacon. Critical structures that need building will often be overlooked for unimportant ones, equipment will remian broken while an army of technicians ignore them to chat with each other in the bar. This means the simultaneous building of objects is either best avoided (to direct workers to where you want them) or thrown to chance if something important needs to be done. Maintainence is best done by changin all technicians to builders and then reclaiming (destroying) degrading equipment and rebuilding it. When raiders approach, there is no way to direct non-security personnel away from an area. To be able to direct a worker to a specific task is such a basic tool it is amazing it has been overlooked.There are some notifications (information) that should be alerts (clickable). What good is it warning me that I have an airlock somewhere I haven't built something in if you won't take me to it? This leaves you hunting down building errors, that may not be your fault, when it should be a simple click and fix. The AI is very stupid at times. Workers will starve to death while standing in front of a food dispensor. Builders will build themselves into a room and then suffocate because they can't get out. You can't even pull them out before they finish because you can't direct them. There is no screen rotation. Sometimes you will get missing floor tiles hidden behind walls. They may have been missed in construction, they may have come about from damage (fire, space debris). You can drop the walls most of the way but sometimes they can still hide. Being able to rotate the map would help this significantly. For something that borrows so much from RTS games, it is a game that fails to learn from lessons RTS games had to learn as they matured. As a result you get a game that could be (and at times is) increadibly fun but is severly hindered by its lack of basic features.			"

								While it appeared promising on launch to the Early Access register, already having the framework for a novel and engaging space-station based administration/colony game, this Early Access title is now one of many that have failed to achieve even a half of their potential, and is instead being rushed into 'full' release and obscurity.The game's feature list has been aggresively pruned, and while the ones which remain there are not outright fabrications, they are misleading as to the scope and function the current game has. I'd advise caution towards any of DoubleFine's releases in future, as the end product may be subject to extreme and massive change, or be unduly delayed as development drags on and stagnates in favour of more profitable ventures.

To buy Spacebase now, is to buy a game engine then go hunting for mods for it.Unfortunately, I do not see much of any mods for it at this time.This review is negative for the very fact that Spacebase is now the base engine, and no longer a fitting or complete ""Game.""

												Spacebase DF-9 is one of the 2 games that taught me to never again invest in either an Early Access of Kickstarter video game. The other was Peter Molyneux's Godus. I had a lot of faith in Double Fine's ability to produce this game, and after a long period of slow progress and bland features, Spacebase DF-9 has died in development. It's not an uncommon occurnace in the video game industry for a project to fail while in development and most of the time we players never see this happen. The lesson Spacebase DF-9 teaches us is that early access/kickstarter games are not exceptions and are not sacrosanct. If you're foolish enough to give them your money for something that does not exist yet while they are not contractually bound to provide you with a product then you deserve to loose your money.			"

												I bought this game so long ago. It looked promising, giving us barebone functions to make sure we can grasp how the game works, and how stupid the colonists are. I was definitely hoping the game would be published to its fullest potential because, despites its numerous bugs and AI mishaps, it was a fun ride.But then Double-Fine decided to say ""F--- You"" to everyone and stopped working on it.So, basically, here is what you have, in clever bulletpoints:-Buggy AI akin to the Sims without the instinct for survival. Your colonists could very well die of asphyxiation if you forget to stop them from doing whatever they were doing-a faction-based territory system that barely works, where you could very well f--- up the enemy base if you just dismantle a wall or a door while they attempt to invade you. This causes strange bugs all around.-Limited space and resources, you mostly end up relying on the so-called enemy invasions to dismantle their clutter so you can have anything, at a later point in the game.It's an interesting micromanagement survival game, and a challenging one at that, but it became so buggy and out of control that I couldn't see myself play any longer each session. Plus it seems Double Fine deemed this game a dud, and stopped working on it. Wrong move, guys. Finish your games before calling it quits.			"

								This game, like most everything on Steam Early Access, is a total scam. Basically:1) Start Kickstarter campaign with good idea. Get funding.2) Write something half♥♥♥♥♥ then release it on Steam Early Access with the promise of its ongoing development.3) When you finally decide to close up shop, ensure the community that development will continue and run a Steam sale.4) A week later, announce that you've stopped development and give the game away for free.5) PROFIT!Steam, you should be ashamed of yourself.There are other services that people may want to use:http://www.gamersgate.comhttp://www.gog.comhttp://www.desura.comhttp://www.greenmangaming.comhttp://www.indiegamestand.comhttp://www.humblebundle.com "

												Lets begin.I can not rate this game on steam by using start 1-5 but if I could, I would give it 3 stars. I give this game 3 stars because it is very glitchy but also can be an adicting game for a short period of time. If you are looking for a game to pass your time for a few hours and never play again (becuase there are so many bugs), this is your game.One of the biggest problems that I think exist right now is: after about an hour of playing, raider start spanning 1 after another (even if the threat level is at low). Another problem similar to this is that debri begin showing up all the time.Also this game is frusturating because your builders and tech either never listen or do there jobs but not where you want them to it. For example, you may have many ""oxygen recyclers"" but the one that is about to burst to flames is ignored by your tech and he goes to the ""oxygen recyler"" that is in good condition.Additional problems may be that when a derlict appears, all your people go there and then will begin to ignore all your commands (except security and miners)After writing this review I now think that I would rate this game as 2 stars. Do I recommend this game: Absolutaly NO! But if this game were free, ""Go nock yourself out."" This game is just too much money for its quality.			"

												The idea behind DF9 is awesome. A City Builder meeting Sims in space. And that's about all I have to say to sell the game to you...Now why I'd recommend NOT to buy it. Reasons are numerous, and most already mentioned by others and this blogpost[wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.nl] explains most of it I think.In addition to the blogpost I'd like to add an other reason why NOT to buy DF9. Once again the AI, which just plain sucks! My personal experience with the AI sucking balls is that after a debris stike, my oxigen tanks and power supply got hit. Without power and oxigen, the whole crew starts to panic, including the whole technical team. WTF? You guys should run to the power supply and oxigen tanks to fix them instead of running around like headless chickens!An other problem is the Sims part of the game. The people have a (hidden!) worklist of stuff they have to do. So far so good I'd say. But technical maintenance (yes once again) should have a top priority for lifesupport, but noooo..... Ocigen tanks are about to break down and they fix ...a bar stool... FFS guys get real please! Or at least let me point the Sims where they should go next instead of fully automated.Bottom line, the idea behind DF9 is real good. Sadly the developer dropped the ball and the project, leaving us with a half-baken, bugged and dumb game :'(			"

												Owned it since very early on. It looked interesting and I love space games as well as ""theme hospital"" type sims so I gave them $50 on Kickstarter. Went to play it but it is literally unplayable. Not just unenjoyable, actually unplayable. But hey, it's early access, I'll open it up in a month.A month later, almost nothing has changed. Development is slow but yeah, it's early access, I knew what I was getting into. Did this for a few months and again, very little has changed. It eventually becomes playable but very incomplete so extremely unenjoyable.Left it for 6+ months and recently heard they made it version 1.0. Opened it up again, it's playable but still extremely incomplete, there is very little to do. I ate my $50 and wrote it off as a bad decision and feel that you can't trust DoubleFine. I then heard that they ran a sale in September a few days before slapping the 1.0 on it. Brought in a horde of new young hopefuls like myself who believed in the studio and what the game could be. A week later they slapped the 1.0 on it and called it finished in its incomplete state.In short, don't buy it, it's incomplete. And seriously consider whether you want to support the studio when buying any of their other titles.			"

These hinted at a small team with less than spectacular plan for development which either lacked in the resorces or the drive to produce new content and polish old content.As a result the game is to be released in a rough and not-quite-ready state which should be avoided.It has a charming exterior and had the promise to be a game that had a number of interesting interplaying mechanics but the final months of production lacked the feeling of enthusiasm that was present in the games early days of development.Much like the game itself, realy.

								This game was boasting that they wanted t odo so much with it and the inspired to be like Dwarf Fortress but in space. I was so happy when I saw this, because I've always wanted a space sim where the main goal was to try and make a space station and survive. Thing is, there was so much they planned on fleshing out and building . Thing is, they didn't have funding so they took an Alpha game, slapped a 1.0 on it and called it finished.Don't invest in $25 games is the lesson I've learned. Early Access is amazing, if done right and this wasn't done right.Don't buy this game unless you absolutely love the idea and think this scrap heap will yield results.			"

Double Fine seemingly just gave up with giving this any funding so updates just continously slowed till this just died miserably.Even as old as it is Startopia is a much better alternative and much cheaper. Or watch out for Rimworld, which is a similar premise but with much more consistent updates and expanding of the game.			"

												This game had a lot of promise when it was first put on steam and I had high hopes for it as did many other people, it had promise to be a great Dungeon Keeper styled game where you could make a sprawling space station, tend to the needs of the astronaut's living there and of course fight hazards...but what we sadly got was an unfinished mess.Not only did DoubleFine release the game WAY before it was ready, they had the nerve to call it 'finished' and continue selling it even after they announced that work on it had been ceased...this was followed up by a party on DoubleFines end that didnt exatcly look cheap to host, and seeing as how the game was cut due to money issues I suspect that DoubleFine had not only left the game in an unfinished state, but outright stole from their customers and fans..and as a result got quite a bit of backlash from the community. I enjoyed this game for a while as you'll see on my profile, and I sometimes revisit it only to see wasted money on my part...DoubleFine is truly scummy for doing this and for still selling this game at it's current price.Bottom line: Do not buy this game, it is a waste of money and will only feed the greedy beast that has become DoubleFine...oh how the mighty have fallen.

												As you can probably tell by my hours played, I was a huge fan of this game while it was in development. I could live with the bugs, knowing it was all an Early Access alpha, and that it was being worked on regularly. Some day, it would be finished and fun.Except that never happened.Tim Schaefer himself gave the order to pull the plug on development, claiming that not enough people bought the game during Early Access to fund the development. That's right, the business ""plan"" was to use Early Access money to fund the actual game (smacks head).If they'd done a standard crowdfund (like Kickstarter) and said ""We need X dollars to make this game"", they probably would've gotten the money because, you know, Double Fine -- but, apparently, they completely misunderstood what Early Access is for (hint: it's not for funding the majority of your game's development).Short version? Same as everyone else has been saying: the developer abandoned the project, but called it finished anyway. It's not finished. Do not buy.			"

												Here lies a game with so much wasted potential. A skeleton for potentially a great game left to dust. It lacks the meat that really would flesh out and liven it up into something that could easily become a hit. Instead its just a lesson of why we must be careful when backing early access games. Heres hoping someone comes out with a mod to make it what it could of been. In the meantime its not even worth the sale price $6.81 I paid for it. And I am in fact sorry that I supported a failure.

												This is pathetic.  I will never buy another game from double fine.  For those of you unaware, Double fine put this on early access after a successful kickstarter and instead of finishing the game they abandoned it while keeping all the kickstarter and early access money.  This is inexcusable from any studio that wants to be respected.  Just pathetic and dishonest.			"

												Broken, unfinished, shallow crap. They went into early access to grab some cash, did virtually no work on the game to develop it then dumped it as ""finished"" and ran away with the money, Tim Schafer is a scammer with a long track record of financial mismanagement and failure to deliver.The AI is non functional.The content can be fully experienced in an hour.Everything (not exaggerating) is bugged to hell and back.The most basic of tasks become nightmarish due to the bugs and clunky brokenness of this ""game"".Here's how dishonest Tim Schafer (the guy in charge of Doublefine) is - His steam profile listed Spacebase as his favourite Steam game and he had about 1 hour of playtime on it.

												I don't think the game is bad, it just sort of very quickly becomes repetitive where you set it on highest speed, sit back, and wait. The quick start/tutorial was pretty good but I found self-start was too steep of a learning curve - I had to restart several times because my dudes were dying. I think maybe the game needs some sort of campaign or level progression to make it more enjoyable (maybe there is one? I didn't find it).			"

												this game has a few too many problems for me.1: no one ever does their jobs. the builders and the miners do their jobs, though when you tell the builders to take appart a derelict they go inside, take off their space suites, and drill a hole in the hull and kill themselves.i got attacked by raiders and they got into my life support room and got killed, but then the room was full of dead bodies so no one wanted to go into the room to fix the oxygen recyclers. how do you get rid of dead bodies? well, the doctors are meant to come in and take them away, but whenever they enter the room they get upset by all the dead bodies and leave. THIS IS YOUR JOB! not to mention that they leave all these unconcious and injured people all over the base.then there's the science team, there was a disease i needed them to reaserch so i assigned them to it and checked back on them about sixty minutes later and they had done NOTHING. i had a special room and everything, i double checked and they had just been standing in the hallway chatting the whole time. eventually they got to work, but people were sick and going to DIE!the security job is nearly pointless, and what they actually do can hardly be considered security. people assigned to security patrol a small area around a single security beacon, and the only real use for this is to have them explor derelicts. i just ended up building defense turrets everywhere, but they have limited view. 1.5: you can't tell anyone what to do, so even though this room is on fire no one knows and your fusion reactors are going to burn down.2: given how little you're actually able to do as a player, the game asks way too much of you. every five minutes it's telling you there's a new disease that needs to be researched, when instead you want to research new technology (because apparently the scientists who research dark matter also research medicine, and not the doctors), raiders seem to attack more and more frequently untill you're perpetually under attack, and the game is always telling you that, even though you have 30 reactors and twice as many oxygen recyclers than you need for your population, you don't have enough power or oxygen.3: the AI is stupid. outside of not doing their jobs, when i got attacked by raiders the AI does nothing to avoid them. when they walk into a room and see a raider, most of them just stop and hold up their hands in fear before being shot. raiders aren't even that smart, one broke into my pub and started punching my fridge.4: i'm not listing all the problems, i'm glad this game was so cheap when i baught it, because it's too late to get a refund.

I cant tell you how many security gaurds I've lost exploring derelicts only to have them get stuck in an airlock or panic and not leave until they suffocate. And dont try to build extra airlocks for long range mining, 9 times out of 10 they'll use the airlock furthest away and asphyxiate. Hopefully this will be improved or at the very least add some feature to assign miners specific routes or airlocks.			"

Early Access Review
								I cannot recommend at this time. The two biggest problems are the citizen AI and zoning. The citizens do the dumbest things and there is no way to micro-manage them to do what they really need to do. On more than one occasion I have had people die because they wouldn't build a door or they'd take off their spacesuit in the unoxygenated. The zone system limits what you can do with your base. You can only put certain types of objects in certain zones. This means you can put a life support system in the same room as the bedroom or pub. This is a pain when you are just starting out and can't really afford to layout an entire space station.A lack of content is to be expected but these issues harm the gameplay.			"

												I love the concept of the game. I love what it could be but quite frankly, the devs either need more resources or more dedication. They claim this is ""their baby"" but all I see them doing is adding fancy backgrounds, fixing 2 or 3 relatively minor or non-gamebreaking bugs, and adding a new half-finished feature every 1.5 months or so. This is unacceptable and this is exactly why I am absolutely DONE supporting early access titles.I don't believe early access reviews anymore unless they look honest and there's enough of them. Too many people review a game and say they love it despite its flaws simply because of the premise (Kinetic Void is a good example). I love the concept of Spacebase DF9, but if I still had a choice whether to back it, I wouldn't. The devs are pathetically slow on this and I see no excuse for a 4 or 5-man team to take this long especially if it's their ""baby."" Yes, they did say that in an update a while back.

Early Access Review
								Alright, I enjoy aspects of this game very much, but the A.I. is, quite frankly, awful. Disasters like space debris and raider invasions happen fairly often, but your civilians have almost no way of actually responding to them, unless you make them a security guard and give them a beacon. And even then, only about half of them will do what you say. Then sometimes they'll start suffocating in space, but they won't even attempt to head back inside the station. And if you order them back in (by sending them either to the infirmary or to a beacon), they'll take the most roundabout route possible and still die. Once, I sent a worker to tear apart a derelict for extra scrap, but when he got on, he took off his space suit, so when he removed the walls, he suffocated.I really want to like this game, I really, really do, but the A.I. needs to be fixed desperately. I'm talking priority 1, above all else. Either that or give the player some sort of option to order any worker (not just security guards) to different parts of the station at will. Honestly, I was enjoying it for the first 2 hours, but the last hour I was tearing my hair out as the terrible AI constantly killed off my best people.I realize this is still alpha, and I expected some bugs. But my gosh, I expected the AI to at least be somewhat competent. If you're going to release an alpha, DoubleFine, at least have the game be somewhat playable.I'm sure my feelings for this game will change later down the line, but honestly this alpha has left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. There's so much here that I really like, but the AI ruins it for me.			"

Early Access Review
								Has much potential but to be honest progress is painfully slow. There is often no update from the devs for weeks at a time and the 'monthly' updates when they do come, late, are small.I have totally given up playing the game as after a couple of hours you've been through the same repetative cycle of building, loosing everything and starting again twice or more. There are very few item/rooms to build. One of the things I really have a problem with at the moment is the rediculous way it handles breaches. I can remove a section of wall then watch the O2 level in the room slowly drop off over a minute or so. This makes dealing with raiders hard as the security are next to useless and you best option is decompression which doesn't work.I hope they get all this sorted, there is so much potential here for a great game. But its not worth buying now while even the very basics don't work. For now save your money, there are more bugs than working componants it seems and every belated update just introduces more.I'm going back to prison architect for now, if you want an alpha builder, thats where to invest your money right now.I have heard the team is only 3 people, considering the funding sales in this game has already brought it I have to wonder if this is true, then how much they really are behind it. It has certianly made me reconsider my feelings about buying early access in the future.PS I have much more than 8 hours outside the steam time as of writing this.			"

								Do NOT Buy this. It's been an interesting ride, but Double Fine is already discontinuing development.After they recouped the 400k investment through the initial Early Access purchases rush, the plan was to pay for the game's development through early access sales.The lack of an actual game or engaging mechanics left no animo for word of mouth excitement and Spacebase DF-9 is losing them money. Say what you will, perhaps they should focus on not repaying the investment before the game is actually fun to play/worth selling, but let's hope Double Fine learns their lesson on overpromising or underestimating their budget needs.

Early Access Review
								EDIT: (12/24/14) This game still has very annoying bugs. The door graphics still has a bug where the doors are other graphics instead of doors. The way the power usage on base works is unblanced, hostiles can plow through your whole base in nothing flat, the illnesses are unblanced; frankly everything is unblanced. For a supposedly finished game it is terrible. Don't waste your money.EDIT: (9/23/14) Don't buy it. Just don't waste your money on it. The bugs are still there and pathfinding is still horrible, possibly worse than ever. I can't play more than 30 mins before I rage quit over some stupid bug that is seemingly never going to be fixed.I was very hopeful when I reviewed originally, but with the annoucement the game is leaving Early Access still as broken as it currently stands is extremely dissapointing. I will not be buying from this developer in Early Access ever again.Original (8/23/14):Each update it gets better, but it has some bad bugs in it. I play on Mac and for me the most annoying bug is that the door images are never doors sometimes they blink between a chickenhead in the shape of the door that should be there and nothing at all. In this game you run a spacebase that's constantly falling apart around your ears. If the workers aren't killing themselves the raiders will do it for them.Currently you can only play one game at a time. If you start over you lose the base you were building. You usually lose the base to something stupid before you get to the point you would want to start over anyway.Everything needs worked on. AI, pathfinding, how the spacewalkers handle their oxygen timelimits (they ignore them and die last I played), how often metors strike, how the bartender wants to eat which jams up everybody as they wait on the bartender to be served who can't serve himself (only fix I know is to change the bartender's job to nothing which unsticks everyone and then change him back until the next time), how the builders decide what to build next, just everything.The game looks promising and when it decides not to kill me within the first 15 mins of gameplay I usually can have fun until the door images being wrong get to me or raiders invade while the turrents do nothing and I get mad. I open it after an update, start a new base, play until I rage quit, and wait for the next update to try again.My suggestion is to put it on your wishlist and check it early next year. See if the bugs have been fixed and even then only buy on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								It was really hard deciding whether to recommend it or not. Here's why I decided not to (followed by what I like):At its current state (Alpha 6e) there are a few bugs I consider gamebreaking.1. When exploring a derelict that for various reasons doesn't refill it's oxygen, citizens will walk around and even go there (!) - like technicians wanting to fix something, botanists if there is a garden, etc - until the oxygen is low at which point they start running around panicked. With no way to add oxygen, they do this until they die, often wiping out most or all of my security crew, along with a couple of other idiots who went there.2. I can't seem to get them to calm down after throwing a tantrum. Most of the time, they wake up (or when they're released from the brig) and throw another. Rinse and repeat until someone kills them.3. Technicians are quite useless at their work (which goes for all citizens, really, but it's most noticeable with the technicians). It takes forever to fix something.4. (Related to 2) It's too damn hard keeping your crew happy. I just can't seem to do it, at all! Ok, so that's why I would not recommend the game at this point. If these things are fixed in a coming update, however, I would definitely recommend it! Here's why:I really like the challenge it is to build a base in space. Things like broken or incomplete walls are suddenly a major deal. It's fun with the research letting you get better and I like that there are derelicts appearing that you can explore. I see much promise in this game and think it can get really good once the team has had a chance to develope it a bit further.			"

								What can be said ?...: Spacebase DF-9. [ An Early Access Preview ]*Uninterested exhale/grunt.**Leaves to get coffee.**Returns, sips coffee.**Writes this prologue in a way, that hopefully delivers the feeling of indifference.*This, is exactly why. You cannot properly review an Early Access game, since most of the games content is not present. It is like Minecraft in Alpha, its a proof of concept with not much context, polish or content.And thats why, i cannot write a review about it...What ? Dont look at me like that, when you think about it properly. You'l see exactly what i mean, it would be like reviewing something just based on its trailer.  *Cough* Colonial Marines .But allright... Spacebase DF-9 is a game, where you try to build a working Deep Space outpost. This is only hampered by the AI and its questionable prioritisation. Multiple times, my only technician thought it would be more important to talk to Johny the SpaceSlug than to, lets say, repair the Life Support systems.And this is one of those games where there is a certain build plan. And deviating from it will just result in failure.That is, if you can get the builders to do everything in time.And speaking of ""doing stuff on time"". That is an ironic statement/joke, that i hope several of you will get. The citizen of your station are complete and utter lazybones.. 'ses.Most of their life consist of eating food and talking to others. And this they will do even if they have other, more important stuff they need to do. Like maintenance to make sure the station wont disintegrate like a clown car.  Another rather ironic thing to say about this...So to compress that all:Spacebase DF-9  is like Minecraft in Alpha, very lacking in content. But the concept is easy to get, now it just needs some care and attention to make it a full game. And for gods sake, repair the AI.			"

												Do not buy, it's a Pyramid Scheme. The game is buggy, unfinished, and unstable. You can't play it in its current form, you can only test it, and it has been made clear the issues won't be addressed by DF. DF have paid off their Investors twice their investment, with our Early Access money and then have the nerve to say there's no money to develop the game after only 6 updates. That's right, version 0.6 and they pull the plug.EDIT: Very little changed in 1.0, other than a tiny price reduction and an offer with Hack N Slash, still unplayable and wouldn't even be worth $5.

Early Access Review
								What can be said ?...: Spacebase DF-9. [ An Early Access Preview ]*Uninterested exhale/grunt.**Leaves to get coffee.**Returns, sips coffee.**Writes this prologue in a way, that hopefully delivers the feeling of indifference.*This, is exactly why. You cannot properly review an Early Access game, since most of the games content is not present. It is like Minecraft in Alpha, its a proof of concept with not much context, polish or content.And thats why, i cannot write a review about it...What ? Dont look at me like that, when you think about it properly. You'l see exactly what i mean, it would be like reviewing something just based on its trailer.  *Cough* Colonial Marines .But allright... Spacebase DF-9 is a game, where you try to build a working Deep Space outpost. This is only hampered by the AI and its questionable prioritisation. Multiple times, my only technician thought it would be more important to talk to Johny the SpaceSlug than to, lets say, repair the Life Support systems.And this is one of those games where there is a certain build plan. And deviating from it will just result in failure.That is, if you can get the builders to do everything in time.And speaking of ""doing stuff on time"". That is an ironic statement/joke, that i hope several of you will get. The citizen of your station are complete and utter lazybones.. 'ses.Most of their life consist of eating food and talking to others. And this they will do even if they have other, more important stuff they need to do. Like maintenance to make sure the station wont disintegrate like a clown car.  Another rather ironic thing to say about this...So to compress that all:Spacebase DF-9  is like Minecraft in Alpha, very lacking in content. But the concept is easy to get, now it just needs some care and attention to make it a full game. And for gods sake, repair the AI.			"

								The current state of this EA game is lacking in content and stability. At the time of this writing it is in Alpha 4. Currently the AI is quite problematic and often results in very stupid behavior that will cause crew members to become stuck in loops or stop functioning altogether. The game also tries to emulate air pressure, this while a very exciting feature can cause problems in larger spaces/ bars. The game I suspect will be one of my favorites once it's development is further along, and I am sure my review will change. However, in its current state I can not suggest picking it up.			"

												Don't buy this game until at least 5d.  Bought the 4d version of the game on sale yesterday, but it wasn't worth it.  Sadly the game does not work.  You do what the tutorials tell you to do.  Building an airlock, lockers and life support, sealing the rooms, but the oxygen levels stay at 0% and your workers all die after eight minutes.  Too bad.  They have a great concept and graphics.  The current execution earns it a big fat goose egg though.			"

I can't hail ships, I crash periodically for no reason whatsoever, my station members wait outside airlocks until they die of suffocation, the list would go on but these are just the things I've experienced until I decided to stop putting up with it.Game is wonderful, just not right now.

								I don't recommend the game in its current state. It does have a lot of potential to be fun but there are a lot of frustrating bugs in the current alpha build. If you purchase the game as of 12/30 you must understand what you are getting into. If anything look at it as a discounted preorder. Considering the game has already turned a profit for Doublefine you would think it will get a lot of continued support. Patience will be the key.			"

Also, due to a high number of bugs (which Double Fine are great at finding and eliminatingby the way) the game can be frustrating as you'll often find yourself waiting 10-15 minutesfor the A.I to complete what should be simple tasks.Definitely worth looking into later on as it goes through further development.

Early Access Review
								Spacebase DF-9, or as I like to call it “The one game where I want to throw everyone out the airlock and watch them all die” is in my opinion one of the reasons early access games should not be on steam. While the page fully warns people that this is still in its alpha stages it should not have been allowed to until at least a better running beta. As of right now the game is computer destroyingly broken as there are multiple problems with the game.The Intro: As of right now there is not even a full bare bones intro to this game. While when first picking the area you will settle in you see multiple aspects in the upper right corner which mean nothing to you. However it does give the player some heads up after picking it what everything means. That is the only good thing I can say about the intro as is. The next second you are placed in space with three aliens and a pod which can be broken down for scrap and a few minutes of oxygen for each to try and figure out how to build a base. While I understand people hate the idea of tutorials that really drag on I would have preferred at least something to give me more information. My first time playing my entire crew died because instead of building as I instructed they mostly floated around space and then began to panic when their oxygen got low because no one worked.The AI: Ok… Day One: Garry’s Incident I feel is one of the best examples of bad AI… this nearly reaches the same level of incompetence. In order for a crew member to do anything you must assign a job and where they will be in regards to some of the jobs like mining and building. While that’s fine by itself the AI doesn’t know what to do often times. They will lounge about the base or flat out ignore build orders or security beacons for when intruders come in guns blazing or fires because… I have absolutely no idea. The AI is unresponsive and more lazy than helpful and I feel like this would have been aided greatly by being able to tell them what to do The Sims style but the AI of course has free will… the free will to walk around doing nothing while I have set up a build order for oxygen recyclers which they need to live while their oxygen quickly is used up.Building: There is barely any direction as to what to build when starting but common sense plays a part here. Of course they need oxygen, food, and a way for more resources and while all those work when the AI actually does their job… the rest is very lacking. There is no explanation as to why a pub, or a reactor, or really anything is important beyond just common sense guiding my actions to make me build them because, they are there so they must be useful. After all if they can make their own food they stop eating the same stuff from the food replicators. But again things don’t seem to need reactors for power or crew quarters, or fitness rooms, or a pub since things work without them. Again direction would be nice here and even diversity since for example there is only one air recycler, no better one.There is more I could go on about and while I love Double Fine… I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone until at EARLIEST its full release. But even then I would wait a few months if this is any indication of what the full game will be like.			"

												☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☠☠☠  Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid!  ☠☠☠☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰This game has been classified as hazardous space debris.  Set your navicomps to avoid this sector at all costs, lest you find yourself wasting space credits.UPDATE: Developer has released the game as ""done.""  Oh, but we'll get the source code so we can finish it ourselves, right?  Right??  Well, let me say this:  Tim Schafer is the new Peter Molyneux.  *drops mic and walks away from Double Fine forever*UPDATE 2:  Just played 1.05, the ""release"" version of the game.  Some of the bugs I've mentioned have been addressed, but only a few.  Now features a ""tutorial"" level that is basically just a pre-built base with some lame text overlays telling you to perform a few tasks.  I played the level after the tutorials were complete, and was immediately swamped by a continous stream of raider vessels.  Base went from 12 occupants to just 1, and when I saw that last ""Raider breach vessel incoming!"" message I just quit the game and un-installed it again.Pros:☑  Er.  I wish it were a good game that had potential?  Cuz I would love me a Sim Starbase game.Cons:☒  Very buggy user interface.  I commonly had to ""trick"" the game to build an item by building another and then canceling it before completing it in order to get it to build the second item (which is the item I wanted in the first place).  If items overlap, then it is impossible to click on one or more of the overlapped items.  (Say if you have a claim-territory flag that is overlapped by an oxygen generator.)☒  Obtuse needs and wants system.  My crew fights and kills each other, and I am never sure why without carefully inspecting each cluttered needs/wants screen for each crew member.☒  I've lost dozens of crew without even really knowing why.  The notification bar fills up with tons of ""XXXX needs medical attention"" and ""XXXX is dead"" messages before I can even react to whatever is putting my crew in danger.☒  Your first base is going to result in dead astronauts.  So will your second, third, fourth and likely fifth.  Margins are extremely thin at the beginning of the game, so if you screw up in the least (such as build a room too small to hold a refinery, without knowing how big that refinery is) you have to start over.  There is no way to undo or fix a build mistake, so if you make any at the critical first few minutes of the game, then kiss your space-butt goodbye.☒  Zoning system is clunky and requires you to build a special-purpose room to simply place one item.☒  Annoying fixed view that cannot be rotated, nor is there a ""fade behind"" effect when someone or something is behind another object, so it's easy to lose people or things.  This will likely never change either, because while the crew are rendered as 3D models, it's clear the walls and objects are static sprites, and if the devs didn't account for rotating views at this point in the dev cycle, they probably never will.☒  Overall quite buggy.  UI elements end up becoming corrupt, crew get stuck in rampaging loops and can never be subdued, miners will drop ore in the middle of space during a crisis and never pick it back up, etc.☒  Feels very unpolished, and like an early WIP.  Expected more progress for this game since the last time I looked at it (about a year ago).			"

												I'm sure everyone knows this, but I must include it on my review. This game has been abandoned by the developers.The developers are also expecting modders to finish the game for them...but didn't make a workshop compatability...*facepalm*. Seriously devs? so at the moment, there are very few mods out there and they are scattered all over the internet, and google search is no help. However, there is a new mod called ""unoffical patch"" to fix some bugs and add some features. I recommend you download that mod or be greeted with bugs apocalypse. Now lets talk gameplay.I don't know what they normally call them, settlers? austronaut? pawn? I'll just name it ""people"".Unfortunately, you can't move your people, which can be very annoying when raiders are on sight.You can assign them up to 9 jobs, some people are more skilled on certain job and also enjoy/hate certain job.The jobs are;Builder: self explanatory Technician: maintain and fixes objectsMiner: self explanatorySecurity: shoot hostile enemy, and follow security beacon that you can set.Bartender: Tends the bar which increase happiness.Botanist: tends the garden.Scientist: Make researches to unlock things.Doctor: Heal and cure diseases/illnessJanitor: Clean corpsesUnassigned: defaultPeople have needs, and they can go up and down shown on a graph. I don't know what most of these does to the person.Duty, Social, Morale, Stuff, Energy, Hunger, Fun. Those are the 7 needs of a person.People also have ""thoughts"" that you can read. Some of them are about friends and enemy they made, an object they built, or even a certain doom they are about to encounter. Thoughts really define them and I enjoy pausing the game and reading them. They also have a nice hand drawn avatar so you know what they look like and perks, if they have low self esteem or they are anxious, etc.Each person really is different from the rest and it's amazing how much detail they have. It's ashamed this game is abandoned.Now let's talk about building.There are 13 rooms you can build, and they are;Airlock: In and out of the space stationLife Support: For placing Oxygen machine Reactor: for powering the entire space stationRefinery: smelting rocks into matter (money)Residence: Build beds to increase population limitPub: increase happinessGarden: Grow foodFitness: gymResearch: build research table for scientistInfirmary: HospitalBrig: prisonCommand: Threat monitoringUnzoned: plain old room Each of these rooms have certain objects that can only be placed on that room. All objects (and wall/floor) cost matter to build.Matter can be obtained by mining rocks and smelting it on a refinery machine. To build a room, you need to inclosed it with walls and floors. If a wall or a floor is destroyed, and a person is in that room, they will be sucked into the vacume of space and die.Walls/floors and objects can be destroyed from astroids and raiders. There are random encounter in the game.There are people that you can communicate with that randomly pops up (when they are near you).If you respond to their message, then you can either gain a person or be targeted by raiders.This is the risk you need to think about before accepting their calls.There are also an actual spaceship that shows in your game. You can either send your security (via security beacon) or leave it alone until it leaves the game. Spacebase DF9 had potentials, but its been abandon before it can even fly. I really wish someone would make a similar game. SOMEONE PLEASE! That being said, would I recommend this game? Not on full price. Buy this game when it's 90% on sale.			"

								This game was supposed to be one of my favorite games ever, I played and enjoyed throughout early access and looked forward to every single minute of playing. Sadly the dev is rushing out 1.0 and with not even half the promised features.Spacebase DF-9 tasked you with building a station then maintaining it amongst the stars, with research, raiders, new arrivals, and multiple room types the future of this game looked bright and full of potential. But, everything changed when the fire nation attacked...SB DF-9 has followed suit of Towns, Starforge, and a few other Early Access titles in that, they made all the promises but only lived up to a few. With the community left with a unfinished product.Please do not buy this game, developement is mostly finished and it will be abandoned go buy Clockwork Empires, Gnomoria, or Rimworld if you love these types of games. Idk if there will ever be a spacebase sim and, even if there is there will never be one in my opinion that felt as good as SB once did.... Truly tragic.			"

								It has potential and and if you're not afraid of an Early Access game go for it but as it is now I'd say wait. The game is in alpha still and it's pretty short since after you build a base with one of everything there's not really anything to do. The AI is not too bright when it comes to pathfinding and has a tendancy to act like lemmings. Combat is meh. It's just too early.			"

And it is all that; I love this concept: Build and survive, personnel management, with a twist of exploration thrown in.However, all of the positives this game has to offer is decisively destroyed by its horrible, horrible AI.The technicians should have an editable queue. That would make life better.Security should have a route display that is editable.And if there is no door (only a wall) why am I still supplying it with oxygen? Maybe I want to decompress the room.

(That's not the reason, but check out Humble Bundle.)I'm writing this review right after I deleted it because I lost about half of my people with one raider. One. ONE.There's no autosave, so I can't do anything about it. If you need to know more, watch some videos on it to decide. But you really shouldn't get it. (I also think I lost a few people because the controls are hard to get used to.)Go play Hack 'n' Slash, as it's a better and cheaper game.			"

Poor direction and very little finesse to the game's controls make it frustrating from the perspective of the player, and the constant bugs that can block progress and lack of any real story mode make it so that this game has no real playability at all, and anyone who would want to would quickly be dissuaded by the tutorial, which is SO poor that it can outright glitch and block your forward progress.My rating? 0 inexplicably depressurized stations out of 10.

Double Fine studios raw dogged everyone with this ship-jumping money-grabbing half-arsed excuse for a space sim.If this were any industry but gaming they would be taken to court by the customers and sued for breach of contract, having to give all customers the option of a refund. They sold the game with the promise that it was a work in progress and they would evolve it, only to bin it as soon as they harvested all the early sales. To add insult to injury the game is awful too.Disgusting, I shall not be buying another Double Fine game.			"

												It's a shame to say, but unfortunately, this is just an incomplete game. That's really the best way to describe it. With bugs and glitches abound, and an astounding lack of ability to implement even the most basic mechanics without running into huge balancing issues between AI abilities (which are stunted by a bad AI setup) and the horrifically timed Raider events, it really just reeks of Double Fine saying ""we need to get something that at least looks half decent if you close one eye and squint real hard"".Don't waste any of your money on this. I got this as a gift copy, and I still feel offended for the person that was kind enough to gift it to me. This is one of the few games which makes me genuinely angry to play, and is a blight in anyone's game library without some future huge rewrite by an independent coder of some kind.			"

												As everyone else has said, the developers lied to their fan base and scammed a bunch of people out of their money- the game is far from finished and doesn't even have the featureset originally promised. Who knows if the game will actually work on future OS updates? A developer that lies and doesn't respect their fans doesn't deserve any business, keep far away from this game and any other game the Dev tries to scam you with. BROKEN GAMEPLAY, CANT RECOMMEND.

The manegement of your citizens are rediculously shallow, and almost non-exsistant. the game is bugged beyond what is 10 Euro's worth, and the fact that Doubble Fine has abandond this turd in the pool, means that there is no more fixes. The game delivers only 40 mins of gameplay, and is depression-indusing. This game is Fraud!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!BOYCUTT DOUBBLE FINE! - BOYCOTT TIM SHEFFER!			"

								I want to preface this review by saying it is about the update schedule, or lack there of, not the game play itself. Knowning this game is early access, I bought it back in January expecting that it would have bugs, lack of content and be a work in progress. I also expected steady progression on the games development. In half a year of owning it I have seen two full alpha revisions and maybe seven or so minor patch/bug fix updates. There is no posted schedule or hint at when updates can be expected. It feels like this game is on the back burner and a one man team is working on it. All the while the rest of company is putting time and effort into they 5-6 other games listed for release this year from DoubleFine. In short, if you are looking for a game with a set alpha release time frame and/or constant status updates this is not for you. Paying the money I did I was hoping to see progress more like Prison Architect and Space Engineers and that is just not the case.			"

I would have said it was earlier on because they were actually working on it and it seemed to have good potential. But as of now Double Fine is going the route of sticking a 1.0 sticker on an alpha. This is not going to be a finished product, it will probably never be finished and honestly they don't really deserve any of your money. This just seems like it was just a way of getting a few extra bucks for other projects they needed money for.If you look at the reviews you'll find that it's only about 32% positive. Out of those about 90% are Early Access reviews from a while ago and is probably the only reason this game isn't even more negatively rated.Screw dat gurl friend.

 £18.99 For a Cancelled Game This title is broken in its current form. More often than not it is unplayable due to unbalanced mechanics and truly awful ai. There was once promise, promise enough for many people to shed out a lot of money when the game was listed under Early Access, now the developers have declared that no more updates will be coming to the game - that there is not enough funding to warrant the amount of work it would take to deliver the experinece the devs described to us (back when they asked for our money.) The investors who spent 400k on this title have recouped that amount but players who supported this title are receiving a mere token update that hopes to fix a few bugs and add a tutorial. Do not waste money on this broken and unfinished game.  "

The first 'promising' Early Access gameDouble Fine had lot's of plans[archive.is] for Spacebase DF-9. The game those plans outlined would be well worth the $20€ price.As development continued however, more and more of those plans were laid to rest[archive.is] and in the end a very select few were ever realized. As such, the game as it stands, is just nowhere close to being worth the price, and should've been priced more like Hack'n'Slash, the game it's being bundled with now, is priced.Spacebase DF-9 is a perfect example of a phenomenon that continues to this day: wholly unfinished but 'promising' alphas on Early Access.As Steam's own documentation states, both developers and customers should treat Early Access games as they are know, not as what they might one day become. Devs shouldn't sell promises, and customers shouldn't buy them. But alas, here we are.I regret buying into Double Fine's promises during Early Access. Because of the few genuinely good games they've put out, it's easy to forget Double Fine's catalogue is more 'miss' than 'hit', Spacebase DF-9 being a prime example of that fact.Bottom lineOnly buy Spacebase DF-9 if you want to support Double Fine. Even then, it might be better to just buy a DF t-shirt or something, rather than to inflate the sales numbers of this mediocre dissapointment.			"

												It occurred to me that I should actually write something after the couple of years I've had this game. For those who weren't aware, this is an unfinished game that went from Alpha to Finished virtually overnight after Double Fine got all the money they thought they were going to get from it. It's buggy, it's extremely barebones in features, and if you buy it now you'll ""miss out"" on the Hack/Slash consolation gift they offered to us paying customers who got royally screwed by Tim of Legend. There is a modding team attempting to do (for free) the job Double Fine Entertainment couldn't be bothered to do, but buying this game will give those welchers yet more money that they can roll into their new Early Access project, which they're totally going to finish this time, honest guys. My advice: avoid.I can't say the $20 I spent on this game was a complete waste, though. It taught me two valuable life lessons: never buy a game for the promise that it'll be awesome later, and never buy any more Double Fine products for as long as I live.			"

												Starts off sweet but quickly becomes sour.As far as abandon titles go, this one seems like it is close to being complete. However, two big elements are missing. First, there is gameplay balance. The game starts off feeling like you can do anything in it, if you just put the time and effort into it. And for the first 20 or 30 minutes this feels true.  You expand your base, explore ships, and manage your people to get the most out of them.  But then the raiders, and meteor strikes happen. And this is where the missing gameplay balance is most obvious.  Negative events are important to any game, if things were always good, than there wouldn't be any challenge. But the speed, and frequency of the negative events needs to be balance out against what the play can and cannot do, so that they can overcome them, and not just suffer.  I found that during the few games that I played, that I would get close to having a decent base going, only to have ruin by constant attacks, to the point where I was losing a lot more people than I was generating. Which resulted in me having a large empty base that I had no chance of defending or using.The second element is content. There isn't much in this game... Overall, this is not a game that you should spend money or time in.			"

Then you will be under constant attack with everything you build getting destroyed faster than it can be rebuilt.There is no way to turn down the frequency of attack.  I've even changed the config files with no difference.Resources are clunky to manage.Tons of ""fun"" negative events include various types of raider events, meteor strikes, fires, fights, killbots, etc.ZERO helpful events.No balance.

												I liked the concept of this game, but ultimately it proves so frustrating to play.Everything from the UI to the AI slowly starts to grate on you. Take when the player has to first build the room for power and life support and an airlock - even though I did it fine each time, a bunch of times the little crew members would refuse to go inside and instead ran out of air while floating and wandering around outside while marvelling at their craftsmanship.Send your virtual minions to collect rocks so that you can build more areas for them to live in and shelves for their..tentacle monsters and sooner or later you will encounter... SPACE PIRATES! Okay, it is not nearly that dramatic, it becomes such a casual occurrence (so much so you get invasions right after each other, yaay..), the problem is these visits throw stuff into chaos. Security team, arm phazers, set them to stun or kill, I don't know, just get rid of these guys! Mr Wol--, what the... So even if you go to the security tab and tell your security team to defend a breach point a lot of the time they will stand idle and just be cut down one after another and the SPACE PIRATES will go on their merry way butchering your whole crew.How to prevent this? Set EVERYBODY to security since that is the only way people defend themselves properly, afterwards you can try to figure out who does what job. CHAOS, Chaos everywhere, send in space marines to purge all this chaos.After learning that my security were completely incompetent I instead put turrets, over there, outside, in that room there.. EVERYWHERE! Turrets are far more effective than actual people, you don't need to worry about losing something that took ages to level up and they kill raiders near instantly. <3 Turrets.Base is defended - rockin'! Crap, tons of dead bodies in the base, mostly raiders but also my own people sometimes too, but they are making the crew depressed. No worries, the doctors will clear these bodies and recycle the matter, or at least they should. Doctor doctor, emergency paging dr. Beat, corpse rotting in life support room, whole station being flooded with smell of rot and bacteria! DOCTOR! I stare at my doctors and notice two standing in the infirmary playing videogames (curse you videogames!) and another one in the pub getting drunk and brawling. I sigh and decide that if they want to look at them so bad then sure, they can keep their cadaver friends.Despite my doctors being either drunken masters or videogame addicts, I don't have any huge illnesses or parasitic worms devouring the crew lately. Still no work is getting done, so I change all the bartenders to other stuff hoping this abolition will get people to work.I have miners and builders getting picked off by raiders and kill bots because the AI does not avoid danger and there is no way I saw to tell them to stop and go home. I stop caring if my crew die, it is worse than herding sheep because at least sheep run away from danger, crew numbers drop, bodies piling up, nobody cares and just drinks away their sorrows on Spacebase. I decide to quit playing the game before the chaos and stupid mechanics get to me and I become as apathetic as the crew, right before I quit - I notice that a doctor is finally removing all the dead bodies on the ship. Double Fine, could have done better. The game had potential, but abandoning it rather than fixing stuff was much easier for them.			"

Early Access Review
								The developers seemed to think that SB DF9 would generate enough money to sustain development costs for ""years"", yet they neglected to realize that people aren't going to keep buying something that's quite obviously treated like a side project, with slow updates and little content. At one time I personally defended the game, because well, it wasn't done yet, and someday it might have been something really good, which I was willing to wait for. However, now that DoubleFine has announced that they're basically just going from alpha 6(!) to 1.0 release (with an added ""b-but here's the source code so YOU can finish it""), I cannot recommend the game, as it is unfinished, nor can I recommend any other product from DoubleFine, since they evidently need better management (and PR while they're at it).

												Unless this has a serious discount, don't buy it. It has a lot of things wrong with it, and the devs dumped it before finishing the game. BUT some modders have taken up the challenge of releasing patches for the game anyway using its source code, and so far they've been consistent in their releases.The most annoying thing about the game by far is how your station residents are incredibly sluggish when it comes to doing anything. I've had two starts where everyone suffocated in their space suits because they took a million years to actually get around to building oxygen recyclers when ordered, and another where everyone suffocated because they refused to build an airlock to actually get into the mini-station they'd just built. When you order a squad of security officers to move to an area with raiders in, it's a coin flip whether or not all of them will actually go there. I lost one citizen and one of my two officers to a raider attack when one of the officers decided to - I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not - stand around playing a handheld game instead of actually doing his job and shooting the raider that just killed someone.It's quite frustrating sometimes, but worth the whole 69p I paid for it. I wouldn't pay much more than that for this game in its current state, though - if you do want to pick it up, I would advise you to not pay anything more than £1.50 or so for it.			"

												Spacebase DF-9 feels like it had so much potential, but very quickly demonstrates that it has failed to achieve it...I am honestly yet to be able to experience it's full potential as multiple times now, before even getting established, and with a only a handful of people on board, I've been raided in a 'low' threat zone and leaving me to chase my tail, hoping for new residents to come along to replace my losses... This makes even getting your spacebase established, with a reasonable population, an arduous and frustrating task...Limited resources are just that, limited, even in areas with alot of asteroids to mine, you will find that they are depleted quickly and constructing large bases (like those shown in the screenshots) seems improbable...If you're a sucker for punishment, and can pick this up on special, Spacebase DF-9 is probably something you'd enjoy, otherwise, this is not for you.

												This game is just a failed experiment I suppose? Basic playability is barely functional.At a base level in games, you generally want to know what you can and can't do, and a certain amount of intuitiveness is necessary in UI elements. You cannot place objects on walls if they face ne/nw (Isometric view). You cannot rotate a camera despite the 3D models, I spent about five minutes confused thinking no surely you must be able to make it face the other way? Considering objects are NECESSARY in one room, to go into another, (Two spacesuits in a room, with an airlock, to move out) the only answer is making gigantic rooms or a ton of small rooms. The tutorial doesn't really tell you to do this, and while you can then retry, and do it ""right"", it sets the tone for the game. You won't be using your intellect or planning skills, you will learn that the game isn't capable of some things, and how to work around it. There is no space efficiency, which is one of the key ""fun"" things to do in a base building game. Learning is of course a key part of games and design, but they should be learning mechanics not limitations. In ten minutes I ran into several of these little ""Oh. You can't do that? Or am I doing it wrong?"".I bought it because it was DoubleFine and it DID NOT say it was early access. I checked if there would be updates, and it says sure there will be one more, and then development is done. Unfortunately I think this is a kind of cool game that will never come to fruition, like  many in this harsh industry.			"

												Originally, I had a positive review of this game.  It was an interesting start.  It was basically Dwarf Fortress in space with graphics from the list of planned features, and looked to be quite promising.  Even with what was in the game, it was at least worth playing for a couple dozen hours, even if it lacked any real depth to keep you playing for too long.  Then, it was cancelled while still in pre-alpha...The developer abandoned it because, as far as I can tell, they just plain didn't think it was selling well enough to be worth putting money into finishing the game.  It's kind of crushing that a company that had a positive reputation like DoubleFine would just abandon a half-made game like this.  (And for the record, my first real notification of this was that my previous positive early-access review managed to get a near-constant stream of downvotes for the simple fact that it had been a positive review...)  The ""consolation prize"" was that they handed out free Hack 'n' Slash games to purchasers of this game (limited time, already over), although it raises the question of why players would trust in the next early access game when the last one was abandoned...That said, I don't have the same bitterness a lot of people seemed to have. (Likely because I don't live in hype of upcoming games when I'm sitting on a mountain of Steam games I've got in reserve.)  As for the game, itself, it's fairly simple.  Start with nothing but a few resources, build an airlock and air recycler quick to not suffocate when your suits run out of air, build a mining station, and start mining for more resources.  From there, use resources to start making more rooms, and stuffing them full of all the random things in the menu until you have a little of everything.  Then have random visitors stay at your station, and start building MORE of everything.  Then have asteroids slam into your station (just lock everyone out of the threatened rooms), or have some raiders (set everyone to security, and bum rush them all), or have other mystery stations drift nearby (remove their walls from the outside to suck all the likely hostile inhabitants into the vacuum of space instead of letting your guys get killed). By and large, the game just lather, rinses, and repeats from there.  If you really like managers, I can say you might have fun with it for a few hours, but don't get it unless it's absolutely dirt cheap, because you're probably going to experience everything this game really has to offer in about 6 hours or so, and from there, it's just a matter of building a base larger and larger to cram more and more population in.

												Not really much to say on this one.I picked this game up when it was still in early access, spending what little money I had free to use on video games at the time, excited about all the plans the devs had. What was already there was a solid base game to build on, and I figured with a studio like Double Fine behind it there would be a lot to look forward to.The joke was on me, I suppose.Double Fine bailed after they decided the game wasn't as successful as they wanted, and left everyone who supported them with the very beginning of a game and nothing else. What's there may be stable, but there's just no content. I wouldn't even call it a beta; it's not complete enough. It's fun for all of an hour or so at most, and then there's nothing left to do. Starting over doesn't really change anything, either. There's nothing to really do differently, so there's virtually no replay value.To this day Spacebase DF-9 continues to be one of the most infamous cautionary tales of early access, and for good reason. Not sure I'll be doing any further business with Double Fine either, but only time will tell.			"

												There's a lot of bad blood between gamers and developers here, but all im really reading in regards to the game is that the AI needs tweaking, needs more features and a few other tweaks here and there.Im recommending it because im developing it. DF gave us the code to edit and mod it, so thats what im doing. Progress is happening in the forums, but im a lone developer with no graphic design skills. But relax, its all coming together!If you have positive input and would like to see this game succeed, join the forum and send a message in thread and ill see if i can add it in. http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewforum/58/Before anyone says it, no im not a shill for DF, I just enjoy this game, found little to no one developing it anymore and want to see it succeed.

												Spacebase DF-9. I've played some terrible games in my time but this one takes the cake. 90% of my seven odd hours spent in this game was spent screaming at the screen because the AI, which you could easily equate with a turd, weren't going into the oxygen filled station that they just built to get air all whilst panicking because they were sufficating. The base building was the only fun part about it but it was always a worry that the builders would go out, stay out and die. The roster of jobs was a feature I liked though. Rather than hope you get what you need you just make them what you need whether they like it or not. However...some of them didn't work all that well. For example: Security guard, armed with a pistol, stood and had a fist fight with an attacking raider. And what did the others do? After running around like headless chickens for 2 whole minutes which, by the way, was made even more amusing once paired with Benny Hill, they all got their suits on went out the airlock...and stayed there.One thing this game needs desperatly, but probably won't get, is the option to tell the members of your shambling corpse of a base where to go to combat the amount of deaths that can happen in the first five minutes. I can't remember how much i paid for this, whether it was on sale or not but either way it was by far the most regretful purchase i've ever made. Don't make the same mistake I made. Leave this game in the cesspit it tried to crawl out of.			"

			It had potential, but it seems Double Fine opted to not bother fixing the game's issues. All their other games had good ratings except for this one and while its technically playable, there is room...		

Video: (Speed up version of above, coming soon)Review:Double Fine has the capacity and the know how to make this game better, but because of the overwhelming amount of bad reviews, they won't be ever coming back to it.  This is unfortunate, because I rather like the game and think it could be improved a lot, especially if I can get ahold of the developers who were tasked with this specific game and give them my detailed unbaised input on things.  Having talked to several other game devs in my time, I've learnt several things about the development scene so I know how to work around certain issues with development to help make a game better.  However, it seems thathis game is abandoned.In its current state, it ""works"", but you have to be real lucky to get a good base going and you need to place lots of turrets everywhere and rapidly expand as fast as you possibly can.  I guarentee you're going to lose, a lot.			"

Early Access Review
								For a game that showed so much potential, this one really let me down. I followed development from alpha 1a, and eagerly awaited every patch. But now, DF have decided to end development mid alpha and release the game as a 1.0 full version. I can only hope that the modding community can salvage this game, It has so much potential left. For now though, its not worth $25 to support a game ending development, wait till the price drops or modders expand it enough.			"

												Spacebase DF-9 was broken when I first began to play it...crashing within the first ten minutes. I was bummed out 'cuz it looked like a cool space station builder. THEN...I don't know what happened....maybe an update (maybe the last one), but now it runs reliably and I can't remember the last time it crashed. I have had immense fun with this game. It does have quirks that will be unacceptable to some people, many have been covered by other reviewers. I just, for some reason, really enjoy building building outposts in space and don't take my ""crew"" too seriously if they asphyxiate themselves because, after awhile, my space stations tend to get big and busy....starting over and rebuilding is what I enjoy about this game. I've not run out of ideas for construction of the ideal station, yet. That's what I like about this game...the building and crew management and watching something I've created actually function...until aliens board, or a new crew member's mental illness comes to the fore with disasterous results! Or someone leaves a door open..yeah, this game reminds me of Planetbase...I get to build things my way, but in the end, a billion miles from nowhere, I can only forestall eventual doom.I am glad I bought it.Frankly, I would give Spacebase a 8.5/10 for concept.......umm, I don't know what I would give it for execution, I just know I pick it up when I'm in the mood  for making things in space...""It scratches an itch very well""...7.5/10			"

												I like this game, simple, dumb.  It lacks a lot of items, randomized events, and it's most likely when you really need an action taken like saving an incapacitated crew member, or fight back against enemies you are going to lose.  That is pretty much it, three things you have to deal with.  Bad A.I. that are stupid and the events of ships coming and going being either new crew or raiders, that's all.This is, sort of worth the price but sort of not, since it still plays like alphaware (even fan-patched, you want to do that) If it's on sale like $4.99 (or free/bundled cheap/$1) I think it's worth just a few hours of play if you want a really dumb space simulator that is pretty much rogue-lite if you don't absolutely micro like a mo-fo against any early first 15 minute rage quits.  I followed all the hype and bad blood and finally sitting down with it, (had it for awhile) I really like it.  If there was one thing I'd like added it would be abit more control with your crew, rather then somewhat bad hit/miss pathfinding and que actions. Like at least make one crew promoted to Captain and you at least can do everything on your own seperately and remotely while everyone else just does their business.Like I said, it's a more unforgiving repetitive rogue-lite experience with either very bland gameplay or very frenetic broken attacks and your crew just being dumb.  It won't be this sim that is easy or, hey build a base with hundreds of items beautiful space life thing.  The gameplay is somewhat vapid, and a bit weak in a few areas but to me it was okay for what it is, regardless of any pie in the sky promises.  I've certainly played far worse games that cost more and games that truly are shovelware/abandonware.  It isn't going to be evil genius, or dwarves, or even rimworld.  It's okay for an unfinished game.  Believe me, there are much much worse out there.  Out of 5 I'd give this game a 3.  Out of 10, I'd give it a 5.  Out of 3 I'd give it a 1.5You send a guy to a derilict and he dies, go send a builder to vape a few walls and kill everything inside.  You got miners/builders outside about to be attacked, switch to guards.  Use the alarms/beacons.  Put sentry guns everywhere, build air/power and research.  Then build.  That's about it, build another base layout, then another base layout. Most of all, get this game as cheap as possible.  Not more then $4.99 and certainly $1 is a bargain for you to waste an hour or 2 just to see how rediculous your crew will act.  They will leave crew to die on the floor with broken knees no matter how many doctors you have, they will fly around outside and do like one action and return with 7 mins of oxygen.  When the crew does work it makes you happy, when they all leap out the airlock to die like lemmings... well... ya, it pisses you off.			"

												It occurred to me that I should actually write something after the couple of years I've had this game. For those who weren't aware, this is an unfinished game that went from Alpha to Finished virtually overnight after Double Fine got all the money they thought they were going to get from it. It's buggy, it's extremely barebones in features, and if you buy it now you'll ""miss out"" on the Hack/Slash consolation gift they offered to us paying customers who got royally screwed by Tim of Legend. There is a modding team attempting to do (for free) the job Double Fine Entertainment couldn't be bothered to do, but buying this game will give those welchers yet more money that they can roll into their new Early Access project, which they're totally going to finish this time, honest guys. My advice: avoid.I can't say the $20 I spent on this game was a complete waste, though. It taught me two valuable life lessons: never buy a game for the promise that it'll be awesome later, and never buy any more Double Fine products for as long as I live.			"

Then you will be under constant attack with everything you build getting destroyed faster than it can be rebuilt.There is no way to turn down the frequency of attack.

												Starts off sweet but quickly becomes sour.As far as abandon titles go, this one seems like it is close to being complete. However, two big elements are missing. First, there is gameplay balance. The game starts off feeling like you can do anything in it, if you just put the time and effort into it. And for the first 20 or 30 minutes this feels true.  You expand your base, explore ships, and manage your people to get the most out of them.  But then the raiders, and meteor strikes happen. And this is where the missing gameplay balance is most obvious.  Negative events are important to any game, if things were always good, than there wouldn't be any challenge. But the speed, and frequency of the negative events needs to be balance out against what the play can and cannot do, so that they can overcome them, and not just suffer.  I found that during the few games that I played, that I would get close to having a decent base going, only to have ruin by constant attacks, to the point where I was losing a lot more people than I was generating. Which resulted in me having a large empty base that I had no chance of defending or using.The second element is content. There isn't much in this game... Overall, this is not a game that you should spend money or time in.			"

								Sims in space lite with permadeath and poor pacing.  Please fix entire game....Okay, it's actually very addicting, which is WHY the permadeath (no save points) make it that much more brutal.  IT TAKES SOOOO LONG to have a decent base, and then boop, everyone dead.The mechanics are pretty good, but the placing of objects is off sometimes, and the interface could use a lot of work.  But it's fun to see your little colony doing well!  And so so brutally frustrating after crew have been given the ""builder"" job yet refuse to install the air reclaimers, asphyxiating your entire base.  The entire crew apparently has mono because all they ever do is eat and sleep, it seems.  For a game that's been in development this long it's kind of surprising how not nearly done it is.  But I love this company and when it IS done, this game will likely be awesome.It IS Alpha! People who like this say it's similar to play Prison Architect.  So I'm going to go play that now.  Too bad it's not in space. :(			"

												This game had promise, particularly since it was backed by  largely well thought of and high pedigree studio.  Unfortunately, their business model depended on coninued purchase throughout developmento fund more work, and they abandoned the game.  Double Fine should be ashamed of how they abandoned their customers and stopped development.  This whole experience seriously makes me think twice when buying a Double Fine game now.			"

												I liked the concept of this game, but ultimately it proves so frustrating to play.Everything from the UI to the AI slowly starts to grate on you. Take when the player has to first build the room for power and life support and an airlock - even though I did it fine each time, a bunch of times the little crew members would refuse to go inside and instead ran out of air while floating and wandering around outside while marvelling at their craftsmanship.Send your virtual minions to collect rocks so that you can build more areas for them to live in and shelves for their..tentacle monsters and sooner or later you will encounter... SPACE PIRATES! Okay, it is not nearly that dramatic, it becomes such a casual occurrence (so much so you get invasions right after each other, yaay..), the problem is these visits throw stuff into chaos. Security team, arm phazers, set them to stun or kill, I don't know, just get rid of these guys! Mr Wol--, what the... So even if you go to the security tab and tell your security team to defend a breach point a lot of the time they will stand idle and just be cut down one after another and the SPACE PIRATES will go on their merry way butchering your whole crew.How to prevent this? Set EVERYBODY to security since that is the only way people defend themselves properly, afterwards you can try to figure out who does what job. CHAOS, Chaos everywhere, send in space marines to purge all this chaos.After learning that my security were completely incompetent I instead put turrets, over there, outside, in that room there.. EVERYWHERE! Turrets are far more effective than actual people, you don't need to worry about losing something that took ages to level up and they kill raiders near instantly. <3 Turrets.Base is defended - rockin'! Crap, tons of dead bodies in the base, mostly raiders but also my own people sometimes too, but they are making the crew depressed. No worries, the doctors will clear these bodies and recycle the matter, or at least they should. Doctor doctor, emergency paging dr. Beat, corpse rotting in life support room, whole station being flooded with smell of rot and bacteria! DOCTOR! I stare at my doctors and notice two standing in the infirmary playing videogames (curse you videogames!) and another one in the pub getting drunk and brawling. I sigh and decide that if they want to look at them so bad then sure, they can keep their cadaver friends.Despite my doctors being either drunken masters or videogame addicts, I don't have any huge illnesses or parasitic worms devouring the crew lately. Still no work is getting done, so I change all the bartenders to other stuff hoping this abolition will get people to work.I have miners and builders getting picked off by raiders and kill bots because the AI does not avoid danger and there is no way I saw to tell them to stop and go home. I stop caring if my crew die, it is worse than herding sheep because at least sheep run away from danger, crew numbers drop, bodies piling up, nobody cares and just drinks away their sorrows on Spacebase. I decide to quit playing the game before the chaos and stupid mechanics get to me and I become as apathetic as the crew, right before I quit - I notice that a doctor is finally removing all the dead bodies on the ship. Double Fine, could have done better. The game had potential, but abandoning it rather than fixing stuff was much easier for them.			"

This game is good but it seems to be nothing more than the best of genres from decade past - not a bad thing but a thing that retails at £12.99 as a complete package.This feels like a game from experienced developers going back to their roots and as such I belive they should have the courage of conviction by offering a discounted Alpha and not a inflated overpriced one.

								This is quite a fun game but even when all the problems are fixed it will still be a failure.Current issues: The game A.I. is broken which means everything else is currently broken too. Every type of crewmember forgets how to do their job every now.. builders wont build, botanists ignore plants etc (restarting the game every 15 mins helps).  Game settings (all 6 of them) dont always work. Some features are unfinished (which is understandable). There are a lot of graphical glitches & bugs.Game issues: There is very little to do. You can research everything and build a fully functional space station in 30 mins.  Then you just sit and wait for the RNG to do its thing and thats it. Even if the A.I. & everything else is fixed it'll still be broken the same way most god/build/sandbox games are. Every game will end the same way, you'll keep building until some RNG event inevitably breaks things ruining your game.			"

I REALLY don't care what fictional bands my colonists enjoy and I certainly don't want to read through their mental diharrea to find out what exactly displeases them. The worst part are the conversations with ships arriving at your spacebase. I had more meaningful conversations with my cat...Can not recommend this game at any price. I tried to like it but it's really just a waste of time.Get Dwarf Fortress, Prison Architect, RimWorld or Banished instead.			"

								This game had great potential when they launched it back in October. And now, 9 months later, it is still solidly stuck at potential. They add a new room about once every other month or so, and that's about it. There are still really rudimentary bugs that they have shown no progress toward fixing, and it still feels incredibly unpolished, and they still have yet to add any fun. For the amount of time this has been in development, this little progress on it is really unforgivable. I can't recommend it unless someone actually takes its development seriously.			"

They have delievered what they said they would, but i think pateince is required for alpha games from small (ish) developers. However i do not think its worth £18.99 yet... 11.99 maybe. The AI needs a lot of work still and after a few games it can become repetitative. Not much changes from base to base. You will encounter the same problems again and again.  5/10 @ Alpha 5a			"

								This game has some promise but currently is a little dull. It is standard resource collection, building, and some disaster management. I think they are aiming for something like The Sims in space, but there isn't really a spark to make this game interesting, and also it is full of bugs. There is a difference between an early access game and an alpha game. I'd expect early access to have the features, but minimal bugs, like most other early access games (E.g. Godus). This game falls short of the marketing and I think there are other more interesting, more engaging games on Steam to try first, e.g. Craft The World.			"

I love games based in space and I LOVE LOVE LOVE strat games and world building games or anything where you build a base.  This game is about building a base in space... and it sucks♥♥♥♥♥ Building a base is difficult enough but keeping your crew alive is damn near impossible.  Game is just frustrating.  Worst of all, in a genre where customization is key, there's F'ing nothign to build.  There's like 8 room types maybe, none of which really matter because placeable objects are mostly restricted to room type... and most room types only have 1-2 constructable objects spare a few that have like 4-8... but the one that has 8... the pub...... the only part that even does anything is the bar.Game is just garbage.

												The game seems like it has potential, but it simply isn't even close to being there yet. Releasing it to the public in this state was a mistake. Everything feels extremely barebones, and I've encountered numerous bugs that forced me to start over (such as people getting stuck in an airlock). There's even a room type that does absolutely nothing (why even add it in yet?). I'm assuming said room will, in the future, function as a power plant for your station, but at the moment it's purely for decoration.The character relationships aren't close to being where they should be, and it doesn't seem like there's any reason to build separate quarters for each character over one communal bedroom. I was looking forward to the inhabitants becoming friends, getting married, having kids, etc. At the moment it seems the only relationship types are ""friend"" and ""enemy"".The random events seem limited to a debris pummeling your station, raiders arriving, and new recruits arriving. Debris is easily dealt with by installing a fire extinguisher in each room, raiders will leave if asked, and new recruits offer to stay no matter how poorly you're running your station. I bought this game expecting to build my very own Babylon 5 or Deep Space 9, but it simply isn't anywhere close to being there yet. I'm very much looking forward to new features and improvements, but at the moment I cannot recommend this game. I do think that will change in the future if the game lives up to the potential of its concept.Edit: Since I wrote this, Double Fine has announced that they're leaving this game an unfinished mess. Stay away. Far away. And boycott Double Fine.			"

												Post v1.06 Update:Derlict games (a community team) has picked up the task of fixing what Doublefine left for us.Progress is slow but allready with v1.07 and v1.071 the game is noticably improved. Many bugs are fixed and there are quite a few new structures avalible.Unfortunately becuase Doublefine only released the Lua Scripting what can be done is very limited in nature and many aspects of the game are being rewritten from scratch to make them more eaisly worked with.I dont reccomend buying Spacebase DF-9 yet. In time that will change but there still are better games out there like Startopia.Origional Review:I previously had a negative review of the early access for this game due to various bugs, quicks and gamebreaking issues. I went into 1.0 with the intent of  viewing the game as a clean slate and giving it a fair chance at a positive review.Unfortunately though nothing has changed.The AI is terrible, and incapable of even the most basic levels of prioritisation. Crew will get stuck behind objects which is a new issue for the game this sort of thing wasent a problem in previous alpha releases. The initial seed powering system is still buggy. I had to rebuild the room around it 3 times before it registered leaving me with very little resources left to actually continue my station. The predicted resource gains from mining is completely inaccurate. It gave me an estimate of around 1000 or so and i got maby 200. The event system is still stupidly unforgiving and 9 out of 10 new game attemps will fail because of massive ammounts of meteor showers hostile invaders or generally just incompetent AI.The only thing i can tell they did add was a tutorial that nobody wanted or needed. For all intents and purposes the description of the 1.0 update is nothing more than a lie, there have been no bugfixes, there is no new content.Do not buy this game. No matter how much of a fan of this genre you are this game is not worth the cost. Dont make the same mistakes myself and the rest of the community that bought into this project.			"

												I can understand completely why this game has such poor reviews. Two years after its release, it remains littered with bugs that devastate its playability. I am reccommending it because for what it costs, I think you're getting your money's worth.This game is very screwy. You've been sent deep into the galaxy to help seed the remnants of human civilization throughout space after the fall of Earth. You're not alone, you get help from nearby strangers in similar situations. You never get to actually take control of anything though, the people do whatever they want and all you can do it provide some guidance. More often than not, succeeding involves less strategy and skill, but simply getting lucky.With that said, I've been having fun with it. There isn't a whole lot to the game. I really wish they would finish it, or perhaps publish it open source so we could develope it further, because it has enormous potential to be an exceptionally entertaining experience.If you get it, you're going to notice a few problems right away. There are almost no settings. I think you can basically turn the sound on or off and that's it. The game's artwork is quite simplistic and usually runs smoothly, but the HUD menues are overloaded with special effects and animations that will make your framerate drop to crap any time they open. Once you've done the tutorial level and are ready to actually play the game, you may spend more time just looking for a decent place on the galaxy map to build your base than the time you spend actually getting to play. The whole game then gets quite confounded by the mood mechanics. While there are things you can do to help people be happier, and I've had lots of happy folks in some of my bases, they all inevitably gravitate towards depression and then stop working and everything goes to crap and the oxygen runs out and they all suffocate.Once you get to that point, you discover that there is no way to actually loose the game! Even with everyone dead and your base in ruins, you can still get new people on random chance and continue playing, even though they are almost certainly doomed.The whole game is wacky that way. It makes a whole lot of no sense. But, still, it's fun, somehow. As long as you don't think abut it too hard or take it too seriously, building one base after another while being hounded by pirates and metoeor showers and ocasionally having some suicidal idiot walk out the wrong door and drift away into space can be pleasantly amusing. This is a game you can just relax with and generally expect to fail at every time you play.			"

								Full of annoying bugs, and if you dont play the game exactly to the creators idea of how it should be played, you're sure to have lots of fun having your entire crew dying and having to start over. First 10 mins into any spacebase game is infuriating and it only gets worse.			"

												Wow. Do not buy this game.  I've wanted it for a long time but never bought it due to the god awful reviews. It starts out stupid, the first time you try to build a station from scratch.  If you don't know what you are doing you will run out of money befor having all of the life support stuff ready.  So after you create your 5th station and have mastered the exact money(matter) management you need to get a reactor, air cleaners and a matter recycler thing, youre finally good. Then one of your dudes , about 10 minutes in, gets infected by a space parasite.  You only have 3 guys.  No infirmary yet.  He turns into a giant bug and kills your entire crew.  That's really crappy.  Now, you build a new station again and no infection happens.  Good so far.  Everything is great except about 4 hours in and you love your station very much, boom raiders.  3 raiders killed all 22 of my crew, including my two 4-star security guards.  I'll never play this again.  I want this exack game minus the hazards.  I just want to build and manage, not fight parasites.  Also the order the builders build is ridiculous.  There doesn't seem to be a way to actually research things. Screw this game.			"

								It was fun for a while, until you start noticing the stupidity of the AIs: - Miners don't use the nearest airlocks and suffocate. - The techs spend their day getting fat instead of repairing equipment (especially the turrets outside the station). - Doctors don't always grab the bodies floating in space. - Everyone runs around panicking when the station loses air instead of suiting up and repairing the hole. There are also graphical glitches: - Sometimes phantom fires stay lit in the floor if the crew put the fire out without a fire extinguisher.- Airlock LED indicators often stay floating in space after the doors are removed. There are more problems, and the game features don't feel fleshed out enough. I would recommend trying this game later in its life.Edit: Now that the developers have stopped, well, developing, the game isn't a worthy investment unless you want to cry tears of sadness.			"

												A broken and unfinished game, Double Fine has fully released the game and added a mods folder, not even steam workshop support. They expect the community to repair their broken game, I enjoyed the game for the most part, that was until the raider attacks just didn't stop, sometimes it was one or two attacks, others it was five or seven at once making it impossible to survive more than a few weeks in the game. I do not recommend purchasing this game and I strongly suggest you take your money anywhere else that isn't Double Fine's pockets, I think that even EA has better games than this.			"

I regret every single of the 99cts. It just sucks. My crew keeps dying constantly without any logical reasons (especially popular: asphyxiation due to blocked air locks that other crewmembers refuse to leave or generally refusing to leave depressurized areas), i get raided all the time despite living in a VERY LOW threat sector, the build menu is awful to use and the game sometimes refuses to follow build orders due to already demolished structures that nonetheless block the construction of new ones.Don't make the same mistake i made.

								This game has potential, but in its current state, there is about 3 hours worth of somewhat buggy gameplay.   Simple things like citizens of your base being unable to figure out how to navigate through/around other citizens, or to the place where they need to do their assigned jobs.It's easy to imagine this could turn into something great (with more tech and numerous path finding bugs worked out).   Let's hope it does.At the moment, it is not a recommend for what I paid (around $15 USD).  Hope to change this in the future as the game improves and sometimes very frustrating kinks get worked out.

								There's something very engaging about this little base building sim.  The character of your citizens, the flavor of the room types and furnishings, the banter with incoming vessels.Bugginess aside, the game is still very incomplete.  It serves to give you a taste of what the finished game will be, but it wont satisfy.  For Alpha 3 though, it's in a pretty good place.But even ignoring it's alpha state, there are some issues with the design I find a bit lacking.  Issues I'm not sure will be resolved by the official launch.  For instance, there is no vertical building.  Your citizens can space walk in 3D, but you can only build in 2D.  There is also only one material to mine and build with.  Some of the other issues I could list off are relatively minor, or things that they're likely to address for RC.  But these two core design points are things that fundumentally narrow the experience, and it's not clear if they'll be resolved.Ultimatley I say wait, unless you want this sitting in your library and eyeing you until it's finished (and I'll probably update my review at that point just to be fair),			"

								HI everyone i truly love this game its awsome and new updates nice touch developers. But as of now i do not recommend the game it has been very bugy and alway lands up mysteriously without anything happening the floor disappears just one tile and everyone is flying out into space or i cant place a door down even when nothing is standing in the way or built in that location another issue is the fact that as i progress in the game getting a bigger space station i land up with 30 or more people and i have about a ton of oxygen recyclers all in good status but slowly the oxygen just drops and everyone suffocates but i check to see if oxygen recyclers have a range to wich they provide air but when i built another oxygen room in so many places the issue continued so that didnt seem to be the case and im really sorry developers about this rating but if you can fix these bugs you definetly have a thumbs up from me and probaly many others too pls fix thx and keep up the good work.

												I bought this a long time ago, back when it had really just entered the Early Access section.  My play time is more than what's shown as I play offline a lot.  The idea was sound, and I really enjoyed the game when I first tried it.  Obviously, I expected more as time went on since the game was still in development.  I also understand that development takes a long time, and isn't exactly the smoothest ride, so after a while I uninstalled and just let it sit for a while.  Seeing it just get officially released, I decided to check in on it again and find that, really, not much has changed.  I'm disappointed in the scarcity of things to do - it's a game of ""build each facility, bam you're done"", when it comes down to it, like the tablet versions of city builders such as SimCity/Metropolis/Anno/etc.  Just not much to it.I don't recommend it simply because it's not worth playing more than once, and I'm not happy paying for something like that.  Even the most single-player of experiences I tend to come back to after a while, but SpaceBase didn't have anything to it that made me say ""yeah, I'll pick it back up after I play this or that"".  Not worth a buy, not worth the time, especially given how lackluster the support has been over the period it's been available.			"

												An incomplete game they slapped a release on to call it complete, so they could make a little bit more money from being on Steam's front page for a while. I got scammed by the developers and will never purchase another product from Double-Fine again. The game went on sale literally 3 days before they announced they were cutting development and just releasing the game as is. I got suckered into that purchase assuming there would be at least another year of EA, and at least most of the features on that list would be completed. Double-Fines horrible calculation of finances and not wanting to dip into their own-pockets for a game not even released yet shows a lot about their business practice. Avoid anything from these guys in the future!As for the actual gameplay, well it's early alpha still with about 2 hours worth of gameplay before you run out of things to build and at that point you will just get raider after raider attack, meteors, and parasites mutilating your base with no chance for recovery. This game has been the biggest let-down for me since Fable 1 on Xbox back in the day :(.			"

Avoid these guys like the plague until they pull their heads out of their asses.So much promise as a company, but they can't finish anything close to on-time or on-budget.  I'm sure they are decent individuals, but as a collective group, they are utter failures.

												Wow... Had a lot of potential, but the product that Doublefine crapped out here.. I won't be buying anything else made by that ""game"" developer.The project is abandoned and unfinished. The build number claims to be 1.06, but it feels more like a 0.7 beta. Nothing is balanced and I encountered several glitches. This game was made to be modded, which in this case means the dev handed over game development to the players instead of finishing it. I would be happy with some awesome mods that finish the game out, but there is no workshop support.After four or five failed bases I thought I had got the hang of it. I had beaten every disease and easily defended against 20-30 attacks. Then a wave of attacks hit (they often come in threes within seconds of each other) and I took out the first two no sweat with my five man security team with a combined star rating of ~14 out of 25 (which is quite good). Then the last raider boarded all by himself, and killed my entire crew.I was boarded by the main antagonist of a space pirate anime apparently.I would have researched better weapons and armor, but my two man scientific team were busy trying to develop anti-viral air scrubbers to counter the relentless spread of disease.My entire population was 18. 5 Security, 2 Scientists, 1 Bartender, 2 Doctors, 1 Botanist, 4 Miners and 3 Builders. They were all busy non stop. Also, they were all assigned to professions that made them 'happy' and I had every accommodation in the game available to them in abundance, but they were all still sad/angry. I had only lost one crew member to a sudden chest bursting that I don't think could have been prevented.I really want to play this game. It is really fun up until that moment that it becomes overwhelmingly unfair and you lose three hours worth of work. Maybe they made the game so hard to compensate for the lack of content. Every so often something comes along and takes out 90% of your crew. Then you have to build back up, thus 'adding' more game play. Not fun.I give this game a 3/100. I'm going to give it one more try because I am stubborn, but I have no expectations other than a severe cussing fit.			"

												Ok, so this game.  Great concept.  Great idea, and it is done really well.  Except for one main thing.  The game constantly throws stuff at you, and sometimes there isn't actually a good answer.  Let me explain.  You are building a big section of your base.  Things are going well.  You then see a message appear on the side of the screen saying how one of your builder's space suit oxygen is running low.  Sometimes they quickly make their own way back to the airlock, stopping them from dieing.  Sometimes they just carry on working and then die.  You can try to avoid this by sending them to the infirmary (which is obviously inside) manually.  But sometimes they don't bother to listen and still die.  Another example of this game throwing rubbish into your face would be those raiders who have high tech weaponry.  It takes one of them to take out tonnes of vital parts to your station as well as many many people with inferior weaponry, and thats it.  Your space base is broken and/or on fire and half your population dead.  Yay.The random space debris causing major fires and ruptures within your base can easily kill a room full of sleeping people, again almost half your bases population. But the main thing that gets me is that for a game that is meant to be a mix between economy and fighting, all the fighting is unfair (see the first paragraph) and the economy lacks whats really needed.  The AI don't know when to prioritise fixing vital oxygen recyclers over fixing an unused door.  They also don't know when it is useful to take a break - many will take a break and not perform tasks during critical points in gameplay, causing negative effects (most prominently the players mood).  In conclusion this game has a lot of potential.  A lot.  But it doesn't have basic concepts like manual prioritization and decent AI.  The whole game needs a huge amount of balancing, and until this happens I recommend you simply follow this game, rather than get it.  If and when the devs make the changes necessary this game will definately worth the money.  But for now, I recommend you spend it elsewhere.And one other thing.  I can't for the life of me find out a way of keeping the people happy.  It may just be my incompetance, or this too may need balancing...			"

												i could not even get past the tutorial without dying or being attacked to death.  I tried the game on linux with a gtx460 and it ran ok so for functioning it works.  As for the gameplay,  if the tutorial is broken i dont feel that going into the game without knowing how to do anything would be wise.  It also leads to what Dwarf Fortress would call !fun!.  Sadly i prefer  Dwarf Fortress' idea of !fun! more enticing than DF-9.  To put it short... RNG hates you in this game.			"

												I bought this game because some youtuber hyped it up. The most disappointing game I've purchased so far. It's a very basic space colony builder and the fun doesn't last very long because you run out of things to do quickly. The developers abandoned this game so don't bother wasting your money on this.

												This game had a lot of potential, but it's left very unfinished.  A lack of settings makes the game difficult to customize, and many of the event are haphazardly thrown in.  I'm very disappointed to see this as an example of an early access game gone wrong.  It's sad that they just dropped it like they did, and with very little info on what happened.			"

												1.0 review update:I don't recommend this game anymore. The developer decided to quit working on it simply because its alpha release did not net them the money they were hoping to get. Not everyone goes for an alpha release. Some want to see the finished product.Considering the developer thinks of the 1.0 release as the finished product, let me say that I'm thoroughly disappointed in the product. I would not have bought it in this state.Instead of complaining about the lack of funds they received for their in-progress game, the developers could have simply hammered on the bugs, made a well-rounded game, and then the 1.0 release could have brought so many more people in. People who would have paid them.This is yet another example of why Early Access fails; developers pulling the plug on projects because their expectations were impossible to realize.			"

												A grate idea that showed endless promise, up until it was axed my Double Fine after Alpha 6. That's right; the game was released as a 'finished' product before it even went into bata!I enjoyed my time with the game, even in its unfinished state, but given how it was shamelessly shoved out the door and given a price slash to entice in new players who had yet to see what a half-baked product they were buying into, I cannot recommend this game in good faith, nor can I even say that you should pick up the game if you think it might appeal to you if you don't mind a lack of polish.As a moral consumer, I strongly advise you to NOT give money to this game! Even on sale, when a 5$ USD price tag might be reasonable, it is an utterly disgusting example of a once grate company using its good name to exploit its fans.			"

												Don't be fooled by the trailer or any marketing literature Double Fine put out about this game. It is incomplete, buggy, and a waste of time. Double Fine claims to have run out of funds to develop this title but what they did is squander what sales they did get to fund other initiatives like Amnesia Fortnight and a trip to GDC for the developers (about four weeks of dev time down the toilet).They then turned around and did an about face, turning this into an abandoned Early Access title.

												There is nothing more infuriating than an almost good game.  I really like the concept and mostly still had fun playing it.  The game has an annoying tendency for bases to implode (figuratively) for no discernible reason ruining hours of work. The game has no easy ability to save and as far as I can tell no way to have multiple games at the same time.  People are made of tissue paper.  Fights break out and the player has very little control as the denizens pummel each other unconscious.  I have had airlock glitch and deplete the air in the base and suffocate people. I have had people run screaming past fire-extinguishers while their co-worker's burn.  The lack of ability to prioritize building often leaves a room only a single floor tile left to be constructed.If the issues that make it un-playable were fixed then I would change my recommendation but until then a waste of money.

Product received for free
												I got this game off of Humble Bundle.Before i start, may i say I was VERY close to rating this as negative like the rest of the community seems to be doing.However, i like it as a time killer.Though this game was obviously designed to be added upon, the devs FLOPPED with content, leaving a phrase i keep seeing as ""Abandonware"". This accurately describes Spacebase DF-9. I got it for a buck, so it was probably worth that one George Washington for a 6 hour timekill.Everything else about this game is disapointing.Oh well.It's sad to see such a good concept DIE.			"

												Obviously there is no shortage of hatred on this game. And it is not undeserved by any means. Double Fine betrayed all of the supporters of this game by making many promises, delivering very few, and eventually completely abandoning this game. I've owned it for quite some time, as I purchased it very shortly after it was greenlit. I'm not here to White Knight in any way for the Dev(Double Fine).  Screw. Those. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  I will never purchase anything from them ever again.However... There is yet, a glimmer of hope. Now, it's no secret that this game is riddled with bugs, and malfunctioning features. But due to the hard work of a dedicated group of gamers, coders, and modders, an unofficial patch has been released for the game. It fixes -many- of the game-breaking bullsh!t that plagued the game, and even adds some additional features. It's easy to find via the game's forum page, for any who are interested.So in my opinion, with that patch, the game is worth a try. Don't like it? Refund it. I find it extremely fun, with some very unique mechanics and concepts that I've never seen elsewhere. The promise that this game had was immense. It's very obvious that, before they decided to run away with the cash, the Devs were being extremely creative when making this game. TL/DR:  The game deserves a shot, as long as you use the unofficial patch.			"

								I'm not really sure what to think about this game. It seems that there are still a lot of balancing issues in the game, making it very hard to play a single sustained station, and now that they've mentioned they're going to stop development on the game, after the next update, I don't think these things are going to get fixed.It was a nice idea, while it lasted, and maybe it's even fun...

												Meteors destroying your base every 3 minutes Simulator.Update: A.I. is more stupid than previous updates.I know it's an alpha, but seriously, on Alpha 4 A.I should be better and not worst than A.2/3.Today I did 10 bases, and I couldn't play with these more than 30 minutes (the shortest is 8 minutes because oxygen spread bug...)Reasons: -Frequent attacks of meteorites on ""Extremely low Stellar Density""- NPC blocked in construction wall, so infinite construction and stuck.- Oxygen doesn't go on other rooms and NPC A.I. too stupid to build 1 Oxygen recyclers, they prefer to eat or workout.- Builders construct 1-2 things, then eat, chat, build again 1-2 things etc.- Bartenders wait other bartenders serve them, if there is no more bartender, they wait and don't move until they have food.And what happens if Bartenders wait for food? ALL NPCs have to wait for food, but no one can serve them, so you have to get more bartenders... Because Bartenders can't cook their own food.- Lost 2 Builders and 4 technicians because they are stupid, so they are stuck in the doors in space, while Builders destroy derelicts.I loved this game before the Alpha 4, but now, there are too much bugs to enjoy it.To avoid until official release.

												In its current form the game is worth less than $1Unfortunately it may never be improved beyond that state. If you want to buy it for $1 (on sale) and hope that several years from now the playerbase mod team actually turns this into a working game, go for it.But don't say you weren't warned. I bought this for a $1 knowing what I was getting into and I can't say I'm disapointed simply because I wanted to poke around and see what all the negative hype has been about. And the reality is, this game can not be recommended with a good consience.All the potential for a good game is here and than you realize your content ends shortly after figuring out how the controls work. There's no campaign, the tutorial is laughably poor at even explaining the basics and the sandbox play (which is pretty much all that exists) is laughably short before it becomes an endless loop.You start with a random team of 3 with random skills in a random zone of space with random resources and (almost) random difficulty. You have some minor influence over how to skew the randomness (by choosing different zones of space); but in the end the only real choice you have is:pick a dangerous area or pick a non dangerous area (or rather: pick an area where you cant play because you die instantly or pick an area where nothing happens until later and than goes into an endless loop of the same easily defeated enemies)I don't know, I had some silly fun poking around with it for about an hour but there's just not much here and while I applaud the playerbase mod team for making an effort at improving the game I know full well that it could take years before there's enough fixes and content additions to make this game playable. I'll probably replay it for a few minutes every year or so just to see if they ever do anything with it.Edit: And I fell asleep listening to the music while playing, which is the only reason it looks like I have some hours of play time. Content was over in less than an hour. The rest of the listed play time was watching the spacebase like a fishbowl or sleeping with the music from the game playing.			"

												Theme Hospital meets FTL.It's a roguelike space station building game. You start with three astronauts and some supplies. After you've got the basic stuff laid out - everyone needs air and food - you're free to start kicking back and just...building a base. Positioning sleeping quarters, infirmary, dropping plants, opening a pub.Challenge comes in the form of enemy attacks. Sometimes enemy ships will close on your station and invade, other times you'll come across a derelict wreck which you can explore, though in doing so you'll generally have to fight stuff.And why are so many negative reviews around?Fan base doesn't like the way this game came from an early access to a full release, so the most of them changed their reviews to negative ones.Nevertheless the game is really good and definitely worth trying!

								Current recommendation for this game: Wait at *least* a year before purchase.As it stands this game requires MAJOR changes to even make it playable, let alone entertaining. I have been waiting since relase for this to happen, but so far it simply hasn't been done. Patches seem to be few and far between, and the current gameplay is broken so badly that even when starting a new base I have had a 90% failure rate inside of ten minutes, due mainly to minions lack of oxygen... even when my whole base consists of an oxygen recycler, and an airlock...

												Everything works well and nicely on intel and windows 10.My dear Daar has just asphyxiated because of lack of oxygen, I was a little bit attached to him. He made his work so happily. He had no enemies and did his work well. I can see what they say , their friends, enemies, what kind of music they like and their food. You can see them arguing, chatting exercising, and see their dialogues. They seem to me “real” people Several types of:  	 rooms (restrooms, infirmary, research, airlock etc) 	items to put inside (beds, closets, shelfs etc etc ) 	races	events that makes you smile and wonder what could happen if….           .- Anna invited me open the door!... 	    .-Hey We dont have any  Anna!!All that offers a wide variety of gameplay.  and replay value.It seems developer used too much money and time to make it work and profit was not good. so he decided to release the code for this game so someone could improve and patch it if they like to do it)It seems he loved so much his game that he made some  poor financial decisions and have to abandon it at the end, not without any pain.(like a divorce of someone you love so much but that is unsustainable and it is better to set it free.) This game is a treasure and there are some new unofficial patches that fix some gameplay balance issues but the game works well and I will be testing it this days.  Having the code of this game on my hands seems like a real treasure for someone with coding abilities or someone who wants to learn.( Many thing done on LUA so they are very easy to change.)http://spacebasehub.net/ for patches, and see the development roadmap and the team that is developing this game. it is not an abandoned game.Highly recommend game …			"

												November 2016: Now that the game is not so buggy and it is unoficially supported by the comunity, it is good and I really liked the time I had playing it.The major problem is the one-unique save-upon-exit (but there is a bypass for it). Permadeath is not a bad idea, since a careful strategist can beat the game and build the 'perfect' base farely easy. BUT the game still has some minor bags (once my 5 guards squad was stuck running on a wall wile 1 intruder was destroying my life support systems, another time the guard with low oxigen in his spaceswit didnt want to follow my waypoint to safty and prefered to suffocate etc). If i had only one save, I would had abandon the game in the obavo acations, writing a rage review.BUT: I reguraly exit the game and copy-paste the two save files at another folder, so I can paste-overwrite them agan later, to properly handle buggy or annoying situations. That, made the game a really nice experience: A more casual Rimworld type of base building.I strongly recoment if you go on with SPacebase, to get the unoficial patch 1.08. It adds things in the game and helps for better control of the guards (really useful).So, I recomment the game, but since the publisher is not supporting it any more and community/freelances do the job instead, I am a bit sceptic about the 10 euro pricing... Check on some gamply videos and comunity feedback, and then deside if you would prefer to wait for a high discount before purchasing this actually good game.(ps. Rimworld has also still many minor bugs, but the save system is there to make me forget about them...)			"

								Bottom line is, never trust Tim Schafer with with your money again.  He put something up here that fleeced the people investing in the game, while taking no financial risk himself.  Calling him an indie developer is an insult to indie development (PS JP, Your not a developer until you develop a finished product).  All they did was take peoples money, determine they weren't going to break even based on pre-sales, returned no ones money and banged out after a year of development.There are people breaking their backs out there to make a game.  Meanwhile your developing a quarter of a playable game in one of the most expensive cities in the US.  Try a little, or fail at your job and get offended at people for being reasonably upset at your hack job.  I bet if you had venture capital they would have crawled up your♥♥♥♥♥ but since its just the lonely plebs below they should be ashamed for belittling the pie eyed hacks you have working for you.Thanks for the code, feel free to disclose your financials if you want to not be called the fly-by-night scum that you are.If I every see Tim Schafer or JP LeBreton involved in a game, you can be sure I will not purchase it.

												A pretty fun, unfinished, Sims-meets-FTL.Started playing about a year ago, during early access. Have played the game as it developed, up until 'official release'.The theming and art of this game is excellent. It's cute without being saccharine, the dangers of space are presented realistically, which somehow feels acceptably couched within the hand-drawn avatars and cartoon 3d models. I love it.The game starts off viciously (excluding the tutorial), dropping your three spacefarers off in the blackness with a small pod of resources and 8 minutes of oxygen. Within those eight minutes, you have to build a small space station that can support a oxygen-producer, and an airlock.All my astronauts suffocated before I was able to do this, and it was excellent.The game presented me with such a challenge, I was glued, it was excellent. The first time I successfully got my guys into that little pocket of safety, I felt like that scene from Gravity.And thus ended the difficulty curve of Spacebase DF-9.From that point on out, excluding game-breaking bugs (to be addressed later), the game gets easier and easier. Your first foothold allows you to establish resource collection, you invest wisely, and eventually you have a thriving base of about 40 personnel, you've run out of local resources, and are colllecting recycled resources from passing derelicts.Some playthroughs got to be so easy, I'd just start building massive space-station shrines, or just interior hallways that stretch across space to the next resource deposit, because it was fun.Sometimes, I'd have enough surplus to just install double-walls around my entire station, so when boarders attempted their namesake, they'd just drill a entrance into the interior bulkhead.There are some minor issues I have with infrastructure, for instance, for oxygen, the recyclers produce oxygen that free-flows through the station, but aside from that, there's no real way to control it. Usually it's best to center the recyclers in the base, and build the other rooms off as spokes, but if you have say, a long hallway, the oxygen just ceases to flow down the hall, since it's 'range' is too far. The addition of oxygen ventilation, and power conduits, would be a much appreciate increase in control and complexity.This game had/has such potential, if well balanced and bug-fixed, but there are powers higher-up putting an end to that. Developer Double-Fine has recently seen a round of layoffs, shorty after CEO Tim Schaffer announced that production would cease on Spacebase DF-9. While I've not gone through the process of comparing Spacebase's credits with the current Double-Fine roster, the coincidence is certainly suspiscious. Double Fine, who since Brutal Legend have been relying on Kickstarter and Early Access to fund their products, may have found that charitable funds are not an effective way to bankroll game development.Regardless, the premature cessation of development on Spacebase has it's noticable effects. Massive, game-breaking bugs still exist, that completely ruin the expierence.For instance, technicians are tasked with repairing damaged or worn-down equipment around the base. At it's peak, I had around 20 assigned, and I typically ignore them, as they automatically prioritize things to repair.Instead, I'm focusing on the Marines I've send out to a derelict to clear any threats. Surprise, surprise, there's a xenomorph on this derelict, and I haven't committed enough troops to deal with it. As it chases the final doomed marine around the derelict, it's tail flicks a door, damaging it. I sigh as I watch the marine die to the monster, when I notice that there's movement elsewhere in the derelict.A conga-line of technicians stroll through the airlock, ready to fix the broken door. As the alien rears it's head on the first, I'm frantically trying to do anything I can to get them back into the main base. But it's too late. They're all panicked, and it's not like the game has any system to give independant commands to a single unit. I lose half of my base's population to bad AI. This is not a one-off; it has ended essentially all of my long-running playthroughs.Other bugs exist, such as the game having trouble determining what is and isn't space, which leads to things like units being sucked through an interior doorway into a bedroom, only to hover there, trapped, as if it were zero-gravity, until they starve. Or the fact that something about scientists causes them to almost immediately 'go insane' when assigned the position, causing them to run around fighting other crew, and breaking things.Some of these bugs may have been fixed since, but they were present in the game when it went 'Final', so I am writing about them here.I really, really like what this game could be, and maybe mods will get it there. You'll noticed I've 'Recommended' it on this review; while it's certainly one of the most ambivalent recommendations I've given for a game, it's entertaining and unique enough to definitely be worth playing.Get it on sale, though. And don't trust Double-Fine to not release another half-baked product... definitely wait until the next title is complete before putting cash down.			"

												Honestly I love this game From the building to the micromanigning people and there needs fears and likes.I think the feel of the game is a combination of age of empires in space + sims aspects, the reason why I say this is becasue  the building and advancing feels a bit like age of empires 2 but with aspects of sims.As in the people have there own will and do and act to there will as much as you're commands and you need to micromanage the jobs and flow of mass and keep building to acomadate all these people.I find this game quite challanging because of the constant fear of raiders diseases and parasite's oooh those damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.this will always keep you on you're toes and usually I try to keep the starting 3 people alive as long a posible and get a like and dislike in people and try to make them happy and thats challaging to keep them happy and alive with all those treaths.The building is also quite fun becasue you can basicly do wathever you want how you want it and it's always a good plan to build efficient and smart to ensure safty and easy access to you're rooms wich is also essential.Even tho the developer gave up on it people that liked the game just like me starded to update it !unofficial but they are improving the game nothing the less and working on it making it better and doing a great job on it. shout out to them amazing job people keep it up !my final Judgment The game is great if you like a age of empire in space with a personal toch I rate 8/10.Becasue the atmosphere freedom in building, managing all you're people and the sound track is great and I like it.you can play it alot and not get tired of it atleast I can haha.I will keep playing it because I find a lot enjoyment in this game but thats just my opinion.

For the HATERS, this is a INDIE game, what means that it is made by a group of about 1 to 10 people sitting nonstop developing in the same clothes and they have no/barely communication with the outside world. Wich they got probaly tired of and stopped developing. If you just dont focus on the group abonded the dev, and the bugs- wich arent much - ( there are some fixes for it). This is a very fun game. This game is just like a completed game.			"

												9.99 dollars eh steam sale .99 heck yes, I didn't want it at first because it's incomplete and $10 but now I got it for $.99.Every thing but this is good...sometimes I don't know, when I have 6 scientists In a room building a phaser rifle all of a sudden a victim in the med-bay in the reviv-a-bed gets right out when being healed and dies (gets out of healing, decides to kill his self, and dies...with room at 96 oxygenated goodness no parasite, starvation, nothing just...dead...) other than that it's a good game except having to click all members to see who needs or wants what there needs to be a overall status bar, not sure if it's in the game and idk how to do it or in a upcoming update, anyways these two things are the only problems I have and Developers, good job making the game i love it...and I just finished downloading last night.✍🏻			"

												Fun diversionary game.  If you get it for a few dollars, it is worth a purchase but don't pay full price since there just isn't enough content.   The tutorial is decent.  I haven't found the Lua modding community for this game that the developers were hoping would expand their content.  For a lower price and some DLC, or more content at its full price, this game would have been a great afternoon or light weekend game. Helpful ObservationsInstalled turrents in quantity seem to be the best bet for security but lack the ability to investigate the derilict ships.  Watch the lights on the airlock doors (they go from full lights when pressurized to no lights when depressurized).  The airlock will only handle as many characters at a time as there are spacesuit lockers and space for.			"

												I don't understand why this game has so many negative reviews. Don't get me wrong, to have it bought and then find out that the devs would cease development, I would probably be angry too...but it's no longer early access, and for 2,45 I have to say that it has all I want. The music is nice, the scenery is nice, and the gameplay is good. I mean...you build habitats in space!!!It relaxes me VERY much and I can't do anything else but recomend it. Maybe it's not worth 9,99, but having bought it on sale I have no regrets!			"

												Ok let me start by saying I love this game. The best way to describe it is that it is kind of like SimCity and also the Sims but it is in space. You have to build a space colony from scratch and take care of your people. You build things for you colony to aid in research, life support, things to do for your crew and so on. You have to mine materials and manage resources in order to last a while. You must make sure you keep an eye out for raiders and derilect ships. This game is like a Sims game on steroids. If you don't like games like the Sims or SimCity you may want to pass this by but if you do enjoy games like that then this is a must have. The neat thing is that all of this happens in a sci-fi setting and the game can be addictive as you want to do the best you can for your crew and protect them from raiders. Make sure you get the The Officially Unofficial v1.08 Patch! Now with Brainworms! to make the game even more enjoyable. Trust me.			"

												Well, I find it fun. The only problem I have is with the raiders. It starts off fine but there is a certain point where it was one after another until everyone was dead. I mean, I was fighting off two groups of them while another appeared. It's rather annoying. Many things could have been worked on. Looking past the mistakes, I like the game. I'm a big space fan and if you can look past the problems it does have, you MAY enjoy it.UPDATE:Yeah, literally just started a new base just to be attacked twice almost instantly. Then, later on, three attacks at the same time. I could understand if I chose a dangerous location but where I'm at, danger is said to be low. I don't see how anybody can get a functioning base in time unless you really throw out defense measures. I also see that this problems is irritating many people. Could anything be done to change this?			"

Couldn't do anything even after several tries.It's a waste of money, and that steam is selling this for 20bucks is ridiculous.EDIT October 8 2015:An update rolled out and the game now actually works, I'm greatly enjoying this even though it's mostly basic base building with not too much to do other than assign people to mine, food, build and maintenance. It's fun but gets kind of dull after a while, I'm now changing my review to positive only due to the fact something has changed and it actually works in an enjoyable way.			"

												I guess this game has gotten such bad reviews because the previous developer dropped it after people had already bought it.  Well now it seems like it's finished.  Great UI, great concept, lots of fun.  Reminds me a lot of the old Outpost series, but with a greater focus on your people/birdmen/chickenmen/frogmen etc. I really like that you can plan out the design of a room before confiming it and having your builders build the objects, but wish that you could do the same thing when laying out the room initially.  Something like a building simulation mode where you can place the walls and then place the objects to make sure that you have the room dimensions correct.  I've built a few rooms where I've discovered that the walls need to come out another tile and then had to send my builder back outside again to fix it... If the devs did this I think it would be the first sim that I've played with this feature, design first then build.  Then I wouldn't need to keep drawing my rooms first on grid paper... haha.			"

												I'm writing a positive review to this game only for 1 reason - current fanpatch(v1.08.1) made this game quite playable - when you`ve figured out this game at least(i made a little guide for the game anyway - ""Nova-class fortress"").As game in raw - you are building a space base populated by lazy idiots. They dont do what they must, fight for no reason and die for that reason. 10/10 simulator of why idiots must not be around base. Ppl jump off airlocks, fight fire with bare hands - that's raw spacebase.Anyway, you're building yourself a spacebase. From scratch. You need to get Air recyclers, beds, medical care, food and later - garden-made food. For all of that you use matter mined out of asteroid chuncks. Ppl have different skills and job preferences. Sometimes you gonna get raiders, sometimes - derelicts with raide/parasites/killbots. You also need to research new stuff in order to survive. And in the end - fight off massive raider attack.For great idea this game had, it's a shame that the game was never finished, but with fanpatch and other stuff game is quite funny and can test your wits and nerves. Also, bought game with discount - so it's worth it's price for me. Shame no achievements evne though game has goals(things like achievements).			"

Few new items as well.Keep an eye on this game as if they keep up the good work it could become what we all hopped for originally.---------------------------------------------------Excellent space base build game.  Played it for a little while then got annoyed as the original developers abandoned it after a quick final few patches.  Making the game getting really bad reviews.... BUT.  It looks like someone is gonna save the game and a new roadmap has been written up.  Lets watch and hope :)http://www.spacebasehub.net/roadmap.html "

												ONLY BUY THIS ON SALE!!!!!!!!!!Admittedly at first with this game I bought it in early access, I ranted and raved about it and it had amazing potential to be an extraordinary game. The game itself offers good game play and a decent UI, the tutorial is standard, does the job. The only thing that annoys me about this game is that although the features the game has are damn cool and entertaining (at least for 37 hourish ahaa) it had the potentially to become one of the best but sadly double-fine as per usual started as being active with the alpha community but did the inevitable thing they almost always seem to do and screwed everyone by being half arsed and essentially slapping a for sale sign on an alpha despite many things 'in the pipeline' so they claimed (including workshop compatibility which would have only made this game even more fun to play, more features, more control, more events and ultimately a better game). So i will still recommended this game, but however please ONLY BUY THIS ON SALE!!!!!!!!!! I only say this as double-fine seem to developing quite a habit of not fully developing their games that they release early access and shafting what is always an active community of fans to 'work on other projects'.... In other words they wants to see the $£$£$.... like a street hooker who starts buy giving you some amazing head and then bolting down the street leaving you to realise they've provided an albeit enjoyed but unfinished and overall crappy service while stealing your money and running onto the next chump.... (I use that analogy as it actually happened to a friend of mine once, hardest I've ever laughed).... Despite all of that however I cannot find it in my heart to not recommended this game as I thoroughly enjoy it....			"

												I bought this game really early on and i still had a ton of fun with the limited things to do, now that ive played the full release, i can see theyve done alot of work, theyve fixed a huge amount of bugs and glitches that i used to see. The game goes pretty well now. I see people complain about the raiders, well you can build turrets to repel the ships before they even arrive, its all a learning process honestly, youll need to try a few new games before you find a nice balance.Now I will say that there are still a few glitches but nothing gamebreaking. And I think the power system needs reworked because my base is covered in reactors but im somehow still need power. I also would think that there is alot more they could add to the game (rooms, objects, defences, other customizations) to have more things to do, but Im happy with its current state and id deffinately say this game is worth $10			"

												Spacebase DF9’s 2,859 “mostly negative” reviews (at the time of writing) are probably more a testament to Steam’s ubiquity as a content delivery tool than to the game’s own (very real) problems. And it does have problems, to be sure, but depending on your outlook and how much you pay for it, they’re not insurmountable.Its gameplay appears at first to be something along the lines of the legendary Dwarf Fortress, Mucky Foot’s 2001 classic Startopia, or Firefly Studios’  2003 Space Colony, but its flaws – the result of a suddenly-abandoned development process – make it play more like a Roguelike. Your rather nebulous goal is to re-populate the galaxy by building endless space stations, staffing them with an ever-increasing supply of wandering space travellers and keeping them happy and safe from weird diseases, bloodthirsty raiders and each other. Material for building comes from mining asteroids or disassembling passing wrecks and derelicts, and your rooms and corridors are built and then assigned different uses – residential, life support, various social, scientific and utilitarian functions. There’s a strong people-management aspect too, as each new arrival at your base can be assigned to one of eight different duties, each of which will make them feel varying degrees of satisfaction or frustration, and each of which they’ll be good or bad at according to a 1-5 star system. In all respects, the UI is super friendly and makes juggling your people as easy as possible. Which is great, because you can eventually build gigantic structures with literally dozens and dozens and dozens of crewmembers. Crucially though, you have almost zero direct control over your people. You can only order them to report to the infirmary if they’re injured, and even then it may take them a while to limp their way over.At first, as you learn the ropes, each new game comes hard and fast. Death comes as a result of being ill-prepared to research a disease cure, or not having sufficient defences against a surprise Raider attack, or for any one of dozens of interestingly unfortunate and unforeseeable reasons (usually often as funny as they are frustrating). But the actual process of making your space stations is so much fun that the urge to immediately try again keeps you clicking, again and again, learning more and more each time, developing and abandoning new ideas and strategies as you go. Spacebase DF 9 is very much one of those Civ/Morrowind-type games that suck the hours out of your life without you realising. Be prepared for some really late nights if you decide to have ‘just one quick go’ before bedtime.Adding to this feeling is the game’s own save system, which by default consists of toggle-able silent autosaves and a Save and Quit menu option. Like a psychopathic lover, Spacebase DF9 doesn’t want you to be anywhere other than inside it, grinding at full speed. Played like this, the feeling is very much of a  Roguelike’s ‘one life, one death’ trip, and all of this helps mitigate the pain of being screwed by one of the game’s terrible bugs or imbalances.Yes, they are quite terrible, unfortunately. But in the twenty hours that I’ve played it so far, the problems have been all about imbalance and lack of tweaking, rather than outright bugs. One of the worst of these is the fact that the guns on enemy ships, once they’ve boarded you, remain ‘hostile’ even after you’ve killed or captured the invaders (sometimes they can even be reformed and will join your crew to start a new life), or claimed their ship as your own. Only by eventually disassembling enough of the enemy ship will you be able to cut off power to the gun, thus making it safe. But getting to the bloody thing can be a real game-breaker – these defensive turrets have great range and cut through people in spacesuits like a lightsabre through yogurt. It’s at times like these that the lack of direct control over your spacemen becomes a real tooth-grinder, and you can end up with piles and piles of floating corpses made up of the Builders who foolishly crossed in front of the guns to get behind them (in space, the AI paths in direct lines from point-to-point), as well as the Doctors who went to retrieve their corpses. As far as imbalance in the invisible numbers, the worst offender is the near-constant brawling that goes on. At best this leads to a trip to the brig to cool off for the aggressor and a trip to the infirmary for the victim. At worst, guns will be drawn, and people and facilities start falling. In-fighting is a result of a brilliant system of cabin fever that is determined by various things, including job satisfaction and a host of actual personal feelings and emotions, all of which can be monitored on the crew’s individual profiles. Assigning two people who hate each other to a double cabin is a recipe for disaster, while the sight of bloody corpses littering the place has an obvious impact on depression (especially if the deceased was someone’s friend). But again, due to the abruptly aborted development process, it’s one of several crucial, glaringly imbalanced systems. Which, unless Double Fine release the source code, as they’ve promised to but still not yet done, may never be properly sorted out. This is doubly frustrating because a lua-based modding system is present and correct, but so far nobody’s done anything with it.Like the similarly blighted and similarly great fun Aliens: Colonial Marines, it’s a game with a bad reputation that in reality is only partially deserved. Early adopters and those who saw the potential for a Dwarf Fortress in space have every right to be annoyed (and to make those thousands of “negative” Steam reviews). But for those of us coming to the game in its ‘finished’ state, and aware of the lingering problems, there is still much fun to be had. Double Fine’s original plan for the game was hugely ambitious, ultimately requiring much more funding than they could successfully raise for it (hence the truncated development). It was only unfortunate that they had already taken it well into the Early Access phase at USD 20 a pop before they realised this. But that’s one of the risks of public alphas, crowdfunding and transparent game development. Like condoms, no one's happy when they go wrong. If we’re looking at it in financial terms, then in my case I bought it in the 2015 Steam summer sale at -50%, or EUR 4.99, and have played it now for nearly 21 hours. My feeling is that I’ve had at least 20 Euros of fun from it, and that’s quite important. With some AAA titles costing nearly 60 Euro-dollarpounds and offering dozens of hours of gameplay, but failing to deliver even half as much fun, for a flawed gem like Spacebase DF9 to give you that elusive feeling of true, full-belly satisfaction is, I think, quite a feat.

												/edit I love how I posted this and then they did the 180 on the game like a couple days later. Belief misplaced. I really wish someone would finish this though, it was really fun.I recommend this game because I believe in Double Fine and really want it to work out. I played the super early super basic demo a long time ago and it's came a long way from that, but still has a lot to go. At this point in early access, you're paying to help support the game's creation as well as beta testing it. There's a lot that needs work, but you can see where it's going.Some very weird things that happened:-A room got hit with a meteor, caught on fire, and they would just kind of use the room normally. I thought ok, I'll put a fire extinguisher in there. The guy walks into the fire, builds the extinguisher, walks out, room stayed ablaze until I quit for the night. They would seriously walk in, use the console to research something, and walk out. Hilarious, but buggy.-Ships would dock with mine, then nothing would happen. Nobody would come from the ship, nobody would go into the ship. Nothing. One time one of my people had a panic attack and ran into all the rooms of the docked ship that allowed me to claim them, but there was nothing in there. -I had to rezone the Brig to something else so prisoners would maybe leave there and get food instead of starving to death. -I had an incapacitated invader just kind of chill out in my main room doing nothing. I eventually forced the cop to put him in the brig where he slowly converted to being a member of society, but couldn't figure out how to unbrig him so he also slowly starved to death. Added food processor in the brig, they kind of just decided death was better, and died. I mean really? Those are bugs, but they're also pretty hilarious. I'm backing this game because it's fun, even in it's buggy state, and I believe Double Fine will hammer this stuff out.			"

												I once had a base bustling with 30 highly skilled workers working together in flawless harmony. Then raiders came and killed EVERYONE and destroyed all the oxygen generators, which then led to their death, leaving my base as a graveyard for me to revisit any time. Occasionally being visited by more raiders to add to the body count of suffocated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.The game itself is actually pretty fun, one thing that was never fixed was the AI. The AI will build a base then float around until they die instead of entering the airlock, they take forever to do their jobs or just won't do it entirely. The game also lacks content in general, the bases get bigger but still get filled with the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ lots of repetitious dialogue amoung other things. Having a pub doesn't seem to actually do anything, they eat chicken instead of paste and that's really it. My crew was also very depressed and just liked to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of each other all of the time, I tried to make it better but no matter how many shelves I put up they just wouldn't be happy. The gameplay is fun but it needs work, work that isn't being put into the game anymore.			"

												Its a mix between FTL, Banished,  and Prison Architect, but not. Each play through is different and each galaxy is different. With no real difficulty level, its really good endless fun and chance. If you like space, building, and running things, this game will fit your profolio.I have read other reviews about the game not being complete, the devs dropping everything and running, plus the studio giving this a death sentence. In reality, what game studio doesn't? The game has potential and can be fixed, but its open for modding. I think they set out to make a Minecraft type of game and hope the community would run off with it, which it hasn't so far. Take it for what it is, wait for it to go on sale, to a price your happy with, and enjoy its quirks and misgivings. Oh, if you find a great MOD, please let me know.			"

								A great game that suffers from AI issues, the mechanics are great and remind me of Dwarf Fortress, without the ASCII issues.The AI issues are minor if you don't mind builders taking forever to finish their ques while the bartenders play games and sleep before they serve people food, and the miners sufforcating because someone else as using the airlock. A patch to make people return to the nearest airlock and get pressurised before the suit oxygen lvl get to 1% would be nice, not as many people would asphyxiate that way.

								I must say that despite my disappointment that many of the features that were suggested as possibilities did not make it into the alpha and most likely will not make it into the 1.0 release.  It would be nice if Double Fine Productions were willing to keep this game in a beta state and continue active development of it, but despite this, I still find this to be a very fun game with a lot of potential.  Thankfully, that potential won't be wasted.  Double Fine is including the lua source for developers to mod this game.  While, this would be a very fun project to undertake, unfortunately I don't have the monetary resources to take a year or two off of life to mod this myself.  While this game in its current state is fun and enjoyable, it lacks the depth to justify the price tag in my opinion.  I think with a little more effort to add these features instead of relying on the modding community, a lot of these reviews would be a lot more favorable.  That being said, I love this game for what it is and even more for what it has the potential to be which is the only reason I'm recommending it.			"

								There are quite a few bad reviews for the game. Most people seem concered about the current state of the game. While the game is a long way from finished, maybe I can put a couple of concerns to rest.This game is a double fine game. Double Fine are an experience developer, who have made games such as Brutal Legend, The Cave and Phychonauts. They have built up quite a reputation and are very unlikely to leave thish game unifinished.Also, this game is being developed on Linux from the get-go. On the off chance someone from Double Fine actually reads this, let me just say this was really awesome of you guys! I have recently stopped using windows and am very happy to see all my Double Fine games not only run on linux. But run better on linux. (Seriously, I get like double FPS on Brutal Legend!)Really great linux support, really fun even while it's no where near complete. Also planning to do an LP of it soon :D			"

I enjoyed it and I look forward to playing it properly when it's more complete, but this is one of those early access titles that when it says it's an alpha, it really means it.In the meantime why not enjoy Startopia?

												The game has so much incredible potential, but it is stymied by a lack of development. The many jobs/professions operate fairly well, but ultimately it all comes crashing down by the mid to late game. Once raiders and derelicts inhabited by hostiles become more commonplace, the utter incompetence of your security staff makes exploration and defense near impossible.The game as a whole is an excellent distraction and I never feel as though I wasted my time, but I do wish your citizens were at least a quarter as competent as the enemy raiders.

												After glancing at the review page for this game, I feel obligated to share my experiences with this game.Some of the positives:*You have to actually plan a base and monitor your resources in order to survive*Every play through is different.  *You choose what type of game you plan on embarking on from the very start.   - Do you want a lot of hostiles?   - Do you want to build your base close to a warp gate so you will have visitors (Friendly & hostile?)   - Stellar Density: Do you want to have an abundance of ""money"" or do you want to have to really work for it?Some of the negatives:*Yes, the game is no longer being developed*Yes, there are many things not completed   -The game is still very much playable*Yes, there are many features that should have been added in, via the Dev’s constant updates, such as:   -Multi-level base construction   -Teleporters   -holodecksThis game started out as an early access game and unfortunately it also ended that way.  The way I see it, anyone on steam, including myself, takes a chance when buying a game that is in early access.  Will it be phenomenal? Will it suck? When will development finish? Will it ever finish? Will this new bug fix crash the entire game? The game may not be 100% complete, but at least Double Fine released the source code to their fans to continue development.  Sometimes, it's the fans that understand the game on a much deeper level than the developers ever could.  With that being said, should you purchase this game at $20?  In short...NO WAY!!  Should you never play this game though? NO!!! Wait for it to go on sale and purchase once the price drops to a good amount.  You can get HOURS AND HOURS of play time out of this game - and isn't that what you want from any game you decide to sit down and play?!?! "

								Some people may be thrown off by the idea of buying a game in its alpha stage, but I have so much fun playing this. No matter how glitchy or buggy it may be (I have only encountered two bugs, while some people have encountered a bunch), it is all about the setting and the experience that this game creates. I started to play this game, and 4 hours later realized I had memorized patterns, and adapted my strategy, adapting to chaos and catastrophe. There is a sense of accomplishment when you get all of your crew members to an emotional state above just ""Happy"" and reading their logs to see what is going on in their lives. This space simulator is addicting and engaging, and I am very impressed by the amount of detail and development behind such a broken masterpiece.			"

								It's an alpha, so you aren't really getting much right now. However, the developers are quite up front (and accurate) about what is currently in the game and have posted their near-future plans as well as those that are a bit further out. In particular, keeping morale up is very important (and not something you are really going to notice at this stage unless you check the forums) and isn't the easiest to do. I'm also not a huge fan of the fact that objects only have 2 orientation choices right now (as opposed to 4). However, all in all it has kept me amused for a good amount of time and offers a lot of promise for the future.			"

												While I do agree with the negative reviews in that the execution of the ideas that could have resulted (and still can result) in a gem of a game is mediocre at best, I still cautiously recommend it.Below, I list the bad and the good aspects of the game based on my very short experience playing it (one hour is normally enough for me to make my decision, but I leave it up to you to decide whether it is enough to trust my review).The bad:- The AI of your colonists is not the best, but is getting better.- The game becomes repetitive really soon (for me, it has after the first hour playing it)--there is just no hierarchy, almost no gradual development (save the research), and frankly not much to do as of now.- There is no balance. I am pretty sure the developers got their inspiration in the Dwarf Fortress (where ""dying in fun"" TM), but I am able to play a game of Dwarf Fortress for days, but here my colonists die horribly within 15-20 minutes (raiders, fire or what not).The good:- The graphics are pretty good. I liked them a lot.- The atmosphere of the game is its best selling point, IMO. Save the frustration of loosing each game I play pretty quickly, I like how the game feels. The colonists have their own characters, interact with each other and the environment, make friends and enemies--and all of this creates a feeling of a growing community in space, which is unfortunately quickly sent to oblivion, heh (see the balance).- Enabling the support of mods is the best of the developers' decisions, which I think has the potential to save this game. There are mods already that address the balancing issues, and I am sure there will be mods fixing the AI, adding more things to do, and generally, adding depth to the game.Despite all the drawbacks of the game, I still recommend it for one particular reason: it (still) has an enormous potential to grow into a fantastic game.I understand the reasons for the negative reviews, but I also know that these reviews can eventually bring the development of the game to a halt. And this would be the most unfortunate turn of events, as the game, as I said, has the potential to become a fantastic game that offers its players countless hours of fun (and not frustration as it is now =) playing experience.As for now, the price of the game is somewhat high for what it offers, so I suggest you buy this game on sale, and try it (with mods). I also hope more mods will be made for the game to enhance/improve it.			"

												Going against most of the people here, it seems, I think DF-9 should get a generally positive review.So you know where my view comes from: I bought this game early in alpha because I had a DF coupon, but I rarely play early EA games.  Aside from a quick try in alpha, I have only played the current 1.06.  I also rarely look in the forums, so perhaps I'm less angry than some.  :)Bottom line: if you enjoy city/base/island-building sandbox games, you will enjoy this.I found exploring the game after a minimal tutorial enjoyable.  I had several false-starts and refined my base layout as I went.  Lost one decent early base when I learned the difference between tear down and vaporize: when removing a section of wall, vaporize removes everything including the floor.  Everybody was blown out before it could be repaired.The graphics and animation quality are quite nice as are most of the sound effects.  The user interface is also easy to use in most cases.  It has a few issues when it comes to placing objects, especially ones that go on walls.  Even though they might be hard to see sometimes, the game does not allow you to use the south-east and -west walls interior (hidden) side for object placement.  Turrets are one of the few items that can face in any direction and it can be difficult to place the turrent as it will jump from wall to wall.  There needs to be a manual method to move the selection tile-by-tile.  It matters where the turret's cone of fire reaches.The AI is perhaps not superb, but so far I haven't had any serious issues with it.  At least, not yet.  Pathfinding seems okay, as long as your base isn't riddled with paths because of doors everywhere.  Picking/keeping a good crew goes along way towards avoiding frustration.  You should also invest some time in keeping them happy.  It can be difficult sometimes, but all of the information you need it given in their tabs.Sometimes, though, the AI will do something really stupid or annoying.  Like avoiding the conveniently placed fire extinguisher in the hallway and trying to stamp out the fire.  It seems as though the extinguisher must be within the room on fire.Of course, sometimes it helps to discover or know the AI's priorities.  With builders, for example, it's rather easy to observe their work, or lack of it, and to figure out what they prioritize.  They tend to prefer building floors before walls, and walls before any indoor work, and so on.  So, if you have a room built and while waiting for it to be filled you plan on a new hallway, the builders will drop their indoor work and go add that new section of hull first.The game's biggest flaw, by far, then is the lack of depth.  Except for the residence and pub areas, every room has only a very small number of objects that you can place in it.  Researching does not alleviate this problem as you really just get upgraded versions of an object or an upgraded replacement model.  That's not bad, but it would be nice to have a number of topics to research (maybe based on your contact with alien visitors) that would give you new objects to use in rooms or maybe even a new room type.This lack of depth and seeming lack of forward progression after a point seem to be the primary reasons other posters give for giving the game a thumbs down.  These really impact the length of play and replayability more than they do playability, however.If the poor description of the game that I've given sounds like a genre that you enjoy, you'll definitely have some fun playing.  For how long I think largerly depends on how much you like exploring the mechanics of the game while you learn to play.  Experimenting with various base layouts for efficiency reasons or asthetics also adds some time and depth.Whatever the reason for DF ceasing development, it seems pretty clear that what has been delivered is a *platform* for a game.  But, of course, they were supposed to deliver a game.  Fortunately, the platform seems to be robust and moddable and even as-is provides a good amount of fun.Judging by DF's last announcement, I doubt we'll be seeing anything more from them.  I choose to be optimistic about the game's future, though.  The quality of what they've open sourced appears good enough that I think the mod community will add a lot to the game in time.  I wish DF hadn't dropped it, but they did and there are far worse states they could have left it in.The game does provide some long term objectives conveniently located under the ""Goals"" tab of the main HUD.  They are more like milestones, however, such as getting X number of crew, surviving the Mega Fleet, or killing X number of raiders.Finally, price:  It's definitely not worth full price given the lack of depth.  I would pay anywhere between $5 and $10 for it and feel that I got my money's worth.If you're looking for similar games, I would certainly recommend either Startopia or Evil Genius.  Startopia doesn't let you build the base, but you fill it and manage the station.  It came out some years back so it runs great on most any machine and it's a lot of fun.  Evil Genius has you building a base in your island mountain hideout.  You get to design the whole layout, rooms and hallways, similar to base building in DF-9.  Evil Genius has a lot of depth as you take on nefarious missions or as you build booby traps into your base to catch unwitting good guys.I hope this provides a sufficiently objective view of the game.  Keep in mind that I'm still playing and making ever larger bases, so it's possible that there are some issues I've yet to encounter because my population hasn't been large enough. "

								A lot of people seem to be complaining about bugs, which, when you're buying into an Alpha I'm not sure what you expect, but it's by no means ""unplayably buggy.""  There are some pretty severe issues, but they're getting whole swaths of them corected with each pass, which is what you get in an Alpha.  As far as ""seeing all the game has to offer in an hour,"" the same can more or less be said of Minecraft, especially the earlier builds.  I've happily invested hours at a time into various stations only to have them go to hell sooner or later, and then started over again.  I guess maybe it's just a YMMV situation, but to me it's hard, it's buggy, but it's also fun and full of potential and very addictive.			"

								As a fan of Space Station 13, this game piqued my interest.  Although it is a singleplayer game and lacks a lot of content in comparison to SS13, it is a good start for an Early Access game.  I'm glad it isn't a pixel or block based game like most of the Early Access junk.This game is also compared to Dwarf Fortress, which I absolutely love.  I wouldn't compare it to DF except for the fact that it is singleplayer compared to SS13.I would love to see Spacebase DF-9 be as fully featured as Space Station 13.  If I could turn SS13 into a singleplayer game I would enjoy many hours of crazy spacestation activities and mayhem.Current state of the game is minimal.  It is in a beginning stage of content/development from what I can see.  There's a lot of room for improvement.  I'm sure it will get there if the developers stick with it.  But that's always a risk you run with Early Access.  The developers don't actually have to finish the game.All that said, it was fun to try it out.			"

								I've played this game only a couple hours and so far I really enjoy it.  You can create rooms for your guys to sleep in, tell them to mine asteroids so you can make your place bigger, put in a pub.  Just don't forget to put in enough oxygen recyclers, otherwise, you'll have a lot of dead guys just floating around.  The only issue I found so far, is that when I started out one of my guys was stuck in an asteroid.  He wouldn't move or anything, just sat there in space and suffocated.  After I got situated, I was able to mine his body out of the asteroid.  The good doctor was then able to turn his body into materials for me to continue my construction.			"

								Spacebase DF-9 is a space colony building game by Double Fine. One moment you will go from peace across your colony with 20 citizens and then a meteor strike hits and kills 19 of your people leaving a lone survivor who is left to wallow in sadness. In this comedy with a twist starring Adam Sandler you play as Adam Sandler. The lone surviving drunkard who must rebuild his space colony 350,000 years in the future he is then attacked by giant space slugs as he uses his classic comedic timing in mutiple jokes about them. This game brings you back to the golden days of Adam Sandler when he only played a single character in the movie, rather then 2, this twist makes you remember the time where Adam Sandler had made a good movie in 10 years. Everything goes alright until Adam Sandler finally is asphyxiated by his lack of oxygen in his space suit thus ending his comedic golden age. This game is likely the movie of the century. 5 stars.

												I actually enjoyed this game, I got it free when buying Hacknslash so the price was right. I think most of the negativity from this game involves the lack of delivery on promises made by the developer. I started playing with 0 expectations and after a couple of failed bases built up a huge successful base and pretty much saw everything there was to see in one day. I got 10 hours out of it and while I didnt get all the achievements and there isn't a ""win"" condition I'm done with it. I CERTAINLY wouldn't pay $20 for this but <$5 is ok. If you like base building and character management games like gnomoria this can keep you entertained for a few hours.Gnomoria is much better than this though, it has far more content and is still being added to.

Low, Semi-Low and so forth all seem to spawn things at roughly the same rate reguardless.Early Raiders are a little tuff and can take over your entire base.It can be unpredictable - just when I thought all was going well a seres of events meant the lost of my base!Overall it is fun, and it makes you think when it comes to how you place and build your base.

Accidently commanding your crew to dismantle a machine, but instead telling them to vaporize the floor beneath it too, and having your crew get sucked out into space is hilarious. I can see how It may get boring after ""winning"" and being able to withstand raiders and meteor showers, but it'll take a good while before that happens. Even then, you just restart and do it again.Also, my bartender, Tim Schafer died of suffocation, after I accidently destroyed a wall seperating the bar and the life support systems, and the builder crews started dismantaling oxygen recyclers.

								Despite what the nay-sayers say...Yes, the game is Alpha. Yes, it's full of bugs, some of them fairly major. What it also has is a good bit of fun. It's not an action adventure, it's not a shoot-em-up... it's a Sim. If you play other sims, you'll probably like what this game is turning into. It has a good ways to go, no question, but with the regular updates the author has been doing (every month and a half or so) plus his response in fixing the major bugs themselves, the game is obviously being supported and actively developed.In short - if you can sit and watch an ant-farm (yes, I can... dunno why, but I can) like any other sim game, you'll be OK with this. Heck, my pre-teen kids sit and watch me play this... even ASK me to play it. Give it some time to get where the author intends it to go, and you'll see some magic, I think.			"

It shows how you can assing characters to specific jobs and accumulate ressources, manage characters mood, set up different rooms that serve different functions and so on.  There is only so much you can do for now and once you've set up a good base, you can pretty much wait it out forever so there's no real interest.But the alpha game does an excellent job at demonstrating how rock solid the core elements are. Everything is intuitive, characters do what they're told, unexpected roguelike events come to break the monotony and the game already has a certain charm to it. Given how the basic elements are so well done and so stable, it's easy to see the potential of the game, they can add layers upon layers of features in futur updates and their roadmap is in fact already impressive. I can see that game becomming very complex in the future and each base you build could be very different from one another. Here's an interesting idea, at some point, why not give each base you build some kind of purpose or mission to accomplish and give members of the crew some kind of personnality system od background stories and random events. That way players could make their own little stories with character having romance or hatred or jealousy or mutiny or aliance and friendship and brotherhood and so on.			"

I really love this game and it's still only an alpha. wether fighting off raiders and derelict ships,  building awesome space base to keep the crew happy or just seeing who hates who this game is keeping me very entertained!

												Ive spent most of the day playing this game, and I've found it very fun, I've noticed a lot of people complaining about undelievered promises, but I dont know what any of those promises were, so I dont care. I've also noticed people complaining about instability and crashes, and bugs. but I havent experienced any of those. One thing I do have to say, is its really annoying when a cloaked battle cruiser slams into your station, because it totally screws up your layout and removing it is a ♥♥♥♥♥.One thing you need to know about this game, is that you can't win, and its not about winning, its a sandbox game and most of the fun comes from the crazy stories about dying you'll be able to tell.

								Good game to pass the time.  Never thought I would be into a spacebase simulator but its actually good and very complext to other games similar like Sim City.  If your one of those people who want to try a game like this I would not suggest to try this in its Alpha form.  I would wait till its released and see if they come with a tutorial.  This game is not to complicated but I can see how it could be frusterating to anyone new to this type of game.			"

								Spacebase DF-9 is a ""Space Station Simulator"" from the people at Double Fine. The game starts out on a map screen letting you pick the best spot for your Seed Pod and every pixel has a different variable ranging from, Stellar Density, Warpgate Proximity, Threat Factor and Magnetic Interferance and all change how you game will play out. Once you have your Seed placed you will go into the space base part where you will have 3 crew and 2000 matter (Currency) to start out with, but be warned as your crew only have a limited ammount of time until there oxygen runs out so you have to be quick building a simple foundation and a good amount of oxygen genorators. Now getting more crew is as simple as waiting for a ship to come by but be warned as it could be pirates who will latch onto your ship and try to kill your crew one by one unless you have a good defence, but it could be just people wanting to be crew of your station. Mining is also a main thing that you have to be checking as if you don't mine you will slowly runout of matter and have no more.Your crew has needs such as; sleep, food and morale if any of these get low it can cause them to do their job slower, sleep longer of worse die so you do have to farm and have food replicaotrs to counter act this. Apart from the pirates being a thret  meteors can also hit the station and kill your crew so you have to be on the ball if you have a large station and have emergancy alert systems in place to get your crew out of danger.Now This game does look good but on slower machines can be slow so always check for the latest drivers and be sure that you can run this before buying, as for anything.I am going to give this game a 6.5/10 as in this is still in alpha and is nowhere finished yet, but has a good amount of features.

												dispite everytning ive read about the game and it being ditched and blah blah blah, i actually really enjoyed this game my first attempt at wasnt...the greatest but..well...went a little something like this.was building my base, things were going great, had a lot of people, plenty of jobs and work, got attacked by 2 raider ships one blew a hole in my wall, sucked out a couple people, the other breached and begun an assault, they killed a couple people before being killed, so I had to switch the survivors job roles to fit the needs, a technician a doctor and a builder, 2 techs 2 builders 1 doc, 1 of the techs got stuck outside the airlock, because 2 of the people went in as he tried to get back in so it liked, glitched, and locked them in, and him out, well during that time the life support went on the fritz, oxygen slowly was depleted, everyone but the tech outside the station died of asphyxiation, he got back in after they were all dead and it stopped being glitched, he fixed life support and I went about repairing damages, got one new resident made him a builder had him working on some stuff, the tech (panya) slowly went insane and he eventually popped, and started beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out fo doors, my new resident (jeff) went to calm him down panya said no, they fought knocked each other out, jeff woke up first, killed panya, went to the medical bay to heal, in stasis basically, more raiders attacked, they found my reactor room my turrents in the reactor room decided shoot THROUGH the walls at the raiders blew up the walls lit the hallway on fire, fire skipped some rooms and lit the life support on fire I booted jeff out of the med bays and turned them off so he didn't just lay back in them he ran around trying to put the fire out did so went ot repair life support died of asphyxiation before needed amout of oxygen was in the roomand so my last resident diedTL;DR everyone dies at the end.

Also one major flaw that annoys me too much, is that SHIPS DOCK TOO OFTEN. i would rather have it as a really rare opportunity, or not happen at all because in games like this, the whole point is to expand your ship yourself, not have it be expanded upon by random occurances.

												This game gets an 8/10 from me. It's a really relaxing game when taken for what it is. I am reviewing it as version 1.06 Mac OSX no mods installed. I had a free version for months before finding it on steam for 99¢ and just had to buy it to encourage the developers just a little bit with my tiny contribution. I would easily pay $5 bucks for it.You're basically thrown into space, given 3 guys and very little resources to start building your space base. In the beginning you need to start as small as possible, building just the bare necessities. Once you have a small (3x3) airlock room, another room just large enough to hold 3 oxygen recyclers, and a room just large enough for a matter refinery, the rest is a piece of cake.The game is 90% relaxing, mining and building, welcoming new (weird & silly) inhabitants, and pretty much trying to keep everyone fed, breathing, and happy - or as happy as one can be in a fragile domicile in space. You need to begin early considering how to protect your base from bad guys that pop in periodically, and asteroid impact damages.Aside from the few (easy) dangers, it's just a relaxing sandbox style building game where you can be creative in making a space base to be proud of. The interface is pretty much well organized, which is an aspect that many games like this get wrong. I enjoy the weird types of characters/aliens and their thoughts and interactions.Many people complain about the AI being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but you have to pay attention to what each character is good or bad at and by what degree they would suck at a job. You have to assign them to duties they are good at and actually enjoy doing. Some are good at a job, but hate doing it, so yeah, they'll stand around playing games on their pads instead of doing any work, unless you assign them to a duty they enjoy. I find this aspect completely adorable, as it really adds to the immersion and how you feel or care for each individual. I also love the names - imagining how an alien would pronounce his name written as ""Uneekly (nicely)"" - that sorta thing.It's currently (for the past several months) been my favorite game for when I just want to relax and make a creative little space base. The few, easy dangers add just enough of that random aspect to keep you on your toes and influence the shape and direction your base takes. Have lots of good tech guys and your base will run smoothly - put lotsa gun turrets all around the outside walls and you'll be safe enough to survive a large attack that eventually happens. And just have fun building and watching how your inhabitants get along.My only complaint is - once you get a VERY LARGE base, things go bad fast. Machines start failing, catching on fire, destroying themselves everywhere, no matter how many techs you have to fix them. But I guess this is just a sign that I've gone way too far with this base and should just start a new one, haha.Lotsa people be hatin' on it, but it's been one of my favorite, relaxing games that I keep going back to.

He did so, and although it didn't addrerss every issue I had with the way things were handled, it did address a lot of them and was an apology I felt was sincere. The harshness of my previous review was due to anger seeing an early access game come to a sudden halt (Tim Schafer does address the lack of communication and the lessons learned from this experience. He specifically apologizes for the communication issue which was my main problem. Had there been communication about the state of things before hand, I would not have been upset. I would have been sad, but not angry. So I appreciate the fact that Double Fine realized their mistakes and apologized for them.) -- it was not, and I feel bad for not making this clear in my past review, but anger clouded my communication skills... -- it was not a negative review targeting the quality of the game.In fact, I really enjoy Spacebase, which is why I became angry. It's a game that from the beginning of early access, was getting things right. Yeah, there was rough patches, but the core of the game and vision was there and I was excited. And whether or not the finished game met all the ""features we want in the game"" dev list or not was not an issue for me. And my anger was not really aimed at the devs of Spacebase, really. I was angry at Tim Schafer. I'm stating this due to the amount of anger that has been directed at the developers. I think they've done a great job developing the game. Communication was not there. But that was an issue with Double Fine as a whole, not just this one development team. So, going from a thumbs down to a thumbs up becaue of an apology might seem odd to some people. And that's my fault for not being clear as to why it was getting at thumbs down. It's a good game. As it stands. And I'm sure it will be better when they release the last update. Am I sad that they weren't able to achieve what they wanted to? Yeah. But is the game bad because they weren't able to work on the game actively for a few more years? No. It's a good game.I'll be curious to see what happens when the community has the ability to create mods and etc and curious to see how if Double Fine keeps an eye on things and maybe works out a way to be there in the form of a helpful guide to the community down the road.Developers of Spacebase, you made a great game and I'm sorry you were unable to work on it as long as you wanted to.

I look forward to taking the chance that a derilict station that has just shown up will in fact contain raiders, and having my builders knock out a wall section to make them all suffocate first. Of course I also did that to a station containing friendlies and felt a little guilty :)			"

								Toon soon to really recommend it or not. It is still missing a lot of rythm and items, rooms, objectives etc. so far. But it is already fine to play it and it is not  buggy  for an early beta. However, the psychologie of the population, how they are  affected by a job or what is really missing them or not is still unclear and should be worked a lot more. A lot of content, like medics, mission variety are missing. At this early stage of developement i must say that even 90' management and building games were more complexe and innovative. However i remain confident, i like this game.It could become something good and it has slowly but  positilvely progress so far ! "

								Less 'Dwarf Fortress in space' and more 'The Sims meets Dungeon Keeper in space'. Not that that's a bad thing... just don't get your hopes up about interactive complexity or emergent gameplay... they're not to be found here. In fact, the only point of the game at present seems to be to keep your base operating---this might be seen as somewhat lacking in comparison with any of the above precedents--SBDF9 dosn't have the world building of DF, the customizability of The Sims, or the naughtiness and design of DK. However, it does look to aspire to all three, eventually.As of v5, it's still buggy as hell, so I would wait a while before purchasing. Get your fix from Timber and Stone or Prison Architect for the being (or check out RimWorld, which I haven't done yet).			"

Compared to other games of the colony planning genre, the complexity of game content is fairly low, but the visuals are far more detailed and approachable; What I mean is, where in other games you may be struggling to remember what that static @ on the map represents, or which one of your little colored peg people was a particular character, in Spacebases you can tell at a glance what job an individual crew member is assigned to, what they're doing, and even how they're feeling, with an exaggerated moping walk when they're upset or a bounce in their step and head held high when they're happy.The space setting gives way to elements you won't find in most other colony planning games, such as oxygen management, exploring potentially dangerous derelict vessels, asteroid storms and chest-bursting parasite monsters, but common themes remain such as the importance of high morale and dealing with tantrum-throwing or fighting crew if that morale drops,  dealing with disease outbreaks and fighting off (or capturing and reforming) invading forces.Despite the amount or complexity of content not being that deep, I've still found fourty-plus hours so far of thorough enjoyment through catastrophic failures and the desire to ""build it better the next time"", and much like in a Roguelike, I manage to do better, and make a spacebase survive longer, than each previous attempt.Decide for yourself what price you're willing to pay for a simplistic colony planner, but if you're a fan of them and love anything space-related, I think you'll enjoy this game.

								Before I've bought this game I've read the reviews and they were horrible, but still decided to give it a chance because its idea seemed really cool. I'm really glad I didn't give in to the negative hype. Game has it's bugs as any EA but at the moment (Alpha 6c) none of them make it unplayable. Building and running your own space station is tons of fun the way theese guys did it. Lots of ways to let your creative side run free and strategizing for those who like some action. It's always exciting to send a security detail to scout out a derelict ship, or prepare for boarding by pirates. Really like the idea of inhabitants personalities where they make friends and enemies amongs each other and situations it creates. I definately reccomend this tittle, don't believe all the bad things you hear, sometimes it's good to try stuff out on your own.			"

												A fun game & great concept.Though the downside is that they pulled out of alpha development way too early.It seems like they're making more progress now the game is released, rather than when they were developing it.I recommend it to those who love to sandbox and mess around with building/ simulation games.But I'd recommend waiting until some more development/content from a thrid party (modders most likely) is released.

								Cooley Station was unfortunately designed to have a disastrously small selection of toilet facilities. The station’s industrial architect, Adolf Riker (a given name only recently returning to a brief but immense popularity after an extremely long hiatus) had studied under the Europan architectural school famous for its brief merger with the Plutonic school of Folk-Industrial psychology. At the time, a study of the Plutonic school had shown that workplace efficiency increased seven-fold where employees were unable to utilise the bathroom facilities and had to spend long periods yearning to pass fluids. Unfortunately it was only later discovered that the study had taken its entire sample from a pool of specially bred accountants genetically engineered to only excrete small unscented pellets every five to six years. The disposition of toilets on Cooley Station was one of the more famous and catastrophic results of the merger of the two schools, the other major notable example being the Plutonic embassy in Basra, which was constructed entirely out of fresh spring water and shaped into an immense♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Though a number of reviewers quite zealously insist that this game is more like Dwarf Fortress than Prison Architect, I have never played Dwarf Fortress and would say that it is quite similar to Prison Architect from what I know.  The game is in early Alpha right now, so there is a limited depth of play, but it shows enormous potential.  For those that enjoy it there are a number of advantages to owning a game in Alpha, a large part of which is getting to see it grow and develop, along with being able to give feedback before everything is finalized. In essence the game is a space station sim.  You make a station, try to keep your people alive an happy, screen potential immigrants, explore derelicts, and get attacked by raiders.  Of course that’s a gross oversimplification, and trust me it’s much funnier and ridiculous as you play.  If you’re interested at all, you’ll probably like it.  At this stage it’ll likely leave you hungering for more once you stop accidentally suffocating your crew members or getting them killed by raiders.  But if you can be patient it’s very much worth your time.    "

								Not much to do yet. After a while you got little to do. Less to explore than Gnomoria or Towns. It would be fun if you could move the base around to a different part of the sector or dock to a moon or a planet. The little guys have a lot of data attached to them, but seems redudant and its hard to make them happy. Hard to monitor food, and what you need to produce more. There is a counter for minerals and oxygen but food is not as clear. Right now all engagements are options. You have to choices, if you want to fight or not, and you can select either. Characters are not memorable and also many wait too long to go back to the airlock and die. I wish I could send them back to the base earlier. They shouldn't die in routine jobs because they went to the airlock too late too often.			"

												Was very surprised and delighted by this game. I will watch these guys to see if they come out with a new version. Wish the IA was a little smarter and there was different space related things to do besides mine. It would also be nice to have more of a travel hub like option; I could run a small airport or turn it into a travel hub. The show the name play is based on was a travel hub. I will be putting in a few more hours for sure. "

And now you've arrived... with eight minutes of oxygen, you hurry to get life support on, when you finish building a basic airlock a passing ship hails you, requesting to come aboard. You send someone on to there ship and you meet someone running past you, then two killbots attack your station, you flee the station and spend your last moments floating in space, watching your oxygen level steadily deplete.......you die.Buy it			"

								Really fun and simple game! If you've played games where you try to build up a base and make it as good and powerful as you can then you'll fit right in. The games still has a bunch of bugs that need to fixed and some things should be added to prevent some dumb situations. First off you should be able to assign crew to stay in certain ships so that repair crew don't go and fix stuff at empty ships because to be honest t's probably better you just scrap the ship unless it's really cloes to your base and you can make a pathway.  Second there's a bunch of issues with the bar, people always go there when no one is working and just sit there instead of doing there jobs which causes tones of issues. Also everyone wants to go to the bar and this completely emtyss the oxeygon out of the room. This one time I lost half my crew due to these issues. Besids that  great game and I can't wait to see what you guys add next.			"

								Developers at Double Fine are consistently updating the game because it IS an Early Access/Beta. I am glad I got SpaceBase DF-9 on sale for about ten bucks, but it is definitely not worth twenty. I suggest waiting for it to go on sale if you want to try it out.In SpaceBase DF-9, there's no micro-managing. The A.I. take on a life of their own once you give them a task so it can get rather frustrating. And most of them are very, very moody, which affect their work ethic severely (ugh). They're fairly stupid at their current stage of development, so you can expect to lose a base very quickly - regardless of whether you're playing the game correctly or not. And if your base doesn't fall apart right away, it will eventually. It takes quite a while to understand how each A.I. functions (due to their personalities) and how to work around them. Even with all that said, it's a very fun game. I have fun, anyway. It helps that I enjoy simulator games. It's space sims! Sorta. "

								Great game with much potential.. Sure I struggled a bit at first, lost many crews, but all in all they've done a nice job.. I do have a couple of gripes that I'll post here, but I'm sure it's already on their to-do list of stuff to fix:My biggest complaint is the fact that it looks like I’m commander of some of the stupidest aliens in the entire galaxy.  I had a derelict ship enter my sector, so I sent some guards to check it out. Well as soon as they did, they decided to take brief naps afterwards.  It wasn’t so bad trying to get them to leave, but when the oxygen generators failed, they started running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  My genius repair technicians decided to head over there and fix the problem, but their first step was take off their life giving suits and join the orgy of morons by running around with them.  Why they didn’t just keep their suit on, fix the unit and then take off those stinky suits is beyond me.  My only option was to destroy the ship with all the morons on board.All in all the game is addicting, even with all its flaws.. Here’s hoping they fix this craziness with some better AI or at least more logical ones.			"

It's a truthly immersive game, even for what little the developers have done, that can keep you playing for hours on end. Even when you have the occasional crash, you have no problem wiht starting a new base!Fantastic game, I cannot wait for each new update.			"

								Not much to do yet. After a while you got little to do. Less to explore than Gnomoria or Towns. It would be fun if you could move the base around to a different part of the sector or dock to a moon or a planet. The little guys have a lot of data attached to them, but seems redudant and its hard to make them happy. Hard to monitor food, and what you need to produce more. There is a counter for minerals and oxygen but food is not as clear. Right now all engagements are options. You have to choices, if you want to fight or not, and you can select either. Characters are not memorable and also many wait too long to go back to the airlock and die. I wish I could send them back to the base earlier. They shouldn't die in routine jobs because they went to the airlock too late too often.			"

								Developers at Double Fine are consistently updating the game because it IS an Early Access/Beta. I am glad I got SpaceBase DF-9 on sale for about ten bucks, but it is definitely not worth twenty. I suggest waiting for it to go on sale if you want to try it out.In SpaceBase DF-9, there's no micro-managing. The A.I. take on a life of their own once you give them a task so it can get rather frustrating. And most of them are very, very moody, which affect their work ethic severely (ugh). They're fairly stupid at their current stage of development, so you can expect to lose a base very quickly - regardless of whether you're playing the game correctly or not. And if your base doesn't fall apart right away, it will eventually. It takes quite a while to understand how each A.I. functions (due to their personalities) and how to work around them. Even with all that said, it's a very fun game. I have fun, anyway. It helps that I enjoy simulator games. It's space sims! Sorta. "

												Was very surprised and delighted by this game. I will watch these guys to see if they come out with a new version. Wish the IA was a little smarter and there was different space related things to do besides mine. It would also be nice to have more of a travel hub like option; I could run a small airport or turn it into a travel hub. The show the name play is based on was a travel hub. I will be putting in a few more hours for sure. "

								Great game with much potential.. Sure I struggled a bit at first, lost many crews, but all in all they've done a nice job.. I do have a couple of gripes that I'll post here, but I'm sure it's already on their to-do list of stuff to fix:My biggest complaint is the fact that it looks like I’m commander of some of the stupidest aliens in the entire galaxy.  I had a derelict ship enter my sector, so I sent some guards to check it out. Well as soon as they did, they decided to take brief naps afterwards.  It wasn’t so bad trying to get them to leave, but when the oxygen generators failed, they started running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  My genius repair technicians decided to head over there and fix the problem, but their first step was take off their life giving suits and join the orgy of morons by running around with them.  Why they didn’t just keep their suit on, fix the unit and then take off those stinky suits is beyond me.  My only option was to destroy the ship with all the morons on board.All in all the game is addicting, even with all its flaws.. Here’s hoping they fix this craziness with some better AI or at least more logical ones.			"

								Really fun and simple game! If you've played games where you try to build up a base and make it as good and powerful as you can then you'll fit right in. The games still has a bunch of bugs that need to fixed and some things should be added to prevent some dumb situations. First off you should be able to assign crew to stay in certain ships so that repair crew don't go and fix stuff at empty ships because to be honest t's probably better you just scrap the ship unless it's really cloes to your base and you can make a pathway.  Second there's a bunch of issues with the bar, people always go there when no one is working and just sit there instead of doing there jobs which causes tones of issues. Also everyone wants to go to the bar and this completely emtyss the oxeygon out of the room. This one time I lost half my crew due to these issues. Besids that  great game and I can't wait to see what you guys add next.			"

								[EDIT] I wrote this review when I assumed (hoped!) funding would continue and the game would reach its promising potential. With version 1.0 on the way and a general air of abandonment from DF, I'm less keen to recommend this. I still load it up now and again and lament the missed opportunity...================I'm offering up a cautious recommendation here. This game is very promising, while still being far from a complete experience in its current state (Alpha 5d). I bought it on the strength of it being made by Double Fine, who I think have a habit of putting out some really fun games. The recommendation is partially based on their reputation.As other reviewers have mentioned, the UI is great and the overall aesthetic brings to mind 70s/ 80s SF such as Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or Dark Star. Having said that, the devs should really set about implementing some goal-based gameplay soon enough. It seems an odd move to put it out in its current state since there's not the level of freedom for it to act simply as a light space survival sim. There isn't really enough depth at the moment for the player to come up with their own objectives beyond not dying for long enough to build a space-pub. In its current state it looks like you can try out all the space- decor and experience the space- mining and space- pirates in a fairly short stretch of time. Basically, I love the content so far and I'd like there to be more. I really hope there is continued support and funding on this project. There have been a few negative reviews on Steam but most people acknowledge the potential here. I look forward to seeing the updates and in the meantime, I can set about building my Silent Running style interstellar greenhouse.			"

								Update:This is definitely a promising alpha, and many of the issues I'd mentioned in the previous version of my review have been fixed or improved.- The technician AI is very much improved.- I haven't run into issues with bartenders holding up people at the bar, except when I didn't have enough bartenders assigned, which seems reasonable- Intruder defense seems more manageable now, though the actual mechanics don't seem to have changed.- Haven't seen any more accidental depressurizations in a whileThe only part that is still somewhat frustrating is the builder sequencing. While building walls and floors still seems to be prioritized above everything else, tear down or vaporizing unused areas is still prioritized above building other objects. I'd love to see a queue that I can prioritize, but failing that, at least making tear down/vaporizing last in the priority list would be an improvement. Even better than that would be only deprioritizing those tasks if they're part of unclaimed structures.Some other issues I've noticed:- Occasionally people will get stuck in airlocks and eventually suffocate- There are sometimes odd placement issues with room objects randomly getting removed from the building queue, or sometimes not being able to place an object in a place that you should. I've had this happen with research consoles, beds, and rugs--------------------------------------Original Review--------------------------------------This looks promising, but in its current state, is not very fun to play. Most of the issues center around not-very-effective AI:- In order to keep your base functioning, you need technicians to keep all the systems in repair. However, the technician AI is TERRIBLE, and there's no way to force a technician to repair a specific machine. The only way I've been able to play is to keep my base relatively small. Once a hostile docks with my station and as a result, adds more machines, it's an unrecoverable downhill slide to all machines eventually breaking down, no matter how many technicians I add. I've also seen my technicians attempting to repair broken machinery in areas I'm deconstructing, which is a huge waste of time.- Your citizens need to eat. They also need to sleep. If they go to the bar to eat or drink, and the bartender isn't on duty, they'll wait until he is. Even if the bartender is, himself, waiting to eat or drink. The bartenders will not serve themselves, nor is there any sort of timer that allows them to give up and move on to do something else. There's also no way to force a bartender to go on duty. When your citizens get stuck waiting on food, it makes it very easy to start a downward spiral (especially for technicians) since they obviously aren't doing their jobs if they're waiting for food.- Defending against intruders is incredibly unreliable. From what I can tell, you're supposed to assign citizens to security duty, and use a beacon to make them congregate in a specific area, either to explore or defend against intruders. In practice, they seem to take an ""I'll get to it when I'll get to it"" attitude, even when their comrades are getting gunned down around them.- Sequencing building instructions is irritating - things seem to happen only in the order you enter them in - once you put in a request, there's no way to prioritize it against other requests, except to erase it and do it again, effectively putting it at the end of the queue. The exception seems to be building walls - those seem to get built before anything else.- Citizens coming in and out of airlocks will occasionally kill their comrades by an ill-timed depressurizationGiven this is an alpha, I'm guessing/hoping these issues will be smoothed out, but as it stands, it is more frustrating to play than enjoyable.

								this Game is fun and well worth playing however at it final state i feel that you should wait for a deal that knocks this game to $10 as they are skiping beta and have discontinued work on it the game. it Looked like it was going place but was the crew panicking at a mere lost of o2 with no hope of fixing the o2 system or power or building new ones or the game emergency o2 mask i feel the game will be lacking alot, as such i feel it is still fun to play so long as you don't waste $20 on a game that was cut short in it prime. It took them some time to make it fun to play as some bugs were heavy at the start and some contents were a cardboard box but that been worked out making this game enjoyable as a finished project as is it well make a very nice $10 game given time they well realize that in it current final state pay not mind to the crying nay sayer they are just mad as me and won't turn the other needless to say i took it out on the DEV'S! and not this good game they made grrr i wish i could call it great.

												So far I've played the game for 44 hours in total. I enjoyed every minute. Now alot of people (and I mean ALOT of people) hated this game and still do. Lack of strategy, no proper ending, horrible AI and mountains of bugs. Some people say Double Fine grabbed the money and ran and that this is discontinued, but Ive been getting game-changing updates at a normal pace. Im not sure if the content isn't being delivered to them or if they are just hating, but this game seems to me as not discontinued.SpaceBaseDF9 is a relaxing, term long-term game what do I mean by long-term? All your actions are to prevent things in the future that may harm you. The game is slow, but not steady as it shows alot of difficulty. Sometimes it is just luck of the dice. If you aren't a fan of linear games and like management games then I think you should buy it.This is my opinion you probably won't agree with it, but still If your interested in a game watch gameplay of it and you will know if you want it.

												Though this game had its development cut short, which was admittedly disappointing, its is still a solid game and one of the better city sims I have played in a while. So please, before judging solely on the fact that development was cut short, hear me out. If you wanna skip the points i will have a final verdict at the endPros1. No preset rooms, you build how you want2. Dialogue is rather humorous and reading people's thoughts normally gives me a good laugh.3. The resource management is just right, not too complex, but not too easy either.4. Since there are no templates you can really make your base yours. If you want the center of your base to be a nice dorm room thats totally doable. If you want to make it a huge club, all up to you!5. The game keeps you on your toes and often provides great stories such as when one of my engineers went crazy and caught an oxygen recycler on fire and had to be taken down by security!6. People interact and all have different opinions of each other. They may become best friends or end up knocking each other out!7. Passing ships will signal you, you may recruit a bunch of aliens waking from their cryo chambers or tell raiders you're gonna kick their butts!Cons1. Raiders get a bit overpowered in later stages of the game2. Morale is hard to regain after it drops and often leads to the end of your base3. dialogue, while funny is quite limited. You will definitely see the same phrases more than once.4. This game had insane potential, unfortunately many concept ideas that would have been great will now never be includedFinal verdict: While it isnt a perfect game, spacebase possesses a lot of charm and an amazing amount of freedom. If you are a fan of sim games and think this may interest you, at least grab it on sale. Its a great sim game that has many disappointed fans who look at it for what it could have been rather than what it is			"

								This game has some real promist. In its current state I found that I had ""completed"" it.   Suggestions for the devs:1.  Update the roster to make it smaller in UI space.  Add features like health, needs and other important info2. There seems to be no real objective except have a larger base.. Once you build the rooms that are availabe you are done.  Add goals:  Build a docking station to get an economy going, Build warp gates/black holes for travel and trade. Add a goal to colonize a nearby planet. 3. Research is painfully slow and cumbersome.  Add options to speed it up by spending Matter or sience points. 4. Random Debris fields are not really a challenge.  Add a couple of fire extenguishers and you can over come them.  5. Infirmary is useless.  Needs a serious look to make it a worth while room6. add action menus to the right click of a resident.  example:  Right Click > take corpse to refinery/dispose etc. I am anxious to see what this game can become. You are on the right track!			"

								Do you like resource management type games? Do you like simulation type games? Do you like science fiction? If you answered yes to two of the previous questions you should check out Spacebase DF-9. Even though this is an Early Access Game there is still enough playability and fun in it to occupy hours of your life. Basically you build a space station or as the name suggests a Spacebase. You do this by laying out rooms and zoning them for specific tasks. At first you'll need an airlock and a life support system so that your virtual Spacebase residents can breath. As you play, you'll discover that you need to expand, and that takes resources. You'll need to build more rooms and different types of zones to make your Spacebase function. Things like refineries, sleeping quarters and pubs. Yes, they have pubs in space.To add to the gameplay each of your Spacebase residents has his or her special skill set. You need to assign them tasks based on their individual skills or train them in new ones, if you wish. As they get better at their tasks the station starts to hum along nicely. As you progress, you'll discover that the natives get restless and you'll need to attend to their complaints and unhappiness by building new rooms or maybe mixing up their work routine. All that is enough to keep you busy, but there is more. Every now and again a spaceship will pass by. They can be friendly folk and join your Spacebase or they can be your worst day in space. Sometimes you can weasel your way out of sticky situations but eventually something is going to rain on your Spacebase. You'll need to prepare for that eventuality and defend your Spacebase if you want to hold onto it. This is an Early Access Game and it’s in Alpha 4b as of this writing. Even so, there is plenty of fun to be had with this game. Double Fine Productions, the developer, is actively releasing updates. They are shooting for updates on a monthly basis and that’s good. Now I don’t want to mislead you. I’m having a ton of fun with this game, but it is and Early Access Game and it’s still in Alpha. That means it’s not for everyone. The game isn’t finished. It’s not even close to finished. It’s Alpha. Don’t buy this game expecting a polished game. Even if you have Beta tested before, keep in mind that this is pre-beta. That said, this game promises to be something extremely fun to play. If you want to be in on the ground floor and watch, as well as give feedback, as the game develops then you should definitely pick up a copy of Spacebase DF-9. It’s okay, the waters warm, jump in. You will have fun.			"

								Explore the perils of space. My first crew died because I didn't install the airlock correctly and they ran out of oxygen. My second crew died after a ship flew in and dropped off a parasite-infested crew member, who later died and spawned a parasite that rampaged through my base. My third crew died when I got boarded by a hostile ship. My fourth crew died when they got stuck in a wall and ran out of oxygen (but hey, it's early access).This game is like the FTL of space base building. It'd hard. But it's got amusing touches like the crew's personal logs, and the delicate balance of ""should I explore and risk an alien attack?"" Still early and a bit shallow, but has potential.			"

								This is an excellent start to what the developers hope to eventually achieve with the game. At the moment you can build your base (including multiple rooms), take on new residents (meaning you'll soon need to expand your base to cope with the extra people), fight off hostile enemies, claim ""derelict"" bases nearby as an expansion of your main base, and assign each resident to a job, which they progressively get better at.Eventually, you'll have a well-run base that is looked after by a team of highly trained staff, but to get to that point, you might have to survive a couple of scares near the beginning of the game (a meteor strike which leaves your base on fire when your technicians aren't well-trained to deal with it, or raiders when your security forces aren't trained up, etc).In the future, the devs want to add depth to the game with a research system, job zoning, and so on. Once those are implemented, the game will really be something. I think there's enough for more than a few hours of enjoyment here already. Definitely recommended.			"

												This game is the Chaos Theory evolved. Whatever can go wrong does go wrong. But it's not that expected mishap that you can see coming. No it's that 'This is kinda dumb' series of events. So the threat factor set to low causes my base of 6 people to get raided 5 times. Okay then... And debris hits only the life support, 4 times, during these raid attacks. Oooohkay. My citizens keep complaining about 'stuff' when there are well over ten shelves placed in living quarters which for some reason they decide to not stay in regardless if I put them SPECIFICALLY to a room. This game needs re-tooling. Stopped playing when I got 20 citizens then one just randomly started punching people, while a raider that was left incapacitated in my base got up and joined in on the fun.In short, 10/10 only for the execute button as I placed 5 people on security and started dropping people before opening the airlock to suck those 5 out into space. Only to have a ship pass by and tell me my base was cool as it was in ruin....Also I didn't laugh once at this game. Was I supposed to laugh at all the wacky♥♥♥♥♥♥because I didn't.			"

								An addicting space station creation-simulation reminscent of Dwarf Fortress, Spacebase throws you alone into the cold, deep darkness of space with nothing but 8 minutes of oxygen and a recommendation to quickly build a life support zone. The rest is up to you, as you are left to quickly build a functioning space station and hopefully turn your tiny crew of three space colonists into a fully functioning space outpost.If you're a fan of Gnomoria, Banished, or Towns, then definitely pick this one up. I'm very excited to see what future updates offer, and I hope they come soon!			"

												It is a game with amazing potential, it's really fun when you see past the wealth of bugs and the other mechanics issues, most notably the character AI, who will eat a snack while being shot at, or build instead of fighting raiders. Raiders who appear far to frequently, every 5 minutes it feels as if a raider comes to ruin everything you have just made and due to the derpy ai, you can do little to stop them.Past all of this it is a really fun building game in space, I would recommend to anyone who likes building and can deal with bugs and setbacks at every corner.

								Absolutely fantastic fun to play. The only frustrations come not from gameplay, but the little glitches etc. that are to be expected at an alpha stage of development. Two concerns right now are that your citizens can be doomed to eternally eating at the pub, never to leave until you quit and reload the game. I have had excess food and yet had many crew members die of starvation. It's frustrating to see someone starving and scream ""THE FRIDGE IS RIGHT THERE, JAMES."" and then have James say ""no, there are people eating in the bar right now, I'll wait my turn"". Meanwhile, in the timelocked existence that is the bar, 9 citizens stand at tables, frozen, looking ahead as if they've seen something I haven't. The food is long gone, but they're still eating. Forever eating. Basically, the timer freezes and stops going down.Also, when mining matter, crew members have an unexplicable urge to return from whence they came. When you have to venture away from your base in order to continue mining operations elsewhere, you think to yourself 'I'll just place another airlock and refinery here. That'll be convenient.' Nope. Instead, miners will ignore that airlock, deciding instead to head for the MOST DISTANT AIRLOCK IN THE QUADRENT. I have a silent dialogue in my head with them.""Bill. I built you this airlock and refinery. I even built a long path down from the original base so you don't waste oxygen getting out here, see?""""Ahh thank you sir, I appreciate that""""Bill....you're going out of the far away airlock.""""I know.""""...why?""""♥♥♥♥ it, it was closer"""".........""""dum dee dum dee dum""""Bill?""""yes sir?""""why did you go PAST the airlock that's right next to the mining field""""I'm heading home?""""I know that Bill. I know. But you could have gone through there and just...WALKED up.""""Nah I'm good.""""BILL.""""WHAT.""""YOUR OXYGEN IS ON 30 SECONDS GO TO THE GODDAM CLOSE AIRLOCK""""Nah man, YOLO""*Bill has died from asphyxiation*""...♥♥♥♥ you, Bill.""I don't know if you're starting to notice some slight frustration I feel towards my dear citizens, but they will be patched soon and hell, I'm still playing aren't I? In all, though, such a good game, and it'll only get better.			"

I really enjoyed the 5 hours of time, and it is worth a couple of bucks if you realize its only going to be 5 hours tops of play time.

								Quite fun. Still needs a lot of work, but it's definitely looking promising. There's nothing that's truly broken, just a general lack of variety that further development will undoubtedly fill out. Even so it's difficult enough that even when you think you're strong enough to take on some of the pirates you might just be deluding yourself. Only issue is that there doesn't seem to be a significant benefit to taking on raiders yet. Would also be nice to see a progression route where YOU could send out raiding parties and take other bases' supplies and/or dock your station to another's to merge it with yours.Definitely			"

								This game is one of my all time favorite games... The game has some problems but it is still in alpha therefore there is no room to judge its complexity.. But overall i love the concept of this game and everything about it ( The Artwork, Dynamics, Style, etc)... I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy games, Minecraft, space related, or just wants a relaxed kind of game where you can sit down and build an amazing space-base.. This is probably the biggest review i had ever done on a game but i truefully love this game and everything about it and the developers are doing a fantastic job on it...			"

								This game is strangely and frustratingly addicting.It's by no means finished; at time of writing, Alpha 4b is the current release. Some major and glaring pieces of the game are missing. There are no doctors or infirmies to heal people from injuries, and bugs abound. AI pathing is a work in progress. The difficulty curve needs to be balanced more, and base immigration is hit or miss. Right now, the game is crying out for some sort of debug mode or option. It'd be nice to force events or otherwise peak under the hood right now to see what's going on. Adding some hints to improve morale would be welcome, too.Overall, the game is more than promising. It shows a proper spark of fun and creativity, with tons of good ideas and some solid concepts to build off of.			"

								I like this game. Yes it's got flaws but it's an alpha so I expect them. I would like some further options, like a 'safe world' mode where I can build without dangers. But I hope that comes in time. It's hard to start, taking me at least 5 tries to get something happening without all my men dying. But once I did the game started to take hold and I'm slowly learning how to play.Dont get this if you don't like alphas because you will be dissapointed. But do get this if you like the idea of building your own space station from scratch and don't mind a few bugs here and there.			"

												This game has the potential to be a lot of fun but it falls short from the start. I chose a high density area for mining an low density for the raiders. I get raided every 15 minute or so. All my security are ordered to go kill the rader's. But can't seem to find there way to them till half my base is destroyed. Then to no surprise the 1 raider is a grandmaster marksmen wile my guys have a board with a nail in it. I have restarted so many times now I can get the base started easy enough. But die out every 15 to 20 minute. NOT FUN.  I will give this game a thumbs up but it needs some patching and balancing between raders skills and your bases ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ skill I mean security.			"

												Update: All the negative reviews I read for this game were before the November 14 1.06 update, which fixed a lot of the bugs that these reviewers were discussing. I played the game for the first time after this update had already occurred.Raiders, space debris, nosy passenger ships, quiet derelict vessels, deadly diseases, and parasites that jump out of an empty husk which used to be one of your citizens. That's what you face when you become the Administrator of Spacebase DF-9. You will truly feel like the manager of a tiny oasis, alone in the vastness of a harsh galaxy.To get a summary of what it's like to play this game, combine the play styles of a small-scope RTS like Age of Mythology with The Sims. Not only do you have to build, maintain, and defend a space station, but you must also make sure you're tending to the needs of your citizens.Frustrations abound. Just when you have finally constructed a small, functional base, complete with power and air, your citizens will have the gall to ask for a place to sleep. Then, they'll want something to eat. Then they'll need a doctor. Then they'll want someplace to hang out with friends. Then your base needs a maintenance technician, but no one wants the job. Now they want a gym, but you're still trying to build the infirmary because two citizens died in the last Raider attack. But now there aren't enough power reactors! So you've zoned the construction to build a bigger power room, but then some Raider blew holes in your airlock in a firefight and now the whole thing is useless. But hey, at least he suffocated. Pompous jerk. Anyway, you've got to refit another room as an emergency airlock, to fix the airlock, so you can build the next reactor, to build the infirmary, and then ultimately build a gym, but darn it all, your Builder's feeling overworked so they went to bed! And NO, I do NOT want to answer your request to come aboard, random passenger ship!In many ways, I find this game to be a very realistic depiction of what it would probably be like to lead your own vessel out in space. You have to fight constantly against the threatening, invasive, hostile environment, while not letting your crew's own loneliness overcome them. Think about it. Suppose you were one of your citizens: one of a group of ten people stranded out in, truly, the middle of nowhere, with no chance of ever seeing Earth again. No wonder my overworked builder is having trouble staying motivated, and no wonder most of my crew spends their free time in the pub. We all might want to think that living in space would be cool, but Spacebase DF-9 reminds us of the human element.Yes, there are still minor graphical bugs, and sometimes your Miner will asphyxiate because they were too stupid to get back inside before their eight minutes of oxygen was up. However, no technical glitch any worse than this has happened to me in the time I've been playing; most of the frustrations are caused by realistic depiction of the situation. But like in Kerbal Space Program or any other pleasantly challenging game, when you overcome the trials of the moment, you will feel an immense sense of reward watching your citizens live the lives you have given them among the stars.

								This game feels like Startopia and Tiny Tower went and had an adorable funny baby.  It is important to point out that Startopia is my most favorite game ever made, and I'd still be playing it today, despite having owned it for ten years, if I could find where I put the disc.I would still be immersed in this Spacebase DF-9 if I hadn't hit the bottom of the alpha content after a few hours of playing it.  I am so looking forward to future releases. Everybody buy this game, it is going to be magical.			"

												Oh my.This could have been an awesome game, but they gave up on it, left it half finished, and had to call it done. DF-9 isn't a bad game, the part of it that is finished is pretty awesome and fun to play, until you run into balencing issues that hault the game. I don't know how common of a problem that is, but it seems that all the games I play end up with a negative feed back loop where if enough of the citizens become unhappy, everything on the station starts to not go well, resulting in more unhappyness. what's worse, is no explanation of why. The Wiki for the game is incomplete at best, so there is very little insight into how the game is supposed to be played.I recommend this game because I owned a copy of space colony, and it was awesome. As it stands, Space Colony is currently better and less frustrating although more than a few generations of gaming old. Spacebase DF-9 is still being worked on, and will hopefully keep improving. All the issues I currently have with the game could be fixed in future patching, and BETTER be fixed or this game will be a hightly polished turd that could have been made of gold.TLDR: Game needs balencing to be worth buying. Try Space Colony if you want this kind of game.			"

												This game feels like it's going to be extremely good.  But right now it's more like a horror game.  The whole time you're playing, you have this horrific, sinking feeling that something is going to happen that makes absolutely no sense, and you'll have to restart (or, more likely, quit).I've played several times on earlier versions, and I just played 3 games on the latest alpha (6b).  First game, I ran out of minerals before I built my refinery.  Whoops.  Second game my guys finished the building, but then wouldn't enter it, despite everything being apparently in order.  They all died of asphyxiation.  Third game, I got the base up and running, things were looking great, but then meteors came and smashed into my base.  While no walls or floor were visibly damaged, the oxygen dropped to 0% and everyone died.I can't say the game is just flat out broken, but it sure feels like it.That being said, the potential is there... they just need to get this out of alpha.  I really wish they hadn't made it early access so darn early.  This latest update does not fix the game enough to warrant being released as early access yet.I think I'll love this game eventually, but it pains me to say that I think they released this so early in order to fund other projects. The developers may love this game, deep down.  ""But it's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you.""Edit: Is it any surprise that people disliked this negative review, and yet, I feel I hit the nail on the head now that the game has been ""released"".

								I've been playing the alpha 5b (Doctors with Boarders) build, and the game definitely has promise.Not everything works yet (e.g. power reactors don't seem to serve a purpose), and some things work when they probably shouldn't (e.g. the wall mounted turrets inside the base seem to be able to shoot raider ships that are outside).  The game also currently lacks any tutorial content, so you'll need to learn by playing or look for outside information.  There is enough there to enjoy, although after a few hours you'll probably reach the end of what's available and need to restart keep it from getting boring.There is minimal micro-management options available in the game (you can assign jobs to people and tell them to go to the infirmary), so you need to be careful how much work you queue up since there is no way to prioritise it.  There are other mechanics that don't work so well, such as sending security personel to derelict bases to investigate: the bases always seemed to be hostile and I would end up with some of my people dying.  I found it easier to deal with these bases by getting a builder to knock holes in a few walls to vent the atmosphere first.You can already see some of the humour that Double Fine is known for.  Each person has a SpaceFace feed where they make notes about their day.  There is humour in some of the game mechanics, such as doctors getting rid of the dead bodies in the same matter refineries used by the miners.It'll be interesting to see how the game develops.			"

If you haven't heard of Theme Hospital (or Roller Coaster Tycoon, or several other games with Theme, Sim, and/or Tycoon in the name), then maybe you'd be familiar with FTL, which this also shares some DNA with.You can tell this is an alpha build, as it is a little clunky and buggy -- but you can immediately sense the charm.

Early Access Review
								My first experience with this game involved scrambling to build an airlock and life support structure so my poor crew could breathe that sweet sweet air before asphyxiation ended their greatest adventure.  Sadly I was too late and my workers did not understand the importance of building that suit locker which would allow the air lock to operate properly.  So I watched as my worker scrambled to build the suit locker that would save his life only to be a few seconds too late.  He and the rest of my crew succumbed to the cruelest of fates; I can only hope it was painless.  Armed with new experience and a greater understanding of the fragility of life in space I took another bold step forward and my second base was born.  Things went much better for much longer.  The basics were established with ease and in a very timely fashion.  Mining operations were going smoothly and I was about to establish a pub for recreation and relaxation.  My builder was ordered to remove some interior walls in order to expand a room and it was hoped that he would finish the exterior walls first (you know the ones keeping the cold empty death void that is space outside of my lovely base.)  Alas this was not to be and as the second crew member was pulled into the blackness of both death and the cosmos I knew I had learned another valuable lesson in the fragility of life in space.  With just these few experiences I must say that Spacebase DF-9 has a lot to offer even as an early release.  It is a little rough around the edges and your workers will tend to aggravate you with poor decision making, but stick with it and you will be proud of your accomplishments in time.  Failure and loss is a part of this game so don’t be too frustrated when you need to start over from scratch.  If you enjoy building and management games you should at least give this a shot. "

												Yes, it was abandoned by DoubleFine because they realized that they had over-committed to the game. Yes, it is unfinished and feels a bit rough around the edges. This is, however, not a game worth only a 4/10 rating - people are rating their hurt feelings, not the game itself.That said, it is not great. It's not bad, but not great. Easily worth a few hours of time, and capable of presenting a moderate challenge. Tentatively recommended for those who need a break between bigger and better titles.			"

								First, I would like to point out that this review was made on 15.06.2014, early stage of game.I liked this game, it has a lot of potencial, but so far, there is not much to do in it. Space pirates are lazy and not that dangerous as they try to sound in vidcom, so there is no much of a challange to start with. Just be sure to build airlock and airsupport at the begginning and you are good to go, you will be fine untill you bore yourself to death and quit the game. In my personal opinion there should be more random events, like sickness, rogue settlers, dangerous aliens, neutral events that could turn out favorable or agressive, problems with neighbour bases (So they won't just hang out nearby, but they could request for your help or attack you), etc. Lack of danger is kinda killing the survival vibe in this game, you just build, chill out. Build some more, kill occasion pirate and it's what else? Nothing. This game need a challange, something for a player to fight for. This would make it way much interesting, in my opinion.			"

												Meh meh meh, meh meh meh. That's what almost every negative review here sounds like. All they talk about is how double fine abandoned spacebase DF-9 (which is true, but that doesn't really qualify as a reason for bad reviews.). Honestly, the gameplay here is a bit glitchy (a doctor carries away a dead body but still shows corpse, etc.), but I myself enjoyed this game (until I moved on to other games), mostly because It looked somewhat like prison architect, but less just spamming the HIRE A GUARD! button (not that I own that game, but I have played once or twice, and thats where a lot of my time went) and more problems to take care of. Now, onto the gameplay besides the prison architect style building stuff. 1: more controlled problems. In pris. arch., all you really need to worry about is food. Here you have emotions, job liking, oxygen, sleep, and nothing more that I can remember. 2: uncontrollable problems: in prison arch., you have riots. Here, you have brawls, meteor strikes, fires, betrayals, parasites and raiders. nuf' said. I like this game, so I hope you read this actually sensible review, and buy spacebase DF-9.			"

												        This game was made by an interesting company called Double Fine. The game it self has left early alpha and has became a full game already, now i will emit this game could of been worked on alot more then it currently is. The game many 'preset' areas that you can pick from, but each area is actually randomized as to how it's looked. i played in the same area two times before and the asteriods was layed out different, i had different encounters and much more.        Now alot of people are non-recommending this game simply because they don't see it being complete. now i do slightly agree there, but there is alot in this game you have to spend time playing to actually find. one example would be there is more research than the ones you can get at the begining once you build a research lab. Random data cores can spawn with derelict ships which have random chances to apear. so you could get a late game research earily on or just get a low grade research.        When double fine released this into full game, they had said it wasn't to the level they wanted, they wanted to do so much more with this game but they wasn't able to do it. So instead of just scrapping the game entire like some people believe they've done. They have actually given it to us... to the people of the modding community to create things for it that they would like to have seen in it. Many games have been made alot better thanks to the modding community, games that have had more things than this one even. Yet Double Fine has still been doing updates to the game to balance the game and less bugs to the game.        As for actually gameplay, the game runs fairly smooth and there use to be many annoying things that happened in the game. But the game does have random generation, so you wont have the same game twice. one game you could have an entirely peacefull game, never running into Raiders, or Aliens let alone other things. while one game you could get hit near the begining and get slaughtered, Which this is slightly factored by your chosen start location, for some has more likely hood of one thing than another would. Example: One section has tons of asteriods and rare encounters, while another has medium asteriods and very common encounters.         all in all, i actually believe it's a good Space Station Building simulation game, that many people wouldn't of thought to make, the only real bad thing of this game is the Ai i will emit mainy on the builders, if you want to remove spot in a room or anything be prepared for massive pausing and quick selection, for they will try to kill them selves at times, though i have never had to unbuild anything, because i never seen a reason to do so unless i was doubling a room, which was easy to save my builders. If You think when placing security markers that something is wrong and your security isn't going to the location, it's because either 1. their asleep. (you can't wake them up you gotta let them sleep for as long as they wish). 2. you actually don't have any (pay attention to the jobs you assign) or 3. There is no phyiscal way for them to reach the location.    I will emit this is the first time i've done a review for any game, but i believed i needed to after seeing so many negative reviews that was for reasons that in my opinion didn't fit as a good full on review of the game. This game is still a nice game to play on the side, and in my opinion once the modding community actually starts making mods and more if they haven't already, this game could become even more interesting just like Double Fine is trusting us to do.i personally would rate the game, but i'm not good at picking right numbers to what i feel it should be, it's not a game you'll want to just spend hours apon hours playing, though sometimes when you start you'll get a bit addicted.. untill your space station is killed and you rage. but you can't live forever.

												Before you rage at me, yes there are loads of bugs, and yes the development is ""finished"". I know this, so either take note of my review or shut up.For those who actually want to read my review, I say in short this game is good if you like base management, but buy it on a ridiculous sale.The last game I played that could be compared to this is Prison Architect, so I'll compare to that. This game has its ups and downs, but I found that Prison Architect became a bit stale after a while; build fast at the start, expand for new prisoners, work on efficiency. Rinse and Repeat. Not that it wasn't good, but that's the gist of it.Spacebase Df-9 on the other hand, was a somewhat evolving base management, and a bit of tower defence thrown in when raiders visit too. Once you get the hang of it, you need to constantly adapt your base to make room for new people, keep up with the component decay and so on. One of the hardest bits (albeit interesting) I found was defending against multiple raiders. If you can manage to defeat the raiders, you're then left with a depressed crew (that don't want to work) that needs to repair the remains of the station and hold out until more people show up... or more raiders.I honestly haven't seen any game breaking bugs yet (touch wood!). Bodies stick around for ages, but with enough doctors they get moved over time. Components decay rapidly, but with the right balance you can keep them in check until you research better things. And yes, research takes ages too, but it's helpful if you're around long enough to finish it.All in all, it can be problematic, and there are plenty of issues people have talked about, but with patience and taking the time to learn the game, it can be pretty fun. Maybe a 7/10 from me, buy it on a very good sale.			"

And once you read the wiki page, it clears a whole lot up about the mechanics. Overall, good game, I recommend it.I just wish that Double Fine could polish it up a bit...

								Currently in early access, it's not hard to see the potential of this game. Running your own spacebase can be challenging and frustrating depending on your luck and knowledge initially, but it's quite satisfying to see your crew improve as they grow your station from a simple airlock to a sprawling hub for interstellar travel. Currently lacks a lot of features, so expect not to get much out of it until more is added, but the initial few hours are very entertaining if not buggy.

								This is still an early Alpha version of this game, but even in it's rough state I was hooked. There are some bugs, and you can feel the need for a greater goal beyond building and maintaining your space base.  This game feels like a merging of Sims with the 90s classic Outpost from Sierra Online.			"

												Ok, so this game has been targeted for negative reviews by a bunch of gamergate loons. Free speech and all that, but Tim Schafer and Doublefine make superb, heartfelt games that justify the entire art form, and you should know that he's evidently feminist enough to be able to speak out when the kind of treatment this release is getting is an obvious risk.So maybe, if you want to♥♥♥♥♥♥off some reactionary sexists, you should buy this lovely game. It's not quite everything it was targeted to be, but there is a hidden storyline in there, and it is fun. If you're not interested, then maybe go buy psychonauts or one of their other bigger games as those are superb.I got it when it was on sale, and my persistent habit of bothering to speak in places where what I have to say has gone unsaid means I am going to get downvoted horribly by those same loons.Gamergaters, you're on the losing side :)			"

YouTube™ Video: Spacebase DF-9 - My Best Base Yet! 

			Views: 105		

			This is my most successful base yet! I think I made it about 3.5 hours before the SHTF. I was able to keep the base going even after that happened, building back up to about 27 citizens.		

This is a great start on the game so far. It can be a lot of fun, or really frustrating, but overall a satisfying experience if you are into roguelike games... and can handle some bugs that absolutely will kill you when they happen. Development of the game is a bit slow, but it's steady. I'm definitely a supporter of the game, and I definitely recommend it... so long as you're patient enough to deal with such an unforgiving game.I don't think it will ever be an *easy* game, but due to some current bugs it can be overbearingly hard. The above video is the longest living base I've built so far. I played about an hour longer after the end of this video, and probably could have kept playing indefinitely... but due to some kind of bug my technicians just refused to do any serious work to repairing the base, and I got fed up with it. I've played a few more games since then, but most games don't last longer than an hour. When you do get that one game like this though, it can really make it feel like it's all worth it.			"

												Now that the Early Access and broken promises are over, it's time to review this game as what it is. Forget about the development plans for now, and just focus on what was delivered.Spacebase DF-9 is definitely playable and can keep your attention for a few hours, as you struggle with a not too clever AI to survive the problems the game throws at you.You start out with next to nothing and your first priority is to build and airlock, a room around the seed pod for power, and a life support room for oxygen generation. From then on you will be constantly trying to expand as new crewmembers arrive all the time, and you will face problems like boarders, raiders, alien parasites, base breaches, and crewmen going crazy and causing damage.There is no real goal to this game other than survive. Eventually you will figure out how to create a base capable of sustaining 50 people, and the game will have reached the end: there will be nothing left to do except wait for people to die and be replaced.The game has an unfinished feel about it and that is the main reason I cannot possibly recommend this at full price, but if you can get it at a good discount and do not look at the scrapped plans for the full version, you will probably have at least some fun with it.

												I actually bought this game after reading all the negative reviews because I wanted to see how bad it was. I thought it might be so bad that I'd get a chance to write a funny review and laugh about it with my friends.I was shocked to discover that I actually liked it. DF-9 has much better graphics than any other dwarf-fortress-lite game I've played, and it's quite challenging while fun. I get the feeling that a lot of the hate directed at this game is due to the fact that the developers promised a lot more than they delivered on, but what's here is still pretty and enjoyable.The are some weird gameplay decisions - like the fact that when ships dock at your base, they bypass your defenses automatically and essentially becomes a new randomly generated chunk of your base. However, this can be countered by building floor in strips outside your base to keep ships from from interfering with it... so it's a weird mechanic, but it has a counter and doesn't ruin the fun.A lot of the encounters feel like they were just intended as placeholders - they feel a bit rushed.I played the game for over 32 hours, enjoyed it, and found it hard to put down... so I'd have to say overall I think I got my money's worth.

												Sounds like a lot of these reviews, rather than reviews of the current product, are angry early access people who didn't get all they were hoping for. I bought this from the very first version, but I'm not particularly angry, for some reason. Franky, the game looks a good bit better than it used to, and the features in the trailer are in the game, so if it looks fun, it probably will be regardless of the reviews. And it's $20, even less now that it's on sale, plus they released the source code, so there's a lot of potential for mods. I know some people have said that 20 bucks is too much, but I don't think it is. Standards for game prices have gone waaaay down. Plus you can get Hack'n'Slash cheap, which is a really unique and interesting game. My only suggestion for potential buyers is to look up some videos of the game in action and make your decision that way, and not put much stock in the reviews, because many of them are colored by their expectations of early access, rather than focused on the finished product.

												Now I let me prefrice this by saying that I did not buy this game, I got it for free at launch with me having bought Hack n' Slash so I don't have as much attachment nor need to justify this purchise. Now with that out of the way I do want to mention that I do enjoy this game, it hits all the same centers as Dwarf fortress did. I will and do recomend this game to anyone who likes Dwarf fortress and Gnomeariea.Now for anyone who wants some more info on this title and not just a breif blurb. Starbase DF-9 is a take on your Dwarf fortress style game I personaly like it more but this is my byis towards space over fantasy. For those of you who do not know what this game or style of game is let's run this down real quick. In these style of game you take a small group of settlers and build a base having to harvest rescorces, defend your land make everyone happy. This is much harder then you would think, and these games suscribe to the idea that loseing is fun, you either ram your head into it and start to learn how to play it through sevrial fresh runs. Double Fine did a great job as usuial with it's sense of humor in a game although for them this is a weaker showing, which is stil better then most ""ha ha we're funny"" games bring us. The graphics are styleized and rich the artists did a nice job in the 2d art you see in dialoge but I do feel that the models coud use some work, although this still could grow on me and is made to make it easier to tell at a glace who is doing what in your base.This game has a lot of potential but it did not and is not paying for its devlopement which is a sad thing so that game finalised early and is only a shadow of what they wanted to bring us. I hope that as this game sits on steam and sells they can make more patches to bring us the content they want us to have and make a okay game a stong game for those in this neich of gaming.			"

												Spacebase DF-9 is a space station-building tycoon game with a storied development. Initially conceived during developer Double Fine's Amnesia Fortnight event, Spacebase went on to enter early access with hopes of a long, successful development period which would allow the game to keep expanding for years to come. Despite promising early sales numbers the development couldn't sustain itself and was cut much shorter than everyone expected. Version 1.0 does still offer a full experience, albeit one with quite a few bugs and rough edges. For more, check out the  VIDEO REVIEW

												Ok so this game gets a LOT of flak. But I'm here to put your minds at ease. Version 1.02 is actually stable. It is actually enjoyable. I don't know why Double-FIne waited until the end of their development to finally fix everything but it's fixed at least.I've played several hours of spacebse, and that playtime spanned version 1.0 to 1.02. Since the update to 1.02 my game has finally been running stable, though for some reason I do not get random ship encounters anymore.Conclusion? The game is fairly cheap and enjoyable. It's had a terrible past but seems to have moved on. I recommend modding in the future though, since there are not a whole lot of mechanics in store.			"

Didn't follow up on the updates (so many games to play) but apparently they were lacking. I meant to pick it up again, but never got to it.  Now i've been given hack & slash, a game that has been in my wishlist for some time, to make up for the fact that development has been stopped. Yay for me. :)My recommendation: if you like city builders and exploring new games AND you don't really mind a bug here and there: this game might give you some hours of fun.  Development has stopped, so buy it in promo.			"

Early Access Review
								I always enjoyed playing this game.  I joined early access in this game...  I remember the first Early access Game...  Kerbal Space Program.  I have a beleif that if you don't like the game in the current state the game is in during early access... Don't invest in the game.  If development of the game finished tomorrow and this was the last version of the game... Would you be happy with the current version ?  My answer for every one of the Early access games I have in my library,  Except one. Godus -  I bought the game when I was happy with how it looked. Now it is completely different.  Luckily I did not pay much for godus.The Game has alot of Very good features, Admittedly the game does not have all the features the Developers would have wanted to add if they had the funds and future revenues to develop them.At the end of the day. This is a very nice little game that works well and has a very nice look and feel.			"

												It's sad that the devs abandoned the game but, and that's the most important part for me, it's still fun playing. You want to build a digital space station in a way similar to dungeon keeper where not everything is too easy and people die or get attacked by aliens? You want to try it again and again and again till everything is fine and you can be proud about what you've done? Then buy it. You want something that's so easy every newborn gets bored? Well than look out for another game. Some people might call it buggy and not finished, I call it challenging. Have a good day,			"

												I really don't understand the nerd rage that is going on here about project discontinuation. Like, ""give me my money back"" and stuff - come on, it's not a catastrophe! Of course, I myself also cannot recommend this game since it's not finished, but it's an interesting idea and it's a limited fun to play. The game has a great soundtrack as well.It is sad that this project didn't make it. But it's not a reason to go that mad at a company that made it. Yes, they obviously failed, but at least they were honorable enough to admit it and atone for their failure by releasing the source code. P.S. BTW, did they make everything on Lua? It's kind of hardcore, IMHO...			"

												First point I will make is I really enjoy this game and I would recommend that if it was on sale you should pick it up as despite what people are saying about it not being complete it is still a very fun game to play for 30-40 minutes every now and then which is how I play this game.This game is getting a lot a flack at the moment for being pushed out rather quickly without being completed by the developer. Though this is the case there is still a lot of good content that is in the game as it is and the developers are releasing the code script for this so the community will be able to continue on and mod the game to make it better. I do have to say this is a quite bad thing to do on the developers side, it does mean that at least in the future there is sure to be a lot of content that will make this even more worth while.TL:DR Fun game to play every now and then, buy if in a sale "

												Well I have to start with saying that I am really surprised by all the negative comments on this game......but then again I bought this game in alpha, played about an hour, forgot about it after getting into other games and then when I got back to it there were tons of new features. At this point I had a blast playing it (even in its alpha state I could easily get 10+ hours of gameplay) and was sure that small balances and tweaks would add a lot to the games value. I guess would sum it all up to I was not really expecting much. So as It is now I really enjoy the game, with no bias of previously reading dev posts of false promises and what could have been. What it is right now is a modern version of a god game where your in space.... think dwarf fortress meets the sims with a dash of spacestation sim. It does have its bugs and it is a shame that they still exist in the full 1.0 release but I am confident they will patch the problems over time.As for everyone being hurt by how the devs represented themselves, the game, and double fine, (after reading the many reviews on this game) It really does suck. But Hey - At least it's not Infestation. Or any other of those super scamy games.... you got to admit that this game comes out as something pretty decent, even though it might still be a prototype.

												A lot of people are going to say no to this game because of what happened with the early access. Which for those who don't know, basically backers were promised a lot of features that they later cut in order to push the game to launch due to lack of money.Politics aside, Spacebase DF-9 is a good game. It has a lot of character, makes you smile at corny jokes, looks pretty good, and in general is a good colony management game. I don't think I can flat out reccommend it at $20, but if you pick it up during a sale I'm sure you'll find it well worth the money.			"

												Very decent game, is a lot of fun and quite a bit of replay value. There are some bugs, but those will be fixed in time. I suggest you pick it up on a sale. Lots of Sci-Fi factor and it also brings in a pretty new element of managing a space station, which I haven't seen before. Developers are nice and helpful, and dish out updates pretty quickly. The developers also focus on the bugs more, instead of adding useless content when the game is really buggy. Kudos to them for that.			"

												For all the people who are complaining about the game, just don't listen to them. I can understand that the final release from the dev disappoint many of those who paid it at the beginning but this why we call this, an early access. It's mainly to support independent game devs and contributing in creating new games genre that can actually not always work the way we want it to. For me, after playing the game I have to say hat it isn't THAT bad. no... it's actually a cool game and if you're not happy with, you can still develop it yourself since the source code has been released!

												I don't know why so many are complaining. I think it's a great game, better than Starbound. As I mentioned a while back(their forums? steam? can't recall..) I don't think it's worth $30, $15 would be more like it, or rather $14.99 would be about perfect. But I'm a firm believer that developers are getting stupid crazy with pricing just because they see some games doing it and getting away with it.I found this game a while back, but got a pirated copy to try it out. I liked it and came to buy it, but when I seen the price I decided no, I'd wait. Even if I had to wait for GoG to eventually sell it, for a more appropriate price. But then it went on sale for like 50% off and I was able to get it for about $15. I snapped it up then. I know it shows I've only played for a few hours, but I've got considerably more time in the game than that.If you like games that set you some where and you have to do research and harvest resources to survive and manage things then this is a great game. Just pick it up on sale for $15 or less and you wont be sorry.			"

								This game is litterally unplayable.There's nothing more here other then some nice graphic on an existing engin. The mechanics that have been made in-house are obvious. The path-finding via open Space is buggy and sufocates the crew. The mechanic that lets you repair structurs, like the oxygen generator, is buggy and sufocates the crew.I tried to get my money back, but Steam said they wanted to keep it.			"

								Is extremely fun once you get the hang of it. Only fun for about 4 hours though because there isn't much content in this state. Only other problem is that the devs take 6 months to add like 3 things.			"

								As of 2-13-2014 it plays, but after getting established it loses any sense of direction or challenge.-It is very difficult in the beginning due to limeted intelligence of your crew and the need to spend all of your resources on very specific things.  After getting started it is fairly easy to just grow and grow with the only challenges being to decide who you let on your base to grow your crew and the occasional meteor shower setting fires.  If you can accept these limitations it is still fun to build.  I look forward to seeing how this one ends up.			"

								Enjoying this most frustrating space sim lol ... you think you got it sussed, 20+ peeps on board all living and doing ... then all hell breaks loose heheheh 6 die in a mysterious leak in the recycling room of all places ... reaider playing friendly start shooting .... frantic swap of rota to everyone alive to security and you see the fire extingishers all fizzing ... really enjoying it lol ... dow to 4 peeps and a whole station to deal with .. and so it continues ....Really enjoying this game hopefully more and more features will be added to make it a contender with the current ones out there ... it has the potential to be a great space sim. L<ooking forward to more additions and tweaks. "

								Lovely idea and I like the old themepark/themehospital style of it. The overall idea is great and for an Alpha version it actually is quite good. There are lots of features and it runs good enough. AI is rather stupid sometimes, having a pub with three bartenders but nobody is working there for example. But it's al part of the alpha. Lovely game with some nice potential! Wondering how this game is going to be when it's done.As for the other reviews, don't mind them to much. Just remember your buying an alpha version of this game! It's not complete so don't expect a game that is working flawlesly ;)			"

								NOTE: Not currently worth the $25, I think if you find it for $15 then it's okay.  Currently in early alpha and buggy.It's sort of like a Roguelike, but you build a base instead. "
