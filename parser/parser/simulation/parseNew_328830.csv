												Positives:- Player and Staff database is extensiveA lot of youth players, attributes are quite clear how good a player is or will be- Lots of leaguesNegatives:- UI is not user friendly:Navigating through different pages and what actions can be done is not intuitive- Match engine:It's not very clear what's going on in the way of stats or info, quirks such as making a clean break with all defenders beaten and then making a pass to a player with a defender right on top of him, running towards the touch line in the goal area with no defenders around- Transfers:Not very realistic, a percentage needs to be met for the player to sign and is simply increased with more salary or contract duration with no consideration of which club the player is moving from and toOverall:So far it's not very enjoyable to play=============================================================================After playing a few more hours it does get slightly more enjoyble. The not so great interface has a learning curve to it, which is not somehting you really want for a sim manager.Better than PRM, but I wouldn't recommend it at its release price.			"

												I got asked to manage England in the Six Nations and I ended up getting the wooden spoon. I'm Welsh. 11/10. On a serious note though, this has all the potential to be another championship manager success. It's early in development, the graphics aren't pretty and there are a few flaws here and there but if you try to imagine just how many features there actually ARE in this game then the laws of probability say that's always going to happen on a first series game. Hell, even Football Manager 15 still has bugs and I can't begin to even imagine their budget compared. What we have here is ladies and gentleman is a fantastic glimmer of hope that we finally have a lose your life game for people who support a REAL game, Rugby Union. No diving. No tears. No hooligans.The developers are supportive, listen and reply, and I am hoping that this could be the platform for something great. If they incorporated a similar match engine from a game like 'Rugby Dynasty', an online MMO (check it out, it's incredible) then I would probably NEVER leave this game. Bravo developers. Don't quit and leave us with that abomination of Pro Rugby Manager!			"

												Interesting first attempt, and given time I reckon this could become a really strong series for rugby fans. The basic premise is pretty solid, and the functionality is pretty in depth so it should keep you engaged for a pretty long time. Particular highlights include the colts system - being able to bring young players through and shape them into world class players is what will keep me playing in the long term, and the player stats are generally not too bad, with the editor there for those which are questionable.For me the biggest negative is the interface, which is frankly a bit of a mess and needs some serious thought going into it. The game really doesn't flow very well, and there is a pretty steep learning curve to be overcome.I've also noticed that the number of knock ons and penalties in a game is incredibly high, not sure if I'm doing something wrong but surely you shouldn't have to manually give a command to make players release the ball at every ruck, I'm currently seeing about 10 penalties against me per game for this and its beyond frustrating.I would definitely recommend this game, as it is a very strong first effort which will only get better with incremental updates and I hope the developers will listen to the feedback they receive "

												About 30 hours in I feel like I can make a review for this game.Being an avid Rugby Union fan as soon as I saw this on the steam market I bought it. Initially the game wasn't great, the menu navigation and UI wasn't amazing, but after playing around with it for a while you get the hang of it and are able to move between sections easily. Whilst the graphics aren't great I don't think that's what this game is about. The in game player base is awesome with great depth. The match mechanics are okay, not a big fan but if you get the hang of the plays and what not it can be quite fun.So yeah that's a broad look at the game. The killers for me however are more minute.There's a few big problems IMO. First and foremost is the unrealistic simulated games. You can have a team of 'World Class' players and lose to a team of 'Nationals'. Look I know Rugby and I know you can't count anyone out and what not but this lead to a lot of head scratching from me.Some players are not up to date; e.g. Duane Vermeulan was argueably the best player in the world this year and he's rated as 'International'. So yeah there's a few cases like that, some players over rated and other underated. Which once again left me scratching my head.Sometimes I felt as though my team simply sucked for no reason. I would have an awesome back line, they would have a crap one, set my tactics to play a more expansive game, and strangely, I lost. More head scratching...Overall though it's a fun game to play, if you're not a rugby fan, don't buy this unless it's on sale, I don't feel like you'll get $40 worth of satisfaction. I'll continue to play this game and learn more about the mechanics (still learning!). Cons- Confusing/clustered UI- Unrealistic results- Some players not up to date- Bad graphics- One or two crashes- Players brought up through the 'Colts' and 'Academy' when selected for international duty don't have a name unless editedPros- In depth teams- Aweosme development of your players through your teams system- Accurate coaching system "

												Finally, a rugby title has been released that has some depth and longevity to it.  Having been disappointed with previous management titles released this year, I decided to purchase RUTM 2015 to see if this title could deliver and so far I have really enjoyed playing it.As with any management game, it requires a couple of hours to familiarise with the UI and screen layout - And like others have commented, this seemed a little clunky at first, but given time I was able to get used to it without any problems.The number of leagues and players is very impressive. Rugby fans will be pleased to know that both Northern and Southern Hemispheres are both represented, and there is even an editor that allows for players to customise their teams and alter the names of any unlicensed leagues, teams and players.The match engine is intuitive and allows players to engage with their team and issue orders during a match. Adding Team Calls is a neat feature that can really help to change the outcome of a game.The youth development and academy system is also something that I am particularly fond of, and it allows players to create a self-sufficient team that doesn’t cost a ridiculous amount to establish.I think RUTM 2015 has been a promising addition to the management genre and has set the bar for other Rugby games to follow.  If you are a Rugby fan I am sure you will enjoy this game.Positive Aspects:* Great player database and leagues to choose from – both Northern and Southern Hemispheres.* Different match engine approach with Team Calls and issuing orders.* Great Youth and Academy system, allows smaller teams to be built up over time.* In game editor which allows for plenty of customisation.* Lots of tactical options and statistics for players to tweak.Negative Aspects:* Slightly clunky UI and menu system.* 3D match engine graphics could be improved upon.

												Excellent, excellent first effort. It isn't perfect and there are ways it can be improved and given the opportunity of a yearly franchise I am very confident this can become the ""Football Manager"" of rugby that everyone craves. The menus are tough to navigate until you get used to it, then it becomes a much easier game to get around and there are great levels of detail available. You can make the game as complex or as simple as you like.A very, very positive step in the right direction.			"

I'm a rugby fan playing Football Manager for years hoping for a game like this. It's a bit rough around the edges but it's a good stand alone manager sim and hopefully just the start.			"

												Well, having been a big fan of Football Manager - and Management games in general for that matter. I felt that this was one I would have to try. Especially glad I did so now it has been updated for he 2016 season. Despite the clumsy interface that is not very user friendly, this game has some real plus sides. A lot of leagues, and a surprisingly extensive player database. I am enjoying the game with the recent 2016 season update which brings a fully updated player roster with real life transfers to the game and has the newly promoted teams. Another great feature of the game is the Nations Cup game which allows you not only to control a national team and go head to head against all other Rugby countries throughout the world. To break it down quite simply I thoroughly recommend this game to any Union fan. Sure it has the drawback of a clumsy interface but after a while you get used to it and it definitely doesn't detract from how enjoyable and in depth game this is. The extensive database and realism are huge pluses in this game.			"

Its not as polished to FM standards yet. But if the developers listen to Rugby gamers, it will surely improve with patches..Don't allow these negative comments stop you buying this game.

												So this is a good game!As others have said the menu takes some getting used to but apart from that it is very enjoybale.There are however still quite a few AI issues that I feel at the moment means its not worth the full £30 maybe £20.However the dev is very good at adding updates so hopefully this will be sorted.The AI issues noted so far are;When computer AI kicks to your full-back he will 99% of the time kick the ball out on the full from the 22. Despite being under no pressure.When your own fly-half kicks the chase is always horrendous and if their 15 runs at you he will normally do very well.THis is a real pain as the second issue is that turn-overs from rucks are extremely rare and I have Sam Warburton playing 7 every game!!!!!!  I have also on instances driven the oppostion back from my 22 to theirs without gaining possession The issue with this is that the computer can have possession for almost an entire 1/2 especially if you win it back to just knock on! More turnovers are essential.The game also doesn't notice things like the touch line when running or when a player is blatantly isolated.For some reason when it gets to 80 or 40 mins even if you are 5m out from opp try line your fly half will kick the ball dead.  Not useful when you are on 3 trys and need the 4th for a bonus point.When players make a clean break through the line they will often stop and pass to a heavily marked player rather than continuing themselves (this has cost me several games/bonus points)  or they will not give the ball when there is a ridiculous overlap that is guarenteed a score.It is very intermittent as to whether a player will try to but the ball down between the sticks after crossing the line unapposed, There also seem to be some really basic back moves that seem to end up with a try.  Especially as some defenders run all sorts of crazy lines that completely miss all the attackers.Finally the back row never break off the scrum.  This ties into the point above, especially during a blindside move as it creates a ridiculous overlap.SO in conclusion this is a very good game and I do enjoy it greatly.However with the bugs/glitches mentioned above I don't believe it is currently worth it's premium price as the bugs glitches do somewhat ruin it, especially when games are tight and you feel like the computer is just cheating you.Edit: So as mentioned above the dev has issued an update that introduces more turnovers etc to the game that does give it a better feel.  There are still of course other bugs present still but the developer is continuing to update the game and is committed.  If you are considering purchasing this game, stop considering and start buying you will get a lot out of it!			"

												Well what can I say really I was in 2 minds about this game as I must be one of the only ones that quite likes the other rugby managing game which I got for bargain £7.49. I dont regret buying this but for sure the match engine I dont like the trailer makes it look so much better than it is imo. It takes a while to understand all the controls and to figure out about staff recruitments etc I suggest you hire an agent 1st of all as he saves u lots of money when buying coaches assistants and scouts saves u %25 which i only found out about this after half hour lol so had to restart :(. I could not understand why all my matches was simulating until i realized I had put all my assistants on Auto assign help nd added them to senior squad which meant they did everything and all I had to do was sit back and see the wins pile up 3 in a row undefeated since starting game lol. For me this is awesome with all the database and many decisions you have and so many players in the game and I really like the academy and colts squads to and getting your own coach for the colt squad good to, The only thing I dont like is the match engine so for me will be getting that on auto assign with my assistants and managing that way :). I also like the features such as the best player table in your league, manager acheivements and trophies to view etc :) Will use other Rugby for match engine this will be for huge database and many other aspects I like :)			"

												If you are looking for a rugby union management game, this is defintely it. It is rough around the edges and needs improvement in a fair number of areas, but at its heart it is a very good management game, highly enjoyable to play and allows you to manage your favourite rugby team - what more could you really ask for!?  What is good is that the devs seem to be intent on updating the game to fix problems and seem to be paying attention to what players want to see from the game, which is very encouraging. All in all, the game is very promising and is, by far, the best rugby union management game available. I would recommend  buying the game, so long as you don't expect perfection from the get go.			"

												this is a pretty decent game, it pretty accurately allows you to manage a rugby team from the top national leagues, the interface takes a bit of getting used to but once you do it works pretty well. the database is good as well. resolutions are limited to 1024*768 and 1024*600 at the moment, but I think they may have updates planned to add to this. the pre-game editor is okay but limited to players and their stats. overall it's a pretty good game, most importantly I think it has a lot of potential, future versions or updates could well make this into a passable Rugby answer to the awesome Football Manager series. certainly it's a far far superior game to any other rugby management sim I have played in recent years.

												Feels less modern than the last rugby management game I bought which was released 10 years ago.Player database for my chosen team was pretty sketchy, suggested formations looked nothing like what would ever actually be picked. The editor allows you to fix this relatively easily but it's a fairly big investment in time just to get to the point where you can start playing.Game engine is pretty shakey too. The most common penalty seems to be for high tackles and I'm yet to see a penalty given for scrum or breakdown infringements. Play generally won't move on at a breakdown until the scrum half has arrived (unless they're in the ruck) regardless of how long it takes them to get there. Players make clean breaks and then pass to players in worse positions.And the cherry on the cake? It's just crashed with no reason given. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for this if I had the choice at this stage.			"

I t feels like you're playing with a huge amount of data being managed by a spectrum.

												The updates have removed some bugs and improved matches a bit.The editor only allows you to change names and abilities, so don't buy this game expecting to be able to mod very much.Players have ratings for backs and forwards as well as a calibre rating (which stays the same their whole career for some reason?).  Forwards don't seem to be very athletic in the game (this does not represent modern rugby).The game has depth in terms of leagues although there are problems with All Black, Wallaby and Bok clubs as all the players who play in Super 15 franchises ONLY play Super Rugby, not in any of the national leagues.  The national leagues from these three countries are not great as these players are missing and made up mediocre players make up the unions.  The unions that play in the Super 15 are totally seperate and this will be an issue if the game is to develop in New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, among expats from these countries and among European fans who follow the excellent rugby from these countries.  The unlicensed player names is not the problem, but rather it is the way they have set up these competitions.The game overall is great though and there are lots of things you can control from matches, preparation, training, club infrastructure etc.			"

												At first I was hesitant to buy it, I am a  big   fan of managerial style games (football manager) and I am a massive rugby supporter. The first impression on starting the game up is disappointing as it doesnt support any form of higher resolution (the highest being 1024x768) nor is the initial interface clear engaging OR attractive... The animation of play is very basic and so are the features of the game. HOWEVER...For the price of the game, which compared to other similar styled games, isnt too much... the work that has been put into the database is incredible. Unfortunately some licensing is missing but that can be fixed using the provided editor (wich is another positive) or you can feed off of the hard work of others by clicking here[www.therugbyforum.com]If you can look past the low budget graphics the game is really enjoyable to play and is quite addictive as a rugby fan.I bought the game to aid with the development of future ""RUTM"" games and would urge anyone on the fence to buy it even for that sole reason. If noone had supported/bought Football manager when it started we wouldnt have such great games now, and so I hope my investment in the game with the developers will be met with a few updates/upgrades as time goes on... but we will see.

In terms of rugby managing games that I've looked for, this seems to be the best. However, it needs a lot of improvement to reach the level of similar football or other management games.Overall, if you can accept the problems with it, what you have is a decent game, though it isn't worth 30 pounds.

												This is a very good game, and I was pleasantly surprised at how addictive it is. It ships with an editor so I was able to start simulating Super Rugby after tweaking a few minor details here and there. I give this a solid 8 out of 10 and hope there is going to be an updated version later on which will give you more cameras to fiddle with and a zoom option to get closer to the action, and I will buy that too. It is in the same league as Cricket Coach and Cricket Captain. I recommend it to people that are serious about their sports sims.			"

												Poorly made game. UI is very difficult to use/understand and not very intuitive. Special attention seems to have been paid for some teams but not others, for example most southern hemisphere names are spelt wrong. AI also doen't seem to factor in things like going out etc.			"

												First of all this is in no way worth 29.99 it should be more like 9.99 for what you get, but it is not a bad start for a rugby union manager game. The menu and gameplay does feel outdated, it kind of feels like im playing a old championship manager game. It has potential but atm its very basic, It does not even come close to a football manager game with regards to depth, gameplay and database etc, However if your a rugby fan you will have fun playing this game, I would reccomend going to a online game site, like me You can pick this up for half the price it is on steam.

												£30 ....... for this? Never again, biggest waste of money ever. Stupid UI and the game its self is not complete at all, so many bugs its untrue. As a life long rugby fan (union and leauge) i was really hoping for this title to be something that we havent seen before, but as with all rugby games (bar rugby challange 2), we get the same old s**t.Was northampton in the aviva (on medium), beat toulon and sarries and 2 other nameless punks in pre season then lost nearly every match during the campaign. An absolute joke! especially considering ive got half the welsh back line in there and then the pack is 90% england internationals. Best team by far in the divison and i lose to Sale, Irish and Welsh by heafty margins, at home?!. Game sucks♥♥♥♥♥and is blatantly broken yet they saw fit to release this trash and call it a game and have the gaul to charge mugs like me £30 for the pleasure?  i dont know wether to♥♥♥♥♥♥or wind my watch.Seriously save yourself some money and wait for the rwc15 game or rugby 16 by ea.

												I am a huge fan of the football manager series, so I was very excited when I saw there was a rugby manager as I am a huge rugby fan. I obviously did not expect the game to be on the same level as the football series but I expected it to be a lot better for the price tag of $39.99. "

												It's fun so far, just been trying to make my own custom teams with random fun names, to see how far I can get, would recommend it since it's fun to play with different characters. It can be a bit difficult for new players, recommend starting with a new without academy/colts first to get used to the general gameplay.			"

												Its a shame, for the price you expect a game that is at least funcitional.  There are a lot of problems and lets start with the most obviouse one.  I have had mutiple games where I have not won a single scrum.  Now I know wasps are not great in that position but when I bring in almost a full England International front row there are a lot of problems.  This is the first of a long list I have to say that I am very dispointed.			"

												This is not Football Manger. The game accuratley reflects managing a rugby but lacks any form of glossy finish, it plays like an xcel spreadsheet and has the glamour of a z-list celebrety at the opening of an envalope. It isnt a deep game either, dispite functions such as youth team promotion and in game play calls i'd wait till this game drops to a price around £15 before paying for it.			"

												I love rugby, and its a crime that a true Rugby Manager hasn't been built to this point. I am a big fan of the Football Manager series, but if you are looking for an in depth Rugby management game, this is not the one for you. The UI is quite frankly disgusting (a throwback to the mid 90s); it has no resolution greater than a ♥♥♥♥ing potato. The major reedeming factor of this game is that you have the players photos.			"

												My original review is below, however having put just 4 hours into the game this is my updateAfter playing for about 4 hours now i have to say the game is crap. Might as well be a game from 1992. Although there seems to be alot of depth on first look, it soon becomes apparent that the options available are just scratching the surface. There is no immersion in the game, with bad graphics in 3d game mode and a poorly laid out over complicated interface. Not worth paying 29 quid for.I do not expect a game of this poor quality graphic wise, interface and match engine to be released in 2015. The bench mark is FM2015 there really is no excuse to release crap and call it a game.First impressions.Tons of stats - well put together game, and i like it. Best out there so far.Could do with a few more screen res optionsInterface feels like an excel spreadsheetThe 3D game mode is a bit early 90's - perhaps upgrade that and add a zoom in.Would like to see players names above players in match view.Green text when a player has the ball in match view is hard to seeWould like to be able to have a play editor to make own tactics and be able to employ them during a match.Overall pleased with the purchase. If the match engine was better it would be awesome.			"

												A lot of people rave about this game but I think that is because the alternatives are so bad.The interface is clunky and looks dated. The message prompts don't seem to go away.  And most annoyingly, there is much less opportunity to develop a squad compared with the best known football games.Some of the teams have odd or non existent names which is irritating.The big plus is the realistic details for players - but I can barely enjoy them.  It feels like a game from 20 years ago.			"

												Possible the worse managment game I have ever played, tried to play it for 6+ hours and feel its time I will never get back would rather stick nails in my fingers than keep playing this. I feel conned paying 29.99 for this pile of junk. especially as amazon are selling it for 16.99 but after playing this I feel its has a value more like 2.99/4.99. and before anyone says anything I have played rugby and am used to managment games but this is really appaling save you money. DO NOT BUY!!! You would get more enjoyment buying £30.00 worth of chocolate and stuffing it down you thoat until you were sick than playing this game			"

												Solid, but unspectacular. A good game for fans of rugby union and management sims, but a long way off the depth and polish you might hope for if you're used to similar series, such as Football Manager. Worth picking up, but only at a low price.			"
