Hours played: 9Current patch: #35Rating: 8.5/10Initial Thoughts:Ok so, I stumbled upon this game whilst casually browsing YouTube, reception seemed welcome and I liked what I saw, decided to take the plunge and purchase it.I have played games like DayZ (Mod) and DayZ Standalone previously and quite honestly, Miscreated blows it out of the water, now I understand both are in Alpha builds but god damn, Miscreated just has me coming back for more each day! I decided to purchase this alongside my brother and there hasn't been a dull moment yet, from one-shotting mutants to hijacking a jeep and crashing into a tree and watching it glitch and fly at us whilst we were having a casual conversation and watching it go up in flames! Others players we've encountered along the way have been pretty friendly (we had shotguns xD).However, we've also come along other players who don't hestitate in taking your life, can't even get a ""hello"" in, which is fine, each to their own I suppose, loot is pretty plentiful, which is good because you tend to get really hungry/thirsty very quickly!Good PointsFunPlentiful lootFriendly(ish) playerbaseGood amount of mutants (but not too much!)Level of detail is amazingFPS (frames per second) seems to be pretty stable (even on Very high w/ AA)Bad PointsLack of vehicles (variation of model/skin)No form of storage (YET - Patch #36 should address this)Weight limit seems a bit ridiculous at times (40kg)Not much to do in terms of progression, would be nice to increase player statsPlaying alone can become quite tiresome (a friend would be beneficial)Notes: This is my first review so please be gentle. This review will be updated on the 19th of each month.  "

								-Purchases game, loads up server and its night time-Runs into tall office building-I discovered I have spawned in with a flashlight-Canned corn, I found a can of corn for my first meal in the office kitchen pantry-Eventually I look for loot in the bottom section of the office building and find some gear-Looted up and found a sweet leather cowboy hat and I found some steeltoe boots to throw out my sandals-Everything in the bottom floors were looted so I head to the top floor to find more loot-Stairs, stairs, and more stairs. I finally made it to the top floor of the building-S""STOP AND PUT YOUR F***KING HANDS UP OR I'LL SHOOT YOU"" I turn around and discover another person in the building with a shotgun aimed at my forehead. I freak out and try to run and as I go to leave the top floor I was surrounded by his buddies. They (pointing their guns at me) instruct me to turn around and put my hands up, I'm a noob so I politely asked them what the control was to put my hands up, I do as they ask and they ask me to remove my sweet leather cowboy hat and stare at the floor. I remove my hat and they handcuff me with duct tape. As I'm crying, missing my new leather bound friend, I was told to be quiet and keep staring at the floor, ""OKAY A**HOLE, DON'T MOVE OR WE SHOOT"" I explain to them I didnt have loot as I'm a fresh spawn, they un-handcuff me and tell me to count to 60. I wait patiently and count to 60. I look up and the group of bandits were gone and find that they left behind a ton of food, canteens, a hunters backpack, and a crossbow with plentiful amount of ammo. (I love you, random bandit/friends!)Never got my sweet leather cowboy hat back though :'(10/10 will play again.			"

Considering it was in Alpha, i was hesitant, because I didn't want another DayZ/H1Z1. But to my surprise, it turned into my new favorite survival game. I've had A LOT of time playing DayZ, H1Z1, Rust, and other games alike, but miscreated takes home the cake. It's a great game to play solo or with friends. If you enjoy survival games and want your adrenaline pumping, this is the one for you.  (If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) "

								*note: If some sentences sound a bit strange, english is not my mother tongue, sorry in advance..^^Miscreated. For me personally, the hardest game ever to review, because this game has huge potential and my ingame hours might tell that I enjoyed this game a lot for some time. At some stage I was a dev-tester for Entrada and the base I built can still be seen on Miscreateds store page (second screenshot). For the last year or so I had a positive review up here and as much as I hate it, I feel like it doesn't do the game justice anymore. But still - if you're into these kind of games it might be worth the money for you, but prepare to be let down once you get deeper into this game.So I got this game pretty much just after its release late in 2014 and it was quite a rough start. Very small map, huge performance issues and not much to do. But right from the start this game and its devs were different. It looked pretty, the devs were (and still are) very active and patched this game frequently. They solved a lot of performance issues, added a lot of new content and kept talking to their quite small community. Sometime in 2015 they released a freebuild-basebuilding system that alows you to create very unique bases, as every part can (and has to) be placed and adjusted individually, so no snaping baseparts like in Rust, H1Z1 or pretty much every other game in this genre. I loved this basebuilding feature so much, that I spent about 70 hours to build a single base, which even made it into their store page screenshots. The system had it's issues, but I thought to myself ""hey, this is early access, it'll improve over time, just like other stuff they fixed before"".Then a lot of sales started, it felt like half of the time in early 2016 the game was on sale for 9,99‚Ç¨, which finally got the devs what they wanted and of course every game needs - a large playerbase. And from this point, it all went down pretty fast and and this game got ruined.It seemed and still seems like the majority of (young) players are only looking for one thing: Destroying the gaming experience you have and kill everything that moves. If you were not on a strictly PVE server, everyone in this community, which was back in the days so special and friendly, would just kill you on sight or betray you by pretending to be friendly and shoot you in the back. I know this is typical behaviour for a lot of people who play online, so why do I blame the devs for this? Because they encourage this behaviour in any way they can! The last couple of patches have just been filled with guns, grenades and other PVP stuff, even though this game has so many guns already and desperatly needs survival content, which just isn't there. There is literally NO challenge in surviving in Miscreated. Mutants are no threat as they are stupid, most of the time slower than you and usually don't appear in a group, supplies are a joke (in over 800 hours I wasn't close to starvation or dehydration once!) and there isn't anything to do when it comes to survival (sicknesses, temperature, personal character development etc.). Why should I hunt a deer, collect it's meat and build a campfire to cook it? There is food around everywhere, why bother? This is not a survival game, this is a giant deathmatch arena.Another example of how the developers encourage ""bad"" behaviour: To get into a base and destroy baseparts, you only need a melee weapon(!!), which you'll find in less than 2 minutes after spawning. You can only build wooden walls/gates and they are not strong at all. So even if a person needs to break down multiple walls to get to the storage box of someone else, it'll still be way faster to just do that and steal all of their stuff than actually going into the cities and scavange. So what's the solution 3 out of 4 players come up with to protect their stuff? They build floating bases. Cause once a base part is placed, you can remove the parts under it without the upper part falling down, so no gravity. By now about 85% of the bases on regular servers in Miscreated look like‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because they are floating in mid-air or are abandoned because they've been looted and destroyed multiple times a day. Instead of fixing issues like that, basebuilding just sits in the game and is not focussed on at all.Half of my steam-friendlist contains people I met in Miscreated, mainly from the earlier days. So many good people, such great adventures we had. This is all over now, I talked to a lot of these players and most of them have the exact same opinion. I guess that the problem these devs will have to face is, that once people get bored of their endless deathmatch-rounds they will move on, whatever that means for Miscreateds playerbase. And please don't get me wrong, I like intense PvP fights, it's part of a survival game. But it's supposed to be just a part, not the entire game and all there is to do.When I was a dev-tester I was connected to the dev-team through skype and of course I won't tell anything out of these conversations. But I want to say one thing: Most of them seem like really friendly, down to earth people. But whenever I mentioned these problems I didn't get an answer or they just didn't agree, which I can not understand as these issues concern core elements of a survival game. Of course I accept their opinion, it's their game and if they want to go that path I wish them all the luck in the world and I really mean it. But my high hopes for an intense SURVIVAL game have turned into a huge disappointment from a plain deathmatch simulator with nothing but PVP elements.			"

								so i started out a fresh spawn like every other pleb. i found a ton of gear, got pretty lucky, had a shotgun, two pistols with ammo, a sniper, hatchet, bunch of medical supplies. second largest backpack, combat gear. a sweeeet eyepatch. i found a quad, looked all over for parts, finally found everything i needed except two tires.. another fresh spawn joined the game right behind where i was, he asked for a ride, graciously i gave him one. we tooled around for a bit looking for two front tires, i found one and we were able to go much faster. we arrived in a town called sultan, he said he found a .357 magnum, i already gave him a gun, just without ammo.. at this point we had been traveling together for about an hour, so i decided to trust him... i gave him some .357 ammo i had on me. we continued to search through sultan, i found an ultra rare collectable item.. a ""Garden Gnome"". i was so excited, so happy. felt like the sad desolate world that makes up miscreated was finally started to pull itself back together, all was well.we met back at the church where i parked the quad, i took the battery out so nobody could steal it, and he was waiting by it. i told him of my spectacular find, the ultra rare, ultra suave ""Garden Gnome"". he asked to see it, so i showed him. then quickly picked it back up. he asked if it stands up, i said i dont know, so i dropped it once more, as soon as it dropped, he pulled out a gun, tensions rose, he aimed.. took 3 shots, and down i went, like a tree without a stump.. like a giraffe that lost its balance.. i was hurt, and dying. betrayed by my own apprentice, betrayed by a filthy disgraceful, despicable Gnome-stealer. i laid there as he looted my bleeding body, took my gnome first, then my guns and ammo, stripped me of my glorious eyepatch, now blood-stained. he took my backpack and car battery, put it in the quad, looked back one last time in the grief and horror of his actions, then looked down at the gnome with one tear in his eye.. he wiped that tear, stuffed the gnome back in his new blood-stained backpack and pulled away on my old quad. I will find that Garden Gnome again, if its the last thing i do. Even if i have to pry it from my old friends cold, dead hands. Betrayal will fuel my search, revenge will find my Gnome. It is said the deepest circle of hell is reserved for mutineers, and Gnome betrayers.			"

								Day 1:On my first day I spawned in for the first time in history, found a fully geared body next to me. Grabbed his gear and moved on.  Found another body with a cross... necklace... thing... I took it for good luck. After walking around for an hour trapped in the wilderness, checking out the graphics and immersity. I then stumbled upon a player, gave him a helmet and hammer. I never saw him again. I then found a bridge and found a fresh spawn, gave him gloves... Never saw him again. After continuious walking in circles in the wilderness I finally found civilisation. I looted the suberbs and found an empty gun. I then heard somebody in the house next to me. Curious, I stepped outside, and saw the dreaded Bushman waiting in the plants outside. I ran for my life, then circled into another house and found a clip of ammo. Confident I walked outside with my new weapon. Annnnd... the Bushman was waiting outside, he opened fire first, I returned fire.He had much more ammo, I eventually ran into a bush and waited for my demise.I then did not accept defeat, I rushed him with my hatchet.And then... I got capped in the head and fell over and died. Bushman will pay...Day 2:After dieing horribly, I respawned somewhere in the country side, I then saw a mutant.It killed me very easily. I then respawned yet again and actually did some looting in sultan. I was then attacked by a Mutant, died horribly. Yet another respawn, I started to loot yet again, I then was attacked by ANOTHER mutant. I barely survived. After I healed up I went outside, I was then in the middle of a gun fight between 2 people. The Bushman and a guy with pink pants. Bushman ran away, but pink pants opened fire on me. I ran for my life, having no firearm at the time I always had to keep running away from basically everything. I thought going into the mall to look for bandages was a good idea... I then saw 4 people all standing in the corner. I was killed instantly...Day 3:After yet again being mowed down by a storm of bullets, I looted various houses around the countryside. I was lucky to find a gun and 1 clip of ammo... Seems familiar. I then walked, and walkeduntill I reached a bridge.I saw someone in the distance...It was... BUSHMAN! We starred at eachother, waiting for somebody to fire the first shot. He eventually gave in and opened fire. I fired back. I was the better aim, I thought I had the advantage. I then saw movement to my right, he had friends, 2 of them to be exact. I fired my last clip of ammo into them, then began to run into the forest.Not surprsingly I bled out in the forest... Time to start again... I respawned yet again, and walked all the way back to Sultan. I was pretty sure I wouldn't get my gear back, I would die trying. After getting myself a hatchet and gear, it was getting dark. I had just finished scavenging a house, I walked outside into the night then 2 people walked right on up. I said hi, they said hi, then they bashed me on the head. I briefly replied by slamming my hatchet into his shoulder. I fought with them toe to toe, dodging attacks and swinging my hatchet at them. But I was outnumbered, They had more firepower than me. I ran towards a bridge, with them on my tail. I knew they would follow me to the end of the earth. That gave me an Idea, so I said to them: ""You know kids, it's been real fun but I ain't giving you the pleasure"". So I dove off the bridge myself, I died instantly, but atleast they wouldn't have the pleasure of killing and looting me. I then heard to splashes in the river... They were that dumb to jump into the river and cause their deaths... They weren't the sharpest knives in the drawer.Day 4:I respawn back near Sultan again, and begin to loot. I get some Green Camo gear and a hatchet then went afk inside the church for a bit. On my return I see a man with a Black Helmet, Black jacket, Black boots and gloves... With no pants. He seemed hesitant, he kept peeking through the door. Then he struck, he sliced me with his own Hatchet, I soon retaliated. We decided to take this outside, then the battle began. It was intense, I landed the most hits, and he was wounded. Then I turned around and saw another man in the same Uniform as the other, but with a gun. I'll take you both on! I fought and fought, blood stained the floor, and hatchet man was weak, he retreated behind the church and ran for his life. Gun guy was still trying to shoot me. But I closed in and kept on slicing him up. He was getting weak as well. He retreated to the front of the church. I followed.Just as I thought I had him, We both turned the corner and... There were... 8 other people... All with Black helmets, jackets and boots... All with no pants... And all had a gun pointed at my head. I then thought to myself at this exact moment: ""Well crap, it's Attack of the Clones all over again"". I realised the error in my ways and tried to run. Obviously you know I never make it out alive.I then respawned, l proceeded to look through various houses trying to find something to protect myself with. I then walked into a small house with only 2 floors. As I walked upstairs I saw some blood on the wall, there was a dead body slouched on the floor under the blood stains... Fully geared. The clone army must've gotten to him. I grabbed his gear and ran outside. I then saw another man, we looked at eachother briefly and he walked off towards the petrol station. I turn around and see some scouts from the clone army run towards me... Hurray... I hid in some bushes and they walked right past me... Hiding is so easy. The only problem is, I think they just killed that man I met. Hopefully they thought it was me Just when I think I'm safe I walk out of my bush, And get shot by the clone army...Day 5:I began to loot Sultan yet again... I got a gun, some military gear, and was punched to death by a man in yellow. I respawned and found 2 dead bodies on the road, each with guns. A man I passed earlier also saw this, grabbed a gun from a body and shot me twice. Unluckly for him, I had a weapon as well. 6 shots hit his stomach. He fell to his knees looking at me, dropped his gun, fell down and died. I then met a man and showed mercy on him, he'd wandered into the fight. I pormised I'd protect him and I did. I got him gear and weapons, we then decided to go our seperate ways. I then found a jungle camo shirt and was shot in the very same house where I lost my other Military Gear. I respawned yet again and found a dead body near a gas station. I took his loot and walked down to Sultan, then gunshots ran out and 2 bullets landed next to me... It came from... A bush... At that moment I knew who he was and what he wanted. It was Bushman. I ran back towards the gas station and hid. I waited for awhile then moved up to the road. I looked for every possible angle he could've shot me from. I turned my head and saw a man running up another road. Bushman... I followed him in hot pursuit. I followed him through the bushes to avoid detection. I went down a dirt road and saw a dead body, he was definitly here. I then followed him throughout the countryside. I heard his footsteps now and again but never saw him. He was a master of stealth. I followed him to the trailer park and heard him rummaging through a fridge, I ran over the that direction when I took a shot. He was here alright, and he knew I was following him. I lost his trail eventually and headed back to Sultan were I got myself a hatchet and better clothing. As I was looting one house I heard gunshots ring out. I ran outside to see Bushman chasing a man down. I followed, as I turned the corner I saw Bushman standing over the body of the man he was chasing. He'd killed him. I snuck up behind him and struck, brining my hatchet down into his neck. He turned around and tried to hit me with his hammer, but it was no use. He was weak after his previous fight. Just as I was about to stike him down... The server crashed, and he was gone.			"

								Been waiting for this game to officially release before making a review but as I have been summarily banned from the forums for speaking my mind I feel forced into posting now. Here is the post that got me banned. With my response as well..You have been banned from Miscreated DiscussionsYou have been banned from Miscreated Discussions by a forum moderator for your post in ""Patch #39 - 09/05/2016"": Originally posted by Kleptokilla78:Originally posted by jforsaken1:People were jumping around in gunfights. LMAO, that's pretty damned funny. I guess that would be one strategy. Devs should adjust game so that when jumping you are more likely to be hit by gunfire. There's a fix for us.I think it's a realism thing... Other than in games i have never seen anyone hopping around like a bunny while fleeing gunfire...That was the post above and my response below.If you haven't been in a real gunfight please don't make comments like this.The most likely reason for people bunny hopping in a game is to exploit the lack of a fully working hitbox or problems with the netcode that impinge on hits registering. Too many things going on and hits don't register as they should.Imo this is just a cheap solution to a much larger problem.Ban Reason: Continual Non Stop Misinformation and Toxic behaviorPlease review the Discussions Rules and Guidelines.This is a permanent ban.1 Comments	 Subscribe to thread  (?) Add a comment Tincup_the_Middleman 5 minutes ago  I haven't even posted in weeks and didn't violate any forum rules. You guys really don't want to start down this road of banning people with complaints....Its your forum and your choice but this is not the way you should be handling things when faced with criticism.Reconsider it.I have criticised other aspects of this game before in the hopes of it being fixed. Which they have. I don't really understand why they banned me as I did not violate forum rules at all and just gave my opinion about issues I have observed in the game. As stated before. Its their forums and they can ban whoever they want. But agressively banning and removing all sorts of criticism is a very big red flag and its a course of action habitually used by developer's to hide issues with the game.Miscreated has suffered from issues with its netcode and engine since it released. It has improved over time for sure and has gotten to be a decent game. This agressive censoring is troubling though as it shows a lack of professionalism from the team against criticism of their game.Sanitizing comments about a game's problems is unprofessional. I was banned and my post removed as well. Did my comments hit too close to the truth or is this just a case of overzelous devs ""protecting"" their game's image?I leave it to you guys to consider.First edit: For a more comprehensive look at the issues with censoring and banning please look at the comments section. There is a whole conversation between myself and Jenilya (community manager) and Chrissprance (developer) on it that is quite informative for those wanting to have a wider view of the issue.Second edit: The review was flagged as abusive by the developer's which Valve took into consideration and removed as unsubstantiated reasoning for it to be flagged at all. This was another failed attempt by these developer's to further censor my opinion which violated no forum or review guidelines.			"

								So my experience with this game was shocking. The first server I joined had issues, bugs galore, and hackers everywhere. So I left and joined a different one. By god is this world beautiful. You can do everything, like ride a bike, loot, build, kill (depending on servers), get parts for vehicles, etc. I was having fun running around with my baseball bat, motorcycle helmet and my one 1 bullet for my bolt action. killing the occasional mutant and lots of wolves (scary‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•animals in this game), but I came across a guy who was chilling there in the woods with a huge fortress. Over the comm system he says, ""Hey come up here real fast"" and being an h1z1 and dayz player I was reluctant. But new game new life. SO i hoped up there, and next thing I knew he gave me all his gear, and said ""My time is come to start anew. This base and all the things in it are yours. Keep it safe. And last of all if you decide to leave the server, or start fresh or anything like that. Do the same thing I did. and pass it on like the guy before me."" Then he left, naked and without weapons. screaming ""Let's GO MUTANTS I'LL FIGHT YOU BARE NAKED""  never seen him again. So now I watch over his base, killing mutants, and raiders alike. And when I finally leave this server, I will pass down the legacy of this gorgous base and loot to another. Continuing the legacy of the survival man before me. 10/10 Hopefully I'll meet you again someday Survivor Man.			"

								Forget about dayz, this game has even more potential.Consider this:-dayz has 90+ developers, aproximately 5m of copies sold (and tons of money) a fanbase established since arma 2 mod, completely supported by a veteran company (bohemia) and the best scenario ever possible for an EA game.-Miscreated has 15+ part time developers, limited budget and basically no visibility.-dayz has been developed since august 2012, yet still seems like a buggy trash game and no signs of a release anytime soon.-Miscreated was launched in oct 2014 presumibably began development late 2013 and has done  an incredible progress, to a point were this game can be considered ""finished"", it only has to include some fixes, optimizations, etc. you can feel how smooth PVP and PVE is, there are communities working together in bases, the environment is AMAZING.And that's the best part, I have the sensation of playing a very mature game and we're not even close to see all the features.-dayz has progressively slowing down it's development pace to a point where this year has only seen 1 single update, a big one, yeah, but it took 7 months, and the next one is taking 5 atm, It's pretty clear they're developing their game but we have to have in mind that they're not developing to themselves, they are on EA, they have to mantain regular updates to keep people engaged, a game with all the favourable situation of dayz can't play with the playerbase like that.-Miscreated on the other hand, updates every month, sometimes even twice, new content, new core mechanics, new several architectural changes to make things better than the default cry engine can offer, just remember the team size and compare it with dayz, I can't imagine how this game can be with 90+ people.And that's it, there's more to mention but the review will turn out boring, Miscreated truly has potential and I feel like I paid for a real and serious development.Edit: misspell corrections			"

Early Access Review
								DON'T AVOID THIS GAME JUST BECAUSE OF THE  MIXED  USER REVIEWS LIKE I DID AT FIRST.MOST OF THESE REVIEWS WERE MADE WHEN THE GAME WAS INCREDIBLY YOUNG AND DON'T REFLECT THE QUALITY OF THE GAME CURRENTLY AS IT HAS MAJORLY IMPROVED SINCE.I have never reviewed a game before on steam but this game truly deserves it. Why I love this game:  Absolutely gorgeous graphics. Big updates EVERY month. Amazing base building. Amazing community. Incredibly friendly playes on the servers. Brilliant looting system. Huge map (and is going to be even bigger in future) The Devs actually engage in the community and listen to feedback and help any issues you are having. Incredibly atmospheric. Genuinely scary sometimes (especially at night). The crafting system is fantastic. So many items already in the game. Even though it is early access there are very few bugs. So many more features planned. INSANELY realistic. Such a blast to play. Hundreds of secrets to discover, from caves to hidden messages. Truly unlike any other open world survival game out there. There are more things to add but I simply cant think of all of them right now :PThere are of course negatives, as with any game, however most of the very few negatives I have with this game the Devs are already planning on adding (e.t.c. Storage)This is honestly one of my favourite games of all time and I cant wait for this game to be fully released.Just buy it. You wont regret it.9.5/10 "

								After picking it back up upon seeing all the patches that have been flowing out, I was just wanted to go back and change this immediately. This is a completely different game than what it was then (Function-wise), it's like you took a pile of crap and just molded it into a good thing. How you guys brought the FPS count through the roof is beyond me, because at the time of my last review, I couldn't seem to get anymore than 20-25fps with damn near everything on low. Now it gets up to and remains between 50-60fps at all times, even with being AMD!! I'm proud of how far you guys have gotten with this, so with this entirely different perspective, pick the game up and check it out, I enjoy it greatly now. Keep up the great work you guys!*************EDIT*********************This was my opinion back then.The graphics are pretty, when the FPS doesnt constantly remain below 15, everything else is meh... The inventory system is terrible, on multiple occasions it froze and I couldn't open/move anything. A lot of work to do before I even attempt to play again.. AND YES I KNOW IT""S AN ALPHA, but it's been since October of last year and the inventory is hardly functionable ..			"

								Its early Access, so I dont value the features availlable/not yet availlable.I just want to point out the following:DayZ devs needed two years to implement Trucks - they are quite buggy, laggy and annoying as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.H1Z1 introduced some buildable furnaces, people used them to block entrances (required to delete hive data and start from beginning)Miscreated Dev Team is much smaller compared to the other two giants but: They develope it with concept. Doors are buggy/take a  away too much performance? They removed them, fixed them, introduced them with the next update. They introduced cars as well. Within less time (than dayz) they did some reall stable vehicles in this early access version.The servers are small, and only a few are playing atm, and there is not much to do yet.  I hope this will grow. Because I trust more in these guys here. "

								I'll be blunt. I wanted DayZ, I played almost 500 hours of DayZ before I realized it would never get over 20fps it cities. It would never work. It will never see stable release, and it will never be a working/good game. Fanboys are what is keeping it alive. So I was doing random stuff and I saw this game a few months back, and compared to DayZ, HOLY CRAP YESSSS. Max fps in cities with no drops? Check.Guns work? Check.Loot works? Check.Vehicles? Check.No character Desync and a working voice system? Check Check.And unlike DayZ, the implementation of a new hat doesn't break the servers!It's a working DayZ. That's basically all I needed. I EVEN MET PLAYERS THAT DIDN'T KoS ME BECAUSE NO ONE IS PLAYING WARSIM HERE.Animations are better, everything is better. Everything -works- like it should. Just need more items, but that's coming I'm sure.And holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this update changed everything. It's like playing a whole new, even better game. THAT LIGHTING THO.Miscreated, Y U NO ANNOUNCE THIS GAME TO THE WORLD BETTER SO EVERYONE KNOWS?			"

								My first hour of gameplay: Spawned close to a country house.Looted every house in the near vicinity. Found an axe to chop mutants heads off.Found a bike at one of the houses.Continued on the road into a town called Sultan.Was looting houses when I hear footsteps outside.""Put your hands up and keep them up"" he said.I threw my axe on the ground so I wouldn't get killed.Turns out the guy was nice.We team up.We find him a bike. We are now in a biker gang.We scavenge Sultan until nothing is left. We continue on to next town.In the next town, I find shotgun and pistol.We decide to go on our separate ways. We say goodbye.I keep scavenging for 10 more minutes.I hear gunshots close to me. It's my friend so I go towards him.I get there in time to see him getting shot to death by random guy.I turn the other way without hesitation. 10/10 would watch my friend die again "

								i'm going to share with you something i experienced in this game, which makes me think that this is going to be a good game in the future. > i spawn, and it's night time> i make my way to an airfield to find some loot. needed a gun and a backpack mostly. > found a colt .45 and a backpack, along with food, bandages, etc.> i'm set. i start my journey towards the cities.> on my way, i see flashlights in a house, 2 randoms.> meet a french guy, tells me he's new at this, so we start walking together.> he sees a bright light coming from a tower, so we decide to go there check it out.> on route, we see a lot of light coming from the trees across the river, we get curious, so we make our way there.> we silently make our way towards the light, to find out it is a man made base.> as i sneak towards the base, i lose my new friend in the dark.. that's fine, he's a bambi, can't babysit him. > i find out there are 3 players with high loot building their base in an abandoned outdoor cinema> so i wait. wait to see what kind of players there are.> all of a sudden i see my bambi friend running towards the base, i continue watching.> BANG, he dies. > these aren't friendlies. > it seemed they were patrolling the area making sure nobody was around, i was around. like a ghost in the forest.> one of the bandits makes his way towards the entrance, making him helpless as his teammates are fixing their walls 200 yards away. > i pull out my trusted colt, aim at his damn head, and pop. > the bandits go into alert mode, get into their car, and come booming out towards the entrance.> i make my way backwards behind more trees and i wait. > i'm invisible in the dark, they cannot find me, they keep looking. > then the bandits exit their car to investigate further> and right in that moment, i spot a lone survivor who runs straight for the car. > gets in, bandits start yelling, ""GET OUT OF THE DAMN CAR!"", they were brits. > the lonewolf drives away, running over one of the bandits, and as he drives off with a fully functional car, he says, ""thanks for the car mate"". > and all this, and they had no idea where i was. but i was right next to them, like a ghost.experiences like that are what make me crave these kinds of games. i hope this game remains good, unlike dayz or rust, which in my opinion, when it started, were amazing., but now, it's trash. this game is running well, looks good, feels good.

Early Access Review
								All the bad reviews I've read are talking about how under populated the game is or that there aren't as many mutant npc around. I say it‚Äôs for the best. I think it creates a very real survival feel, I also don't feel as safe when I'm wandering at night because someone could come shoot me if they wanted my stuff. To me it feels like real survival game. you wouldn't run in to people like every 5 min in real life situation like this, and npc enemies wouldn't be just everywhere either. This game has great potential. I would love to see it get popular. The thing that bugs me is people are giving it crap reviews when it‚Äôs not at all a crap game. They see no others and say no thanks and it‚Äôs going to make it less popular given the mixed reviews. So if you are reading this buy it if you realize its early access. There are 12 passionate devs at work here to make the game the best it can be, don't give it ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• reviews while they still building it.EDIT: My god this game is fricken amazing, the devs are awesome too, I went and watched the stream and was able to actually chat with them and ask questions as to why glitches occur and how often they update, they told me they have a lot of stuff coming out! Exciting stuff.So gameplay wise I am on three servers, US 77, 76, 75. All different experiences I must say. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs up: 75: I was wandering and saw a stripped down truck (they are brighter than other abandoned cars and can access their inventory to build again) so okay I start to go look for parts for it and I find a few, as I‚Äôm wandering down the middle of the road like a dumbass I look to my left as I see some movement and there is two guys dressed in all black with rifles pointed at me in the bushes....MOTHER OF GOD. Thankfully they didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me and slowly kept their guns on me and walked away while doing so. After that met another player who was fresh spawn and told him about my car, risky stuff because he could have murdered me and took it when I showed him where it was. We start scavenging parts together and come across another newbie while doing so and he has one the parts we need, he joins...awesome three can easy be super safe in a world of survival. We get all the pieces together and are driving the truck around its ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing amazing. We come across another player and ask him if he wants to join he is a little hesitant but hops on the back of the truck, then we met another guy and he joined. So I‚Äôm rolling around the map with a badass truck and a team of 5 people and we own it. Server did crash and we lost some progress but hey its alpha and those 5 hours were ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing amazing. 76: Play on this server with on buddy, we‚Äôve been to all four towns twice looking for cars as we both had been carrying max weight of parts for it and we were all set up. Two days of looking and we run into some other people....of course they say they don‚Äôt want trouble and that they are friendly, they run down the street while we start raiding a grocery store. My buddy tells me that he hears footsteps, these mofos came back and are trying to murder us while we not paying attention. We get into a 15 minute fire and melee battle with these guys, I go down first and my friend kills another but then he dies. We start all over. = real survival game...I aint even mad. 77: I play solo and record video on this server. Spawn next to river....four people on a boat show up and say they friendly and that they will give me ride to town, I take risk and hop in...BOOM HEADSHOT I die. Respawn and start looting houses turn around and there‚Äôs a geared up guy looking straight at me in the hallway. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• My pants. He‚Äôs nice and gives me a bat with nails and some food. Helps me find more gear and we kill some mutants together. He tells me we going to just stick together and anyone else we will murder and rob....sounds okay I‚Äôve had my fair share of being nice. We walking about and then there is another guy down the street who is mega hesitant to come to us we meet him in middle of street and my new partner is like ""we just want to kill zombies and survive we don‚Äôt rob people"" guys is like sweet first nice people I‚Äôve met. My buddy starts punching him and then I guess us robbing this guy so I chase him with my bat. Enemy pulls out a revolver and two shots me...respawn stay 100% solo and started robbing people with a .22 rifle with no ammo (but they don‚Äôt know that hehe). Needless to say this game is intense, feels real, buy it, if you don‚Äôt like it in 2 hours return it. But don‚Äôt give it crappy reviews while it‚Äôs in alpha. I doubt it will stop these passionate devs but they deserve all the positivity in the world.If you aren‚Äôt convinced yet and need video proof I do make YouTube videos of my adventures with friends in Miscreated. There are a lot of videos in the series, feel free to check it out :) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_uJGecF97sNUrgY6psHpNJ4Z9mJhN2mZ "

Early Access Review
								[EDIT1 at the bottom]To sum this game up in a single word, I would choose ""Potential"".To be 100% truthful, it's not worth the pricetag... Yet.The game has the potential to be somthing spectacular. With over 500 Hours wasted playing ""Nether"", to see it die to hackers, glitches, bugs, a lazy dev team and exploters was something saddening. Miscreated has reignited the spark which I previously had for Nether.The game, for starters, is stunning. The engine used gives us a large, expansive open world (ish, they've cut the size down for  Alpha testing), filled with beatuiful landscapes and detailed cities. One thing which grabbed me is that in the video I watched, I saw houses filled with furniture. Not empty, bland, blank rooms. You actually have to look for things. Items don't just jump out at you... Whilst at the moment, finding food and water is super easy. I'm not a fan of that. Loot does seem to come easy as long as you have your eye out for it.Guns and Weapons. They're limited in varaity but not in quantity... Unfortunately. But with it being in such an early Alpha, the fact that there is only 1 Gun and a small handfull of melee weapons kind of sucks. From what I've been reading is that there are plenty on the way. So far the gun play feels smooth and fluid. It CAN at times feel clunky. It depends on how you're playing.First and Third person. No no no no no no noooooooooooo... If they get rid of Third person then the game would be fantastic. At the moment, Third person is a little buggy. The camera doesn't exactly follow you well and it doesn't provide you with the view you may want at the time. Indoors the Third Person camera just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• itself and cowers up closer to the back of your head, making it difficult to see.Character models are sketchy at best. They may just be basic place holders but holy crap. The mutant does look very... Out dated. But it's alpha. Lots of changes can happen very suddenly.The mutants themselves have very clunky AI. They run at you, lunge with their arms then just run into you. As long as you just AFK wheel backwards, they will NEVER swing for you. You just bash their heads with a hammer or something 5 or 6 times and they die... Not exactly scary or intense... Alpha be alpha.Providing the devs add reasonable items and changes then it should smooth out fine. In a matter of months I see this game looking in a stable spot to start bringing in a larger fan base.If the devs start adding lots of useless things (Like Nether did), without fixing existing errors (Like Nether did), then the game will die. Very fast.I do believe also that people have been troubled when trying to join servers. I have NOT*** experienced any of these problems. Some bloke who shot me in-game told me the servers were fixed. I dunno, i've not had those problems.I recommend you buy the game and play one session. If you don't like it, come back to it after the new year. If you do like it, then keep your eye on the updates (which the devs roll out every week or so). I will update this every now and then, after big updates.[EDIT1] So after playing some more, it crossed my mind that the game is lacking a player-list. Even if it's something simple like ""There are 10 Survivors on this server"". I joined a low-pop (1 other player) to stream some gameplay to a friend when suddenly it became the high-pop.Also, reloading. You have to go into your inventory and swap out the mag. In the heat of the moment going from bang-bang-bang to click-click-click makes my heart drop. It would be great even as a QoL change to add some form of reloading. It could load the magazine with the most amount of ammo in.Something like that.The devs have releaed a long statement today which only brightens the promise this game has. A new rifle, shotgun and more melee weapons. Fantastic. This game right now is headed in the right direction. If the devs ever read this review, then hats off to you guys. 2 Years in the making and you can really see how well their hardwork has paid off.The bugs i have found so far are as follows: - Third Person screws up in closed areas- Some form of unknown action stops you from being able to switch weapons (I think it's swimming)- Some loot underneath small tables spawns out of reach (RIP 30+ Round Magazine for my Pistol)- Some houses are completely empty and have texture glitches (Could just be unfinished houses, not a big deal)- Sometimes when joining a server, you get kicked back to the lobby screen. ***I stated above that I haven't had these problems, but recently it's happened to me once or twice.I haven't come across anything else other than those... Pretty damn good for an early access.Keep up the good work.			"

								I appreciate all the hard work the Devs have been putting into the game. I cannot wait for the new item system and storage. As of right now this game is def worth a buy but please be aware that right now the game is mostly just exploring and PVP.The first 50 hours or so, will be exploring the wonderful, pretty, immersive world that the Devs have created. After that, all you will be doing is walking the map ( or camping a certain spot of the map which is weak, but w/e) for people to shoot. Trust me, I have over 1k hours in the game, and I have been PVPing like crazy. One thing that blows me away in this game is the water Physics. When you shoot the water, you can see it tread, and you can see the bullet wiz through the water. Amazing Yoo. As of right now, I have been laying low on Miscreated playing other survival games just waiting for the new content and storage system. I know for certain once they add storage, Miscreated will once again be my main and favorite game.One thing people need to be aware of is that the game does take a lot to run. It is made off the Crytek engine which is obviously very graphic intensive and harsh on your PC. I mean my GPU which is a 770 OC gets up to 80 C on this game. I can run the game on low settings with 60 FPS (with Frame Drops in towns). Also this game is not very optimized with AMD cards. It will work, but you wont get the best experience out of it.Anyways like I mentioned earlier in my review, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes open world survival PVP games. This game feels like a much much, much more polished up DayZ in almost every way. Just buy it Yoo and support the wonderful, active Devs. This game is going to go a loooong way.Update: Still really enjoying this game with friends. Been waiting for the next patch. The only thing that is holding the game back right now is the various crashing. Very frusterating. Really hope this is addressed in the next patch. Biggest flaw of the game Imo. Looking forward to the future progress of the game :DUpdate: (7/2/16) Patch #36 has arrived with a bunch of new content and gameplay. With this patch released now, the game is blowing up. This means, all the servers are completely full. So far I am really enjoying this patch. Players can now finally store items they scavenge around the world. Although this patch was nearly perfect, it also introduced a major gameplay flaw. At this moment, Melee has recieved a major buff. This basically means, that players can now completely dominate in PVP with various melee weps. In addition, Headshots seem to be turned off right now. I am not sure if this is intended by the Devs, or just a bug. These 2 major flaws have affected PVP greatly, but I have faith the Devs will hopefully reconize the issues and fix them. With that being said let me talk about the big new city.The big new city that was added in the recent patch is outstanding. I mean, it is done very well. I have played loads of survival games out there, and the main city in Miscreated is probably one of the best that I have seen. There is just so much to it and the devs will be unlocking more of it in the near future. The only thing that bothers me is that the city just feel way to big for the player cap on the server. Currently it's 36 slots per server, but I believe the Devs are looking to expand on this sometine in the future. Overall, even though the PVP has taken a big hit this patch, I still am going to reccomend picking this game up. I honestly feel, if the Devs keep this dedication up for the game, Miscreated might be the very few of the genre to move on out of Alpha stage of development.Now wouldn't that be amazing.+1			"

MiscreatedThere are tons of survival games out there, in the market. You can't make up your mind around them. You know what you want, but all of them has some flaws and most of them are in Early Access (some of them have been for ages) or just doesn't fit you right. Hope this review helps you to choose.Some of you might know a certain game called ""Infestation: Survival Stories (a.k.a. WarZ)"", Me and my friends have been playing that game 7/24 back then. But the game has been abandoned for a long time, it was infested with hackers and in-game bugs, developers left the game and it's community to rot etc. You get the picture... Since then, we've been looking for a game like that. I've tried, DayZ and Rust before i find this beautiful game. DayZ was really complicated and wasn't really what i was looking for. About Rust, well, couldn't get used to it and didn't really met my expectations either.So i've finally find Miscreated. The moment i launched the game, i knew that was it! I knew that's what me and my friends been looking for. I told them to buy it immediately (it was also on %50 sale, a week before this review). Until they start, i've just explored and learned about the basics. Met some people in game, looted the towns and cities. It was good fun. But it even got better when my friends joined in. As you can expect from a post-apocalyptic survival game, they're way more fun with friends. Miscreated is an Open World, Survival game. You need to get food, drink and shelter in order to survive. There is also crafting system in the game, which means you'll need to build your own shelter. It'll be tense, scary, rewarding and sometimes funny and i promies that you'll get what you expect from a survival game.There are mutants in the game, instead of zombies, do not expect hordes of them though. It's like maximum 5-8 mutants in a city most of the time, sometimes none. The real challenge will be your communication skills with the other players in this game.Let's hit Pros & Cons:Pros:Decent GraphicsMature CommunityFilled ServersAmazing EnvironmentEasy and Smooth Vehicle ControlsSolid Crafting SystemBase BuildingActive Developers (Streaming & Interacting with the Community)and more...Cons:Weak Graphics OptimizationLack Of Allowed StoragesRearely, Items Disappear On Drop  (when you try to give something to someone)No In-game Map That Shows Your Location (There are maps in the game, but not really that helpfull)Since it's still in Early Access, i can understand those flaws, but it's getting better with each update, and the developers are really active. So i have my hopes up about that it can get even better. If you're looking for a full post-apocalyptic survival experience, get it without having second thoughts. I'd even recommend it for it's full price. It's a beautiful game getting better each day.Thank you, for reading my review about Miscreated. Hope it was helpful and you decided to get the game. Have a nice day. :) "

								Updated Review Aug '15Five months and 270+ hours later if you are interested in a civilian survival game with drivable vehicles,buildable (sic) bases and BEAUTIFUL graphics then this games is a must buy in my opinion. I won't say it's BETTER than DayZ ,H1Z1,Rust or the myriad survival games out there, but it is the game I keep coming back to and am still having fun playing.Original Review Apr '15I'm a big fan of Miscreated and would recommend it even at this early stage of development. I've played and still play DayZ and played and had refunded H1Z1. I even log into Rust every now and again just to, you know, see what craziness is unfolding. What attracted me to Miscreated and I think it's biggest draw is the environment, it's beautiful in the truest sense of the word.  Obviously a game isn't and shouldn't just be about graphics, but in helping with immersion in a post apocalyptic world a rich full environment really helps with the game play. The towns feel overgrown like nature is reclaiming them, everything as a weight and substance about it. It's difficult to describe until you play it. Caveats : It is most definitely an early access game (isn't everything these days). It's not perfect and the developers need to keep up the momentum of development to draw in new players and keep the old players interested and what I've seen they are giving it a good go live streaming, providing regular patches and updating the community. They'll be the first to admit they've had issues most recently network problems and I bought it as these problems were being solved as I saw the developers engaging and informing the community of their progress not just going silent.Conclusion :This isn't just a DayZ / H1Z1 clone and  I think it deserves to be played by more people. I can't think of anywhere I'd rather spend my post apocalyptic time.			"

Early Access Review
								Miscreated can be fun and suspenseful when dealing with other human players since mutants or nature are not significant sources of danger in the game. The environemnts look great and weather effects like rain add beautiful details to the scenery. The game however, is very unstable and often, freezes, crashed and kicks you out of the server (or out of the game) out of the blue. I would recomend waiting until the game is stabilized and better enemies/ai is implemented before playing the game. It has potential but isnt quite there yet.Update: 8 months after i reviewed the game, it is still unstable, bugged and constrantly creashes.			"

								Miscreated has a lot of potential but needs a LOT of work. I'll keep the review short in the form of Pros and Cons,Pros:-Large Open World-Cryengine (Looks gorgeous)-Well thought out inventory space system (Each item from pants to backpacks have their own inventory slots, equiping cargo shorts gives you more storage space than regular jeans.)-Vehicles-Stealth works against other players.Cons:-Learning curve-Difficult Interface-Floating bases (Hoping the devs will improve physics)-Vehicles need more inventory space-Weapons spawn in the same place in particular buildings.-Containers don't exist for looting. (Any gear you find is scattered on the map)Only 7 hours in, with more experience maybe I'll add on to the review. Its more of a PVP than PVE environment. Mutants wont mess with you if you dont get too close.			"

								Here is my story first time i played this game :> Respawn in the middle nowhere> go to the one house in the forest, apparently a big house with a garage > found a Pickup truck on that garage with no spareparts and Gas> Some guy (stranger) come to me and say hi> He was so nice, like a friend of mine> We decide to loot together trying to find the parts for the pickup truck> We met a mutants and fight together, help each other, share jokes, etc> after 1 hours playing we finaly found Gas, Sparkplugs, Battery, Oil for the pickup truck> we head back to the house and we found a bike (just one bike he rode it, i walked) > and then we arrived at that one house and carry the truck together> we decided to go to the city, and we stop in the sultan like house property to get some stuff and gas > after 30 minutes we looted, then came 3 guys with full gear and full weapon talked to us.> we have nothing even guns, so my friends told the 3 guys to join us in the truck > and the truck is just for 4 People in it, he talked to the 3 guys ""I don't know him, i don't even know his name""> the 3 guys shot me right in the head> IM SHOCKED, THAT WAS THE THRILLER DRAMA EVER IN MY ENTIRE SURVIVAL GAMESnote for that one american friend : ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• YOU ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, YOU ARE THE FAKEST GUY I EVER MET. This game is amazing, but it needs to expand the players population make it massive multiplayer online. the whole server is for just 36 people. which is too low for the pop. this game have a lot potential, the weather system, the mutant, the sound effect, environment, the water, the mountain, the base building etc, thats all looks real and beautiful. I support this game and the dev for making a great game. "

Early Access Review
								I've played this almost every day for the past month or so and its a great game with huge potential.It's hard - that may be a put off to some people but working your way around and gathering weapons and equipment to protect yourself plus maybe killing an attacker or two which feels great. Play friendly or play dirty :) More often than not I play the good guy when online gaming so I made an effort in this world to be the bad guy. Why spend ages to loot houses when you can simply steal from your fellow man. The role of the bad guy is essential to this game as it gives the good ""team up"" guys somebody to fight as well as providing loot in a quick manner. The bad element also makes meeting another player a tense scenario - Here is an example of one such meeting I had the other night. Its night, you are in a house searching for bullets to a gun you've found and you notice a flashlight searching a house across the road. Looking at the setup of the road its logical that the person is going to check this house next. You slow to a steady walk to reduce your footsteps in the house to avoid alerting the approaching stranger. Time to think about how this is going to play out - either they kill you or they simply say hello and move on. You know from previous rendezvous that its 70/30 that they will kill you for your loot. You have the upper hand with the dark and the opportunity of ambush, why take the risk? You watch them leave the house while turning off their torch and notice a back pack and a long barrelled weapon slung over the shoulder. Could be plenty of loot carried by this one.. You hear them enter the house and the tell-tale click of the torch, this means no weapon in-hand, another advantage. the mystery person searches the front room, kitchen and dining area and heads for the stairs... He stops as the light makes out a shape at the top of the stairs... We both sit there, me looking at the light of the torch, him looking at my shotgun pointed down the narrow staircase - no way he can dodge the blast at this range. A tentative voice comes over the in-game voice system ""Hey man"" I don't respond immediately... Now he's worried that death is seconds away, the last 30 - 40 minutes of him searching for loot could be wasted in this meeting in the dark. I know that if his flashlight switches off he has pulled a gun.. The moment is tense, I finally speak 'Got any ammo for the 1911 .45?'. He responds with a glimmer of hope 'Yeah sure, just don't shoot - I'll drop some at the bottom of the stairs on my way out' He back away still pointing the light my way until he reaches the hallway. His light then clicks off and he runs out the house, clearly not stopping to leave me any ammo. I realise then that I am still being to kind to these people and that I should have taken it in the stairway when I had the chance. Now he has the advantage, he knows I'm there he knows I have only one exit from the house. No point in searching the rest of this house now, not with the sense that I'm being watched. I wait for a minute to try to listen for footsteps - but nothing. I pull out a smoke grenade and slowly creep down the stairs so I can see the exit of the house, I toss the grenade so it will land just outside and let the smoke fill out before I run, out the door way and take an immediate right. Boom! a shotgun blast clips me and I'm bleeding. Can't stop now to attach a bandage, need to escape, I keep running, avoiding a straight path as much as possible weaving my way through gardens and round fences to avoid the killer behind me. I can hear the footsteps running to where he last saw me. I find a collection of bins and boxes next to a house and crouch to hide. I hear him come closer. He stops moving... tense again. I quickly apply a bandage and wait. Nothing, silence. He knows I've stopped and he is waiting for me to make the first move. I pull out my newly crafted pipe bomb and make a quick judgement on where I think he's stopped based on where I last heard him. I throw it. He realises what's happening and starts to run..., BOOM! Silence again, nothing, no sound. I wait for what feels like ages. I have to start moving now as I can't sit here all night. I equip my shotgun and approach his last know location. He's dead - I can see his prone body in the dark. I run up to it to search it for loot and BINGO! 1911 ammo :)These are the types of scenarios that occur in this game everytime I play it, Sometimes I'm on the receiving end and lose all my loot that I have gathered for the past 30 - 40 mins but I know its give and take. Plus I should have done something different to avoid the death in the first place :)There is alot yet to improve on in this game but they are making progress. Remember its early access, alot of the reviews write it off without having this in mind.Well worth the price tag! "

								Miscreated is a great game that gets many of the core mechanics of a good survival multiplayer game just right. The world is beautiful and rich, and still being improved and expanded in updates. Cities, woods, rivers, caves, fallout shelters and unique landmarks give the player a lot of things to explore.The gameplay is very solid, movement and gun behaviour feel good. The freeform basebuilding gives players a lot of room to experiment and create their own unique bases.			"

								""Don't shoot! I'm friendly!""Oh please. I was eating beans before you had even spawned.I bought Miscreated from -50% sale, thought to myself ""Sure, it's been on my wishlist for a long time now. Why not?""I wasn't expecting much since I've been crawling through all sorts of survival games in the past and they all seem to revolve around the same idea:	- Major catastrophic scenario / Post Apocalypse	- Hunger, thirst, weapons	- More PvP than PvE	- Zombies / MutantsAnd Miscreated fits right in there. You are a survivor, scavenging for gear, food and crafting materials - trying to make the best out of a bad situation. You're surrounded by mutants and other players, also known as ""the bandits"". I know, I know. There are good guys there too. (until you give them a weapon and accidentally turn your back on them)


Oh, invite accepted!¬†

Hells, we've all seen this scenario by now. What makes this game different from that one certain zombie mod over a war simulation game or it's standalone offspring, is that Miscreated is actually built just for this. It's not a ""somewhat working"" adaptation of some other game and it feels damn good to play a zombie survival game that actually has a fluent inventory system, very nice graphics and great performance all around.The world seems detailed, the ambient sounds, light and shadow effects etc. but as I'm writing this (December 2016) it's still missing the wildlife, weather system and the ""feel of danger"". The world feels huge and the current player cap of 36 players feels very low on such a big place. It almost feels like you need a drop of luck to even see another player, though I guess that makes to post apoc feel more like, well post apoc.


The fog is getting thicker and I hear creatures howling somewhere near.¬†

Your only actual threat at the moment are the other players - there's only a few squishy mutants walking around and you see them quite rarely. I did see some bigger tankish variations too but only once. I'm optimistic these things will get more attention in later development. There's enough of different types of gear, clothing, vehicles and gunporn in game already which makes Miscreated in it's current state very much playable and enjoyable. Oh, and from what I've gathered you make a character into a server and it stays on that server. Take that fools! There is no server hopping, moving into a good position, then switching on to another server to grind the same loot over and over again.


Neat puddle. Time to fill up my canteens!¬†

--Of course the game is nowhere near complete being in early access, but I do see a lot of potential in it already. From what I've seen and tested, many of the mechanics in game at the moment do work nicely and the vehicles & base building is a nice addition too. I'm eagerly waiting for more content to the game.If you're a survival game fanatic like me and like to see the sights before the riffraff settles in, I think now is the perfect opportunity to give this game a spin - and for a wallet friendly -50% price!

Early Access Review
								I got this game with my friends after playing H1Z1 & looking for something new.Is has it's flaws, mostly glitchy issues - no point denying those, but if you can expect problems and the occasional unplayable phase that come with this games Early Access, then you shouldn't be too disappointed.Overall:   It's another open-world, survival, post-apocalyptic world with diverse crafting. Plenty to explore on a large-scale map with a number of civilization ""hotspots"" being a few medium sized towns to loot, with smaller hamlets, structures or camps spread throughout.     Gameplay is dynamic in the sense that you must look to find items hiding within the game world in order to take them (sometimes well hidden, or blending in with the look of the surround area) and not simply point at a bunch of cupboards and click to 'search'.     Basebuilding is similar in that there is (currently) no Snap-Too function, moving your character and your camera angles around you decide where to place different base parts freely, so long as the placeable template allows.    No Zombies - in keeping with the games background story; ""Mutants"" are your AI enemy, they are fast, they hit hard, but they're not indestructable if you own a gun - with ammunition.Negatives:  The server issues are definitely a pain, the Devs are working on various networking issues both for in-game item synchronisation and connectivity. However meanwhile, expect there to be various times your unable to connect to your desired server.  No storage currently. Although this is definitely planned for the future, they intend to stabilise the network before implementing this. Meaning your pockets and inventory slots are all you have to store items in, providing you don't exceed your carrying weight of 40Kg. There are rare cars throughout which can store items, if your able to obtain one and hide it.Item synch - as mentioned, there are some issues which can sometimes cause your loot to despawn should you attempt to drop it out of your bags temporarily, or pass it to another player.Positives:  The game looks and feels beautiful, with even further plans to update the realistic graphics on the next game engine's update.  The Devs are active, and open about their progress. Roughly each month they have an hour long stream or so revealing planned updates and explanations on progress thus far.  There is a background story, not much has been disclosed but there is evidence around, messages left, and the general feeling of what went on starts to build. This definitely makes the game feel it has more depth, and helps the world come alive.  Just generally the game is good fun. Mutants pose enough of a threat to be a cause for concern, PvP'ers the same when entering larger towns. Loot isn't too scarce depending on whether somebody's looted your area recently. There's a variety of clothes, melee weapons and guns to gear up. Crafting recipes are ""learnable"" if you can find them, and you don't lose any new guides you've learnt by dying.Summary:  I definitely would recommend this game to people who enjoy a similar genre. It seems this game is still slightly under the radar, but easily has the potential and direction of becoming a serious contender - both with gameplay and looks.P.S:  This is the first i've reviewed a game, so I hope it was helpful. Goodluck out there!			"

								Miscreated is one of the best open world apocalyptic survival games out now. Its basically DayZ with mutants of different kinds instead of zombies, and theres base building. Its not quite as far in development right now as DayZ, nor is the map nearly as big yet. (The devs have promised that more map area is coming.) However, the setting is very well thought out, with plenty of overgrowth and decay, as one should expect in a world decades after WW3 has left the Earth devastated by nuclear war. And best of all, it takes place in the good ol' USA, so all the signs are in ENGLISH! (Yay!)With the recent AI update, the mutants have become a lot smarter, more animated, and more threatening. This is GOOD for anyone who is up for some challenging PvE action. The hope is that the more threatening mutant encounters will clear out some of the ever present and abundant KoS bandits (present in any and all games of this type) by encouraging a more PvE friendly atmosphere which requires some teamwork.Review Update: 5/21/16That last review I posted after one of the initial AI updates, when there was a $#!+ ton of mutants and I was one of the last survivors still playing. Understandably, there is less desire to start playing a game with such a high failure rate due to overwhelming computer generated opposition. Only the most experienced were able to survive.Since then, the mutant numbers have been toned down and there are a lot of people playing again. It is nice to see players again who are pairing/grouping up and surviving. The PvP aspect of this game has always been good. Its a lot more close quarters combat than some other similar games since there are not so many scoped rifles and there is a lot of nice overgrowth to hide in. So, still a thumbs up from me. Miscreated is a must buy for the survival 1pp/3pp shooter enthusiast.Review Update: 9/11/2016I have to add to this review since this game is so great. Miscreated is the BEST DEVELOPED open sandbox, post-apocolyptic game out now. The devs drop huge updates regularly. The map has grown a lot. Weapons/items usability improved. Computer AI improved. New enemies. New vehicles. Crafting improved (and learned craft guides are persistent after death and server wipe/patch updates - I have verified this myself!) They add so much detail, the graphics and setting are truly impressive and totally immersive into the game world. I love the new downtown buildings and interactive environment (at a few key locations only right now). Firefights inside of skyscrapers are a blast! The new wolf packs are a real threat in the forest... I could go on and on... And the price is so low compared to other games of this quality. Miscreated is a must buy for sure (more so now than ever)!Also, you should vote for them on CRYENGINE's website so they can get more funding to make the game even better:https://www.cryengine.com/development-fund/projects/miscreated(No, I don't know the devs, but if I could I would give them my kudos on a well made game. I'm just a survival game enthusiast who loves fun games - just check my other game reviews to see whats good out there.)			"

Early Access Review
								DISCLAIMER: This is all first impressions. I realize the game came out in Early Access on Steam only a couple days ago. I will edit my ""review"" accordingly as updates inevitably come out.Obviously heavily inspired by many survival games like it, Miscreated takes the current trend of Early Access multiplayer titles and makes sure to impress with what it can do with so little.First off, I don't care if it really isn't relevant, but the main menu music I absolutely love. Sad, but slightly haunting. It's a great track.You probably know by now, this was made with the Cryengine, an amazing engine capable of gorgeous, but still well optimized visuals. This definetely has the key visuals of a game made with the Cryengine. Beautiful water effects and high res textures, pleasant lighting, and reflections. EVERYTHING has reflections. Water, puddles, oil leaks, oil barrels, picture frames, shower tiles. While they might not be very obvious, if you really pay attention, the detail is there. It's not very practical in any real way, but it looks nice most of the time.This game immedietly packs a few weather effects, such as rain, clear skies, and heavy fog. It needs tweaking to look truly gorgeous.Almost every building currently in the game is enterable, even this early in development. Most of them also are fully furnished, but a bit copy and paste. They get the job done for now, especially since the loot system relies on hiding items in cupboards, fridges, tables, cabinets, etc.Speaking of loot, from what I've seen it's lacking as I type. I've searched the entire map twice (entire map being all the points of interest, rather than every inch of forest) and found a hatchet, a hammer, and three 9mm pistols. (EDIT 1/16/2015: There has been a recent patch that has added numerous weapons to the loot table. This include a shotgun, a .357, a .22 rifle, and a  .223 rifle, as well as several different melee weapons.) Other than that there are several different kinds of soda, a few various kinds of canned food, some rad meds, and bandages. There are also stone, nails, wood, and other small things to use in a vague crafting system. Finally, there are small various bits of clothing.Your loot may vary though. I'm not fully aware of how loot is spawned, or if it is based on how many players are in the server. Perhaps some more playtime will clear that up, but as of right now playing on a server of about 15 people for a few hours, I found very little of use other than food.Combat is basic, but functional. The pistol I found fires, but there's little impact or satisfaction from doing so. Melee weapons are a bit floaty as well. Combat isn't very inspiring, but it is functional.I emptied a full 10 bullet clip into my partner however for testing, and despite most shots seeming to hit his head, he didn't die. Either it was just buggy at that point, or the pistol is underpowered. Player interaction this early on is to be expected. I've come across mostly unequipped, cautious players just trying to get a feel for their surroundings in this new game. I only encountered one hostile player, who saw me in a house, 100% unarmed, motionless, and began to whack me with a hammer at which point I shortly died.Personally, I rarely attack anyone, especially if they aren't obviously equipped. Last night while playing I ran into 5 players, none of which had any equipment, and one of them even followed my small group for awhile.As for other enemies, there are very, very few scattered zombie like enemies. They aren't very threatening this early on, and mainly seem to serve as place holders. Their AI is weak, and there's only the one enemy at this point. I was able to outrun one and enter a house, at which point the zombie freaked out, ran around the entire house once, tried the door again, and then ran off nowhere to be found again.As for content in general, there isn't that much. What it does have is much more promising than most other survival games I've seen. It has some decent bones. Only time will tell if the game will really unlock its full potential.My suggestion, as well as many others, wait a few patches. Let them add more weapons, enemies, and bug fixes. There are NO rebindable keys in game, which is stupid for any game on PC. Some of the default keybinds don't even make much sense.You can't drown as far as I can tell. My partner and I decided to jump from a small bridge into the ocean for fun, at which point my partner exclaims in fear that he saw another person just floating in the water that wasn't me. Turns out it was a guy, just creepily chilling under the water for who knows how long. $25 just seems like just over the line for the value this game offers right now. It's not too outrageously priced, but you can buy other survival games with more content for equal or cheaper. Overall, I give this game a thumbs up, but only because it shows a lot of promise. It certainly needs work, and that's to be expected.PC performance:It's alright. Again, it's a Cryengine game, which usually always perform well. It's very CPU intensive though. My aftermarket CPU fan really kicks on with this game, so much that I can slightly hear it through my headset.There are a few framerate drops in towns, and even a few random ones that don't seem to make too much sense. I'm running an overclocked 780ti and overclocked AMD 8350 with 16 GB of RAM, and I get about 45-60 FPS in towns, and it dips all over the place when you spin the camera around.Sometimes I'll randomly get drops to 30 FPS for ten seconds and then it will go back up above 60. Hopefully optimization is high up on the list of things to work on. No point in even trying the game if it runs terrible.EDIT 11/2/2014: They used puns in their patch notes. Best developer ever. Support this game.			"

								I can't believe this game has mixed reviews! This game is one of the best survival games I have played! Miscreated makes you really feel that you are surviving. The environment is really breathtaking! The reason why i said this game makes you feel like your suriving is that i was in a farming vehicle(which it has a pully on the back of it, so i hope they may implement something you can pull another vehicle or trailer) and i was driving in the road while my cousin was gathering things from the houses. To me that feels like suviving and working together which gives you the survival feel! Dayz, Rust, and Ark  will not compare to this game because for the simple fact that i found a game that wont have c4 or rocket launchers in it! Great game and people need to play it!			"

								 The server I was playing on had to restart, so I parked my car in a field under the bright, sun lit sky and planted my land claim so when I came back the car would still be there. When the server came back up it was night and the cars tank was empty. No problem, I thought, I'll go to the town down the road and find some gas. It's pitch black save for a little moon light. As I make my way past a small bridge dimly lit by yellow barricade, I see somthing scurry across the road in the distance. I figured it was the graphics poping up as I move, the game is still in alpha. I find two small military tents and proceed to loot them with my flickering flashlight for any gas or oil. With the headphones on the tent tends to sound like footsteps when blowing in the wind. I've learned to ignore it. But this time it wasn't the tent. As I turned my light to the enterence I see five to six alpha phase wolves running right at me almost dead silent from the darkness. I havent felt this kind of panic in a game in maybe 15 years. I frantically smashed my keyboard hopeing one of the keys I hit explodes everything around the tent saving me from the onslaught bolting right at me, no good. In all the jumping and running I somehow managed to get on top of a truck and escape the now verry loud pack of mutant wolf dogs. I can't wait to see what they do with this game in the future.  "

Early Access Review
								Since it is an early access game, it is hard to review since it is not final. So, I will list some current pros and cons!Let's start with the pros!---Pros---~Frequent updates!~New content added often (some content-vehicles-were added faster than it took to add them in DayZ!)~Amazing graphics! (OFC, Cryengine)~Fluid animations.~Smooth gameplay mechanics.~The mutants (NPC enemies) are actually a pretty big threat, unlike in DayZ, and they look sick!~Map is pretty big (not HUGE, but big)~Lots of gear (cosmetics, weapons, etc)~The devs actually CARE and LISTEN (unlike DayZ, once again)~I haven't encountered a single hacker, and neither have any of my friends who play.~Server sync! If you have gear on one server, it transfers to all other servers!---Cons---~Performance. It runs fine (medium-low) on a mid range PC, but if you wanna max it out you'll need a pretty nice PC. (I max it out on a GTX 780 SC paired with an i7 4790k, also OC'd. I get a consistent 60 fps on ultra with SMAA, only an occasional drop to around 55 fps when entering a large area.~Lack of players. However, I have seen an increase players recently.~Price. In my opinion, it is worth $25. However, there are some performance issues for lower end PCs and the lack of players might veer you away for that price.~SOME lack of content. Crafting is a bit weird and you can't craft much ATM, but that's okay with me.---------------------All in all, I would recommend this game. It has a lot more going for it than against it, in my opinion. I think it deserves more credit than DayZ for sure, because the devs here CARE, LISTEN, and ACTUALLY WORK towards a finished product.

								Miscreated is just really and underrated game. The whole atmosphere feels much more like an apocalypse compared to DayZ and H1Z1. It's nice to have mutans instead of your traditional ''zombie'' and the animations for guns, and stuff on your back is just sooooo good! Thumps up for these guys, they are really doing an amazing job to make a fantastic game!			"

								Now let me tell you a story about my first experience with the game:Me and my friend ran through a city, after an intense hour of searching we came to a motel. Reluctantly I went inside, and my friend stayed back to cover my escape. I went to a room looking for some supplies, but when I went to the bathroom. I saw something that still haunts me, a man sitting in the tub with a shotgun. Quickly, I turned around and screamed. Destroying my friends hearing in the process.I nimbly jumped down five feet to safety, and broke my leg. My character was in agonizing pain, but I ran for my life. Behind me I heard the echoing sounds of bullets being fired, but that didn't stop a ""brave"" man. The sound of bullets were suppressed by my cries for help. In the distance I saw my friend standing behind a wall, and I knew that safety was within my grasp.I dodged the bullets with swift action (and a little bit of luck). I ran behind my friend and thought the event was over, but little did I know. I heard a quick swoosh and the crunching sound of bullet hitting skull. My friend fell down in front of me, struck down by a sniper hiding in the city. My broken leg would have to wait, because now it was time to survive. I had to leave him for the roaches, and I ran into the forest. Leaving the little bit of humanity I had left in the process. My leg hurt more and more, but the reality of the situation pushed me on. I hastily threw myself down in a bush, and started to work on my broken leg.I patched up my leg, and I was relieved. I was sure that this day would be my last, but again I had fought and beaten the odds. I rummaged through my backpack, looking for something to eat. All I had was a chocolate bar, and some water. I stood up and began to feast, thinking back at what I lost and silently wept. Then I heard the sound of my faith, the echoing drum of death was closing in. Played through a cheap headset, getting closer every second. My entire excistence was filled with the sound of ""You can't see me"". His punches were swift, and death came within seconds. The last thing I saw was his crotch leaning down on my face. I didn't see the heavens gate, but instead I saw balls. I didn't hear the choir of the angels, but I heard terrible rap music. I did not feel joy, but only suffering. I knew that I had been defeated at last. Looks like I wasn't that lucky after all...I rate this game 10/10. Would love to get traumatized again			"

								I admit it, I bought the game before and I asked for a steam refund after a few hours, cause it seemed like another survivor game.Shame on me,Its not.Miscreated is unique, it has a lot of potential, the graphics are very very enjoyable and the each part of the map was created with love. We can see that in the tiny details at every corner all around the map. Every house is different and that makes the loot more challenging and the play experience less boring and more immersive. The art work and the graffiti are just fabulous. The weather system, with the rain and storms are something else, I hope we can see rain and temperature to have real impact on playersI hope, to see more content added in the near future. There are a lot of room for the game to grow. With more weapons and tools to craft, more caves to explore and better bases to build. I wish the map gets even bigger and the mutants get more frequents and spread around the territory. I hope to see more to improve cooperation and the PVE aspect, and the survival part. Personally I dont care much for the PVP part. There are other games for that.The devs seem to have constant updates and the relations with their fan bases seems close and constant. Thats always a plus. Keep up with the good jobs guys.			"

								The bad reviews complaining about this game are hilarious to me. All I read is :I can't find loot- There is loot everywhere from right in front of your face to little crevices.I have to use a flashlight- Yeah dummy its pitch black with no lights on.. You need a flashlightI keep getting pvp'ed - Yup youre playing a game that has people running around the map looking for guns to shoot you with. You're gonna get shot at.The controls suck- The  controls are actually pretty good with very few exceptions. These are complaints that point to either not taking time to learn the game or they just plain suck at a game like this.I understand that it's frustrating to collect for hours to be killed and lose it all but THAT is what this game CAN be. Don't run around willy nilly and get shot. Sneak around and be more careful. The bad reviews this game gets are mosly complaints about their own abilities rather than the games problems themselves.I would recommend this game highly to anyone that enjoys these types of games.. It's by far the best in this genre.			"

								I dont often do long reviews but here it goes.....I am a huge survival genre fan and after my disappointing experiences with DayZ Stand Alone I was super excited about H1Z1 and again my hopes and dreams were shattered upon seeing videos of insane PvP and P2w and hackers in that game.. Si went back to Arma 3, and waited for a true survival game, and then I was watching twitch streams and stumbled upon this Gem!!!!!Miscreated is Polished, and optimized , and an absolute blast to play! It creates fear at night and a sense of urgency during the day! I would say that 80% of the players are semi-friendly, but it is the apocalypse and trust must be earned! The Cry engine is Gorgeous! The details create an incredible sense of immersion! With all alpha games there are a few bugs, but the Dev's and thier spouses are extremely active and helpful! This game is a MUST HAVE!!!!!  10/10			"

Promising Co-Op Survival Sandbox // Solo players tread cautiously. ""So that's it, we're done..civilization is taking a breather. Anyone alive in 2089 that isn't mutated yet is just focused on staying that way.""Miscreated is a gripping survival horror game (heavy emphasis on survival, moderate emphasis on horror) that offers a satisfying experience if played co-op, but offers a somewhat slow and tedious struggle if played alone.The premise of the game is like any other in the genre: you're thrust upon a lawless land, forced to scavenge for yourself and build a base to protect not only your life but all the loot you've amassed on your travels through the map; fail to do that and, well, in the words of Cloud Atlas: ""The weak are meat the strong will eat.""Unfortunately, this is where the game shows that is more co-op friendly instead of a casual survivor sim like The Forest. Scavenging loot, gear, and weapons are easy enough, but when it comes to actually locking down a place to build and craft a fort, things become a bit more arduous and annoying. You will spend some time trying to find a decent area to build (and these would be around the main town or the military base) due to the distance restriction on placing plot signs (200m away from one another). I forgot to mention, however, that you'll be spending a LOT more time crafting your base components. Foundation by foundation, small tiny wall piece by tiny wall piece, you will painstakingly craft a base in an hour, what would have only taken you about 15 minutes in a solo session of Rust. This is because: you can't close the inventory window while crafting (so running around while your player crafts passively in the background is a no-go), and harvesting resources + crafting base components is time consuming. You will constantly be going from your base point to your resource point due to item weight, and only being able to carry about 1-1.5 building items at a time (so you can only craft 1 foundation and get maybe a quarter to half of the parts for another foundation piece before you are forced to run back to base to place your wall/foundation/door before you can harvest anymore resources) means you will spend a third of your base building time traveling. If you're doing this without a vehicle, it can get pretty old. Which leads me to the fact that...It's a daunting task building a base in this game as a solo player. Usually after something requiring such effort, there's a sense of satisfaction or reward. However, I felt more annoyed than anything. Placing 2 Foundations, 8 walls, 2 more foundations for roofing, a door and 2 mini-walls for a door frame (there is no doorframe blueprint yet, or I've not found it if there is) took me quite a long time. Compound this with the fact that there is no chest available to you + items despawn when thrown on the ground in your base, you can't really help but feel that base building is just completely pointless. With vehicles, getting them to run is just as tasking. There are numerous carparts required, many of which are high in weight so carrying only 1 or 2 primary items at a time is possible. This is understandable, but as a solo player this can mean taking a good hour or so finding everything required just to get a vehicle up and running. All the while, you have to make sure another player doesn't come along and snipe you, the car your working on, or the parts you've placed inside it. You can start to see why playing this solo can be cumbersome and stressful. The game even says it in grafitti on walls throughout the world: ""Live in groups or die alone!Combine the time consumption of base building + difficulty of vehicle repair + weapon penetration (your base walls/doors/roofs/foundations can be shot through with very low damage mitigation) and it all equates to a very brutal solo playing experience. However, playing it with a group of people is very rewarding and much more enjoyable. Guarding a build site while your friends are harvesting and crafting, going on scouting missions for vehicle parts while someone is protecting the vehicle, Recon'ing in Pinecrest spotting enemy survivors to kill for loot...group play opens up a very tangible and immersive survival experience not found in single player. If you are into base building but don't have a group to play with, this game will offer you what you seek but will take a bit more effort and may cause some spastic anger outbursts when you die, lose your hatchet, and end up searching an hour again for another one. You can definitely have fun with finding other survivors to kill, but for long term playability, a group is a must.One of the better EA survival titles available with an active development team and growing community.. don't pass on Miscreated if you're a survival sandbox fan. It is worth every dollar of the early access price. "

Early Access Review
								Having played most of the more ""known"" open-world zombie survival games (H1Z1, 7 Days to Die, Project Zomboid, etc.), I was pretty skeptical coming into Miscreated; especially considering it's current Mixed review rating. But having played around with it for ~4 hours already, I can tell that this is definitely one of the more polished, immersive, and focused, ""zombie"" (mutants) survival games. Graphically, the game is unmatched in the world of Early Access survival games. The Crytek engine has always been able to make games look great, but it's the art direction this game has, specifically, that makes it stand out. Referring to something like H1Z1, you'll notice that the world in that game simply does not look like it's been hit by a zombie virus. The world is clean and has a very bland, uninspired art design. Miscreated, thankfully, understands that just because you're in EA doesn't mean you can't look great at the same time. Scavenging through buildings feels creepy (particularly at night), and the world is both bright and beautiful, but dreary and destroyed. I would actually say it's closest counterpart- at least visually, would be Fallout 4's art style.Gameplay-wise, if you've played other zombie survival games, you'll have a general idea of what to expect here. You roam an open map, searching through buildings and rubble looking for supplies to stay healthy and armed to defend yourself. The scavenging in the game is very immersive, and thankfully avoids throwing menu after menu at you while playing. Looking at games like H1Z1 or 7 Days To Die, they both have ""loot tables"", meaning you'll spend most of your scavenging time clicking on containers, waiting a couple seconds, and then seeing what the game spawned in the menu that pops up. Miscreated actually loads all its items in as physical objects in the world, so you spend very, very little time looking at menus and loot tables, and instead spend your time feeling directly connected to the world looking for loot in half-opened cupboards or on shelves, etc.The only real issue I have, gameplay-wise, with the game right now, is that combat feels just as clunky as any other survival game that I have played. Melee attacks feel light and it can be hard to tell when you've even hit an enemy at all. This is something I hope to see addressed very soon by the devs, as the overall polish that this game has feels counter to the fairly lackluster combat.But, overall, this is an excellent ""zombie"" survival game that looks and plays great, and most importantly, is being very actively developed. A quick look at the update logs for this game will show you that at most, around every 3 weeks, the devs will drop a large content patch to the community with pretty significant improvements. This is what hurts so many survival games in general. It's what has killed my interest in games such as H1Z1, Project Zomboid, etc. An Early Access game that feels like it is constantly evolving for the better is a rare find on Steam, and I would suggest not letting Miscreated be an EA game to pass you by if the premise of an immersive, open-world, survival game, sounds right for you.

Early Access Review
								This game absolutely has a HUGE POTENTIAL. Possibly the best survival being MADE. Very polished early access game! doesnt seems to be in alpha! This game is really fabulous! EPIC BASEBUILDING, IMMERSIVE GAMEPLAY, EPIC SURVIVAL. Really much BETTER than DAYZ.. or similars like H1Z1 or RUST.  CryEngine3 is f***ing AWESOME! Developers team working hard with updates constantly!I can say it is BEST EARLY ACCESS game your money can buy. Forget about ARK, RUST, H1Z1.. they are s**t when you compare them to miscreated! Miscreated is a game muuuuuuuch more polished.I appreciated very good times playing this game, had a lot of fun trying to kill other people, surviving and building my base. So I recommend it. 10/10 OBS: The game now is more PVP than PVE. Zombies are not totally implemented yet, they are not a risk to surviving.ITS A MUST HAVE IF YOU LIKE SURVIVAL EXPERIENCES.------------------------------------------------------------ENGINE:   CRYENGINE 3 is a VERY good engine. Its not a heavy engine for the graphics it offers. Graphics are MUCH BETTER than H1Z1 or DayZ, and CRYENGINE is also lighter. I could run it with a ATI HD 5850 1GB/256bits (and Core 2 Quad) in 720p on medium with AA 1x TXAA, with 20-30fps.UPDATE 2016:   Running well, 1080p 35fps with high settings 2x TXAA with a NVDIA GTX 760 2GB and i5 4570 3.2ghz! At 900p runs 45fps and 720p runs 60fps, with VERY HIGH SETTINGS and plus anti-analiasing FXAA (ON) and MSAA 8x ( both activated in nvdia control panel). Graphics pretty good!!DETAILS IN GAME:    The intern environmment of the houses are good detailed. Better than other survivals. And you really need to search for the things inside the houses. On the floor, inside the cabinet, inside the drawer, over the refrigerator, on the table, on the chair, on the bed. You can easily pass through a item without seeing it if you are not payin atention. Realistic. Very cool. Also the cenary outside looks pretty good,, forests, fields, and cities. Amazining weather system, sun lights, shadows in the cenary!!MAP:    a lot of houses, just 1 military base, some fuel stations, and some supermarkets and stores. but there arent hospitals, pharmacys, weapon stores, police stations, shopping centers, fireman stations, subway, train station, airport or seaport, bases and other places that exists in real world. Please add them to make the game more realistics. The map is still being developed, but at the moment the map is not big as DAYZ and H1Z1. For a good survival game the map must be really LARGE. Developers, please keep working on it.  Sound of enviroment also needs to be improved!UPDATE 07/2016:    New big town with new buildings. Patch 60 also includes a storage system with tents and crafted boxes.. Town is not completely done, but they are working on it!!MAX PLAYERS:   Negative POINT is at the moment MAX PLAYERS per map are 36 PLAYERS ! Could Be 50 players..CARS AND OTHERS: there are only 2 type of cars (car and truck). But could be more. Also IT WOULD BE REALLY ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING AMAZING if the developers added some elements used like in ARMA II DAYZ MOD...  PLEASE WE NEED Motorcycles, bicycle, helicopters, airplanes and others. ITS really important to game become fun and more realistic. Horses and bicycles CAN be an easy way to game dont become a walking simulator. UPDATE 2016: they are providing a new truck and bycicle, but both still being testedCRAFTING:  just Basebuilding!! There is no other usefull things to craft at the moment. Developers please work on this.. MUTANTS: AI of mutants are sad !!! You just get up in a car and mutants stop chasing you. WTF man? lastwise they could be like the zombies in walking dead (Persistents). Please developers work on it. They dosnt hear sounds. the Most of the places there is no mutants. . Also please work on NEW TYPE of mutants ( cause there is only 1 at the moment), would be very cool if you could not predict what kind of mutant you are gonna find on your way (Left4Dead 2 has 4 different types, and this game was done in 2009). Sometimes it becomes boring very easily. You dont take frights with them. To improve it would be very cool find mutants locked inside rooms or houses, or a swarm of mutants suddenly in the forest or inside a building. You know, like in THE WALKING DEAD SERIES man. They should be attracted by noise, light, or smell of animal meat being roasted on a camp fire inside your base. It would be very cool if a swarm of mutants could attack your base due to these reasons, suddenly. THE WAY IT IS AT THE MOMENT, mutants cause no fear and are not a risk for anyone. The deers in game escapes from the mutants, and they dont even need to run to escape.UPDATE: They are working on AI system of the game. Updates are coming..BASE BUILDING: EPIC BASEBUILDING. I HOPE THE DEVELOPERS KEEP WORKING HARD ON IT! Has a huge potential with the CRYENGINE... Its an important aspect of the new generation of  SURVIVAL GAMES. Please developers WORK HARD!! Check ARMA II DayZ mod, this game has a very interesting way of building bases. Please follow some elements.WEATHER: Weather system really cool! really awesome!! with storms, twists, fog..  very realistic effects!HUNTING: WHY CANT I HUNT AND COOK THE MEAT?  I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS A REALISTIC HARDCORE SURVIVAL. I dont like to eat canned meat everyday man, and virtually this is the only thing you eat in game!! So would be interesting if i COULD FISH, HUNT DEERS OR OTHER ANIMALS, AND THEN COOK THE MEAT IN A CAMP FIRE. With salt we could dehydrate the meat to leat later. PICK FRUIT also would be cool.EFFECTS: THE GAME COULD HAVE SOME EFFECTS LIKE THE MOVEMENT OF DRINKING WATER OF EATING FOOD OR USING A BANDAGE ON A INJURY. DayZ has this effects, are very cool and the game become more realisticBUGS: sometimes it crashs			"

								I found this game to be very immersive. Attention to detail really shows in Miscreated, with nearly every building in the generously-sized map accessible and full of personality. You'll find residential neighborhoods, industrial areas and warehouses, office buildings, apartments, restaurants, auto shops, an airfield & police station, to name a few... and inbetween, a cohesive road system complete with signage. Repairing vehicles is a must to take full advantage and appreciate these highways. The same craftsmanship is evident in the rural parts of the map. There are rivers with realistic currents that sweep objects downstream, forests with packs of wolves and other animals, and lush, hilly fields covering the landscape. The weather is a sight to behold - storms feel real, and once in a while, you'll be able to spot a tornado swirling about, which can prove dangerous if you're in its path. Can't applaud the atmosphere enough, it really is lovely.As for the scarier side of the game: mutants roam the island, and they'll bop you one. They're easily outrun. It's actually other players that pose the biggest threat to you in Miscreated. Players are constantly hunting for weaponry and supplies - this can also mean YOUR weaponry and supplies. With a minimum 30-second wait before disconnecting from a server, it's unlikely that you're going to escape an encounter with another player without some effort put into either fighting or interacting in another way. Conversation isn't uncommon. Many players will happily part ways with you after a short chat or barter. Others will rob you at gunpoint. Some will simply shoot you on sight. Whatever the case, running into another player is certainly exciting.Great game! It's come a long way, from what I hear... I showed up late to the party, but I'm glad I did.  Good times.			"

								So, I'm running around an abandoned trailer park. I see out of the corner of my eye, a bright orange pickup truck with no wheels on it. I approach the truck, and check the engine to see if it is in working order, which it happens to be. Meanwhile, I am greeted by another player. Really nice guy, offers me some refreshments, which I kindly deny, and asks me very politely to leave the car alone as he was looking for some wheels to make it move faster. I agree and he leaves the area. At this point its only me, the truck, and my suicidal thoughts. I hop in the truck, and turn the engine on. The truck is very slow due to the lack of tires, however, I'm making good time. I see the owner of the vehicle and I have no choice but to drive the car away from him. His running speed is greatly faster than the speed of the truck. He is gaining on me. So, I decide to drive the car down a small hill and into a river, at this point, I am out of his vision and I get out of the truck. Before he reaches me, the car explodes and is left in smithereens. The [no longer] owner of the truck approaches me and asks what happened. I deny everything.For real though, this game is absolutely amazing and has a great dev team who updates the game with new features and weapons all the time. The game runs smoothly and the controls are simple and actually work when you press the keys (*cough* DayZ). Playing on roleplay servers makes the game even more fun and interesting. Probably the best way to spend $20 on Steam.			"

								I really hope people get behind this game and get more people on the servers. Only by people buying and supporting  and playing the game will we then get more people on, this already in the last week seems to be growing by the day.  The team are an amazing bunch and really care about the game and the players .  They work hard and like to get involved in the streams, as they really appreciate them too.This game can be a lot of fun, especially if you team up and go scouting around together for the vehicle parts and get racing around on the track and looting houses. The Devs are good at getting new items in the game,fixing bugs,etc with regular updates and patches.  I maybe am a  little biast but i wouldn't play it if i didnt like it, but i really enjoy playing it and always manage to get some good loot and die and loot again. It is also a very pleasing game to watch and just look at the scenary (this sometimes causing me to get killed by a mutant) as i take it all in. So much detail in the buildings and even down to the curtains moving and wires from the telegraph polls. the squirels and frogs runnning around in the forest, and some great caves to find and explore too.Deffo go buy and get your mates to aswell and team up and play together. or chat to others and become friends and scout arounf together, either way you will enjoy what it has to offer an lots more to come.

								Recently I've been playing a few ""apocalypse"" games that just happen to have a survival components in them. Needless to say, Miscreated is one of those games, and it delivers a whole new take on the genre. You'll face other players fighting to survive, you'll face mother-nature, but in the end, your worst nightmare will be the mutants.No one can tell what goes on in between the person you were and the person you become. No one can chart that blue and lonely section of hell. There are no maps of the change. You just come out the other side.Or you don't.Stephen King, 'The Stand'Without any further delay, I present to you my review of Miscreated.GameplayYou start as a fresh spawn, whose first obvious objective is to find some food, some drinks, and possibly some weapons. From there on, your main objective will be to stay away from the mutants, unless you're some sort of daredevil, as they are ruthless and will stop at nothing to kill you. During your adventures, you'll encounter other players, and while some might be nice, others will certainly prefer to see you dead, just like the mutants. But don't worry, karma is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.To make life easier, and also to allow you to explore the vastness of Miscreated's beautiful and well-designed map, you'll eventually find some vehicles. However, there's a catch, you'll need to make sure those vehicles have the required parts to work, such as wheels, spark plugs, oil, et cetera. Once you're able to gather all of the parts, and put them together, you'll have a wonderful time enjoying the amazing scenery. Until you get killed. Or die of starvation. Either way, you'll die. Everyone always does. But you can certainly enjoy yourself scavenging and hunting (friends and foes!).And don't forget, don't look behind you.Pros Amazing graphics, the best I've seen around the genre thus far; Compelling sound effects, somewhat creepy too; Runs smoothly, and I'm yet to experience any kind of lag; There's a status bar on the UI that tells you how you're doing, needs wise, although some could say it loses some realism due to it; Many items available; If you exit the game, or even change server, you get to keep the items you had; Quite a few items available to customise your character's looks; Incredibly well designed environment, with the perfect amount of spookiness to it.Considering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a ""Neutral"" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.Neutral Can't assign different keybinds, unless you mess around with game files; The character feels somewhat stiff, when the camera is set to 3rd person; Can't customise your character's build, or even be a female; The mutants could use a makeover; Would benefit from an increased realism on certain matters, since carrying jerry cans and tires on your pants, or even backpack, doesn't feel very realistic.Once again, considering its current EA state, I wouldn't be surprised to see the ""Cons"" I'll list below fixed or improved in the upcoming updates.Cons Takes quite a while to load up the ""worlds""/servers; Despite being able to explore freely, the game lacks the ability to be able to interact with most objects. Quite a few visual glitches, mostly weed growing where it shouldn't and items sort of floating; Few audio/video settings.VerdictI'd give it a 8/10 and I'm sure it will get better over time, not only due to its active development team, but also due to its already great state, I can only imagine how great it will be at the time of its full release.

								I love it. I have played h1z1 for 335 hours and in comparison to Miscreated, h1z1 doesn't have a soul. This game does though. Stalker is my all time favourite game and this game is the closest to that of all the online persistent survival games out there. The enviroment is so god damn good looking and well made, so detailed. The guns feel autentic, not arcade like in h1z1. And when the freaking mindblowing base building enters the game soon, it will be gooood. Im only 4 hours in but i think that i am hooked. If you like serious games with deep atmosphere, if you like stalking and creeping on others - this game is for you. I mean, you can actually hide really well in this game, you can actually sneak on others, just stalk them, prey on them. And looking badass while doing so. If your even remotely close to having good taste, buy it, period.			"

								After playing this game on my own a month ago i didnt really think much of it,after an hour of playtime i had so much stuff and didnt find any players nor zombies. I thought this game was really empty so i kinda gave up on playing it after 2 more hours.Since a week ago i started playing the game again and i have to stay i am amazed by how much the game improved. I made enemies who just smacked me to death without even talking to me and i made awesome friends from the other side of the world! We started surviving together and walked all across the maps while getting attacked by wolves and getting chased by zombies. People tried to kill us but the bushes are so good in this game they couldnt find us in there!Graphics are amazing and i¬¥m not even lagging a single bit.If you have money to spent and want to spent it on a good zombie/ survival game than this is the game to go. The developers are still busy with updating so who knows that might happen in the future!			"

								In my opinion one of the best survival games available at this moment. This game offered me something more than DayZ or H1Z1. DayZ is running simulator, you run across whole map, find some weapons, and get killed,  I am not suggesting it's not a good game, i have 400h in DayZ on my second account, but developers definetly need to add something new, like possibility of building, workshop, etc. H1Z1 - Honestly i expected more from this game. This game looks like simple FTP game, in which you can buy skins for clothes, or other things that will make you better than others. This game have nothing really to survival. Animations sucks, weapon models are worst i ever seen in any survival game, world is in 90% covered by forests, and graphics are also not that good. Miscreated - I didnt expected alot from this game, but this game suprised me. Graphics are amazing, its not simple running simulator in which you only get loot and get killed. Here in Miscreated you spawn, get your first weapon which is mostly G18, explore intresting world, and build a base. While walking on the Miscreated world im never bored, always something suprised me. Miscreated world looks amazing, this game just have its own unique atmosphere, every bullet is worth alot, sometimes worth more, than other players life.-------------------------------------------------------------------------What I do like in this game?-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Unique atmosphere+ Weapon models+ Animations+ Sounds+ Locations+ Vechicles+ Melee/Ranged weapon types+ Graphics-------------------------------------------------------------------------What I do not like-------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well in my opinion there should be more Military type of clothes in game. (Helmets, Vests, Uniforms, Backpacks etc.)- Too much of mutants in cities, and they're too strong. (1-2 hits you bleeding, 3-4 hits you dead)-------------------------------------------------------------------------I highly recommend this game for people who are looking for something new.			"

								Miscreated is really coming into its own - I enjoy the gameplay each and every time I jump in, and the developers are constantly working on improvements. The environment art is top notch and feels really post apocalyptic, and creeping through cities looking for supplies to survive gets my heart beating!If you're okay with experiencing a game in development (bugs, potential delays, problems with gameplay) I encourage you to pick it up. If you'd rather wait for it to be complete, add this to your wishlist asap!			"

								There are a few other survival games (DayZ, H1Z1, etc.) that will be in early access for years. Those games will be completed and stay in early access. Miscreated is and feels like an early, early, access game. I think with time, if the devs keep up the pace, Miscreated can become the top zombie survival game in the genre. DayZ looks like it's on it's way out and H1Z1 is by Daybreak Games, which means their team will be working hard on EverQuestNext and not have the time to fix or finish H1Z1. Daybreak Games has already slowed/ stopped working on Landmark and it's still in Early Access. This is where Miscreated has a chance to step in and steal the spotlight. If the patches stay regular and the devs communicate with the playerbase like they have been, this will be the one and only zombie survival game.			"

								Awesome game.  If you're playing solo, try to group up with people or else be a super ninja, cause you will run into them bandits.  They want what you have.  I've made some trades with people for ammo and things succesfully... And unsuccesfully... This game will make your heart race in those critical thinking moments for sure.  Building is very fun, but you've got to go out looting for the Guides if you want more options for crafting. (you start with the basics) Just get it, its good now, and obviously getting better with the devs expanding with new ideas/locations and squashing those bugs.Pay them so they can work, and you can play. Good job guys.Ps. a lot of the bad reviews are from a long time ago and have nothing to do with the current state of the game.Edit: Patch 35 has added Weather Patterns.  Wow.  Everyone I've spoken to were pleasantly surprized.  Still getting better like I thought..  Gonna go work on base building, Bye.			"

								This is  my favorite game right now.. i play everyday.-I pretty much place it into the zombie survival genre  when i was getting into these games,,, i thought DAYZ looked the best and H1Z1 played the best.,.. then i found this game and it has the best of both. I didnt like the mechanics in DAYZ and H1Z1 looked too cartoon-y... Miscreated looks pretty, controls and mechanics are solid and the Devs are constantly updating the game with new content and bug fixes,,, so its not a game thats stuck in ALPHA hell forever...   Another aspect to mention is the community is actually pretty cool... there are tense pvp moments ingame and you can never trust anyone you meet on the Island, but irl mostly everyone is cool, respectful and willing to help.I am positive this game will dominate the zombie survival genre when it is completed,,, but even though its in ALPHA its a good game and worth getting.

								[Official Chops Seal of Approval]May 2016 ReviewAfter a bit of a rough start in it's Early Access, this game and Development team is doing great!! Do NOT base your opinion on older reviews. Things have gotten much MUCH better. When in doubt, I encourage you to find a streamer that's playing it on Twitch and ask some questions while checking out some gameplay. You'll probably run into some of the Devs too. Educate yourself.The environmental decorations and details are incredibly immersive. They never cease to impress me each time I play. Every location and house has it's own feel. Almost like it can tell it's own story of what happened after the apocalypse. Stunning. The game is absolutely beautiful. Updates come on the average of 2-3 weeks. the map keeps expanding with new areas every month or two. Servers are INCREDIBLY stable at this time. Rarely ever going down except for update patches. Day/Night cycle is lengthy, but not TOO lengthy. With excellent lighting during both. Turning the flashlight on at night while you're looting is often more frightening than being in the dark. Sometimes you don't want to know what's in the dark and your mind plays tricks on you. And the new weather eefects added are simply stunning. Even for first pass implementation. The thunder storms and rain.... OMG.The inventory weight sytem is engaging and inherently encourages teamwork over KOS to get larger tasks done. (Such as fixing vehicles up to drive and the soon to be implemented base building). Sure you can lone-wolf it. But don't expect to hold down a location or have a fleet of vehicles alone. As in real life, I can not and would not like to carry around a car battery, fuel, building supplies, 4 tires with a backpack, food, survival tools and weapons. Often I find myself hiding my backpack somewhere so I can carry fuel or tires back to a vehicle that myself and friends are putting together. I absolutely love this mechanic system and can't wait for it to be fleshed out more and more. (Getting the needed materials to get the generator running at the Old Mine or Airbase and turning on the flood lights at night it a feeling i'll not soon get over. Very, VERY cool.)The combat stances is also a mechanic that I simply love the idea of. And it has been implemented very well so far. When your weapon is stowed away on your back or holster, you move at full speed. Drawing your weapon provides you with 2 stances. ""At the Ready"" and ""At Ease"". In the ""At Ease"" position, your weapon is lowered, a slightly neutral posture. This posture keeps the right click button free for zooming and focusing on distant objectives and does not attack with a single click. It also lowers your movement speed slightly to compensate for the way your body would move while holding your weapons in your hands. When you switch to the ""Ready"" stance, your weapon is raised and ready for combat. Right click then becomes an Aim Down Sights function and your movement speed is further decreased for the sake of aim and accuracy. (Try aiming down the sight of a shotgun or rifle in real life, hold it to your cheek and tell me how fast you can run reliably or comfortably. Hehe) Switching these stances is simple and quick, and the movement speeds for each just add another small touch that I appreciate and enjoy with my immersion.Crafting continues to expand. With base building being in and a team effort. Completely enjoyable. Future updates will implement a new item system to the core including gun crafting, customization and storage containers will make their appearance. (This seems to be a huge complaint from negative Nancys that storage boxes are not in yet. They're coming.) This however does not effect my enjoyment. I don't need to hoard supplies personally.The AI system has recently gone thru changes. A third party AI has seen its first pass implementations and is quite basic atm. Relying on simple sight and sound and chase functions. Seeing that it is the same third party AI used in games such as Dying Light, I'm the future of this AI will be excelent. But being actively in development, this is not something that I can mark as a negative impact. Even if it bugs out or despawns mobs occassionally. I've always seen posative progress in this games development. And this is another area that I look forward to it's expansion in the future.The Development team is EXTREMELY involved in the community (especially the streaming community) and the passion they have for their product is something I have rarely seen.Does it still have a ways to go? Yes. Does it have Alpha bugs? Ofcourse. But the road it has taken and the roads it is heading to have made me very happy to have backed this project in Early Access.In a genre that is flooded and yet somehow not allowed to be expanded on by extremist fanboys, this PvEvP survival game shines like a gem in my eyes.Well worth the price of admission. I'm looking forward to the future, even if it is filled with mutants that want to feast on my flesh! ;)Game on!			"

								So I've been thinking of buying DayZ or H1Z1 for quite sometime, but I just wasn't too impressed by their game engines and some of the game mechanics. Recently found out about Miscreated and started watching video and game play. Decided to go for it. I like ARK (xbox one player), but it's systems are too convoluted for me to just pick up and play in short bursts.  Miscreated seems to a very underrated game. I do enjoy it much more than Ark. The game engine is fantastic and the graphics are top notch (GTX970+i7 6700k stock clocks = ~50fps max everything @2560x1080p). Looking at the update history shows that it gets regular updates.Inventory seems easy to manage. Wish the items auto stacked though (now available in latest build).Crafting system is easy to get into with a low learning curve.Have not tried base building yet.Gun play seems to be on point. On occasion I do not notice lag during shoot outs though with questionable hit boxes. (Devs are aware and looking into it)Melee combat could use some work.Not many gun options or gun customization yet. Enough to enjoy the game though (handguns, rifles, explosives, bolt action, etc are in the game).Weather system is amazing. Thunderstorms at night is something that really draws you in.Not much KOS going on so that's a plus. 32 player count. Devs say this will expand as they open up more of the map.I hope they get more support from the community. $20 is a fair price for the content that is available in early access. I play on one of the official servers and it's usually in the 20-30 player count range. Graphics and art direction are WAY better than the stuff I've seen with DayZ and H1Z1.			"

								Well, this is one of those 'damned if I do, damned if I dont' reviews..I'm sure many will disagree with me on this but here's what I think..It's not Dayz.. (it's Dayz for the arcade set).We are in an age of zombie chic, there's so many zombie/mutant titles right now and it depends on what you think of the genere and what you want out of it that will determine what you choose to play. This game undoubtedly has some nice visuals but some fairly lame character modelling.It's got lots of the right types of locations, but somehow they just dont feel.. real. I meet another player and my senses go into 'arcade mode' it doesn't really matter, I don't feel threatened and I don't really know why.And then there's the user base.. ""hello?""............ no one home.Thirty or forty players accross 20 or 30 servers? I really want to like this game and I genuinely hope it becomes a really good game that will grow a large player base. But I'm sorry, if you want realism, tension and lots more variety and customisation to your survival experience then head to Dayz. It's the daddy of the survival/zombie genere and I don't see it being bettered, possibly ever!Would I recommend it, I'm going to say yes, but only for the curiosity factor and for the casual survivor. But for the hard core or the realists.. no.			"

								EDIT : With the introduction to patch #36 all reviews before 06/30 should not be taken into account. Storage has now been added to the game as well as many other huge features.   None of the reviews really give this game justice. It went from being a bare minimum game, to what is in my opinion, the best survival game currently out. Unlike other games such as DayZ or H1Z1 which have practically no environment, Miscreated actually feels like the apocalypse. There have been times my group will go out just to explore the caves and land. That doesn't mean there aren't any flaws, combat can feel clunky at times and it isn't completely optimized. You start with basic structures to aid you in building, going out and looking for building guides will greatly help as it adds new structures for you to build with. This adds a bit of an end game feel as the guides are quite rare. I went from playing H1Z1 non stop (around 1600+ hours) to buying Miscreated and I haven't played H1Z1 since. Most negative reviews for the game are extremely old, the devs are always pushing updates and letting the community know about what is to come in the future.			"

								Edit - 04/05/2015 - Having left this review for a solid time now, there's been many a large update to the game, and I'd like to say what they've put in that's made it better, yet I still have the exact same problem. From the recent reviews I can at least assume it's a smallish amount of the playerbase that has this problem. I cannot load into any servers, period, as such, it's still a negative review.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately im gonna have to say you shouldn't buy this game.Does it have promise? Yes.Does it have good graphics at a fairly stable frame rate? Yes.It's competition for other survival games, and a decent one at that.The big problem is it's seemingly unplayable for a very high percent of people. Unfortunately many, many folks are unable to connect to any servers, and this is a known problem. From last December, something which means you cannot play it, you cannot even bug-test (after all this is early access, you pay to help test it, etc)Staff and Developers were on it for a good while, the forum thread in which they go through this problem has been updated for about 4 months, then it went dead, completly. People are still posting on it (Last post was about 2 months ago), yet there has been no responses at all from Devs, apart from ""We've fixed X amount of Y, X amount of Z, and X amount of Q, without really detailing how, and giving no more response.So while it has promise, I can't recommend something that is literally broken for so many people.

								What do you expect from this game? A fast paced survival (but mostly shooter game)? The game version of Hoarders? A better DayZ / H1Z1?Well fortunately it is none of the above but rather much more. Just like described this is a hardcore survival game, not a shooter, not a survival-but-you-find-guns-in-every-corner-game, not game where you loot a bunch of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•just to hide it in a base in the middle of the hills so you can brag about it. It is exactly what is advertises: one very tough game, but even more enjoyable.Alright let me start of with the visual aspect of the game which, in my opinion, is stunning. Thank the lords for Cry-Engine and also the Devs for a great work on those textures, especially the foliage that looks amazing and allows one to hide in it very easily. Sunrises look amazing, and at night the game looks impressively scary (probably the reason why so many people ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• play on 24h Daylight servers).Moving on to the PVP/combat aspect of the game, over which I've seen a lot of complaints on the forums: I personally think the combat system is fine, of course it wasn't easy to get used to but I feel that's exactly the point: it's supposed to be difficult. At the end of the day it is a different experience and very enjoyable once you get used to it. No you can't run and gun, but if that's all you expect from this game, shooting‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•at a fast pace, you might as well go back to Cowa Doody 47: Black‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Of course there are flaws to it, but if one can't deal with flaws one shouldn't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing buy Pre-Access games.When it comes to amount of loot and vehicles I've also seen plenty of people complain, especially lack of guns. This is a complaint made mostly by people who just started since they don't know‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Loot is pretty much everywhere and so are guns you just need to know the right places, and it will only take you a few hours to start understanding where the best places to loot are. Vehicles are also pretty common, once you know where to look, although not common enough for them to be easy to find.Overall with about 40hrs played in this game I've had a lot of fun, not only by just killing people but also by speaking and collaborating with them, of course I've been KOS plenty of times, but it's part of the game and can be avoided. There are still plenty of flaws in the game, for me the main one would be base building, since collecting wood pile and turning it into lumber and other parts is a pain, which I haven't really gotten into. I think the lack of storage that makes everyone complain is something that should be added, although it is not something I find essential since not having storage makes you appreciate more each life, making you question your actions, which leads to an even harder game.Writing this review after a patch that brought plenty of bugs into the game I still believe there is A LOT of potential, but as a community I think we should also understand that making games isn't easy and takes time, especially with a small team.I wish the Dev team good luck and will be updating this review later on. Also in-case you didn't understand I definitely recommend this game. "

								I put about 100 hours into DayZ SA before I started to get bored and began looking for something else, I looked for a while at H1Z1 but decided it probably wasn't for me, I then stumbled upon Miscreated. I watched a developer stream featuring it and asked some questions to which were answered, i'd bought a copy before I left that stream and haven't looked back. The graphics are better, the server stability is very good even on the high ping servers they still run smooth. The personal touch by the developers in this game is truly amazing, there is nearly always one of the developers themselves or people close to them watching the streams of Miscreated. They are a small team spread all across the world and the game they have made will be huge. Base building soon to be added and Battle Royale planned for the future. I cannot recommend this game enough to people at the price its at this game is absolute bargain. Best ¬£14 i've ever spent, I been playing it for a couple of months now and already passed 250 hours. If you haven't seen it you must. Run on Cry Engine 3, this blows away the others.			"

								As the other big survival game is getting more and more buggy every update it gets, I went looking into some other game looking similar like it.My eye came across Miscreated.Build on the cryengine, basic/hardcore surival, lone ranger or team up..It got me hooked eversince I started to play it about 1.5 week ago.Mechanics need a bit of polishing, sure.. so does the graphics quality (draw distance could be better) but that is all going to be taken care of by the devs.I think this game needs more backup from the community, get the word out there and get more people to play and fill the servers :) .Anywho.... I like it, I like it allot... almost no KOS, almost no d-sync, pretty steady 60FPS because of the cry-engine from crytek ( wich gives epic lighting effects and water effects) I can recommend this game to anyone who likes the survival - horror genre.

								Miscreated is a beautiful game. My play style in an open world game is typically as a wandering explorer. The map really sets the atmosphere of the game and there is a ton of detail. All the basic game mechanics work but there are some rough edges. I've had this game since it came out but honestly only started playing it to any extent after the latest patch, #35. In this update they added weather effects which are very well done. I look forward to having more survival mechanics such as hunting and cooking. The game is even more greater fun if you play as group  .Overall I would reccomend this game if you are a fan of the genre and enjoy immersing yourself in a game environment. Bear in mind the early access status of the title. I Myself would rate this game 9 out 10 as it's well worth the buy and bear in mind i think only 12 Devs are working on this game at the moment..

								This video sums it all up, but check out the review too


YouTube‚Ñ¢ Video: Games That Deserve More Love: Miscreated¬†

			Views: 298		

			Many games hold much merit, but aren't always appreciated by it's target audience. Miscreated is one of my all time favourite games, yet it's really lacking in the popularity it deserves.		

The thing that really sings out about this game, is it has such a well defined tone and setting. It's capability to tell stories with the environment is incredible, even if the base ingrediants of that story is just four weathered tents, a long gone camp fire and a car wreck. The stories are even painted on to the walls in messages to loved ones, graffiti, and warnings. Of course like any game in this genre, the real joy comes form the stories that you the player will tell. Whether it be epic gun battles across the rooftops of Pinecrest, or sneakily watching two players blow themselves up whilst kicking an ATV, Only to then loot the both of them and make away in my just fixed up car.  The base building alone is enough of a reason for any architecturally minded players with the potential for giant compounds or castles. BE WARNED, the blueprint system requires you to search for randomly generated plans before you can build everything in the game. Something that stands out as an exciting prospect for thosse who like the idea of end game content, that may not be easy to attain and also could hold a certain uniquness.With this latest update, a near whole new city has been opened up, along with new buildings and tons of other content. One particualr addition being weather generation that can allow for tornados that are rumoured to fling players and objects across the map. One final thing to mention, is that I have had some issues running this game in the past. It's believed that certain AMD CPU's have some sort of issue that can cause freezing in game, but a quick search on the steam forums will lead you to many fixes, some of which made the game work in my case, and many others. I'd say pick up this game if you are a fan of other survival games, but feel that others lack a real sense of apocalypse. Miscreated has well designed loot spawns that make searching everything and everywhere a viable idea, if you can bear the fact that 90% of the time you will not find anything in those odd to check spaces. But the times that you do it is the most rewarding feeling. Ok I'm babbling now, I can't actually keep my eyes open.... Time to play more Miscreated. Buy this game.			"

								edit:  So, it's been about 8 weeks since I purchased this game and frankly I feel I have to change my opinion to ""mixed"" at this point.  It's clear, in retrospect, that the devs, of which this is a small, sorta rag-tag bunch (not trying to disparage them, it's just that they are a small team that works remotely) released this game way before they should have.  The network issues were so bad at launch that they completely overwhelmed content and art development and are STILL being worked on nearly two months later.It is what it is.  I hope to come back to this game in 6 months or even a year and really enjoy it, but right now the servers are dead, there has been zero new gameplay added since launch outside of a few items, and the immediate roadmap is still stuck on ""fix the networking issues"".  I still recommend the game, but at this point, I'd also recommend holding off if you haven't purchased and checking back this summer.The good:graphics (cryengine 3, 'nuff said, textures could use some work but not bad for pre-alpha)combat (for an early alpha hand to hand is pretty fun, hit boxes need som adjusting though)atmosphere (sounds are good for pre alpha and so is the map)the bad:bad lag at times that impacts gameplay (rubber banding, teleporting)gameplay (dynamic loot spawn needs a lot of work.  there just isn't much around and there are so many times you think something is loot (say a metal bar to use as a weapon) and instead it's just nothing.  There is literally nothing to do other than gather loot but in my 4 hours (on a 20 pop server) all I found was a hammer, a couple beanies, some ammo and some food.  Apparently there was a bug last night that was spawning guns under stuff so they couldn't be seen)lack of voice chat (they are working on it, and it might even be in by the time I post this, but as of last night it wasn't working).Summary:This game is over priced at $25 for a pre-alpha.  Seems more a tech demo than anything but the basic mechanics are there and it just needs a lot of content and bug fixing to make it worth $25.That said, I bought it fully knowing all that and I don't regret it.  This game has a lot of potential and the devs seem committed to seeing it through.  If you like games in this style I'd recommend waiting but if you don't mind overpaying a bit and a lack of real content (pretty much my attitude) then go ahead, pick it up.			"

								This game just looks amazing to me. I don't know what it is that gives it such a realistic feeling but it does and it made us just want to run/drive/swim around to explore or just sit somewhere and watch it get night. Sometimes forgot there were mutants in the game, untill  we needed things or heard weird noises. I can talk about the things not right/ready yet, but none of them actually bothered me that much. I've seen full games way worse. The details they added to the game I really loved. The cities all look different and the way they have been left looks very real as well. The fact that some loot almost  blends in with the environment is nice. The river and the sea with sound, the rain on the road, the sand that gets muddy. The thunder sounds with wolves in the background. The rising sun. Footsteps on the beach. The fact that I was alone and scared in the woods and heard noises and it was a little squirrel. A deer appearing on the road. Rats and flies near garbage piles. If you like this kind of detail, you will love this game.			"

								The tension was palpable, looting houses in the dark and trying to avoid the zombie down the street. I found myself in an abandoned town, a motorcycle helmet on my head and a wasteland .22 slung on my back. Managed to survive through to morning where eager to explore the lands faster than on foot, I set down to repairing  a broken pickup truck.Every now and then I would check the server list. A few other people on which only made the tension worse - Playing almost nothing but Rust for the last year and a half has left me wary of my fellow man, so I opted to leave the torch stowed in my knapsack.That day was spent looting nearby buildings looking for the last piece of the puzzle, Diesel fuel. Sadly, I had not found any by the time I needed to log out, so finding a nook to log out, and not knowing whether I actually needed to hide before logging out, I logged out.Early access being what it is, I enjoyed the game in its current state, no bugs were noted and game play was smooth - very promising I think and will only be more enjoyable when you are trying to find that elusive ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fuel while your mate guards the pickup truck from other people with the same ideas as you....

								Things that happen in this open world game...**  The first day I played, I met a group of three guys. They let me join them. Right after we were attacked by a small group of zombies/mutants. During the confusion of us all running around we realized that one of the three guys I was with had been killed. For some reason, they assumed I did it, even though I didn't. One of the guys opened fire on me. I quickly killed him with my shotgun. I spoke to the third and last guy... warning him that I had no intention to harm anyone. He backed away into the woods. The thrill I felt as I quietly walked away from the screwed up situation alive... is amazing.**  Yesterday a friend and myself were hunted by two guys on a four wheeler who had a ton of weapons. They killed my friend. I managed to chase one off and have no idea what happened to the other one. Somehow I've never been killed by anyone. Yet I've seen several people die on this game. Why am I still here?This game is just beautiful. It looks great. The environments are awesome. Basebuilding has been implemented, but I believe the crate system has not been finished yet.My only complaint at this point are the mutant zombies. I just do not like the way they look. I'm pretty sure this will be improved in time.			"

								One of the bast RPG games I have played. Intense graphics and very real life play. Have to play a few days to get used to what you're doing or find a team but once you do you are in for a thrill. This game is harder than average because it really adds a reality feel to it in a post appocolyptic setting. Intense weather, monsters lurking, and other players ambushing or wanting to join. Limited carry space adds more of harder aspect than other games. If you like post appocolyptic games that add a real feel and difficult play then this is it. For newbies again don't get frustrated, keep trying. I died 4 times my first day. Now I have a growing base and an epic team! Don't expect to survive long on your first few tries and don't give up.

Hello my name is MrDocCutty im a simple trader who is friendly unless provoked!Today something incredible happend that changed my life! i was looting in the barracks of the military base when i heard a voice shout ""THROW DOWN YOUR WEAPONS AND COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!""I thought to myself ???There isnt any animation or key bind for that action yet! But i quickly responded, ""Oh Oh ok im just a simple trader i mean no one any harm sir."" they shouted back ""WE DONT GIVE A ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! THROW DOWN YOUR PISTOL AND COME OUT BACKWARDS SLOWLY OR WE WILL SHOOT! Now im worried because i roll play a very kind friendly trader who helps newbies with food loot and gear! what i did next had to be done! I quickly ran upstairs because i know this game very well, i knew the upstairs windows are opened half way and it will be a great vantage point! So i get into 3rd person and i look around and i spot two men in the bushes outside the door with an asualt rifle and a shotgun and the third man by the stairs with a 22 rifle! i yell back to them, ""OK..Im going to come out but please dont kill me ill do as you wish! They laugh openly and say ""Good now hurry it up!"" little did they know i had my pistol aimed at them so i took my shot killing the first guy in the bush with a head shot! he fell down dead the other two started to fire random shots into the building so i took out the second man with a head shot ! the third man wanted to end me pretty quickly so he ran upstairs to find me but a sniper never stays in that position once he fires so i went into the other room to hide! he is looking around and i quickly run downstairs to loot the two dead bodies and i get shot at ! i only have time to take his rugged pack and i start to head for the ocean knowing its a great place to hide! he must have wasted 45 bullets trying to hit me but my quick thinking and zig zag motions proved to save my life ! fast forward one hour and thirty mins that man went and got 11 other players to begin hunting me down openly in chat they were taunting me as i was trying to let them know i did what i had to to survive they started calling me wayne gracie the serial killer which offended me beacause i am a simple trader!So i took it upon myself to hunt each one down till all 11 were dead! Mind you all i had was two clips of pistol ammo and two boxes of shotgun ammo and my food was running out! Long story longer i ended up killing seven men in the office buildings they werent to smart being in one main room talking over mic then i took out the man who mugged me and since then for the last three days on that server they hunt me because one man took out 11 ! Dont mess with MrDocCutty! 10/10 would be hunted again : )			"

								For people thinking this as a replacement for DayZ (PLEASE READ WHOLE REVIEW)-The game takes a lone time to load. Not so long I can go and maybe eat something, but long enough that I can get through a youtube video or two.-It takes FOREVER to join a server, and I know thats not my internet, because I switched providers recently and it didnt change. -Sometimes, after waiting ten minutes to join a game, it just kicks me back to the main menu. -When im playing, sometimes, the game will just randomly freeze as if its crashed, but ti hasnt. It will sit there, sound playing normally and such, and then come back to life (My guess is its loading something? However. the above problems mentioned might be my fault, as I cant find anyone else having them online in my searches)-The ""zombies"" or creatures that you put in never move. They often just spawn inside of each other and sit there.But, I will say this...When the game does function, its fun. Not everyone is out to kill you like DayZ, and the weapons have very good models and sound. The lack of reload animations I actually like, even if it is just a placeholder, have to drag my magazines in and out feels nice. The combat is fast paced and satisfying unlike DayZ, and ammo isnt too hard to find aswell as guns. The atmosphere and graphics and alot better than DayZ AND is much more optimized than DayZ. If you want some constructive criticism:-Dont switch to third person, stay first person, for the love of god STAY first person/third person-Reduce jump height. Its very annoying how some players bunnyhop around when in gunfights (Which is, in my opinion, the only flaw in combat)-Add more variety of weapons (I assumed this was a given, or is already being implemented-Refine the ingame UI a little bit. It looks a bit cheap and quickly designed, but it does work. Just needs a bit of tuning.My Specs:CPU: AMD-FX 6-Core Vishera processor clocked at 3.5ghzGPU: ASUS ATI-R9270 2GB VRAM with 1100Mhz clock speedRAM: 8GBHDD: 2x Seagate Barracuda 1TB HDDIn conclusion, do I recomend this as an alternative to DayZ? Yes. Frequent updates, lower price, less bug/glitches, better combat and more stable mechanics, aswell as better graphics and better optimization, I would say so. "

								TL;DR for the below review: Overall a game with much potential (like many early access games) and I can see it being up there with DayZ and Rust playerbase-wise. Despite giving it a 6.5/10 in it's current state, I would still recommend buying it if you are interested in early access games and can understand that the game IS broken and is not a polished AAA title.REVIEW:This game is off to a good start so far, but is obviously lacking content as it is in a pre-alpha stage.Initially, I bought this game through the conbined persuasion of a friend and of the beautiful map it produces running on the CryEngine 3. It took some time, but after a half an hour or so of wandering the beautiful map, I managed to find food, a gun, ammo, and some clothing. Setting myself up for my journey to meet with my friend. Along the way, we encountered unfriendly players (who we killed), Bambi's (literal deer. not freshies [We did meet freshies too, though]) and needle-armed mutants we've come to call Narwhals. In my honest opinion, this game has a much better pre-alpha than DayZ Standalone did, and has just as much potential. In their current respective states, DayZ Standalone still wins, but I will continue to watch this game and I look foreward to observing it progress.			"

Early Access Review
								Long read ahead.I don't normally post game reviews, but felt compelled to make an exception. I was making an argument against PvE servers (more on this later), and received a permanent ban. Normally, I prefer to provide feedback on Steam games in person via forums, but that avenue has been closed to me, so I'll rely on this alternative.First of all, how's the game itself?It's not too bad, but if I were to sum it up with a title, it would be ""H1Z1: Pre-Pre-Alpha Edition."" It has a 36 player cap, runs on CryEngine, and is unable to support more than a few dozen entities in a ~25km¬≤ playable area. Speaking of the map, I did find it to be one of the game's high points. Unfortunately, this is where the ""pros"" list more or less ends.I'll make this simple by going line-item with regard to what I believe to be the core concepts necessary to a survival game's integrity. You can decide for yourself whether these are done well or not, according to your own survival game experiences.The EnvironmentNature is realistic enough (can actually hide in the bushes), but the (enterable) buildings are about as generic as they can be. It's pretty much a copy-paste job for a few ""small home"" types of buildings, a few shops, and a factory.The ""Zombies""These perma-aggro on you if they spot you. They also die in about three swings from a melee weapon. You will encounter these less than a fifth of the time you encounter players on a full server; the engine simply can't support a decent amount of NPCs. There are also wolves, which interestingly enough try to distract you for others in the pack to strike from behind, but they tether and teleport back if you run about 300 meters.The Items/LootBy far one of the game's worst aspects, and something I brought up in the forums very often. Ammunition is extremely rare, which is probably intended to mitigate player-killing. About 97% of what you find is food and clothing. In fact, food is trivialized to such an extent, that I'm not sure why it's in the game. Meanwhile, crafting materials are very rare, which brings me to...The CraftingFreeform base-building. Similar to other games, but you're not limited by structure part ""latch"" points. You can only build on a plot of land that you ""claim"" (one per server), and the structures are easy to break into, unless you use exploits to build in the air. The single most important aspect of base-building, storage, is trivialized because of excessive load on the engine hoarding. You get to have one small box (8 slots) and one large box (never found the recipe) per server. That's it. As far as item crafting goes, the selection is extremely limited, and you'll rarely find what you want anyway. Example: there are 16 arrow/bolt recipes (making up 64% of all weapon recipes), but in the time I've played, I found arrows exactly once. Oh, and the inventory uses an outdated ""slot"" system.The Performance, et ceteraThe game runs...okay. That said, crashes are very common, and you will need to drop your settings to make the swings in frame rates tolerable. I had to drop shadows and AO on my stock GTX 980 just to not dip into the 30s all the time. Also, there are frequent lag-pauses, which is something that's apparently being addressed soon. There are some issues with getting stuck on geometry, and some ""temporary"" bugs, such as headshots not working.The AtmosphereThe environment looks good, and the weather effects are nice, but outside of that, there's nothing that makes you really feel that you're ""surviving,"" aside from the occasional encounters with other players, which, because of the low player cap, don't happen too often. And when they do, the players usually go their separate ways because no one is armed with a ranged weapon. The geared players, on the other hand, will almost always kill you, because the game lacks PvE content to such an extent that there's really nothing else they can do for fun. And because ammo is so rare, it's usually a very one-sided affair, as you can't reliably arm yourself with low-end ranged weapons until you've farmed for a while. You'll find guns, and you'll find ammo, but you'll rarely survive long enough to have matching sets. The few gunfights I've been in were against groups of 2-4 geared players when I at best had half a clip to fire. In their intention to combat mindless killing, the devs created a situation in which it's extremely difficult to deter better-geared players killing everything they see. In other games, it's easy to get some kind of pistol quickly, which, despite its inferiority, poses some danger to someone with a dope carbine.Did I mention that nights are dark? They're extremely dark, to the point that you might as well be playing blind. If you have a glossy monitor and/or any kind of reflective glare, forget it. Fortunately for you, there's a fix: just turn up your driver gamma. But here's a quick anecdote with regard to that: when the devs were pressed as to why they don't balance the darkness a bit in the face of such a fix, they said that they didn't want to turn down the (let me paraphrase) ""hardcore"" darkness, because then they would essentially be ""responsible for implementing a darkness-subverting exploit."" That, and no one would be using the flashlight they put in the game. That's some logic right there.Well, I feel that this has gone on long enough. I'd like to just touch up on what brought me here in the first place: the devs' treatment of the community. It appears to be, shall I say it, very ""politically-correct."" Disagreement is frowned upon, and rules are enforced arbitrarily. When I got in touch with a developer to inquire about my situation, he said he would look into it, and in a few minutes, blocked me without saying a word. It was pretty obvious that it was a matter of politics, and they just wanted to remove someone who publicly spoke about the game's issues (outlined here) instead of giving praise to meager iterations of progress. I know for a fact that they didn't get rid of me to protect any of their ""fans"" from emotional harm. I was active for about three weeks, and during that time, I was pretty much the only one who logically addressed the game's issues, instead of either mindlessly praising or cursing it.It was curious how they threw in ""insulting developers"" into the reason, considering I've done no such thing, and in fact wasn't even insulting the carebear advocates edging me on. Not a single cuss ever left my mouth. Of course they also ran the ""remove all posts"" toggle, so I can't prove it. Over twelve years and almost 11,000 posts, and this is the first game company to give me this sort of treatment. And I never expected these guys to do it, since I was advocating for their intent to create a survival game that's more hardcore than others on the market. But in the end, if this game seems like a good investment (and I would've honestly still given it a thumbs-up if it was $6.99 or less, despite everything else), you have to ask yourself this: if you can't trust them to be honest with regard to how they treat their community members, can you trust them to deliver on the promises they're making with regard to their product? The game has been out for two years now, and I got it during the recent sale. It was in my wishlist during that entire time, and yet it doesn't feel much different from the videos I watched in 2014.I take censorship very seriously (and you should too). Here are the links to pictures of the offending post, if anyone wants to get a better idea of what you'll be dealing with:

								Bought this game right when it became available on steam, played it for a month or so, got bored with the content it had at that moment and gave this game up only to get back into it 2 years later.To be honest, Miscreated is one of the best examples of early access games with updates being delivered once a month. There's lot of content - variable locations like towns and cities, camps, caves, bunkers and forests; different types of weapons - both melee and long-range; skin/clothes customization; different types of vehicles. To put it simply, Miscreated has all the attributes needed for another sandbox survival game.But there is one thing that makes this game stand out from the rest representatives of the genre - and that is the atmosphere which is really well done. Lighting, weather effects, sounds and detailed locations design are blended into something that makes me want to get back into this world again and again just to enjoy this beautiful, dramatic and at times (mostly at nights) creepy world of Miscreated. And developers were smart enough not to ruin all of this with the crafting system which does not motivate players to build a lot and allow us to enjoy locations in a state of nature.Most atmospheric post-apocalyptic survival game I've ever played.

Miscreated¬†
A Screenshot of Miscreated
By: kolya




Miscreated can be easily passed off as another clone of DayZ and i do agree with this to a certain degree but it is very nice to play a game like this that gets it's core gameplay correct. It's impossible for me to not compare it constantly to DayZ (which i put many hours into in mod stage and standalone) as i began playing this game but find myself often thinking how much better it has done certain aspects of the style. Straight off the bat it's nice to have full control of your movement and mouse control that feels natural. While i understand DayZ aims to be more tactical and slower paced it is constantly frustrating when simple things become much harder to do because of forced realism that generally ends up showing more bugs than anything else. Despite this so far Miscreated definitely lacks some of the atmosphere and intense situations that are present in DayZ but still excels with its own style that you would defintely say is a more arcadey experience. DayZ has a massive scope and a much bigger map but it feels spread very thin in relation to how the game has developed. Miscreated somehow has quite a lot more features already but definitely has a more focused approach with it's smaller map and less unique locations. But to me that's not a bad thing and it is refreshing to play a survival game like this that is created in a good engine. Miscreated nails the simple things when it comes to gameplay. Movement and shooting feel smooth and responsive. Vehicles are in the game and have worked fine so far with simple enough systems in place to get them running(including boats which was a surprise). I think it's important to note that this game is not made by a big company and probably does not have massive funding which for me puts it in a different perspective. Because of this fact i think Miscreated punches well above it's weight and surpassed the expectations i had when going into the game. It is mind blowing to me that they can nail many simple things that a game like DayZ cannot which tells me that the developers have focused on the right things when they set out with the development roadmap. I think it's important to note that i find the PvP experience completely fine. People are going to kill you for no reason, its a matter of fact in these games and i have no problem with it. In some cases it makes situations much more tense which is really the experience i'm looking for in a game like this. It's part of the experience and even so i have ran into quite a few people already who were friendly already which was surprising. I just think it would be unfair to quickly judge this game based on a interaction you've had in a game with another player if it comes down to simple things like player choice. That being said perhaps this game is better suited to at least playing with one other person.The performance is great for an early access game and it looks quite good too thanks to cryengine. Looting in houses with a torch feels much more immersive than other games and the loot system seems to work quite well so far. It's nice that all the simple things just work, no worrying about picking up loot not working or nothing ever spawning it seems. Bugs have been minimal for me so far besides some glitchiness in AI behaviour of wolves but nothing too serious. The infected in this game do have a presence but it is not overwhelming. I would not mind if they increased this in the future as the combat mechanics are consistent enough to deal with them. Melee feels reponsive and reliable which is a nice change while you do still take damage and it's not a total pushover.There is quite an array of loot as well and i'm sure it's going to improve. Interestingly after 15~ hours of gameplay i've found items i haven't seen before which i think is quite good. On top of all of this there is an easy to use crafting system that contains many items and so far it has worked very easily. Something i cannot completely cover yet is base building and the mechanics of it. However i have encountered others bases and it's pretty cool to see some stuff others have built and being able to explore it.For me i feel like as long as this game is continually worked on it is only going to get better and better. Some of my early encounters have already given me a similar to feel to what i have experienced in DayZ with the difference being that i felt in control the entire time of what my character was doing. The northern most part of the map is a great change from the rest and the small city area seems well crafted. If more areas like this exist in the future it will be a massive improvement. I expect the major negatives for me could come in the form of getting bored of the much smaller map, however it is too early to say if this is true and the gameplay is still very enjoyable and it helps that it looks pretty good too. Regardless of that eventual outcome i am happy with the purchase and it will be extremely worth it if this game can reach the high potential it seems to have. I am still yet to completely explore the map and look forward to doing so. Please note my experiences were playing in a group rather than alone. I am sorry about the prevalance of DayZ comparisons but it's really hard for me to not do. I do not intend to have this come across as me hating on Dayz either, i still like it and have put many hours into it, i just feel like this game presents a similar but less frustrating experience just with a much smaller map and more traditional controls. They are still quite different but Miscreated keeps surprising me with the amount of content it has in it.Some videos from my playtime:

								IGNORE THE MIXED REVIEW. I really am not sure how the rating fell so low, but this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing amazing. Extremely fun, optimized surprisingly well, great graphics, the bugs are minimal; nothing game breaking really. Updated at least every month and the Devs actually communicate with the players. And a whoooole lot friendlier community then DayZ. I HIGHLY reccomend buying this game right now even during early access, the cheap price is well worth it. The game is only getting better and better.			"

If you have 1 or 2 freinds to play with i suggest you give it a shot and play for 1.5 hours than refund if you dont like it. Full review might come once I hit the 100 hour mark. "

								Gonna keep it short & sweet :   Devs are great, updates regularly. For early access this is a beautiful game, more so than dayz or any of the others.  This game has more potential than the aforementioned games as well. If there is one game i would urge you to support for early access this is the one.  It litterally will only get better.  The graphics to the features, controls once you get them down, just amazing.  80 percent of early access games are a gamble.  If you are looking at this one, I would highly recomment it.  If you enjoy gaming with friends, spread the word, as this game is tremendously fun, exciting and overall, amazing for its current state.     If you play, or are thinking of getting it, add me because this is one game that I was very impressed by, and I'm actually  very critical, however this one deff made the cut.    Support ! Buy ! Play !     a solid  8/10  as of 2/2/15.			"

								Second Time, i'm writing a short Review of Miscreated. First Time (back in October 2015) they had some troubles with servers but it's fixed long time ago.A lot of things happend and this game makes some huge steps forward. Graphics are really nice, crafting and base building getting way better than expected and besides the cars and trucks, you will find some bicycles here and there (tour de zombies, anoyone?). You will find some decent loot pretty fast and if you're lucky, meeting friendly players.It's also possible to rent your own server and modify weather, daytime (24h daylight) and such other things. This gave Miscreated a little boost of new players and some of those servers are always very active. If you want to play PVE only, there are some servers, too. Played now over 100 Hours, never met a Hacker or cheater till today.So what's missing? You! Not joking, this game needs more players and devs really deserved it. Yes, still Early Access but runs very stable and i enjoy playing it. "

								After watching gameplay of Miscreated on Youtube I couldn't wait to play it for myself. To begin with I was a bit sceptical but decided that after reading a number of reviews I would purchase the game. To begin with the game was a little difficult to get into as it can be rather buggy from time to time, however after mentioning the game to a few of my friends I found the whole experience 10 times better as team work really paid off and helped to build our first base. At the currrent stage of the games development I would say that teamwork is essential as the player inventory is currently capped at 40 kg, which can be pain when it comes to collecting car parts and building materials. on the other hand the game is rather stable for its current state and the servers are stable as well.Overall I would definitly recommend this game if you have atleast one or two friends to play along with you.

MiscreatedPeople may say this game is broken, boring, and ""miscreated"" but it's non of those. The game is quite beautiful and if you run away from the towns and city you can find the thick forests. The AI isn't the best but the mutants arn't the main obstacle you should be scared of. There's hunger, wolves, and other players. I am a big TWD fan and love the survival aspect, killing and looting others and the thought of raiding ones home and scavenging items (not that I do that on normal basis). The game is still quite difficult for my friend and I and I'm still learning the pvp. Finding cars and weapons can be difficult and trying to store all your items under 40 kg is challenging. Overall the game has it's flaws but if you look at them hard enough, you can laugh at them play the wonderful and fun game that miscreated offers. 8/10 play with a friend "

								Been playing this game for 11h plus now and i can say that I¬¥ve allready had more fun than in dayz.Graphics are awesome even though i turned all of it down to medium and shadows to low to avoid lags, it still looks great.Without voip its kind of every man for himself and kill or be killed but its not like in dayz when you feel, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, now i have to run 2 hours to find gear again. You get back into the fun a lot faster.And talking about fun. Even looting is fun since no house is useless and theres so many spawn points for items you miss stuff all the time and really have to look for it which in my case makes finding that gun so much more fun.The devs are doing a great job and I truely believe that with bigger map, crafting and persistent item storage this game will be the best survival mmo out there.I strongly recommend everyone to at least try this game.

								I have over than 1600 hours on DayZ and havinh only 400 on Miscreated i can say that is the best survival game at the moment. There are wolves, different speces of mutant, each one different and most powerful. You can play PVE or have PVP. Be an explorer, an hero or a bandit, you can find so many weapons and cars. You can build up a base where you can store your stuff, change your clothes to adapt the bihome and backpacks to carry more loot. the map is not finished yet and when it will be is gonna be enough if you think about all the details all around the game world. Developers are quick to answer questions and solve your problems, they release updates frequently.The best at the moment.			"

								This game is really fun. I'm surprised of the ""mix reviews"" and the fact that not many people play this (Don't worry some servers all near maxed). I took at chance even after reading those reviews but obviously some major changes happened because idk what the hell the neg reviews are talking about ha. Pro's: Beautiful game. The graphics blow dayz/h1z1 away.Mechanics are smoothSimilarity to Dayz with looting/searchingSimilarity to h1z1 with craftingAlmost all people i've met are friendlyYour food and water doesn't get drained so fast like it does in other games so as long as you pay attention to it you'll be okay.The flashlight reminds me of a horror survival game, its extremely useful and at night you definetly need it.The night time itself is awesome. Really brings the creepyness to the game.Cons:Day/night shift. It was day time when i logged on and within 30 mins it was night and stayed night for literally 4 hours. I fell asleep after that it could still be night lol.You press 1,2,3 for your weapons but some weapons cant freely float from 1,2 or 3, but can only be assigned to 1 or 2 but not 3.The mutant AI sometimes glitches outTLDR;This game is sick, and definitely worth the buy.

								This game is still early access so you can't expect too much, it's pretty much beta testing but in a fun way. The drill armed zombies I'm not really a fan of because they are extremely tough unless you have a gun and the way they look is just weird and there is no variety. However, these zombies do make it fun and add a sense of danger. Me and my friend grouped up and we were soon chased by 8 zombies we ran towards a bridge and jumped off into the water making a cinematic getaway lol. There are also a lack of items but enough for a game in early access, a bunch of clothing and melee weapons and 2 guns as well as numerous food and drinks. The only thing that they really need to fix is the optimization. I have a 3.5ghz processor and 6gb of RAM and 1gb of VRAM. That's enough to run the huge game of DayZ but I can only run this on low at 1366 by 768. This is the only game in my library that I've had trouble running, if anybody has suggestions or tips to boost my frames message me because I love this game!			"

								Would like to start off this review, don't let one server ruin your views on/with this game. In-game server browser always has choices, or check out the forums here;  Miscreated Player Servers [miscreatedgame.com]Alright now you don't have to build a base, find yourself a vehicle, (assuming you have gathered the parts required for your vehicle), bring a buddy or maybe pick up a survivor or two and chase tornados, or not. Miscreated at times, can be strictly all out PVP warfare with a chance of camping. Like most servers, whitelisting can help change all that. Which is great for PVE players like myself, where we can also enjoy the game from a different,  less hostile, perspective. If you're one playing for the basebuilding, having a good group to help gather guides will greatly improve your chances of constructiing a stronger base. Don't let those daytime screenshots fool you, Once it's dark, it's going to get creepy, of course only If the server has the Day/Night cycle enabled ;). Sure does get real eerie during the night, looting a house in the rain, hearing cracking on the roof, for a second you can't tell if another survivor or mutant is creepin up on you.  Being in early access certainly it will have its share of bugs. or awaiting more content for the content already there. Like the invisible mutants, or  storage for your items at your base.  I have not been around since launch, but if you have a look here at their current state from December 18th of 2015  LINK [miscreatedgame.com] you can see a lot of the games progress, as well as the developers plans (some of which is already added).Looking forward to what's in store for the future being a part of this community and as Miscreated progresses. [s] The expansion to the upper part of the map is another thing I'm looking forward to seeing. [/s] Although my buddy gifted me my copy, I plan to pay it forward by doing the same. I for sure recommend checking this out, either through videos or picking yourself up a copy,First review, thank you for your time.Review as of  5/15/16 Storage for bases, Hayward City has been opened and a lot more  Patch #36 [miscreatedgame.com] 6/30/16			"

								Miscreated review (Oct 30th 2014) - Day of steam release: After waiting so long for this game, I must say, i am impressed so far. Only thing that is bothering me at the moment is theres no voice chat and there the 3rd person view is a little clunky.. But man, for a game this early in development, its astounding so far for me. Well worth the wait.My first playthrough (still ongoing) was amazing... Story below.Been waiting a LONG time to play this game, missed the chance each time to pre order and all that.. Went on, was amazed by the atmosphere, watched someone axe a fellow down, after they store each other down at a gas station.  I hid in the bushes like a coward with my hammer, waiting for a moment to move in. I watched him leave, went in, found a body (fellow probably killed him to). Never saw him again. Went searching homes and sheds and such, when i heard footsteps in the house paralell to the one i was in. Heard him open the door that i had closed downstairs, he grew louder, and louder, until i knew he was upstairs. With my hammer ready, I hid behind a wall, and when he came in the room, thumped em in the head a couple times and he was down. My heart was going nuts, then to top it off, I was bleeding and didn't know what the hell to do, and once i figured it all out, another person came and dropped me some stuff not far away and ran away... Best experience in a survival game in a long while, hope this game gets support and a good following (hopefully of more helpful people than other games)			"

								10/10 game however:Be careful whom you play this with. Out of the 3 people I started playing this with I'm only talk to 1 now because 1 other person (Mr. C) didn't like the idea of having 2 bases so much that he had a sook. Unfortunately 1 person (Mr.Z) enables his childish behavior. APART FROM THATPros:- The weather in general in this game is absolutely gorgeous. - Great optimization especially when comparing to games like ARK and DayZ. - non-sickening motion blur, which is a positive for me because I can (on the odd occassion) get motion sickness- ACTUAL LOOT UNLIKE DAYZS BULLSH*T STANDALONE- You are less likely to do die whilst walking down steps- water doesnt instantly give you hyperthermia - easy inventory management- easy to check ammo- even playing on a 350ping server didnt feel that bad- less than 39.99 usd-  THE CAVES OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW WORLD AND ARE GORGEOUS, I'M SO EXCITED TO EXPLORE THEM	- base building is really fun!- active devs that have a done a top notch job with constant patches and hotfixes- They actually have cars, busses and trucks. - Melee against zombies is actually viable. - walking dead references   you can get the baseball bat that was used to kill glenn	Cons:- crafting can be a real pain- weight for inventory is kinda annoying- being limited with storage based on plot signs is frustrating- guides can be quite a pain to collect- if your base doesn't have floating components, it's not safe. - fire doesn't spread ( you can't burn down wooden walls ).- Can't open your INVENTORY when someone is near you (BUILD A BIG SPACIOUS BASE OR PREPARE TO SUFFER) I never played the DayZ mod but I played the standalone and the lack of loot and ability for solo players to progress really disappointed me. Miscreated essentially fixed most of the problems I had with DayZ but also impressed me with its visual flare and great optimisation. As far as these types of games go, this is the best one at this point in time. "

								I'm gonna go ahead and write a review on my opinion of this early access game.It is one of my favorite Early Access games to this date (2/05/15)The Gameplay is mostly layed back and the graphics are improving more and more with each update. It also has a great Dev Team behind it that is constantly working on updates and working with the community. This shows that the game will soon be out of Alpha and on its way to the big leagues.I enjoy the rush from ""interactions"" with other players and this game is perfect for that. The newly added military base has brought tons of action to my nights of playing and It just makes the game that much better. The guns aren't all super accurate so it helps or destroys gunfights. Also makes it hard for me to just chill up on the mountain overwatching places and snipe random Bambis to be the evil man I am.With the new VOIP added last patch as of today (2/05/15), It makes player interactions alot easier to see who is friendly and who is not, but this also adds to the game of getting large groups together and then slowly slaughtering them one by one and just blame it on ""the guy in the mountains""Anyways,Gameplay is fantastic if you are into the whole loot up and then have fun for a bit and maybe die a couple times in between.Graphics are decently well done, they have removed most of the grass from the CryEngine so the game will run alot smoother on most lower end pc's.The sound quality is alright so far and I'm sure they have plans for improving it in the future. Ambient sounds can be a bit buggy. You can hear most people around you, and even scare yourself when you think you hear someone but you are really just crouched and turning to different positions(which makes walking noises)I almost forgot about the mutants, boy do I hate those things, but I haven't seen them much as I have been stuck to the Military Base, but those suckers are real game breakers when you have no loot + they chase deer.Their is also some easter egg behind the game, because just below Factories/Woodhaven, there is a giant body(or the lower half of it) sticking out of rubble in a drainage pipe. So Mysteries would be 10/10.Can't wait for future updates as I love the game so far.That is my review on Miscreated,Thin			"

Right now there is absolutely no point in playing it.We have yet to see what ideas developers are about to present to us in this game. Now it's just another DayZ like it was a year ago. You run around, hit people in a face. Sometimes you find a can of beans or soda.Resume: give it a year or two and then check back again.			"

								Take it as this... 200+ hours into this game.  And I'm still finding new and amazing things within it. 300+ hours into dayz, and 50 hours of Battle Royale in h1z1...  And none of them compare. This is the best survival game out of all of them. Less glitches than any other early access alpha. NO DESYNC LIKE DAYZ! The developers CARE about the community, and are constantly doing patches/hotfixes, and adding new content while keeping the community informed and updated regularly. The game itself is simply beautiful, It runs smoothly and looks beautiful on even low level and mid level PCs. medium graphics are better than some fully released games and very high settings?!?! You wont stop staring at your screen. The PVP is excellent and the interactions are even better, i'd say the community is 50%friendly interactions/50% KOS&Banditry. If youve been interested in this game, then it is absolutely worth the $18.99. you will not be disappointed.   Feel free to message me on steam if you have any questions, or stop by twitch and search for randomh3ro1, and come see for yourself.			"

								Comparing H1Z1, DayZ, The Forest, etc, etc, etc, (don‚Äôt own any of them, played them all for at least 50hrs, and would NOT SPEND A DIME on any of them). This is the best of them and time will confirm this, unless is a very well planned fraud on the development team side.PROS:VERY STABLE AND HIGH PERFORMANCE for an early alpha.Continuous PATCHING and development that continues going forward, not backwards like H1Z1 or just a big stalemate ""promised land"" mess MONEY COW like DayZ.LOTS of populated good performing servers WORLD AROUND.A BIG and very interesting mix of a growing PLAYER BASE (survivalist, warriors, tourists, adrenaline junkies, recon elements, base builders, etc, etc, etc).LOTS OF POTENTIAL in an EXCELLENT and proven game engine.A public ROADMAP from the developersCONS:BASE FLOATINGNOT being able to control and modify game assets unlike the mine on The Shire Ravine (houses, buildings, some caves, etc)The ability to have a mobile camp on demand (this limited tent availability I hope is fixed down the road) to survive more away from the main base, its probably the most coveted item on the game right now, and a must have to be able to survive the elements away from home.More storage, Duffelbags are great storage, they should be able to be ""placed"" at least ONE per base so we can go out with a smaller backpack, also the option to store this smaller pack empty on a crate so we can have a complete customisable matching gear for the specific out of base activities which require different camo and low profile gear.A fix to the weapons and other items carried by players, sometimes you dont carry a rifle or bat or axe, again for low profile, but the game keeps this items visible on your caracter, also its misleading if you find someone that looks like he is carrying this gear but at the end, they dont.FINAL WORDSJust to end my review, this is a FREEPLAY style game, YOU can do WHAT EVER YOU WANT, be a psycho KOS cold hearted KILLER, a shadow SURVIVALIST, a son to learn a lot of TOLERANCE FOR FRUSTATION ""little house on the prairie"" builder, a social leader guiding your meager flock of sheep, a National Geographic wannabe reporter. a TOURIST, a COMPLETELY LOST BAMBI that would not survive a day in the wilderness even without ""stupid wildlife"", mutants included, or a Homo Sapiens Virtualis ETHOLOGYST, like me, that loves to study human behavior without social or conventional constraints (eavesdropping on the wild and on the RADIO and OBSERVATION without interaction).GEAR ADDONSRight NOW, I just need some BINOCULARS added to the gear available or using the scope on its own (holding it without the rifle would be a quick fix, the rifle barrel has its concealment limitations) and AUTO FREQUENCY ACTIVITY SCAN for the radio, that‚Äôs it.CYA ON THE FIELD MOFOS ITS A GREAT GAME...!!!

								Hello. For an Early Access Game it has great graphics, a lot of activities to do and the sets you in a gloomy mood when exploring the Orca Island.Pros:- The concept of survival is real in this game, if you are out of resources, you die and you can't come back :) Once you die, your character cannot be brought back to life.- Game loadings are fast. I didn't encounter any neverending loading screen. - Game menu is simple and easy to use. Allowing you to optimize your sound, video, input options from Settings.- Customizable Keybindings from the Menu ( very helpful for a lot of players that want to have the same keybindings as they have in others games, as an example the inventory in this game is on ""G"". Normaly inventory would be on ""I"" or ""C""- There are plenty servers to choose from ( Official Miscreated servers or Community Servers ) - Spawning on map -> It is random generated in a couple of locations close to cities- Map orientation is based on Road Sings which leads you to towns and areas to explore (at first I was very confused where to go, but the road signs helped me a lot ) - Also you can find the map on Community Discussions area- HUD is looks clean and it displays the important character bars/debuffs such as life, food necessity, water necessity, etc debuffs: bleeding effects, radiation- The feature for First Person to Third Person view is amazing, brings you a little joy that you can see who exactly you are playing with :)- Crafting (bandages, buildings, traps, bags, weapons, arrows etc )- Gathering tools for crafting materials such ase Axe, Pickaxe, Hammer (Wood, rock, metal) that can be used in combat and the Axe hurts a lot :)- Weapons for various types(guns, assault rifles, sniper, knifes, bat, etc) but the amazing part is when you can craft a weapon into a better one such as  ""A bat with nails and a spinning saw pinned in the head of the bat""- Enemies of various types ( zombies, muscular zombie, hulk zombie, 2 headed dogs, wolfs and obviously PLAYERS ! ) watchout, players are not friendly ... or most of them aren't so be careful, I got killed 4 times before I understood- The map is great and has both ocean and mountains enviornaments, with beautiful views and areas to explore by foot or via a transport vehicle ( bike, car ) at least that is what I've seen so far.  But be aware when exploring, you might encounter enemies anywhere.- You can have your own base by bulding it.- Option to join a clan and have trusted players to play with- Inventory is intuitive and easy to understand. I like the fact that you have maximum of 40KG that you can hold and items that you pick up have a specific ammount KG. You cannot pass 40KG and move slower, but it will display a message in chat that you cannot carry any more weight.- Movement seems easy, is nice that you can peek,lean on a corner, jump, crouch + FREE look if you press ALT- You can also power up generatos in towns to start the lights on the streets, its really cool :DCons:- I created a backpack, I added some items in it to lose some weight and left the backpack on the floor where I was building my base. 5 minutes later the backpack was gone- Building a base takes a lot of time due to the fact that there is no automatation made in crafting to craft multiple items of the same type by a click. Like you need 7 logs for A wall and you must click for each craft ... 7 clicks for mats + 1 more for wall- Bikes are really aweful to control, you can paddle without problem if there are no obstacles at all but If you run into an object with your bike, is gonna take some time for you to unstuck it because back-paddling is very very veeeeeery slow.- Guns pass through objects ...  missing collision with some objects for example: walls in houses/windows ... when you search in a house try to have your gun down or you risk to give your position to other players in the area if they are around and easier for them to spot and kill you after or even come after you in your scavaging hunt.- Monsters are easy to to kill and not that many. Hulks are easily killed by ramming a car in them and the pack of wolfs are ferocious but engaged by 2 players they are zero  "

								I've had more fun with this game than DayZ and I think that says quite a bit. Unfortunately this game has been in development and early access for sometime and that's always something to be wary of but I'm quite comfortable with the state of the game as is (I bought this game in mid-December 2016). The map isn't ridiculously huge so it's not just a hiking simulator, and gear and equipment is relatively easy to find. And its also pretty easy to get a vehicle going, just have to look around the town you're in pretty good and you can almost always find everything you need. This does make the game a little more fast paced than DayZ but in my opinion that's a good thing since your death won't always feel like a massive blow and you won't have to go on yet another massive expedition to re-gear.Graphics are pretty good (game runs on cryengine) and the atmosphere is nice. Night is really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing dark and there is a fog that comes in time to time that really limits your vision. Field of view is locked to 55 (:vomit:) but you can go into the game's folder and edit this in the system file. Also when I am exploring new areas my FPS drops to like 15 (I have a GTX 980), but when I go back to previously loaded areas I get around 60-80 FPS.A big complaint that I have with this game is that currently there is a game-breaking bug where if someone pulls out a gun and sprints, there is a chance that other players around will hear a gunshot from that weapon. It is especially bad if you are in a group of people because you will not really be able to tell from glitch gunshots to actual ones. Fall damage is also pretty high and there are issues with duplication of items. Bases are easy to get into if you have an axe and are willing to spare 10~ minutes breaking down a wall (though there might be another wall). And just like any other survival PvP game, be prepared to die a lot! But as I said before the map is not gigantic and gear is easy to get.Also another thing to be aware of is that you CANNOT PRONE in this game. This is a big counter to bush wookies but there are some times when I'm wishing I could. This really all depends on your playstyle however.I do very much recommend this game but bear in mind the survival aspect is really only limited to finding food and drink and not dying in PvP. However, wait to buy this game on sale because it'll really feel like you got an amazing deal.			"

								Very good multiplayer survival/apocalypse game, which is worth the money if you are into these kind of games. The developers keeps updating it and keeps making it better, by adding more stuff to the game. It is one of the better survival games out on steam right now, and it looks like it will keep getting better and better.			"

								Okay, I'll be real here. This game is alright so far, nothing about this game has made me quit or want a refund. I just play it for a couple of hours and then take a brake from it till an update comes out. I have had some intense moments on this game. In my opinion It actually gives off a post apocalyptic theme. The community, the smooth fps, and the textures are great for an alpha. I would totally recommend this game. Or you could wait till it reaches beta.			"

								I'm a great fan of the post-apocalyptic, open-world, sandbox genre, and Miscreated is my favorite among the many titles of this ilk. Why? Because they are developing with the end-game in mind.Open-world games are plagued by a common question: ""Ok, I'm geared up. What do I do now?"" This creates a very strong exit point, and many gamers will stop playing, never to return. Miscreated has a solution to this problem: Base Building. They're not the first to have this idea, but their implementation (even in their first iteration) is excellent. It's free-form. There's no snap to grid. There's no ""voxel"" system (aka minecraft/space engineers). The possibilities are limited only by your imagination... and the blueprints you find.Blueprints are an excellent design feature: Blueprints are lootable ""plans"" that unlock new types of building parts. They also reveal medical and weapon recipes. But here's the thing: They're super-rare. And there are tiers. Although you can build a basic base right when you spawn, you have to constantly search the world, especially high-risk areas, to find the elusive blueprints. And this is a brillant linkage between base-building and looting. Looting in this game is risky, much like in DayZ. But the drive to find new blueprints is a strong incentive to contantly take those risks.Overall, I've alreay gotten so much more than money's worth, and it's still very early in development. I'm a developer myself, and it's clear to me that the Entrada team is highly competent, and has created a development and asset pipeline that's highly efficient and high-quality.Also, this game is utterly gorgeous. The level design is hands-down the best I've ever seen. There's lots of love put into the environments, and little touches everywhere to keep you immersed. Graffiti telling you to ""get out,"" bloody mattresses, massive piles of trash bags, etc. Also, the map is designed to create interesting tactical situations. There are choke-points everywhere, and high-value buildings often force you into a tactical disadvantage.Obviously there are plenty of things that need tuning and polish. Gunplay/controls feel a bit ""stiff,"" there are bugs and netcode/sync issues. I find netcode and server-client synchronization is a challenge in all games of this genre. Because this is early alpha, I will withold judgment on things like animations, controls, stability/quality, and core feature content until I'm relatively sure the game is near completion.Overall: Buy this game. Do it.			"

								First day in the game:Went to empty server to learn the basics.Ran around finding gear (clothes, backpack, knife, etc.)Ran around some more blindly cause there's no map system you have to rely on memory, landmarks, & signs which is AWESOME!Saw some deer, tried to kill deer, deer don't die. No monsters around started getting bored.Then night came. Saw some mutant guys that looked like they were from the movie ""the hills have eyes"" (messed rednecks basically), they kicked my‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•Started over grabbing gear, found a squeegee! Then some a-hole took a shot at me. Snuck around behind him and killed him with squeegee! It was a clean death. Took his stuff and went to different server.Found a truck almost fully repaired with lots of shotgun ammo in it. Perfect for my shotgun. Took ammo and ran. About 10 min. later a guy in a truck tries to run me down, can't imagine why? Ran into the woods ""serpenteen, serpenteen"". Thank god for trees and crappy drivers.The lowdown is this is a good game with the potential to be an epic game.As long as they add some variety of monsters & stay away from a money/barter system to keep rich boys and goldfarmers away.Didn't run into any hackers & few monsters but that was a good thing since they pose a real threat to the player.

								This game could get a lot better.  If the devs work hard and the community supports their effort, a LOT better.  But right now, as is, it's a great start.  The environment is beautiful, in an insidiously creepy way.  Enemies, other players, and falling off stuff is suitably and satisfyingly dangerous.  When you spawn fresh, you feel very vulnerable and isolated.Fantastic job for an alpha.  Can't wait for base building and other features.  Should be fun seeing how it develops.			"

								Only have about 9 hours into it so I'm just barely scratching the surface.  But from what I've seen so far this is a pretty amazing survival game.PROS:AMAZING WORLD AND GRAPHICS.  This is hands down the most lovingly hand crafted world I've explored in the whole survival sim craze.  The overgrown feel is great and the every building bush and tree looks amazing.  SOUND:  Pretty good so far.  From the soft russel of bushes as you creep through them to the thud of your shoes as you  explore a building is great.  COMBAT:  From what little I've had it's been satisfying.  The Zeds drop with a well placed headshot which feels great.  INVENTORY:  Pretty straightforward and not clunky at all.  SURVIVAL GAMEPLAY:  Food and water are abundant enough where it's not a nusance to survive.  From the lowliest trailer park to the biggest house I haven't had trouble finding what I need to keep myself fed and hydrated.  Everything else as far as guns, ammo, craftables and such seem to be well balanced and sparse so far.  The overall feel to surviving is rewarding thanks to well designed sound ques.  Such as hearing the howling of a pack of wolves while trecking through the wild letting you know to keep quite and head the other way.  The sound of the Zeds inform you of their wereabouts.  Been able to avoid most combat by crouching, watching, listening, and being stealthy.  PROGRESSION:  Though I've only barely begun to dabble in base building it's been pretty clunky but passable.  But what I do really like is finding new ""plans"" that let you learn new base building parts.  This is great because it adds to your sense of progression when you find one.  It's nice to unlock that new piece to liven up your base and watch it grow from a humble hideaway to a proper fort.   CONS:Not many so far but here's a few (some of which just come down to personal preference)Zeds getting stuck on scenery.  Seen this mostly in the bigger towns.  When holding a gun it lowers itself after only a few seconds.  Wow this one really gets me.  If I find a shotgun and I'm exploring a particularly hostile location I'd REALLY like it if my gun didn't lower itself all the time.  It's maddening to have to click a key or press my left mouse button to bring it back up to a ready position.  If  you run smack dab into another player who's stalking you that split second it takes to hit a key to bring it back up could cost you your life.Inventory glitching out.  Seems like when I've logged in the next day some of my stuff has dissapeared.  Might be just me but I swear I had an axe in my inventory and a smaller backpack when I logged off last night.  Map size is smallish.  This one is completely personal preference.  Like most of us I got into the whole zombie thing by exploring Chenaris which is huge.  BUT...... I have to say what is here is COMPLETELY top notch and lovingly crafted.  So it's just me wishing there was alot more of it  ;)  CONCLUSION:Probably the most fun I've had in a long time in the zombie survival catergory.  The cons are small and non of them gamebreaking.  Looking forward to what will be added next to the game as it is still in early access.  To the DEVS:  CHEERS AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!			"

								It's A Wonderful game reallyIma make this review really useful and tell you how this game goesYou enter a simple screen letting you choose you player name and find a serverservers are not empty and have players playing.You spawn in a very optimized and beautiful world, a very green one and very fun to run inFood isnt rare and can be found in any normal houseDoesnt feel like a running simulator since there are towns and houses and stuff to explore always10 - 15 min you should find a weapon, but thats not that rare. Finding ammo for that weapon is rare ;)There are lots of clothes and cosmetics to find that can make you look intimidating and badass as f*ckThe mutants and the wolves arent a threat at all as you can see\hear them from a kilometer and avoid them easily ( most of the times)The real deal is the other players as it can get really tence and heart pounding when you know there is another dude with a gun in town.The guns are very nice and intresting but you will mostly encounter shotguns, pistols and a sniper.Fights are very scary as there are lots of objects, buildings, bushes and grass obstructing your view and that sh*ts scary when you know someone is around but you cant see him.Pros: Weapons are not hard to findYou will encounter atleast 2 or more survivors in 30 - 60 minlots of building and townstense and action packed gameplayCons: You die very very quickly if shotIts hard to make a car work as you need lots of partsYou have to be a douchbagHealth regenrates very very slowlyOverall its an amazing stressful, tense action packed open world survival game and definitely better then most of over games in its genre easy 8.5 \ 10Buy this, you will enjoy ;)			"

								Rating: 8.5/10+ Graphic fidelity is top notch and you can tell the devs spent a lot of time building an immersive environment. There are so many small details that were obviously handcrafted that add to the realism. I've spent hours just riding around on a mountain bike exploring the terrain. (Kinda makes Dayz/H1Z1 look like minecraft.)+ Well optimized: Getting 60+FPS in most situations on high settings with a GTX 970+ Lots of butt clench moments even in low population servers. (There are plenty of healthy full servers but I find the low-medium pop servers are even scarier as you run into survivors when you least expect it. On a server with only 5 players I will still encounter someone every 20-30mins or so in major areas.)+ Active development team. Map keeps growing and bugs are getting squashed.+ Really fun with friends (when you finally find them / until someone randomly kills you)___________________- No compass and the pickup item map is vague & outdated! Finding friends is a pain in the !@# right now.- Base building is a little wonky and there is no real storage other then vehicle trunks.- Too few vehicles / loot. Groups with bases horde everything and generally kill on sight.- Gunplay could use some work... but it does feel better than most competitors in this genre..- A.I. monsters are glitchy and pretty stupid in general. Only scary when you are trying to hide from other players.- It doesn't take long to get looted enough were there is really no reason to go on because you can't store anything. - PVE elements are really lacking at this point. Eventually you just get bored and want to kill everyone/yourself.Overall: Beautiful well optimized game with amazing potential that is definitely worth picking up. It really just needs a compass, better signage / landmarks & map, more loot, more vehicles, and a proper storage system.			"

								Without doubt THE best survival game out there. Stunning graphics, very active development, good size map which is expanding with further development, PvP and PvE nicely balanced.It is really fun seeing this game develop. With every version update (at least monthly), the game is improving each time.Mixed reviews on steam is just crap, nobody that plays this game can give it a legitimate negative review based on the current state of the game. Sure there are things that are a little glitchy at the moment, but they are very minor and are being fixed with each update. The glitches are no worse than some AAA game titles I have played recently.This game is easily worth $50 as it is today. $20 is a steal. Buy it now.Edit: Don't bother trying to give feedback on this game though, the mods on the forums remove and lock threads showing faults with the game. Quite sad really, and detrimental to an early access game.			"

								This is a truly amazing game, I don't even know where to start.PROS:-Dev team updates often-Gorgeous CryEngine graphics & textures-Vehicles that are a ton of fun to fix up and drive-Great combat, lots of different weapons-Fun community-Cool setting, feels like a zombie game but actually is about post-nuclear war survival with mutants (basically zombies)-Pretty big map, big expansion coming very soon for a huge city-Extremely detailed (way diff than dayz detail, way more thought put into each building)-Awesome FPS, unlike dayz you can easily get a butter smooth framerate with a half decent comp. Even runs well on low end pcs at low settings.-Base building that is fun as hell.  You can basically build anywhere you want, hold down a road if u like. Creates interesting gameplay-Dynamic weather is interesting and scary (storms actually make the game feel eerie)CONS:-Private servers are only available through one provider.  Kinda slimy and I assume a way for the devs to cut extra profit, the provider is also overpriced. -Server files aren't public, so making a modded server with oxide or any API will not be possible :(-Dying happens really fast. If you get shot in the head or chest and its a kill shot, you will instantly go to a death screen and not be able to see how you died or who killed you.  You almost never even hear the gun fire that killed you because it instantly turns to death screen. -No storage system for bases yet, but apparently coming in the next patch so don't let that discourage you. Overall this game is a lot of fun.  The devs update a lot and the gameplay is awesome.  I wish they would make server files public and will continue to fight for that to happen. Join this community and help it grow, it deserves more praise than DayZ which is a barely functional ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•how of a game that will never work.			"

								A hard-core survival game that leaves you checking around every corner.Miscreated is a beautiful game, the forest and grass look amazing and as you wonder though the open world you really do get the feeling that you are in fact surviving.  The player v player aspect is brutal, almost everyone will shoot first and ask questions later so keep your whits about you and trust no one.  The PVE aspect is somewhat lacking.. in the 9 hours I've played I've only seen 3 zombies, but do remember that this is an early access game and I am sure this will be changed as the game develops.  Looting is a long task, finding a weapon is quite hard and ammo the same story but both can be found with a bit of persistence, food and water can easily be found within any of the built up areas and random tools and items can be found throughout these areas also.  There are vehicles on the game and most require you to collect parts to get them functioning (batteries, spark plugs etc) but again this is a quite easy talk.All in all I am very impressed with this game so far, when you spot an enemy you have to make a quick decisions, Kill/be killed or Run and hide and this really does increase your heart rate, especially if you have just found some good loot and dont want to lose it. A totally absorbing survival game.I would definitely recommend this game to any survival game fan.			"

								Okay, I thought it was gonna be yet another crappy early access survivor game....it basically is, lets be honest. But to be fair it's basically a better H1Z1, a much better infestation or whatever the hell those greedy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s are calling their game this week. Not as good as DayZ after thier 6.0 patch in my opinion but this game isn't bad at all and worth the $20 bucks if you got it to throw down for one of these games.Generally I think this game suffers from a pretty unintuative user interface (I had a gun, pressed R to reload ammo from my inventory into it...had to do it through the G menu). The loot tables are pretty slim pickings, But I think this is pretty common for these kinds of games, one week its guns and ammo everywhere and next week theres no food anywhere cause devs are always messing with it, which is fine. I think alot of the animations are pretty janky, which is fine. performance is actually...pretty damn good, had 60+ FPS with no hitching or drops (had two small 2 second hiccups while it was raining super hard, which is pretty dismissable)Overall, this thing has potential to be decent and in the very least a nice break from DayZ while they are getting their‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•together for some of the patches where the game is literally unplayable, decent work devs. Keep it up, but it's a long road ahead for you boys.

								This game feels like a hybrid between H1Z1 and DayZ in many aspects. The feel of the gameplay along with the community is very similar to H1, whereas the game itself and the loot system is much like DayZ. Miscreated itself has a very nice looting system to where you can get pretty decently geared in under 30 minutes making the game much more enjoyable. In this game you don't feel like a death will be a total waste of time in comparison to DayZ because that game takes forever to loot as well as the map sizing just all makes it very difficult. This is where the H1 comparison comes in because the map is smaller, there is loot, but H1 is littered with bases and clans. Miscreated shares the aspects of a small map and good loot, but has little to no clans in addition to bases. In conclusion, I would recommend this game if you are someone who doesn't have a crazy amount of time on there hands but still wants to enjoy a survival pvp game. There is actually a good loot system, there is a balance between friendlys and bandits, and the map isn't too big nor too small.One complaint is that some of the server admins are a bit abusive at times. For instance, today I logged about 10 minutes and only that because when spawned, I made my way to the airport to grab some gear. As doing so, I managed to find myself a handgun with seven rounds and decided to progress further into the airport. I entered a small bunker with bunkbeds scattered throughout and heard footsteps from outside, so I simply hide myself praying I don't get totally oblitterated due to the fact it's a high loot area. Sure enough a dude with more gear I have ever seen to one guy enters the room and I shot him multiple times out of pure fear and dropped him instantly. As soon as I approched his body, I was kicked from the server. I don't believe this was a game crash, I heavily believe that this was the admin or an admin's frined because of how quickly the chain of events happened.			"

								Hands-down, the best and most underrated multiplayer survival game there is. It's absolutely gorgeous, runs really well on an average PC and it has everything a title like this needs, including the great community of people that you meet in-game, this is not a kill-on-sight game (unless you want it to be).10/10, these developpers have all my support and trust.

								Its fantastic! but what i find is most people arent the talking type in this. Beautiful graphics and so much more id suggest buying this game, its good if you like PvE/PvP games as well as open-world too but i suggest if ur not the loner type try to find a friend that has it. im aloner at the moment and surviving on your own in this can sometimes make you nervous. But if anyone gets this game and is looking for someone to play just message me and ill help you out.			"

								I originally game this game a very negative review and was too quick on the trigger.  I'm now reversing my thoughts on this game and have to give the dev team massive respect for what they've been able to do with this game. To be the size that they are they have easily been able to match what DayZ and H1Z1 offer and in many cases do things better. The visuals and attention to detail is absolutely astounding.  They are the ONLY survival game that truly gives a realistic atmosphere of being in a post apocalyptic world!  The world is beautiful and the dev team continues to throw new things at the game each patch.  The latest patch #36 has been glorious adding an entire new city to the map on top of new features.I truly believe this game is underrated and missed by many gamers who have probably read very early reviews on the game. It is definitely a steal for the current sale price of $10 and I have to say that it's currently the best game in the survival game batch!  Way to go Dev Team, looking forward to what you all bring next!!!			"

								This game I feel is a complete underdog next to Rust, DayZ and many others ...... It has a hell of alot of potentional.    Level design is awesome actually feels like a real place. It's BEAUTIFUL hads down looks really good. It's like your walking through Detroit house's are over grown as they should.. For what other games make up in size this game is make up for a dense super rich enviorment. It feels organic. This game is a complete underdog. Granted it's currently doesn't have basebuilding but I am one who could careless about that stuff.  Small dev team but these guys all have a LOVE FOR THIS PROJECT AND IT SHOWS!!!!. I highly recommend this game highly			"

Early Access Review
								It has potential...but if you're looking for an alpha game that is rewarding and enjoyable, this is not a good choice presently, as it is a long, long way off from being a fulfilling experience.  There are simply too many other better (read: functioning) early access titles out there.Pros : Great graphics, pretty well designed map (though there is no compass or in-game map).  Atmosphere is great, until you realize...Far too little to do, and far too many frustrating bugs exist for me to give it a recommendation at this point.  That is, of course, if you can actually connect to the servers to see what the actual game looks like.  Many users simply cannot connect to game servers or experience constant crashes and freezes and are completely unable to get into the game world.If you're not affected by these bugs and you can actually load in, you're mostly spending all your time building a base (that cannot store any items) or you are searching endlessly for loot.  If you happen to come across ultra rare items (assault rifle, sniper rifle, ammo for those weapons, guides) there is a very real possibility that your inventory will glitch out and those items will simply disappear after you log out or if the server resets.  There's just not much to do, and what little bit there is, is pretty unpolished and pretty buggy.  Food and water is extremely plentiful, so the only ""survival"" aspect of this game is surviving encounters with other players.The only real ""excitement"" that comes after the novelty of searching endlessly for loot wears off, is in the player interactions....  Like all of these survival genre games, it basically boils down to1.  Shoot them (or get shot at)2.  Engage in parlay, team up (for no real purpose other than safety in numbers)3.  Run awayThe mutants in the game, which make up the bulk of the PVE aspect, are pretty scarce and a joke if you have any competency whatsoever in a FPS.  Right now they seem to serve mainly as placeholders, and I sincerely hope that more is done with them so that there is a strong push for survivors to work together, rather than just make this another DayZ clone and its nothing but bandits and griefing.If the inventory system can get sorted out, and storage is actually added... and some server stability.... This game has huge potential.   Add in NPCs, maybe questing, actual PVE type activities...Could be big.Unfortunately, fixes and updates are coming at a snail's pace and despite the improving interaction from the Developers the current bugs and slow progress is resulting in even less people playing (hardly any play as it is) and the very real possibility of the  game disappearing into limbo as so many other Early Access titles normally do.  Why on Earth would you release such a broken game, alpha stage or no, when all you've done is really hurt your public persona and shot yourself in the foot?   A lot of people are feeling burned by this and the incredibly slow progress to solving some of the most critical game bugs is not confidence boosting in any way, shape, or form.  The Developers have admitted to the multitude of problems and confirmed they are indeed trying to work on them, but as stated above, the pace at which things have been progressing is awful.  They have mentioned a total item re-work is coming, which in theory should solve a multitude of server side issues, including latency, stability, performance. So in conclusion, this game has great potential and if the Devs can get their issues sorted out with this engine, this could be the next big thing in the survival genre.  However, as time keeps ticking with no tangible progress (from the user's perspective) I believe they are slowly (if they haven't already) losing their window of opportunity to really grab people's attention (and money).My recommendation is to hold off until the new inventory system is implemented so that we can gauge how effective this new system is at solving a multitude of issues.TLDR-Game has potential (graphics, atmosphere, map, promised features)-A lot of game breaking bugs, glitches and otherwise missing features that really impact how functional and enjoyable the game is currently-Devs are working hard on the game, but progress have been slow-Playerbase is tiny and dwindling due to the aforementioned problems-Patience is required if you purchase now, but you're better off watching and waiting until the next big update comes			"

								It's EARLY Alpha testing stage at the moment, but it's looking so amazing already! Playing pretty well, and showing great potential. So far, I have run away from mutated, irradiated, and clearly irritated monstrous AI people. Found a gun, and a hatchet, food and drink, better clothing and shoes. I ran into a couple of players the other day, but I was playing on a server with a ping of almost 350, so I wasn't able to keep up with them and we separated again. Nobody felt the urge to kill one another, which was refreshing. I found a tower. A wooden tower. With ladders and stuff. For about 2 minutes, I ummed and aahed about it, then dared myself, and finally braved the ladders. I made it to the top safely. I then searched the tower and headed back down the ladder again. I made that too, without harm. Take that, DayZ!			"

								The game is awesome for early access alpha. New base building system is going to be pretty nice and original.It strong and weak points:+Graphics are awesome. Even better than in DayZ SA+Physics are realistic+Atmosphere of post-apocalyptic future is really thrilling because of blood, fearsome notes on walls of the buildings and so on+Cars and boats-You can hear shooting from the nearby town or village, for example you are in Pinecrest and you hear shotgun in Sultan-Car components are too heavy. It is practically unreal to repair a car without friends-Zombies sometimes disappear while entering any building-There are still no compass and in-game map. For survival game these items are important as an air for humanBut it is only early access and it is not so huge amount of problems. I hope you would do everything to make your game the best of zombie-survival games.8.5/10			"

								The game plays fine as long as you're not driving but, it reminds me of Survival: Apocolypse Now. Players hording all the limited few weapons / vehicles in the game, building bases to block off roads, floating bases everywhere. Players blocking and/or, claiming high loot locations, hording the weapons, ammo and the like. Racist & power hungry moderators, and a community of gay‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•fan boys. Forced to play on one contracted server supplier and have to play by someone elses rules other than your own because, you can't run your own server unless you pay for it. As for the server OPs, once they find your base, if they don't raid it and see you have a lot of good things going on, they lock you out from logging in or, just ban you from the server and rob your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• That way, there's no worries about you logging back on the server for revenge. Some will also, change the name of the server or, make it whitelisted to prevent you from connecting to it anymore, less the ban. The game looks good, that's about all I can say positive about it. However, when you're riding along and your 4x4 blows up or, drops out from under you and you get teleported to bum-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-egypt then, that sucks. Not to add when you log in every time, you have nothing, nothing but your underware on. They don't do‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•about it. Driving the pickup truck is like playing on a pogo stick. I guess they like that part, riding on a stick. NO, I don't rocommend this to anyone.I will say one thing else, they certainly gave it the right name because, this game is, miscreated.This is a comment on one of the moderators profile...Riko Nov 13 @ 11:28pm It is because I was too busy waging Jihad against the filthy christian heathens in Europe....and she calls me a racist. o.0Update Edit: This last update #48, I would be ashamed to have released a mess of this kind and claimed to have fixed, anything. The best thing I could do with something like this would be to, act like an Ostrich and bury my head in the dirt.			"

								Updated review for 2017:I've been playing for about 2 years now, and about to hit 1,000 hours of play.  I've had fun, made friends, and still find interesting things to do.  I continue to look forward to improvements in features and content that are planned.I do recommend this game for players interested in pvp shooters, and there are a lot of fun features, but I will emphasize that you need to accept that it remains an early access game.Pros:*Sizeable and growing map that looks good and gives you a lot of diverse elements to explore.*A big variety of weapons and other gear to be found/scavenged/looted, and with a little experience you shouldn't find it hard to get geared up.*Not truly hard to keep hydrated and fed, I approve the balance of this, though it's a work in progress also.*Suitable and decent communication features in game.*Base crafting and a bit of other crafting. Base building is in a relatively early state and expected to receive a big overhaul this year (including a goodbye to floating bases). The hard core survival aspect continues to evolve and has been highlighted by devs for future enhancement.*A variety of fun vehicles.  I've enjoyed the challenge of finding the missing parts.  You don't need vehicles to travel the island, and in many ways they are a liability, but vehicles are FUN.  Recent changes have even made the boats fast enough to have a chance to dodge a bit of fire, making them more viable.  In the latest patch we can even ""push"" vehicles, which opens up a number of other interesting options.*The game has grown increasingly popular and you won't have trouble finding a variety of active servers.Cons:*Annoying bugs, exploits and gltiches that nearly (but not quite) ruin gameplay are a part of early access, and it is true of Miscreated right through the present.  This developer has not failed to keep adressing each one, but just be aware that it is a smallish indie dev and the game isn't out of the woods yet.  Item persistence and storage is good, but not flawless, there are still cases of falling (or driving) through the map, though somewhat rare.  Headshot damage is a particularly troubling issue that works correctly on some servers and not on others.  It is one of several high priority issues acknowledged by the devs.  If you can't dismiss these types of things as they come and go, then wait for a later release of the game.*Development is hindered somewhat by a netcode that can't quite support the goals of this game, and in fact Entrada Interactive is likely to replace the whole networking layer, so this isn't really a con, but hopefully a work in progress.  The Cryengine is expected to be updated to a newer version at some stage, although even an entirely new engine seems to be not out of the question.Summary and other:The game has always attracted a lot of interest from adventure/survival players who are not intent upon KOS gaming.  This is NOT a con either unless you want to avoid pvp game play, and they clearly hyped the game as ""no rules"" around the time I bought it.A number of servers state rules dictating other kinds of gameplay, but here is my final word on this having played all manner of servers and rule sets available including whitelisted servers;  server rules are little more than a suggestion, and difficult to enforce fairly even where admins are involved.We realize that the nature of online games means that many players will behave badly and generally disregard rules where they are able to act with impunity.  Players can get banned, server logs can be reviewed, but overall this makes for a poor solution.  Online games can only be decently enjoyed where the game itself enforces rules by design.So what we have in Miscreated is a very good survival/adventure/open world/pvp plus AI shooter where you can have fun if you take it for what they've said from the start ""Survival with no rules!""  If that's for you, you'll find it on 50% off now and then.  Cheers!ps- If you want unlimited storage play something else.  Also, the game looks great even with modest settings, but it is important that your hardware meets the minimum requirements if you want to play at all!			"

								This is clearly the most beautiful and noob friendly survival game out there. I am somewhat surprised that the other survival games (h1z1/dayZ) get more attention than this. Miscreated offers pretty much the same experience as all the survival games, but it runs and looks A LOT better. Killing on sight is a thing apparently (never happened to me though) because at the end of the day Miscreated is another ""Deathmatch game"" on a huge map, but so far out of all survival games I've had the best experience with the people in Miscreated. I just hope that one day developers will take their survival games a step ahead and make their giant deathmatch more like a team deatchmatch (with Friendly Fire off), where people without a 10 men strong clan can still enjoy some (false) sense of security.

								This game is immersive and the new weather systems puts it over the top. The devs are working hard to get this game finished, which is a nice change of pace from the many other perpetual alpha games out there. The visuals are fantastic as well. Night time is a legit darkness. If you don't have your flashlight on (for example; when you're looting a house) you can't see a damn thing. Your screen is literally black. Throw in some bad weather and it gets a little crazy and spooky. I was just upstairs in a house during a storm and I faintly heard the footsteps of someone entering the house. At first I thought it was the mutant that was hanging outside, but I could still hear him growling at the side of the house. This was another player in the house with me. I assumed he saw my light through a window or something. I could hear him moving about and my heart was pounding. I hunched down in a corner and pointed my shotgun in the genral direction of the stairs. I could only hope I was looking in the right direction because I didn't dare turn on my flashlight and give myself away. I occasionally heard him move, despite the storm....and he was getting closer!  Right when I thought I was a goner I saw his dark melon head passing a window. Blam! Ninja bandit down. The tactical shotgun at close range is a beast. Thank you for the chocolate bar, Mr. Ninja Bandit.This game is worth the money and it's only going to get better as new features are added.			"

								(Early Access review) -29/2/2016-I believe the game has gotten a bad rap from it's earlier days it has certainly changed a lot from it's initial release and new patches seem to be released every 2-4 weeks the improve the game. (Devs livestream info and progress occastionally on their twitch http://www.twitch.tv/miscreated ) Devs seem active and clearly care about the survival aspect of their game.Pros~ Decent alternative for a less hardcore DayZ experience.  Loads of working vehicles.  Plenty of weapons to play around with (if you can find them).  Base building (simple as of now).Cons~ Map could be bigger (I love exploring!) Flying vehicles would be neat- Although not a must have.  A.I could be improved (Devs stated it would vastly improved soon [No ETA].  All around I think it's a decent game with loads of potential it's definetly not just a poor attempt on the genre they give other games a run for their money. I think it's worth the buy if you have the money and worst comes to worst get a refund. (Maybe try‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•for lower pricing)I know I'm not the best at reviews but I thought this game could do with some better ones.(before someone asks I've yet to run into any server issues).			"

								Imagine DayZ, but in the CryEngine with free-form base building, jumping and tornados.Very immersive, lots of potential, extremely fun and makes me happy.Though, please be aware, DayZ just got updated with the new rendering engine, making it pretty darn smooth and stable.Also, DayZ is still a bit more hardcore in terms of mechanics and gameplay than Miscreated is, while Miscreated still has better visuals. Definitely some competition between the two, but I'm not saying one is better than the other. I, personally, will always like DayZ a bit more because of how it plays.			"

								Miscreated.I came into this game with very low expectations, as I was not that into the whole zombie survival genre kinda thing. I owned Dayz, but after 20 hours of so of it I became frustrated with the clunky-ness of the game and the toxicity of the community. So when launching up this early access zombie game I was prepared for the worst.But those next few hours were some of the most fun hours I've ever had on a steam game. The graphics and scenery were blissfully captivating, the controls were simple and quick to pick up as I quickly loaded myself with gear. Despite the low player number, within 20 minutes i found my first other player, who was awesome and friendly, so I rolled with him for awhile. We managed to get ourselves caught in a firefight, in which I solo took down a decked player with just a hatchet. It was the most thrilling thing I have ever experienced in an online game. And for the next 30+ hours I've spent engrossed in this game that thrill has continually been present. And with each update that gets rolled out more and more awesome content is brought in to make the game ever more exciting and thrilling to play.Get your friends to join you. There is nothing better than rolling around in a tractor taking out enemies as you go, or accidentally getting caught up in a tornado (yes, there are tornadoes). Honestly this game is worth the cost, especially since they put it on for 50% off a lot of the time. Framerate may be an issue if your looking for a game with a solid 60 FPS, but at the moment no zombie survival game seems to have managed to get that unless you have a supercomputer. I have a low-grade laptop that gives me 30 frames and I get THIS much enjoyment from Miscreated.So what are you waiting for?Get surviving.P.S This game deserves every award.			"

								I have 1000 hours clocked between h1 survival and DayZ. Less than 10 hours clocked with this and It's safe to say this has the most potential out of the lot. Great detail to environments on an engine that isn't powered by a potato. Despite being alpha, I have not yet come accross any bugs which has surprised me.  Already had some great experiences in game and know there are many more to come. Big thumbs up from me and I hope this game gets the traction it deserves. If you are a fan of the surival genre, support this game.			"

								Compared to other survival apocalypse games this one seems to have less bugs and has regular updates which makes this the choice for me at this time.  The graphics look very nice as one would expect given the engine thats used. They are still building parts of the map,  so far it's quite detailed with flora and fauna and some interesting wildlife.  There are water falls, lakes, ponds mountains and valleys.  There are also numerous caves which have some interesting features.  The towns do feel like they have been decaying over a long period of time and nature is creeping back.  overall a very good game with very good potential once more features are added.  "

Early Access Review
Miscreated...ah, I love this game.First let me start off by clarifying that yes, my time on record is minimal (not sure why, seeing as i've played way more than 4 hours). But, I don't need 2000+ hours to accurately describe this game. Let me cover some pros/cons for you.Pros:+Beautiful graphics and atmospshere (night time storms got me shaking in my boots): At first i never realized that this game ran off of cryengine. But, it does and the weather and atmoshpere in this game are AMAZING because of it, especially at night. That being said, this game is probably a bit resource heavy for older computers.+Comprehensive crafting and loot system: You can craft a lot of stuff, from structures to storage and various other things; and place it uniquely in the world. Granted some things require plots to build by, this is a minor nuisance.+Enemies are not all zombies: Thank the heavens, the enemies are not all the same generic zombies like a certain survival game (ehem...dayz). At its current state, it has wolves as well as various types of mutants.+UI is nice: It is clean and easy to use. Characters react decently to the enviroment and the ability to eat food quickly without having to pick it up first is a godsend.+Combat is engaging: All weapons are a bit different in their use and range, and they fixed the reloading issue so guns are more viable now.Cons:-Respawn: This is my number one gripe with these survival/openworld zombie games and it exists in this game. Yes, you die and you lose everything on your body (rather it stays on your corpse until you run back and get it if someone hasnt stolen it) and spawn somewhere completely random.Further explanation: I get it, it is supposed to be hardcore. But here is the thing, the point between when you become well-established (meaning: you dont have to spend 4 hours looking for a hatchet to build shelter, or a backpack to carry more then a can of peaches and a flashlight, etc) in the game and when your a lonely fresh spawn is quite a while. Meaning, you can reach what is essentially ""getting-by"" and then end up just getting killed and starting all over. Which sucks. Especially, if you have a base and supplies and your just figuring out where everything is. Add on top of that, you dont start with a map or compass even. You just end up in a bush somewhere. My solution? Add a bedroll or bed or something like the game Unturned has that you can craft and then claim and respawn at when you die, giving you the 60sec respawn timer to spawn at your bed or a 10sec timer to spawn in a random spot if you so wish. This will give players a sense of hope in that if they die, they don't have to spend 12+ hours re-finding everything they just slaved hours beforehand finding. They won't have to search for their own base. Make the bedroll destroyable and make it so you can only utilize one. If this idea is too extreme (which, from what i've seen it works great, even on a super small map like Unturned's) make it so players at least start with a map and compass so they can find the base they spent hours, if not days working on; instead of wandering around in some bushes lost AF. Please Devs, do this.-Finding the necessary items: Don't get me wrong, the loot system in Miscreated blows DayZ's out of the water in my opinion. See con number 1. Finding the proper tools as a fresh spawn takes time and dedication. Just tonight, it took me a few hours to find a hatchet. Finally get one and get established and players will end up dying and spending another 3 hours looking for a hatchet. repeat.-Global chat: Would like a global chat to communicate with all in the server. Option to hide it would be swell as well.-Nameplates: I don't know if i missed this, but i think you have to be right next to someone to see their name. If it even pops up. I don't know. All i know is every person i've looked at i've had to ask for their name.Overall thoughtsThis game is great, it just needs polishing. The state it is in now is 100x better than it was a few months ago. Fix the respawn issue and i think the game would be MAGNIFICENT. Hopefully, the devs over at Miscreated see this or try the implementation of bedrolls like i suggested. Maybe stats like in unturned would be cool too. Anyhow, that is all. i give it a 8/10.  -2 for respawn problem :) "

								Quick notice I played this game after patch #36 so I have no previous knowledge on the games state and problems previous to the patch.Pros:Good GraphicsWell placed and used foliage (especially when incorperating architecture into the foliage)Decently smooth gunplay (Still leaves some to be desired in custimization aspects)Great lighting and shading No draw distance settings (you wont get shot by someone who isnt even loaded in on your screen)Smooth vehicle controlsSmooth character control (Nothing is overcomplicated, just good old WASD with some jumping and free look)Clean UI (Could be more appealing but is simple to understand and use)In depth crafting system ( Especially when it comes to structures)Great map design and amazing architectureWorld is full of ""Volume"" (Not alot of empty space, theres always something to be admired or appreciated)Building models (Huge variety in shapes and colors, and when they do re-use a model they'll have a different interior layout)Cons:Mutant AI are lacking in responsivness (Sometimes they stutter due to connection problems, and are unresponsive to being shot or interacted with in any way)Graphical requirements (The graphics are good but I feel the requirements for them are a smidge high, nonetheless good graphics)Some ""querky"" animations (Characters disform from holding objects or going up a ladder, also pulling out weapons doesnt always have an animation which in a game with hostile people in it, the devs should make sure it's easy to tell whether someone is hostile based on weapon animations/sounds)Footsteps are extremely loud and overprojected (Very easy to hear someone come for you especially if theyre on wood floors)Jumping (Jumping can be spammed and the jump hieght is pretty high for a man carying 60 pounds of gear, the gunplay is ruined by the gun who runs around with a pistol bunny hopping his way through your bullets)Character customization (Theres is none as of patch #36)Again all of my experiences are from patch #36 so I don't know how well the games previous state is and this review does not include proper judgement of future patches.But overall it's a fun game full of depth, a must have for the ten dollar sell it's on right now :) "

If you complain how the game lags and it wont run great yadda yadda.. it is because of your computer. It is a beautiful game and it doesn't run on every potato out there. I bought this game about a year ago... for the first time tho.. i refunded it just for the simple reason: my pc didn't run it as good as i thought it to do.. I upgraded my GPU from 660 to 970 (2gb to 4gb) and i wanted to give it another shot. And im glad i did. The game is growing all the time and devs are into it. Well worth its money. I recommend!			"

Secondly the Mutaints, they are not really a real threat just kind of annoying. Maybe hordes would solve this issue? Lastly the map and player count are at a low 36. The playerbase deffinetly needs to grow a bit and the map needs to be expanded apon. "

Early Access Review
								Full review can be found below. I will be providing a quick pro's and con's summary at the top for those that can't be bothered to read words. Pro's:+ CryEngine. Powerful engine that is not used often.+ Graphics are better than most similar survival games.+ Unlimited potential. They want to do a lot with it, and they very well might.+ Cheap. $25 for an indie game is about right. Might seem a little high when compared to the $15 ones. Con's:- Brand new, unknown developer. No official studio, no known prior projects.- Lack of content (this is to be expected in its current stage).- Clunky animations of players, and AI.- Broken AI (absolutely not worth even playing for PvE content right now)- Boring. It boils down to going in and testing it out, while killing other players. That's all there is to do.- Map size is small, and player count too high (as the map expands, I imagine this will be less of an issue). I ran into people left and right when there were 12+ on the server. Ran into 2 people when it had 9 total on the server. Full Review:Development team - Unknown to the world. Appears that most of the people involved in the project are all overseas and they are coordinating via their website and Skype. No official studio location. The LLC (company) registers out of Utah and the address shows a million dollar home that's up for sale. No other projects that they have worked on that is worth mentioning... so what they are capable of, has yet to be seen.Premise of the game - It's a post apocalyptic world that has been done many times over. Lots of the same old farmland, mountains, and buildings spread out around the map. Only one major town on the map right now, and depending on your spawn point could be an absolute pain to get to. Story goes something along the lines of a (nuclear?) fallout war that destroyed the worlds nations and caused mutants in the process (these are the AI).Engine - Probably the biggest draw for me is the presence of the CryEngine. A pretty powerful engine, it fuels the game and does an ok job at it. Small things like water beading off of your face (screen) when swimming, and lighting is definitely gained from here. There are some issues that I'll explain more about later that I would imagine they'll need to smooth out with the engine.Graphics - Surprisingly, the game is stable with the graphics cranked to the max. I get about 50fps and not a single crash yet. The graphics look good, but certainly not amazing. We're not talking Crysis CryEngine level graphics here. They're definitely not going to require the absolute top of the line PC. I run a AMD 1075T (3.0ghz) CPU, an R9 270X 4G graphics card, and 16GB of g.skill RAM (1600mhz). I don't have any issues at all but then my set up is probably better than most casual players. I will say I was a little impressed with some of the lighting (like the flashlights at night) and effects. I had to immediately turn off the garbage head bob and blur.Performance - As stated above I get an average of about 50fps constant. I've not had any crashes though I did get a black screen after activating the showfps command. I ended up having to kill the process to get back in-game. Players are pretty smooth, though it's clear that some people do warp around a little (this could be a communication issue with everyone involved, or just that player having a bad connection). Most people I ran into, didn't do this for me.Anti-cheat -  Non-existent as far as I'm aware. I went onto the dev forums and asked about the anti-hack plans... I was told and I quote... ""We have a bunch of ninjas spying you"". I've asked for some clarification, but I'm wondering if they're going to try the whole approach that Nether did of, ""We'll monitor players with staff"". Which clearly failed.Content - As an early Alpha, it lacks all content. You have food and drink items, you have some melee weapons, a single pistol, but that's about it. Some clothing items makes your character model (same male figure for everyone) look a little different than the next guy, but not by much. At one point I found a pistol, and the largest backpack in the game... and that was end game for me. This is all expected to improve over time, so understand where it sits now in the development stage. Of note for future content is a building system shown in a video, vehicles, and more. AI - The game features mutants as opposed to zombies. Right now they're utterly broken. So stand in place and do nothing, some sprint around and lag out. Others stand still and hit you from dozens of feet away (by swinging their arm). There's only one mutant skin, so it got old real quick. Killing them? Not possible. Just hitting them did return damage to me and killed me. So don't even try it. There are some wild animals... but they also did return damage to me. I did see a mutant kill a deer, but I wasn't entirely sure I could do anything with the dead animal.War Z (Comparison) - Has the same feel to it. Same clunky animations, same map design look, and limited content. Graphics while a major step up, it pales in comparison to other CryEngine games and looks downright BLEH a lot of the time. I found some textures to be blurry and flickering... other things I could walk through or fall through. This all occurred in the War Z too and ruined any immersion I was seeking.Nether (Comparison) - Same clunky fast paced running which was also a trait from the War Z. The urban terrain was just there... buildings open, with items on shelves, on the floor, and in boxes. The most exciting thing to see is a refrigerator that opens and you can find something inside like food or a drink. Unlike both Nether and War Z, there wasn't a gear explosion when someone died. I was happy to see these devs took the time to make gear on the ground require some interaction. Buy or no buy - At this stage of the game I would wait. I'll recommend it as being worth getting but it's severely lacking. At the development stage it's in right now, I couldn't see getting too much out of it. You can run around and find stuff, kill someone, and then get glitch killed in return. Not very exciting. If you're hoping for content, now is not the time to buy in. If you want to help an indie developer... by all means for $25 you can get it on Steam. Solely up to you.			"

								Great graphics. Rich, detailed world. Plenty of places to explore and items to collect. Kit your character out in countless combinations from hundreds of clothing items. Find guides and build bases and advanced items to stay alive. Weather system makes the environment dynamic along with the 24 hour daytime cycles. An all round polished early access title that gets better in leaps and bounds with every release!			"

								Survivors log - Day one: I begin writing this in hopes someone...ANYONE will find it, for it seems...I am alone. After hearing some strange sounds I begin looking for people...It seems I can hear them all around me. As I spin around in a circle it seems I hear more, no wait. Is that my own footsteps? What is this clanking sound that makes me think I'm being shot at? Paranoia sets in as I trudge on down a dirt road. I soon spot a house that is of course abandoned I look everywhere for something to smack around these things that have been following me should they get ballsy enough. Nothing but a 'plebsi' and some ravioli...I look out the window to see a blurry house in the distance...yes, I must go there I tell myself. I keep hearing these sounds so I yell out ""Hey, IS ANYONE THERE''? No response of course..I run out the door, jump the 4-5 foot tall fence without a scratch and press on...More sounds, this time it sounds like someone is swinging. I turn around frantically looking for the source. NOTHING. My sight blurrs...then darkness all around me. I guess I closed my eyes because in an instant everything was back to normal. Just a fluke I guess..I make my way to the next house cautiously and find a hatchet! Oh, ho ho! The smile that came over my face...I grab the axe in my right hand and swing wildly cutting everything in the house...which oddly enough has the same sound for everything I hit. I begin to yell and taunt those following me with my outside voice...No response...It seems I'm getting tired...will continue log in the morning. Survivors log - Day 2: I begin my morning only to find for some reason everything I had found besides my axe were missing, 'no matter' I tell myself...'but that kinda sucks' I press on determined to find the lost 'plebsi' as I was a bit thirsty.  Wait wait, tomato juice ahh yeah. I crack it open and replenish myself. Walk outside and look at the sky...the clouds and sun frantically dance around which I don't remember seeing before. Maybe paranoia has gotten the best of me..I call out again 'Hey, anyone see this? The sky is weird' Again, nothing. I walk around aimlessly for an hour trying to find my way...One of those big scary mutants...another person...anything. Wildlife.. I don't find anything but a car battery and some handgun ammo..I'm going stir crazy...must...lay...down..			"

								[Shines with Roleplay!]At the time of this review, I have over 300 hours logged on the game. Is this H1Z1? Rust? Or any other game in the multiplayer survival genre? Somewhat, but in the areas that Miscreated shines it completely blows all the others in the genre out of the water! Sure, you could say the concept is similar. Find items, build some stuff, collect more items, build some more stuff, try not to die...When it comes to gameplay, for an Alpha/Early Access game it is fantastic! In many ways it puts others in the genre to shame. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are great, and the developers are extremely active and constantly adding substantial new content, bug fixes, and general optimizations every 2-4 weeks. Sure, there's a few bugs here and there and there are some things left to be desired... Base building in its current form is tedious, time consuming, and downright frustrating! However, the good far outweighs the bad in every aspect. Where this game absolutely excels is in how much it cators to the Roleplaying community. The developers seem completely aware of this demographic and have implemented items and resources that serve only to encourage more diverse and interesting RP. I've tried several servers, but the best are definitely the whitelisted / No KOS servers. Anyone can jump on H1Z1 or PUBG and engage in hours of PvP gunfights, but there are many players to be found in the Miscreated world that have years of RP experience and have robust, fully enthralling storylines that make for hours of entertainment and interactions. By and large the best server currently around is Resident Apocalypse. Extremely active admins and mod staff and rules that are strictly there for the devoted Roleplayer. Community on the server is top-notch and only emphasizes how fantastic Miscreated can be when all cylinders are firing. Highly recommend http://steamcommunity.com/groups/resapoc for information on one of the top RP servers, however there are many to choose from and it's just a matter of finding your home. Without RP:7/10. It is an Alpha build and there are some things that are a bit wonky, but nothing that would be enough to make someone want to stop playing. Plus with the constant stream of updates, it just gets better.With RP:9/10. This is where Miscreated shines. The only reason it gets a point off is because of base building and the other few minor bugs around. Otherwise, it's hours and hours of engaging fun every night!			"

								i'd recommend the game if you like survival genre. To those who dont read the game description before buying games , play half an hour and write bad review because it miss features, let me quote that line you can read above the comment section :  '' Current Features in the Early Access Release:Underground areas and base building will be added soon, but are not in the current release. Only a portion of the current map is available to play on. We will expand it as fast as we can. ''That being said, Underground area are being added and there is a couples of caves already you can explore.			"

								This review will be updated the more I dive into the game. It is an early access game so it should be treated as one.Its a post-apocalyptic survival game set on a 64 square km map, same as h1z1 but with more realistic terrain. You fight mutants, which behave like zombies. There is a few types of mutants atm and more will be added with updates.--- There is quite a few weapons in the game atm, ranging from knives to axes, from pistols to automatic rifles.--- Base building -> going to update this when I try it. Best watch the developer stream for best info on basebuilding.--- Best part you may ask? Active updates! The game had more updates recently than most survival games ever had.---You can use cars to get from one point to another, but first you have to check which components are missing. --- Crytek engine.--- Logical loot placementFurther info will be added later :). Highly recommend the game, but keep in mind the game is early access and might be missing features.			"

								this game is amazing, dont let yourself be discouraged by some minor bugs here and there, mostly desync and server disconnects. the map is awesome, not that big like dayz but really well designed, atmospheric and you have the feeling that your actually part of the world, the lightning is the best i have seen in a long time. pvp is good, you can actually hide in foliage and shadows, ive had great pvp moments so far. the community is friendlier than most survival games. open world survival game in cryengine as what everyone dreamt about. some people might take some time to adapt to the menus and UI but after that is smooth experience. i have played several open world survival games and this is the one that nailed it the most, the devs are really good and actively communicate with the players, and they know what they are doing regarding the game progression. there is no microtransactions so this is not a moneymilk scheme like H1*cough*... its really world the 20‚Ç¨ but at 10‚Ç¨ you are picking up a relic. give it a try, playing solo is great but with friends its even better. <the game dont have advertisment but is now gaining popularity, support this game by buying it if you like survival games, you will surely not regret it, just make sure to have a good gaming machine because it is a bit demanding :) "

								It's early Access, but it's rad. Gets love and attention, loot spawns change frequently after patching.Encourages exploration, dying, respawning, eating, drinking, chopping, building, and hatcheting of wolf packs. One may think it's a bit mean to kill wolves. They are not real wolves. Has squirels, which may possibly be rabid. I haven't been attacked yet by a mob of squirels, but you might want to carry an antiseptic bandage, just in case. Bites from a squirrel are not considered a risk for rabies unless the animal was sick or behaving in an unusual manner, and rabies is also widespread in the area. Before starting Rabies Treatment, consider if the animal looked sick and was behving normally, and consult a local Warden or Ranger to find out if rabies actually occurs in that region.Wolves, well you could pickaxe a rock, then chop a log, build a fire and cook them. Choose a nook to light it in if it is night time, or light it on a ridge above town, and be sure to sit facing away from town so that the smoke doesn't get in your eyes.			"

								So after about an hour of looting I find a friend and we start to travel around and then he asks for my gun so I tell him no. We then meet another person and we start doing random‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•but my first friend runs off somewhere. My new friend and I chase him and we find out that he has had a gun this whole time! He starts shooting this newspawn so we hide in a bush. We then man up and kil both my first friend and the newspawn who was also trying to kill me. After looting for another 15 minutes we see this guy. He doesn't look armed so we try and make friends with him. He pulls out a gun and starts to shoot us! I take 2 hits but I luckily killed him. My friend comes running over to help me. I knew I was dieing and we didn't have any bandages (or so I thought) he starts to type something but since hes from another country he has to translate it then all the sudden out of nowhere the bandits friend comes and shoots my friend so I shoot him in the head. 11/10 great experience better than dayz where you like FRIENDLY boom respawn in 30 seconds. Soz for grammer and english errors I am not english but am learning it very well.			"

								Saw this game at PAX East, and got to talk to one of the folks in the booth for a bit. I felt bad that I didn't take the opportunity to play, as while we were chatting about the horror/survival genre in general (a la The Forest, Amnesia, DayZ, etc.) a few spots opened up. I declined to play, but did want to check back in to say that this game is absolutely beautiful and the gameplay is addictive: slinking around an apocalyptic mountain region, looting anything you can find in an effort to either not get mauled by a roaming zombie, or killed by another player. What's not to like? The day/night cycles are amazing, and I just witnessed my first lightning storm which was incredible; CryEngine FTW. And while friendly confrontations with players are possible, most end in bloodshed, but some are akin to two ships passing in the night, if you're lucky - and not armed enough to want to attack the other person :-)Crafting is interesting; it seems like it would take a _lot_ of effort to build a structure. I was lucky enough to find a hatchet during a random spawn once, and given the inventory size, it just wasn't feasible. Even with several more slots; I'm also not sure I'd want to put effort into a structure that I probably won't be able to find later, but maybe there's an ability to set a respawn point; not sure, but that'd be ideal. I have many an hour on ARK, and while dying in hardcore survival is expected, I do feel as though I really shouldn't get attached to any items whatsoever in Miscreated since I've yet to recover a body. I don't mind this though - I've read a lot of quibbling about loot being too sparse, and that happens to be a major plus for me; loot is extremely valuable in this game; that's awesome; it's a bold choice that not a lot of games take, and I think that really set it apart from the rest.

								So basically, this isn't a true review, not yet really! Just a first impressions to the game, but take it how you will!  I joined an RP server cause.. less KOS'ing and more story which is never a bad thing!The RP server I joined had one other person on it, which is fine, gave me time to learn the controlls and the game.. which there was only one problem (which isn't really a problem it was fun) it was night time.. but! It's not like other games where you can't see‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and you get a flashlight that's actually a flashlight! Illuminating most of your screen and working how you'd expect it to work! Woo!The Ambience was amazing, sounds were both cheerful and spooky at the same time..  and the menu music.. I could listen to that alone!Mutants aren't that hard to deal with if you know what you're doing, but one mistake will HURT which is what you should expect when dealing with a creature the size of a human but stronger.  Gun play is decent and over all the game just felt nice!  Plus there's alot of things to loot so you don't starve or die of dehydration *COUGH* DAYZ * COUGH*So, do I recommend this game? So far, yes! But be warned, it'll take a bit to find a decent gun so.. take your time, don't go and rush the mutants and be calm and collected and you'll do fine! <3Edit #1!  So! After playing a little bit more into the game, I've only had one instance of my screen locking up and I had to force quit the game, but that's it!  The game has had nothing but great atmosphere, well done buildings that.. do get repetative I'm sure, but I'm a looter so.. hehe!Even the RP server I was on was great! Friendly staff which will look up instances of KOSing as long as you can prove it, so if you are to join the server.. Have something to record your gameplay! If you're into that sort of thing.Plus got stuck on a water tower for 30 mins talking to a guy while wolves surrounded it.. was a good time :)			"

								This is a beautiful looking game, but lacks features and things to do! Once you've explored the map, you only have the players to rely on for entertainment... that usually ends with a lot of KOS (Kill on sight).Graphically this game is amazing, but I cant give it a thumbs up until theres more to do :(EDIT: 18/10/2015My recommendation for this game has changed from no to yes! It's not without the odd bug or 2 but you have to remember its still in alpha.2nd Edit: 26/6/2016Ever since vehicles and base building were added to the game I've been glued to it! The map has seen mutliple expansions and upgrades, including the new city (playable through experimental) which is so big its daunting!! The environment does a really good job with immersion!Along with the new city patch #36 has added a lot more features to the game to make it a true survival experience. You can hunt wildlife and cook the meat to survive, and use rivers/ponds for water to truely live off the land! Last night we spent 3+ hours playing like that, we were still doing PVP/PVE but with the added challenge of not eating canned food found around the map.If you enjoy games like DayZ and/or H1Z1 I honestly believe you will love this game!

								Visuals and progress of development seems to be moving along at a good pace. This game has a lot of potential to be the best of its genre. I would recommend this game to my friends and the steam community, but not just yet. That's simply only because at the moment there isn't really to much to do in-game. I do expect great things to keep rolling out from the dev's though, so far they have been very interactive with there players and are always open to feedback. This is probably one of the best early access dev teams currently, and that says a lot about them really especially for how small of a team they are. So in short this is a great game, i personally wouldnt buy it until they add some more features, but if your looking for a game to support that has the means to be the next big thing. Then THIS is the game to support!			"

								This game is exactly how a post-apocalyptic MMO should have been and developed. I have played DayZ and Miscreated; personally, Miscreated scores the win on this one. The game runs smooth on ultra with the gameplay and combat much more satisfying than DayZ. And like the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t DayZ throws on us, this game is actually developing with regards to what the early access players want. Currently there are enough number of weapons to satisfy the marksman in you, but more are being added with each upcoming patch! Moreover, if you're into co-op, there are a few friendly servers that maintain a healthy relationship between every player. Now it's impossible to find a less-eccentric player that does not want blow a hole through your head in DayZ. So Miscreated is worth the buy and I recommend one buys it now because with it's potential, it might increase the price once the early access is done, which I'm pretty sure will happen soon.In short, Miscreated is the best of it's kind on Steam right now. I wonder how it has 'mixed' reviews...			"

								If you like dayz except want an acutal functional game with amazing frames and graphics then this is that. It's what dayz is trying and failing to be. It takes the style of dayz with the functionality of items in h1z1 (which is terrible now) with zombies that need a bit of work but are there. All in all the game experience is what matters. Cars are relatively easy to fix up without having to stress over losing them. Guns are everywhere if you know where to look and the fight for survival becomes a focus when you encounter groups and clans. That said, this game is in alpha and with a few bugs and improvments in the future this game stands at a 7.5 out of 10 with it easily being a 9 when they hit the final version. The main concern at the moment is storage and zombies. The only way to store items at the moment is in vehicles which despawn after not being used for 2 days. Secondly, the zombies (mutants) are far and few with a low focus on gameplay as it stands. The game could do with a lot more of them and slower ones that make it feel as if they're not quite human. All in all It's absolutely worth the pickup and the community is more and more active. Come join us in the fun! ~ DEAD NATION			"

								Disappointed with Day-Z, utterly ashamed with the progress in H1z1? This game has elements from both and multiplies them by 10!  The little details and nuances that were missing from those 2 games, are in here, on top of that CryEngine graphics, makes this probably the best Survival MMO out there today. It is still missing some content that you would like to see in a Survival MMO, but patches are being churned out very quickly with new  additions. You can actually see progress done by the devs, instead of constant balancing and reaggregation of the old content that you see in other Survival MMOs *cough* H1Z1‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•*cough*Game started out pretty weak on content and oldish graphics, that's why most people just passed it, but look at the game's playerbase on SteamDB, this game is blowing up after last few updates which improved the game greatly . With recent updates this game just surpassed pretty much all open-world zombie-survival games. Pros:GraphicsContent (compared to other Survival MMOS)Communicative DevsConstant updates with noticeable content additionsVariety of weapons and secondary weapons such as superfun Chemlights and Smoke nadesFar draw distance which lets you other players at very long range with the help of their own flashlight in the night, or your sniper scope. DayZ only game that comes close in this area.Beautiful weather and time of the day phasesBeautiful atmosphere with little details such as falling leaves and bird chirping in the morning.Only game with a large city (unfinished currently)Bicycles, ATVs, Trucks, Carrier Trucks, Buses!Base building (better than in any other Survival MMO)General freedom of action in regards to building, item handling.No cheaters yet.Cons:Small Map (but very detailed with things to do around). Can be traversed in 30 to 45 min on foot.Low max player cap on servers (but so far it works ok since map isnt large yet)Current dropped items and dead bodies despawn at random timesVehicle hoardingcurrently 8/10 as it is only alpha, with a potential 10/10 when it is fully playable.

								Well, I love this game. Miscreated is a horror survival game set somewhere in the United States where the remaining population must overcome eachother and the mutants that plague the world.This game has a very good community, very good and active developers, it is very well optimized, has a lot of content such as weapons, base building, craftables, and vehicles to name a few and this game also looks amazing!Although this game does have a few bugs, such as tires popping and vehicles taking damage if you drive them offroad and sometimes loot disappears into the groud.I just pulled a six hour session and this is what happened:My friend and I spawn in near the Amalgamated Airfield. We loot it, run to this house and camp there until the tornado passes. After the tornado passes, we make a small camo netted shelter and crate to put some valueables in and begin our quest to go to the big city. Along the way to the big city, we kills 10 wolves, avoid 3 armed people, make one friend and lose him, find a Fallout shelter in the mountains, and piece together what we think the story of the game is. Now, we're at the city, we find very good gear and are exploring the Capital Munch when a group of three roll up and we ditch. My friend logs off for the night but me being the trooper that I am, I continue. I wait the guys out, get even more gear then find the best thing in the entire ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game. The Bus. I spend 45 minutes finding all the parts for it, drive it out of the city to a safe spot, then all the tires pop because this German guy shot them out with his shotgun. We exchange words and bullets in Deutsch. I overcame my German rifle and found the military sniper on his body, and proceeded to go to the woods and log off for the night overwhelming with joy. Until I logged in the next morning and accidently dropped the rifle and lost it.Seriously, buy this game. It has so much to offer and has a lot more to come. Leaps and bounds better than the likes of H1Z1, Exile Mod, DayZ standalone, and DayZ mod. Honestly I'd say this is the best survival game out there.One last thing... not a single hacker.			"

								After 3 hours wandering around the map I made a human contact. Got shot by a shotgun and two guys started to chase me. Hearing shotgun shots behind me and heavily bleeding I managed to take a tiny lead to these brutal survivors. Behind me I hear two guys yelling at me english with bad accent including very offensive words in Polish. They wanted my hammer and offered friendship with them, if I would give them the hammer. Finally after 15 minute chase I bled out while swimming in a river, not giving them the hammer.Pretty much what would happen in real life.An advice for other players, don't trust Slaavs who wants your hammer while shooting you with a shotgun.It's a DayZ but it actually works smoothly --9/10--			"

								It's called Miscreated for a reason.People will chase each other for 10 minutes shooting, swinging bats, and cursing at each other until someone finally dies. The PVP needs to be renovated.. desperately. I feel like I'd have a better chance of hitting the Megamillion Lottery than hitting anything in this game. You get the feel for it after awhile, however it's far from perfect.Last time we died, we were run over by a car. The interesting thing was, we hid behind a stationary deployable on the map in ample time.. yet we still both died. We recently found a car and made it operational. After dieing at inconvenient times, we would reunite with the car and drive it once more. This time, out of nowhere, the car blows up. We had 83% health before venturing into the next town. Suddenly, while cruising down the road, the car catches on fire. The car lost 60% health in about 2 minutes flat (we had not been in a firefight). About 15 seconds later, as we're trying to pull the inventory from the car, it explodes. Cars are a nice touch in this game, but by far the buggiest feature. Sometimes they will start rubberbanding and leave you stranded without your gear. Game over.This game has potential, but it needs work..a lot of work. PVP: 2 / 10. I didn't give it a 1 because the weapon selection and models are above average. Using them is a different story.  Team Gameplay: 6.5/10. Clans exist, I assume this helps team players with certain aspects of the game. Finding each other will take ages until you learn the map. The only real way to find each other is by suciding. Of course, if one of you has stuff on them, you're going to lose all of it. Once you're at a common location, you're good to go. There is no teleporting (which is good for sake of realism). You're on your own for quite a long time until you learn the map. With that said, playing with others is quite enjoyable. The social aspect of this game gives it its playability.Building: -5/10. There is no point to building a base. There is no storage in this game. Blueprints are hard to find. The structures do not clip together. It will take you about 1 hour to make a 1x2 base, and that's not counting the door and other essentials. You pretty much have to dedicate your life to base building for 0 return. Some people box a car in their base, so they can store stuff in it. Problem is, cars despawn.Playability factor: 6/10. Despite all of the shortcomings of this game, it engages me quite well. It is a good game to play when there is nothing else to do. Unfortunately, it seems you never really win in this game because of the bugs. For instance, you have no way of knowing which server you're in. If you want a friend to join your game, you're just out of luck. You can't join via Steam. You can't find out the server's name. You just have to quit and join a common server. Graphics: 7/10. Cry Engine is quite intensive, but it's worth it. On highest settings using 1080p, the game looks great. The devs did a good job on the map. Unfortunately, there are not enough player models and unique houses, etc.Bug example: -Car glitched and placed me outside of the map (also if you notice, the glitched hitbox of the car killed that guy with little to no contact) -

								Great game visually! the devs put a great deal of detail in the world. Everywhere u go there is something cool and unique to see. regular updates and an active team make this a great early alpha to get into and follow as it continues to improve every week. The team hosts regular twitch streams where players can chat about new game content and give their opinions while being answered. side note. today i witnessed a murder in an alley way in pinecrest. the poor victim only had a hammer and a beanie... i was too late to save him, but i could avenge him. the bandit didnt know what hit him. BAM!! i pistol wipped him in the back of the head. Pow!!! i shot , his body fell to  slump beside the dumpsters. rats scampered over to his body  and began gnawing. suddenly i heard two trucks accelerating towards me. i jumped out of the way just in time. one of the truck drivers got stuck on the light post, i pulled up my shotgun and loaded a slug in it... steadied my aim and let that slug fly. it broke clean through the windshield and found his head. i then jumped into the truck and made a run for it , the second truck followed me in hot presuit. he finally started trying to spin me out by a downed helicopter but it did not work , his own truck flipped out of control and crashed besides the black hawk. i made a clean get away with a truck full of loot and a clean concious knowing that i avenged an innocent soul.

More spawn rates of vehicles and the ability to add more storage. My opinion rating 9/10			"

								Okay this game is a slow paced survival that still has some work for it including the crafting system certain items take awhile to craft and can cause you to be killed or just waste time. Basically to sum this game up I tried playing a few days ago and I roamed around and found a canadian we worked together until we reached the airport killing a few zombies we then found this zombie that looked like the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing hulk and then we lost eachother and I got chased and‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•by this hulk being hope this review helps you buy this game lmao its an experience haha.

								The Good:  This is simply the best looking game of this genre.  The environs are beautifully crafted.  The interiors feel real, the exteriors are very convincing.  The rats and snakes scattering about are a great touch (although I couldn't kill and eat them).  Almost everything felt right.  I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement but the dev team clearly knows where that is and given what they've done so far, this game will be a sight to behold when it's complete. Observations:  As far as game-play, there is clearly work to be done. But there are some great steps they've already made that are evident in the current build.  I like the limited inventory and the ability to store stuff in my shirt pocket.  There is work to be done on what has been implemented and obviously, there are many needed features (such as storage and fleshing out crafting).  A few things that disappointed me.  First, I want to be able to interact with everything, 7DTD has done an amazing job with this but their world in nowhere near as visually rich.  I get there's a trade-off happening here but a happy middle ground would be appreciated. 7DTD has to execute on a few things yet but it is poised to be one of the best games I've ever played.  Completely augmentable environments is the reason why, and this alone will make me overlook any number of it's shortcomings.  Clearly, after reading some of the devs posts, they are on the right path and have a unique and interesting take on a very overdone theme.  But they have a lot of work to do in order to compete with 7DTD.   The Bad:  I played for about 2 hours and then it crashed (as of 10/10/2015).  I can't open the game anymore.  after looking at how active the devs are, I have confidence they will fix it.  Final:  If you have limited funds, wait for this one to develop more.  But, If you, like me, enjoy supporting game development go for it.			"

								11:26 PM updated!Happiest day in Apirl, application essay is finished, and I turned off the Motion Blur and I no longer feel dizzy!TL;DRMakes me dizzy, but everything is great so far, absolutely worth buying at -50% discountI never feel dizzy in any other video game, but after playing half of an hour I really wanted to lay in my bed... I don't blame this game though.I play on a 14'' laptop and I haven't played FPS with Keyboard+mouse for six months, I only play RTS with K+M and for other games with my XO controller, however I play most of the FPS on ps4 with a bigger monitor.I think one of reasons is I have to turn around and look closely at objects in order to find loots, so play it on a bigger screen guys for your eyes and your health and your playing pleasure.After exitting the game I couldn't do anything else for the entire day so I had to keep watching Youtube videos and I couldn't start writing my application essay until 8PMBut this game looks absolutely stunning, good texture, good fx, animation in game is way much better than what they showed in the video up there, everything is good and it runs so smooth. Atomsphere done right, I did expect zombie when I enter buildings, and I encountered the first zombie in a building, really immersive. And the loots show up in where they are supposed to show up, JOB VERY WELL DONE!  DayZ 0.60 is still on the way so this game is currently somehow better than DayZ, excet DayZ doesn't make me dizzy (I played DayZ and ArmA2 and ArmA3 for over one thousand hours so I'm pretty used to their engine)Community is fine, met pretty much five people today only one guy tried to kill me with a baseball bat			"

								This is the 1st Survival type game i have played, and what fun it is. There are things that need to be added i.e storage, hunting, maybe a better way of saving progress etc. But i can see alot of this and more being added. If you don't like being KOS try a server with not so many players on as i do. You will on occasions meet these people, but remember its a post-apocaliptic survival game and i'm sure that there would be mass murderers roaming around. Alot of people i have met have been very freindly. The game plays fine on my 7 year old PC.Phenom 2 X4 940 (OC 3.6ghz) also when at stock speed 3ghz. 30/40+FPS On high settings.8gb DDR2 800mhz.(yes 800mhz)R7 370 2gb.Windows 10Give this game a go it's the best game i have played in a very long time, and this from a 50 year old grumpy man who is very hard to please...........

								AS for right now this is where miscreated stands for me. 3.5 out of 5 STARSPros- The gameplay is fun, as long as your not in a server filled with A holes.- The game setup is pretty awsome too, with some crafting and base building options.- Awsome graphics but i expected this from cry-engine.- Dispite the flaws its still worth a buy but preferably on saleCons- Not optimized for cpu usage, my system runs much more intense games without hickups.- very laggy - Game crashes constantly and server connection issues- Did i mention the A holes who play it ?? not a con, but it just goes with survival games i guess =D- most cons are on performance issues of the way the game runs.OverallGame is worth a try, i purchased it on sale and i don't regret it. If you find it on sale hop on it. Despite the performance issues of the game and servers, i still found hours of fun playing miscreated.			"

								Miscreated is built in CryEngine so it looks really nice, and I have to say I'm really impressed with how smoothly it's been running for me, nearly always between 60-70 fps on my GeForce GTX 980 (with some occasional dips for a few minutes after first joining a server). It's still an Early Access title, of course, and I've had that familiar Early Access problem: twice I've loaded the game and found the character I'd been gearing up completely wiped from existence. Servers (those close enough to me that I get a good ping) also seem to be either overstuffed with players or practically empty, which makes finding a medium population server a challenge (I like having people around, but not tons of them).I'm still loving it. It's got the wonderful tension of spotting another player and having no real idea how they'll greet you, with a wave (or the request that you teach them to wave) or a hail of bullets. I hope it remains so for a while‚Äîover my many hours of DayZ it became less and less likely to run into a player who didn't immediately kill you on sight. And I'm not opposed to KOS, really. All's fair. I just love a game in which it isn't a foregone conclusion, and right now, Miscreated seems to have a healthy mix of friendly, indifferent, and non-friendly players. Here's hoping it stays that way.			"

								Well let me start with, DONT BE FOOLED WITH THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. Most of the negative reviews are people who got the game and started hating on it before they even launched it as it Early access and asked for a refund before they clicked play!! Also this game has been heavly modifed and improved the last 2 months which sets a side the negative views from the past as honestly wasnt that good.YES IT ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING IS EARLY ACCESS but let me tell you something its a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing good early access game. I had a game for 3 days and yes there are a few bug here and there but non of them stop you from playing the game. For example: Flickering lght, Yes it has been noticed by the devs and its being worked on but there is a simple fix. Restart the game.  BOOM DONE OMFG its magic. (it rarly ever happens)Another example: Can click on a teb or cant find a server. BOOM restart DONE!!! (happned once out of 35 times i launched it. This game has so much potential and dont get me started on the graphics and it by far has the best looking graphics then any other survival game out there. (this game makes dayz look like a 2d game) So back to the game play. I personnaly like the hardcore gameplay and finding people in game now is not a problem. Recently its been getting attention as it should. It takes a while to loot up as that is relistic and not everyone has guns which means alot of melee action and if they do have a gun the gun probably dont have more then 8 shots . as ammon is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing rare. If I were to rate the game on the gameplay it would be 10/10 Fluent and stable game                                                     8/10  There are minor bugs but non affect gameplay as a simple restart would do.Should you get it. HELL YES if you are willing to start the game with a smile.			"

								I only played 2 hours on the game but my god this was so much better than everything i felt in dayz.The gameplay is better but still is basically your dayz mechanics, graphics are a lot better (cryengine 3) and way more detailed, i especially like the attention to detail in the nature (so many flowers, nice different types of grass, tree's and beautifull water and water effects when you move inside it.). Also the buildings are absolutely stunning and even more once you get inside them, this is post apocalytpic atmosphere to it's fullest.Overall this is the most solid pre-alpha i ever played in my life of early access games on steam (the game released october 30rth 2014, this year). and wow, just get it now as it's already so solid and the price will go up too.10/10 futur reference.

								    Wow, this one just keeps getting better. The devs seem to be quite invested in this game with updates coming in often. The visuals are fantastic, the immersion is top notch. The map is quite large with varied terrain and towns. The PVP action is tense and the control is pretty good.      It runs very good on my old PC, I do have a pretty good graphics card (gtx 970)but the rest of my rig is getting a bit outdated.      Well worth a check for you if you are into these type of games. Looting can be a bit slow at times (of course luck can strike) but for me at least, that's part of the fun of these games and makes the PVP (or PVE sometimes) exciting and meaningfull.      Looking forward to the future of this one, It's really looking like this one will be great. "

								This game needs to A LOT of fixing, but in my opinion it has some potential. It seems like you need to fix the ammo and weapon spawning, I can find a gun, but it usually dosen't have ANY bullets so, most of the game I've been sticking to high damage melee weapons. Also maybe have some different additions like maybe the Tornado can pick up items and throw them across the map, as of now the tornadoes can only drag vehicles, and maybe add other forces of nature into the game aswell. I would like to see a lot more balance in fixes later into this games development.			"

Plz devs if you read this dont be sell outs like dayz and give up on the game after awhile. This has so much potential and i know this could be a big hit. I will try my hardest to get my friends to jump over to this game. And I love how you can clearly see what they do in there updates. Some awesome updates have happened to this game already from what i read. Anyways back to the game i go :)			"

								Miscreated is a great game with A LOT of potential. In the games current state, it is way better than DayZ SA. However if you are looking for a 'real' survival game that is further along I would say this is not the game to buy. This game in it's current state to me, feels more like a FFA than a survival game. Base building, hunting for food is not necessary to survive in this game. You just need a gun and ammo. Food is so common that if you die to starvation or thirst you should probably take a good look in the mirror and play another game. The only real thing to do is kill people and die (as of right now) and there are games out there that do THAT way better. So far i've noticed that a large majority of the community are below the age of 18 who scream racial and offensive slurs at the top of their lungs, drives around killing fresh spawns while playing vulgar and racial music. With the minority being (people associated with S.tars A.nd S.tripes, very good, mature people). And that alone is why I don't recommend this game at full price if you aren't apart of the small percentage of mature people. I recommend you wait until it goes on sale if you REALLY want to give it a shot. This game has so much potential, it is already visually stunning and I can already tell that 1-3 years later this will be a fantastic game to play as the devs have already planned out what they intend to do with Miscreated in 2017. So knowing that, the only reason you should buy this game is if you want to support the devs. Otherwise, just wait to actually 'get into it'. In conclusion, if you are looking for a survival game that is more well developed. I'll say your best bet is to buy ArmA III and play the mods: Breaking Point, Epoch, or Exile. At least with ArmA III you get a full game WITH tons of mods as well as the steam workshop all for one price.(Also, if you are familiar with Breaking Point mod for ArmA III then you know that a SA version is in the making right now and has been for a few months now. Something everyone should REALLY look foward to as Breaking Point SA will without a doubt be the greatest survival game on the market. Definitely check it out.)-Golden			"

								Ohhhhhh, Miscreated.... What things it's done for me. The thing about Miscreated is, yea you can do it alone, but if you have friends that have it, it's WAYYYYY better. My friend convinced me to buy Miscreated at the beginning of summer, and oh my what things we have done. Even though I only played with one friend, it was still a blast none the less. Miscreated has pretty much carried me through the summer and strengthened many bonds. What started out as people I ran into and asking for a can of soup have become some of my best friends. Through the many many nights my friends and I have stayed up till 4-6 am in the morning, it has all been worth it.I usually go by a rule with games, for every dollar I spend, I at least want 1 hour of playtime. And while my ~80 hours doesn't look like much compared to other games I have like CS:GO and Rust with ~600 hours each (BTW great games, if you haven't bought them already, look into them) the hours I spent on here were some of my funest. Miscreated is very weird in the way that you don't need to be stacked to have fun. Whether it was running around towns ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing up freshies with our hundreds of ammo, or just running around 'usting' (our term for kicking) geared kids. The strange thing is, me and my friends can almost recall every fun moment we had with the game, all dating back to the beginning of summer 2016. As a conclusion to this review, I just wanted to say how much this game has done for me, if I haven't shown you already. Just a recap, it carried me through summer, we stayed up many nights playing it, we met awesome people on the way, and we had so many good times with it. And the last thing I said, which is very important to me, was strengthening bonds with my friends.  The reason this is so important you ask? Because I had moved 3-4 years prior to today, and me and my old friends hadn't talked for the majority of that time. All until I first made contact with one of them while they were having a party. We met on Skype and I didn't really think much of it, I just thought it was a one time thing and then we were going to stop talking. But it most definitley wasn't. They added me on Skype and we chatted every now and again, but it was very awkward at first. We moved to Discord and even though I was pretty close with most of them, some of them I barley knew. That was until Miscreated came into my life, and those friends I barley knew have become some of my closest friends. Anyways, long story aside, this game is amazing, and it is definitley worth it's $20 price tag.-Thanks ""Ratio"" for the inspiration to write my long review again.			"

								In spite of the fact that there are a multitude of post-apoc survival games out there, Miscreated really is its own game done its own way. I can't put my finger on exactly why I've found playing the game so compelling, but it has something to do with the 'feel' of everything. The feel of urban blight, where nature is slowly reclaiming what mankind has abandoned is done just right. The overcast days, long dark nights, rain it all gives you the feeling of the world's misery as we plod along and cautiously try to survey another house for materials.The mutants in the game, while not especially creative or smart, do illicit some fear and adrenalin when you try to sneak by them or attack them head on. Here is where they need to add more diversity, I think the game could really benefit from some jump scares in the houses, I understand the desire to be different but the occasional zombified human torso lunging at you from a bathtub or crawling across the floor wouldn't hurt. I'd like to see something like the REC witch in the game somewhere, maybe when they implement subterranean ""dungeon"" structures. If the apocalypse just sees a few inbred hicks become especially beligerent, that would be a shame and a missed opportunity to really scare people with this game.Finding weapons so far is pretty easy, as is finding all manner of provisions. In this regard I feel like this makes the players in the game overly friendly, there isn't any need anywhere to attack another player or raid their cottage, survival doesn't really depend on it. It would be great if the economy either pushed players into conflict with eachother or forced more people to cooperate, while still allowing for the occasional lone wolf and punishing those who haphazardly attack everyone for no reason at all. I like the idea of playing a game where people are friendly first, but then again everyone singing kumbaya is likely to get boring quick.Overall I think the game has a ton of potential, and even though it's early access I still recommend picking up the game and roaming about, searching houses, fighting players, building strongholds because ultimately these are rewarding experiences in and of themselves. More content is sure to come, but in the meantime simply walking around a muddy post apocalyptic Oregon is pretty damn entertaining.			"

								I'm going to talk about the good to this game first, then the negative before I offer my suggestions.Firstly, this game is fun in many ways. It is a gritty, semi-realistic survival simulator. Using crazy people instead of zombies is very interesting and breaks away from the norm, so kudos on that. I also like the fact loot isn't just sprawled every two feet across the game world and that you have to actually LOOK for it. It isn't always in the open people. The ""mutants"" are strong and freaky, which is good because it adds to the challenge. It makes you have to actually use your brain and think, strategize about what you do instead of just charging in and killing everything that moves.Now where it needs improvement. Although I DO like the realism of having to search for loot instead of it laying in the open, it is a bit TOO difficult to find anything useful half the time. Not to mention you usually end up running into the enemies before you even find a t-shirt, which brings me to my next point.Having difficult enemies can be a good thing, but the problem with this game is it isn't balanced. Risk versus reward is key in these games, and with the enemies being so much faster and stronger than the player, it makes things very frustrating.The other area that needs improvement is re-spawning. There needs to be something coded into the game that prevents you from being spawned too close to mutants. Close is fine at times, but there has to be a line. At one point, I actually respawned across the map directly in a group of 6 or 7 mutants! I'm talking surrounded and inches away. I didn't even try to run.Overall, I would say it is very well executed for an early access pre-alpha game. It is fun and entertaining but can be VERY frustrating. My recommendation would be to go for it and try it. It might seem like the price tag is high versus the issues but consider other games in the genre. It may or may not get MORE expensive down the road once it is done.My suggestions are as follows:1. Tone down the mutants strength and/or size a little bit, it far outweighs the reward.2. Rather than toning them all down, maybe consider scaling each one differently for variety, some weaker than others and some stronger.3. If the enemies are not scaled, at the very least make offensive/defensive loot a bitmore prevalent. Kinda sucks to get trapped in a huge building that has nothing but clothing and ammo for guns you can never find4. Improve the respawn coding. Again, it sucks big time to be spawned inches from the mutant threat.Keep an open mind when playing this game, and if you leave a review, be it good or negative, try to be constructive instead of flaming the boards. The game gets better by constructive criticism not rudeness.			"

								I started this game next to a medical building. It was an early morning and you could hear the birds chirping. I began to search this building only to find a few food rations and a bottle of water. I noticed many sleeping bags inside and thought of all the people that were living in this building, using it as a shelter, before all of this happened. I continued to explore the rest of the town. By the end of the day I had found a backpack, a hunting knife, and a few food items. I spent my night hidden away in an abandoned house that was slowly being taken over my rats and moss. It started to sprinkle a little bit that night and my body temperature was slowly lowering. By morning the sprinkle had turned into a thunderstorm and rain was beginning to get into the house. I quickily decided I would need to find a new place to go. I ventured out onto the puddle covered street and instantly was covered in water. I was getting very chilly and was nervous I would catch a cold. I ran along the road for a very long time seeing others in the same boat as me. Many were in short sleeve shirts and some had no shirts at all. As I continued, I spotted bases where I imagined experienced survivors lived. Sitting next to a warm campfire, wearing coats, and eating warm food. I finally stumbled upon an abandoned bus that had a dead survivor in it. I took his coat and cargo pants and instantly felt more secure. As I sat in the bus eating my lunch and listening to the rain. I heard a gunshot. I glanced down at the dead survivor and imagined the gunshot brought someone a similar fate. I looked around the parking lot and found a tarp and some other essentials and build a small tent. I fell asleep listening to the thunder roaring. All of this in my first day of the game. This game is far from perfect. But it has so much potential. The immersion you feel while playing is crazy. This is easily one of the greatest games I have ever played. And if the developers continue to stick with it, this game will easily beat any other survival game.			"

								In my opinion it's an Interesting game, it has a good gameplay, awesome locations, pretty big map,(and still not finished, probably gonna be about 2x bigger than it is now) realistic weapons, very useful items and good graphics, the only thing that makes a disappointment for me is the lack of mutants, there should be more of them in cities and towns, also they should spawn in buildings too(the amount and locations of spawns will be updated for sure anyways). Summarizing, this game is Amazing as for Early Access and the devs aren't lazy, the game gets better with every update and it has got a lot of potential, so if You are a fan of MMO Survival Horror games, then it's one of the best options for you.

								Miscreated is a very fun game, the developers are active enough and it can become addicting. Pros:- The map size is absolutely fine, not too big, not too small. When you join a server for the first time, you can only spawn in the southern  side of the map; so it's super easy to group up with your friends.- Loot spawns can be found literally anywhere, so it's not like ""I just go to that spot where I'll always find loot and in the rest of the map I won't find anything."" Sure there are place way better than others, you can look for logical spots, but you can even find the M40V5 (the sniper, the rarest rifle in the game) in a car in the highway.Pss! check out this guide to get more into looting- Base building: not sure why people complain about that so much: it is supposed to be completely freeform; it's even mentioned in the game's informations. Still a good part of the game, your best bet is to find that sweet little spot between remaining stealth and living near a good loot location (like hayward).- Vehicles (except the bike): They are well developed, they are hard to find, but they give an extreme advantage especially if you have a base. However you're vulnerable when driving any of the vehicles but you cannot pretend to be invincible.-  Graphics are insane making the game even more immersive, and the game is very well optimized, sometimes you can drop frames, but it occurs pretty rarely, unless you're running the game on a potato.- Inventory is very very well thought, from the early and end game storage concept (Jeans- low inventory space, cargo pants - high storage, backpacks which can go from a trashy horseoe backback to a duffel bag) to the fact that you can reload if your ammo is in your pockets only, is absolutely gorgeous.- Crafting is ok but farming guides is grindy. It needs work on it.- Balanced PVP, clothing doesn't change the damage output so as a skilled player you can actually take down with assault rifles with just a 9mm. You're also not too restricted when fighting with melee weapons, I literally saw a guy taking out a group of 3 players with midgame weapons using just a pickaxe.- Moving stealthy, ambushing is important in this game and, in my opinion, it's very funny.- The way the game is made, it encourages Role playing, which is not seen very frequently in other survival games, literally the Function Keys are really good and items such as Survivor VI (a walkie talkie), handcuffs ecc. fit just fine in this game.Cons- Hard to learn if you just bought the game without a friend already playing it.- The PVE aspect of the game is not challenging, you can avoid every enemy NPC in the game by just running away from it, they are just annoying when you're looting and the big mean mutant is just a waste of bullets. - There's absoulutely no earlygame or endgame raiding concept, you just gotta grab an hatchet get a lot of food and then start looking for a base. It literally takes 5 minutes to take a normal door. Of course, bases are meant to be raided, but just getting raided by a bunch of freshies in 30 minutes when you spent a lot of time building your base is really annoying. There should be earlygame raiding with earlygame building and endgame raiding with endgame building.- Saying that the bike is bugged is like saying that ISIS is naughty, however it's a problem with the cryengine.- There's not much of a survival aspect in the game, but it's being worked on.- You cannot host your own server, you have to buy one at i3D.- Floating bases, they have been out for way too long and I'm surprised they haven't been patched yet.Overall really great game, I would recommend playing it with 2 or 3 friends, just because as solo you're way too vulnerable and way more anxoius "

								After playing only 10 hours on the game, I can say only a few things..Firstly, this game is beautiful, It's the best looking post-apocolypse survival genre game out there to date. It is a very under rated game and deserves a lot more attention. The lack of players right now is not a bad thing, infact for me it was great, it allowed me to get a grip of how the game worked and how the engine feels. For me it was amazing, even with every setting maxed out, I had a smooth 45-60 FPS deep in very detailed parts of the map and I dont have the best of PCs.Secondly, the engine for this game right now feels and plays wonderfully. I have not come across any major bugs, especially for such a unpopular game, that's amazing. Loot seems to work just fine, and as far as I can tell the base building it good, and the raiding system works moderatly well for such an early access game.If this game had sufficient advertising I believe it would easily of been a better hit than other popular survival games which turned out pretty crappy, *cough* you know which ones im talking about.Finally, this game reaches out and takes aspects of other survival games out there, bundling it into one great, beautiful and smooth game THAT ACTUALLY WORKS *GASP*. It truly does deserve more attention and more advertising.			"

								Got this game when it was on sale a little while back. Had a lot of fun playing it and meeting the different types of people that roam around in the world of Miscreated. (Keep in mind that this is my first review ever)First off. It looks amazing. The world that these guys build is absolutely beautifull. You can really feel that they put a lot of time in perfecting the atmosphere. Because of this the world is not crazy big and when you die you tend to always spawn around the same areas. This of course lets you figure out the map quite fast, but can also make you feel like you've seen everything that the world of Miscreated has to offer you in the first couple of hours. Don't let that spoil your fun though because I recommend checking the internet or talking to Miscreated players about finding some interesting hidden spots on the map. Sadly this is only a short term solution for the boredom that COULD come and haunt you down the line. Sometimes this game can make you feel like the only thing you're doing is running around and looking for loot. Once you're satisfied with that loot your stuck at the beginning. BuildingWell let's start a base then wouldnt you say? Wrong! Base building is not something that this game does very well. For me this is not a big problem because I never felt it necessary until.. you're at that point that you've picked up so much loot that you have no choice but to store it somewhere. This is normally where you're storage crates come in. Sadly this is one of the, in my opinion, more annoying bugs. Crates despawn. Well Dave, what about picking up a tent? Despawns! I could talk forever about these little but very annoying bugs. But you gotta keep in mind that we are still talking about an Early Acces game. And sure it was first released in 2014, the year that Zack Brown raised $55,000 on Kickstarter to make potato salad. But it is still an Early Acces game. And there are still updates coming out every few months. PVP/PVEI'm not sure what to say about the PVP aspect of this game. The lack of ammo on some servers can really put a strain on having a fun gunfight. Servers invested with clans are also an uprising problem (in my opinion) and really makes finding good loot difficult. Recently they've added more Muntant (PVE) to the game. This also puts a strain on your gaming experience, coming back at not being able to find, carry or store loot. The best thing you can do when you're being chased down by 4 mutants, of which you have no idea how they've found you, is to run into a building or jump over stuff until they get stuck somewhere. Overall I'm not a huge fan of PVE in this game. Running into a Mutant can make you're frames drop and really kill the immersion. SurvivalThere's not much to say about the survival aspect of this game. Surviving in Miscreated consists of finding food and water. That is it! (atm) So.. can I recommend this game to other people? I think I can. But only to the people that have patient. The people that understand that this game, although beautifull, still needs work. For the price that it is at right now, I highly recommend picking it up. It is definitely worth a try compared to other similar games out there.			"

								Best 10$ I ever spent EVER!!!!There are many things that shine in this game from the weather system and the lush environment that just feels like it all fits where it needs to be. I wont go on and on about things already known. I will say that the new patch coming soon is addressing  A LOT of complaints. Reloading of guns works with an animation. Ammo can be remove from mags and split and reloaded into mags. Storage! In the form of tents that can be picked up and placed somewhere else(on dirt). Or craftable crates placed in a Base. much more clothing and an even larger backpack as well as a additional clothing slot/layer for a vest worn on top of the shirt/jacketNew Rifle modeled after Remington 700 called the RenegadeA very large city with huge buildings of which we can enter some now, but later we can enter and access rooftops everywhere. Wolves that hunt in packs of 3-8 and attack the player but can be intimidated and scared away, or you can kill the  leader of the pack. New Mutant enemy type. ';..;' Way too much to list here honestly if you want to know it all then check out the patch notes of the experimental build 36 and expect to see it go live very soon!Get this game you wont regret it! Its some of the best survival gameplay and intense gameplay you can have with this genre and I beleive it will overtake all competition for the crown!			"

TLDR: I totally reccomend this game, it's certainly a gem in the middle of a saturated market of survival games that have become a trend in the recent years, and it seems like the perfect game to stick to, to be a part of, and help grow.First off, let's get a couple of things straight:- This is an Early Access Alpha. If you are not sure what that means, do some research.- The negative reviews were due to a rocky launch back in 2014, as you'll see, you'll need to scroll quite a bit until you reach a true, honest negative review(Yeah, because most people seem to forget what Alpha means, and what your job, as a TESTER, is).That said, I'm wondering where to start for Miscreated..It is a breeze of fresh air in the genre I would say. I've had more fun with Miscreated than I did in DayZ or other survival games akin to it.Positive+It is genuinely fun. Playing with friends, or even just meeting a random stranger can be tense and end up in a very fun experience. Or not. But it'll still be funny!+Great Dev communication, Devs actually CARE, and you can SEEand EXPERIENCE how much work they've put into this game.+Rare KoS(Kill on Sight)+Great optimization+Great graphics+Great GameplayNegative- Loading into a server takes a while, although it has been confirmed it varies depending on hardware(usually 3 minutes for me)..Now thing is, I can only really point out that one flaw, simply because there's really not much more that's ""bad"" about it.Who in their right mind would add ""bugs"" as a negative point to an early access alpha? Of course it has bugs, glitches, spazzing vehicles that kill you if you get close, but they're constantly being worked on. I've only played for about 10 hours, but I've been following development before I purchased the game, because Dev activity with the community is something I value a lot.The game has a good amount of content so far, and what's done so far is good. Do I have suggestions? Sure, but as soon as you start playing you'll also understand the Dev's vision for this game. New features and content are implemented, and the Devs are very open about it, with live streams, roadmaps, etc Basebuilding will be implemented soon, and although I was kind of worried about how it would work, the devs actually took the time to explain everything and I'm now looking forward to it!TLDR: I totally reccomend this game, it's certainly a gem in the middle of a saturated market of survival games that have become a trend in the recent years, and it seems like the perfect game to stick to, to be a part of, and help grow.

								Very similar to DayZ in many ways, but much more polished. Runs great, looks beautiful, and I've had a generally more positive experience with the community (less killing on sight!)However, I would like to see the mutants become more of a threat in the future. They recently announced that they'll have a new AI controller soon though so that should add an edge to PvE.			"

								Little kids really have to rage with negative reviews?I played arma 2 Dayz and the big advantage with this open work survival game is the immersive environment and the greater chance of meeting other players on full servers. The only drawback I have with the game is the amount of items you can pick up. Right now it's a little more than enough to be able to play. Best graphics for a survival game. Here's a cool story of an experience I had. >I spawn> There is a beat down farm house near me>Right away I here wolves howling>I run in and frantically search the house with my flashlight to look for a weapon> I find a bottle of water, whiskey, and green gloves> I think I'm screwed> the howling stops> I run into the field following a road as a reference> it's been 2 minutes and still no wolves> I go in my inventory to drink water> I here growling of a nearby zombie> I quickly start running away back to where I came from> I hear the wolves again> I start crying in the middle of the farm field>A stranger comes in a green truck right beside me> he fires his shotgun>the zombie flies to the ground>I hit the gesture to wave>it was actually the middle finger> I get shot>I go to Unturned for 30 minutes>realize the immersion isn't as great as Miscreated>I re spawn in a different server>I found a pistol right away>I love you Miscreated(Unturned is also a great game, much easier, less immersive, bad graphics (good and bad), and you need friends)Don't make friends; be a bandit. Have fun. "

								First impressions are good, they have put in some good features like you have to find different parts for vehicles and so. The graphics is good, and to be an alpha game it is really easy to run, you dont need a kickass computer to run this game at max settings. When it comes to building I would say they have to do some more work, like when placing a wall onto an platform, its an gap between the platform and the wall, you can lower or raise platforms, that means you have to find an area that is completly flat, kind of dissapointing for a game that looks as good and dont have to many bugs. Only bugs discoverd so far is the vehicle sounds, they do sometimes not sound at all if your friend is driving the vehicle. They should consider that when you cut trees to get wood piles the tree should fall down after some wood piles.After some more playing, the weapons reaload should have been done someting with, should have made it possible to reload with a button and not have to get into inventory and then change mag on the inventory slots. For the blueprints, wood and so for base should have not been on blueprints if you ask me, have benn looting for 10 hours, back and forwards into diffrent towns and buildings around, have just found silly things that i absolutly dont need to craft. Storage box or safe or something like that should have been ingame. For the vehicles , od that you can store just as much in a car or quad bike as in a truck ? does not make any sence for me.As the game looks now, it might be an really good game when it is done			"

								Great game, enjoyed it for weeks, but some advices:1. Play it only with friends, solo is pretty bad experience, especially with this toxic community2. Make floating bases to save your loot, yes it's exploiting but unpunishable.3. Choose a server with ~10-20ppl online, the most populated ones are hardcore and also you don't wish when u get some gear to not be able to shoot atleast someone, because the server is with 1-3ppl online			"

								awesome survival game pick it up! if your not sure about it, well... use the internet and do some research.there is one thing that gave me a surprise. Ok im in new zealand and opt-ed into the exp build of the game, just bought it so i want to play it of course. Get to the server browser there are three servers to choose from the ping ranging from around 200 to 300 on the first one and the rest are 280-300 plus all the way up to the 400s. This had me worried because most game with ping like that are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•en‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to play! I joined a server and Holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! I was blowen away at how responsive and unlaggy it was! pvp seemed uneffected the same with looting and moving around the game world. I dont know how they managed that but man.9/10 for that guys good job! reason for the 9 is because there is always room for improvement in anything.GG			"

								I can't tell you how much I'm enjoying this early access game. I don't think ANY other survival type game has nailed the atmoshphere of this game. The map is such plain drop dead gorgeous!!!!! When you go into a town it feels so realistic. Everything is overgrown and looks like a real apocolypse has happened. I love that there are so many places to hide and sneak around. The first time a deer darts out of a bush, it scares the crap out of you. The feeling of being one of the last few survivors is incredible. The lighting and the leaves gently falling around you. The rats scurrying from garbage almost makes you smell the stench. Loot is hidden among things and you have to actually search to find some of it. There is no watching a circle spin and count down here. If you don't search you may not find.Everything is so detailed. The houses, the interiors of different things. There are even tunnels to explore.Your map has been so thoughtfully designed. If you are a lone wolf explorer it is just a joy to look around and see what you can find. If you are looking for pvp, I can't think of a better designed map. You can hide and ambush from so many different places. You can sneak around on hidden goat paths. You can hide in craggy rocks and defend yourself if pinned down. The trees and bushes and even the undergrowth provides great concealment. Dayz could only dream of having this kind of environment and have it run this smooth. I have a 680Ti and a 2600k and I run this thing maxed out and it's smooth as butter.The vehicles are fun to drive and easy to control. This game has so much potential it is staggering. Is it perfect? Obviously not. The mutants need work, and more variety. More weapons, scopes, binoculars, different clothing and different character models are going to eventually be needed. I have no doubt that all of those things will come as the game engine is tweaked and they get the connection problems sorted out for some people.If you need a game that has lots of players involved in it right away, you may want to wait. If you enjoy exploring and watching a game evolve, this is the best I have seen to date and I hope the devs get tons of support once they start to market it more. Great job devs! I await the next update.			"

Early Access Review
								really good survival game with a lot of potential. however, since it is still in early acess, it is nowhere near completion but as updates come out for the game, it gets better and better. I will make a small list of what I think stands out in this game and what I feel can be improved-pros-* big map and easy to navigate after a while of playingThe map is definitely confusing when you first join and can be a little overwhelming. Although after some time looking at online maps and finding maps in game, I am very confident with the map and how to get from town to town.* wide variety of weapons and vehiclesThere are the usual good weapons and bad weapons that you should never pick up. I feel like this game does a good job for balancing out the weapons though. There is a powerful sniper that can one shot to the head and aks that can switch firing modes. Then there are Hammers and 9mm pistols that are not powerful at all in combat. * lots of clothing and accessories for different combinations to either make you look stupid or scaryMiscreated has a lot of clothing options that have their benefits. If you search hard enough, you can become a SWAT Team member and look very menacing or you can kick it back with a meme shirt and bright orange track pants. Depends on how serious you take the game-cons-* player and loot spawnsI said previously that the loot in this game is pretty unique; this stays true but all the loot is rng. Sometimes it feels like it is impossible to find worst backpack in the game or food. I recommend looking at game guides on finding loot before starting unless you want to spend hours learning the ropes yourself. Player spawns are* even worse in my experience. As a new player, you usually spawn near a beach side of the map that has little loot and interaction with other players besides that ones that spawn there with you. This needs looked into for spawns to take place all over the map. *There has been patches that make it so you don't spawn on this beach side as much but I usually find that true when I spawn and then kill myself immediately after.* base building and craftingBase building and crafting are probably the biggest hassles in this game. Bases as a whole are broken and crafting is a pain to learn and do. Bases in the game can (as of Update 48b) be ‚Äúfloating.‚Äù They are nearly impossible to raid unless you use a military truck or a bus. These bases are going to be fixed in the future but they are just a d-bag thing to see when you are exploring the map. The crafting is also a pain because you need to find these recipes to make certain parts of your base. They, for some reason, are extremely hard to find and if you do find one, it will probably be a guide that you already found.* mutants as a wholeThere are not enough mutants that spawn or a big variety of mutants in this game. Mutants need to spawn a lot more in wooded areas and need to be a little bit more crazy in towns and cities so there is a common enemy in this game that players will be more willing to team up against than just go and kill other players. There are 4* different types of mutants; The Hulk Mutant (big fellow and will kill you in 1 or 2 hits), The Buff Boy (he is a naked fellow and has a rocking undead body), the Spiker Mutant (has a Spike for one of his hands) and the standard Mutant (your average fellow mutant.) *I did not include the Mutant dog because you do not encounter them enough to become relevant. All of the mutants, except for the Hulk, do about 10% damage and die in 3 swings from a hatchet. These damage and health stats need to be changed for a better variety and different tactics used for combat. This game was a good $10 spent during the Christmas sale, but if I was going to buy this game today at full price, I would do it today because it is a good game to play with friends. I have also made a lot of good friends on this game playing on servers. :] *miss ya gabe*			"

								Fun game, feels very polished. Graphics are great (Cryengine), combat feels smooth, survival is balanced - you will find food but if you're settling down to make a base you'll eventually need to go back to a city. Vehicles take effort (finding oil, fuel, drive belt, battery and spark plug) to get to work if you happen to find one so it's pretty satisfying/bit worrying driving about in one. Mutants are a decent threat if you're not equipped to deal with them, if you don't have a gun it's worth teaming and kiteing them to loot or just choosing a different, less infested zone.Any issues are actively worked on by a small but dedicated group of developers who are present in the community and respond to any problems the players report.Most of the negative reviews you'll see are from the initial release of the alpha when there were limited features and fewer players.

								Day 1: ""Well, what can I say, the reviews below me are quite good, I had to go a couple of pages before I saw a bad one.Seeing that and some online made me purchase this game, I however am less than impressed, I will continue to update this review as I play, but a big part of this game to me was playing with people. I logged on and across every server available was a grand total of 30 players. This was a large disappointment to me, and almost put me off playing.I continued, and was suprised with how beautiful the game looks, the item spawning locations (note: I am not complimenting the quantity of drops, just the location), it's DayZ but better.As I said before I will continue to update my review as I play.But for now I would not recommend spending ¬£14 on it.""Day 2 ""I logged back in to give the game another go, to my horror I find less than 18 people online worldwide, and I fear I may have bought into an abandoned game...""Day 3 ""I met a group ofwho held me up, after admitting I had nothing they let me go, and even follow them, they've taught me the ways and accepted me, so I've got that going for me, I've started to enjoy this, it's all about teamwork. I've changed my mind, finding the teamspeak server truely changed this game for me. TS3dragon986.TrinityGames.com:10013"" "

								Hi!I think this game is as beautiful as glitchy, but pretty good and Alpha version.I started playing with Miscreated with my friend and we got everything in the game by the 3rd hour: clothes, guns, food and drink, even some motor helmet and a car with all the accesories. I ll give a thumb up to this game but dont stop updating it because it is way not done- too short-too easy to kill a zombie-and the only achievement  is to get a working car. So thanks this game worths its cost.Bye BlazeZzHardXx!			"

								Miscreated is an open world post-apocalyptic sandbox developed by Entrada Interactive. It is the best survival game that I have played because of its phenomenal graphics and the way it immerses players.Miscreated immerses players with ambient sounds and overgrown landscapes to create a fun and enjoyable environment. The game creates a sense of fear (e.g. when you hear footsteps that are not yours in a dark and eerie town) The mutants can become a threat if not avoided or dealt with properly but the real threat is the vulnerability of other survivors. Any survivor can be a threat even if they appear to be ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô or not.The extreme detail put into this game by the developers is fantastic. Miscreated has a long and realistic day/night cycle with harsh weather conditions such as the many levels of rain, fog, wind, tornados and many other weather conditions. The downtown city recently added into Miscreateds patch #36 is amazing. The city features locations such as the police station, a hotel, scaffolding around buildings and many more.Miscreated keeps players playing because of random encounters that could happen which may result in life or death situations and the exciting updates which happen regularly.This game is definitely worth your money and time so I strongly suggest you pick up this tittle and play it. Congratulations to Entrada Interactive for creating this stunning game, keep up the effort and great work. "

								This is the first time i have ever written a review on steam before but i just have had so much fun with this game in the little time i have played to justify dropping 10 dollars on it. To start with the world itself looks amazing i really feel like i am in an apocalypse with all the run down buildings and the atmosphere is what i imagined in my ideal zombie survival game. The zombies although not really a threat have great potential to become one maybe by adding hordes in the future but they work and i havent seen one fly through a wall yet so im happy. Loot the biggest part of any survival game while new players  may get frustrated when first gearing up loot is not just sitting in the middle of a room and you take one quick look and if you dont see something you just leave in miscreated they did a great job with how loot spawns you really have to look carefully in a house or you may miss out on a gun ammo or another rare item people might say oh there is not enough loot well thats how the apocalypse is suppose to be and when you do find a gun and find the right ammo for it you feel accomplished with yourself. PVP is a mixed bag on one side you get the guys that kill on sight but on the other you have guys that are friendly and since guns can be hard to find you have a lot of opportunities to meet up with fellow freshspawns gear up together. i started at the airfield by myself i left with 4 new friends and granted it may of been a rare situation it still led up to a one of the greatest shootouts i have had with us holding up in a house and defending it from another group like the alamo. All in all i am giving this game a 8/10 as it stands now because it it still needs some work like some game crashes  but with further development i can see this game getting a 10/10 rating and i just hope the dev team keeps up the great work that they have been doing and dont lose sight of the end goal and that is to create a great zombie survival game.

								Extremely good graphics especially the weather and insides of building and water. The combat is good but id recommend making sure you will have high fps so the gun isnt so clunky. The cars are also good, a bit buggy but its fine. The looting makes this game realy feel like a true survival game, searching for food and water one minute then searching for supplies and ammo to protect yourself. The base building takes a while to do however this means there arnt loads of buildings player made around the map also again it makes it more of a hardcore survival game. It means you can put alot more time into the game. There are boats aswell and the devs are introducing a city which is a brilliant development to the game. The mutated arnt to hard to kill but can still be a pain when you have no firearm. Its a fun game but id only recommend if you can play with others and also if you have a half decent computer. Defiently worth 15 pounds in my opinion this could soon be a better game than dayz.			"

								After 15 hours in this game and experience with DayZ and other survival games I must say Miscreated is by far the most fun even in it's early development stage. It doesn't take 2 hours to get relatively geared up to PVP or just to find someone. The base building is pretty cool too. All in all even though it has a few kinks it is well worth the price tag. Even being KoS on PVP servers every now and then I still find myself coming back for more. Very addicting and highly recommended if you're an adrenaline junky. Best alpha survival game on the market currently, watch out DayZ.			"

								This game is completely underrated.Like every other survival game out there, this game is far from perfect. It has it's quirks, but nothing game breaking or life ending. But, unlike every other survival game, this game actually works really well. It feels, looks and reacts smoothly, and is far more immersive because of that. Yes, it's still being developed. And yes, the game will only get better from here. These devs are proving with every patch that they are dedicated to creating the best survival game that they possibly can, and their work speaks for itself. They deserve support for such a fantastic and promising product!pros:- has persistant base building- has working vehicles- AAA quality environment design (towns, houses, camps, roadblocks, everything looks believable/screenshot worthy)- realistic scavenging/looting- has BICYCLES!!!!- offers beautiful visuals (realistic water and reflections, ambient noises, dynamic lighting and shaders, believable overgrowth in towns/houses, and more)- has challenging enemy AI that moves and reacts as you'd expect (won't glitch through objects or hit you from really far away, hit detection on point)- PVP is f**king intensecons:- UI needs an overhaul, not intuitive & not on the same par as the rest of the game's design at this point in time- some animations are missing/broken/still being figured out- needs a bigger player pool.- game crashes (even though its rare, it sucks when it happens. pls resolve this)overall this game is the underdog of survival games on steam. its got it where it counts, and if you enjoy survival games, this is a must play. plus this last patch is MASSIVE and adds loads to the game -- give it a shot!

								First of all, absolutely love the game. Not a big survival fan, am now. Spent hours on end exploring, going into every house, walking through the woods and finding cabins, wildlife, rivers, creeks, deer trails, random dirt roads, its endless. But its not boring, the whole time you're doing it is literally a blast, very immersive.  The Cry engine looks amazing, awesome draw distance, wonderful textures, overall very polished and the game is still in alpha. I can only expect more amazing updates from the boys at Entrada. You make friends and enemies, find some trolls every now and then, find abandon bases, fallen players with possibly that little bit of food you need in their possession, Game play mechanics are wonderful, have already gotten two of my good friends into this game and they absolutely love it. I  really haven't been doing much gaming lately but I've been spending a lot of time with my computer thanks to this purchase. I think the crafting system is great, and have been staying updated with the dev blogs and what they have in store will be only improvements. I really recommend this game for really anyone since I am not the type to play this kind of game, but i have thoroughly enjoyed it and have been hooked since i bought it. One thing I would change, and don't bash me, I know the bicycles are the newest update, but you can be going as slow as you can and if you accidentally hit a friend it kills them immediately. I still haven't figured out body temperature yet, and have yet to see the radiation bar go up. None of this has even bothered me, it is more of just figuring out how everything works. I also wish you could have a game lobby, and maybe some sort of kill cam besides just going to a black screen leaving you wondering how you even died. i give it a 10/10, considering how it stacks up against other survival games, like dayz being in alpha for ages. I'm genuinely excited to see what in store for this game, i have not touched any one of the other 15 games on my computer since i have got it, I'm excited to get home and play it everyday, explore more of the map, see what other items I can craft or find, or find new buddies to play with. Keep it up Entrada, amazing game, seriously, I love it.			"

								Amidst a crowded market of early access post-apocalyptic survival games, Miscreated distinguishes itself as one of the greatest. It positions itself among giants in the same genre, DayZ and Rust, and even surpasses them in some areas.Jumping onto a server, the first thing you will notice is the beautifully broken world that is Orca Island. The foliage, grass and mountains are breath taking. Walk into a town and you have no doubt this is the apocalyps. Broken down buildings, overgrown with grass. The environment feels much more 'home"" than DayZ, as the style of architecture and items within buildings are very North American. Appliances (tvs, computers etc) laying around the world indicate that the apocalypse started sometime not very removed from our day and age.The atmosphere of the game can range anywhere from hopeful (in the bright sunny mid-day, hearing birds chirping gleefully as you stride through the forest) to spooky (in night's grips as you can see nothing other than what your flashlight illumines in front of you). The grey fog that spreads accross the land at times during the day is my favourite weather effect, as it ushers in a very foreboding and chilling atmosphere as you loot around Orca Island.The mutuants and wolves are sure to keep you on your toes, as you stealthily search for that which keeps you alive.Basebuilding is mature. It takes a group of people to build a base, and near impossible to build anything substantial alone. There is a new inventory system in the game also, where you can store your precious loot.Combat mechanics are a bit clunky. Melee combat is satisfactory, as there's some allowance to dodge blows and maneuver in a fight. However, it is the aiming system that is unsatisfactory. It can be very ""shaky"" feeling, and is something that takes practice and getting used to.As for the community, there are 7 unfriendly players to every 3 friendly (in my personal encounters anyway). Of course this is part of what makes the game fun. Albeit, when people start shooting at you with no quality interaction, it can become wearisome and negate some of the joy you experience in playing. My wish is for more roleplay servers wherein it is a requirement to have adequate interaction before ""going to war"".Personally, this is my favourite survival game. I love it.9/10. Keep up the good work, devs.			"

								I plan to do a follow-up review after the next big patch is released.I have invested currently over 50 hours in the game at this point and plan to continue to put time into it. I bought this game when it was on sale. However, for the current state of the game and what I see it's potential to be the $20 price tag right now is not too bad. Note: THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME. So there are some issues and some details that need to be fixed. But the game is beautiful, the landscape, towns and weather system is good. Though there needs to be some tweaks to the sounds. (The wind is annoying)In it's current state, the game is playable, but limited due to the current system setup. You may see reviews that talk about not having doors to open.. this and that‚Ä¶ H1Z1, dayZ blah‚Ä¶  but this is all explained on the Miscreated website in twitch streams and this feature and many others will be added following successful implementation of the new item management system.The Dev team is active in the threads about answering questions so the game is still well in development. I host a Server that I maintain as PvE and requires you to apply to get in as there is no PvP off option. So if you get on a public server beware!! Also admins abilities are limited therefore no admins summoning in cars or guns and ammo for themselves which is a plus. I still will give this game a recommendation BUT, I do recommend waiting till the new patch that should be out ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. That‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve gotten from the Dev team. They jumped the gun on a release so they are not going to make any more promises. Just soon‚Ä¶.. They really care about the game they are making.			"

								I walk along the highway, wondering where my next meal will come from. I haven't seen anyone for a long time... but I know they're there... Stinkin' bandits. Jumping out of nowhere, gunning you down for the measly salvage in your pockets. I look down the road and see a figure approaching. Without hesitation I bolt into the nearby foliage, hoping he didn't see me.""hello? Friendly dude."" He isn't approaching anymore. His hand waves to me in a peaceful manner.""need any food man? I could use some rope. Got any rope?""I don't trust him. yeah I've got rope... three coils of the stuff... how's my hunger bar? Below 50%... not good.""yeah I've got rope. What kind of food you got?""""A couple cans of tuna, some peaches""""I'll take the tuna""""Awesome. Here you go""The cans fall to the ground at his feet.Do I take the bait? I see something at his side. is that his flashlight or a pistol? Definitely pistol. he could whip that out and cap me as I stand over the trade. Gotta risk it.This is a typical encounter in Miscreated. It's a true survival format. Mutants, hunger, thirst, tornadoes, and your fellow players are the forces you fight to stay alive. The Devs seem to be really active with this game and just in the couple weeks I've played the game they've been busy trying to optimize the experince.Is it better than other games of its kind? I coudn't tell you. I just know it was worth every penny.			"

								Early Access Opinion:I've always been a fan of Open world survival games.  I usually buy them when I see them.  I saw someone playing this on youtube and figured it was cheap enough and bought it.  Think I got it on sale, can't remember.  Anyways, it looked decent on video, but when I played it, I wasn't too impressed.  I recently tried it again and was actually impressed.  The game still needs a lot of work, but it doesn't look half bad.  The gameplay isn't bad either.  As long as you're on a server with players.  Really, if you love these kind of games and don't mind the 25$ cost, give it a shot, you might be surprised.  I hope they complete it, we need some good open world survival games.			"

								I recommend this game for everyone! why?1. Beautiful realistic locations2. Active developers3. A good amount of realism4. So many vehicles!! (boats, bus, military trucks, tractors, bikes, jeep and many many more...)5. Detailed map with caves and well designed buildings... NOW with a new big town!!! 6. Building system!! You can make your own base!!! If you don't want to build your base, just find a tent and make a camp into the woods!! 7. Building with recipe system (It gives more depth into the game). There are many recipes into the game like generators, lights, betters walls, second floors, etc....8. wolves / mutants and... new mutants :P9. A huge variation of items...10. I love the vegetation in this game!! You can see the grass moving if you pass over it...11. With my gtx 660 gpu i can play this game very stable...12. Realistic night and day circle...13. ....14. ...and the list goes on....			"

								I've played many of the survival games, and this one is very good, So far i've ran to 4 different towns and the trailor park got looted up, so much food I could share with a group.  It has that DayZ feel in the sense the way it looks, but it has a smooth animation that i like, it's like the best of h1z1 and DayZ combined,  I love how many houses are different, you can look into a house and almost feel what went down in that house, the ""I have a weapon stay away"" sign on some house's when I first seen this I was like ""ohh i like that"" Overall I dig this game, it has more to grow but it's a great game and way worth the price of admission			"

								Hands down if your thinking about buying the game do so. Just buy it now. The Developers are making great progress.  This game is Beautiful, and the PVP is intense.  There are PLENTY of server choices so if you dont like a server. Try a different one.  For an early access game this game really hits the bar.  Everything DayZ Standalone should have been and so much more.  Its early access so yeah there are some bugs, but nothing gamebreaking that ive encountered. Judging based on an Early Development title against other Early Access games on steam ive played this is a solid 8/10.			"

								Really not sure why this game has mixed reviews, it's actually one of the best survival games I can think of out right now, the graphics are phenomenal, the gun-play is great, the weather system is state of the art, zombies are scary, and it's hard to find items. I think this game is very under-rated and if you can pick it up for half price of even full price it's a steal to have in your library. "

								Obviously Miscreated is in Alpha, obviously it is a lot like Dayz or H1Z1 or 7 Days to Die. However from personal experience with Dayz Standalone, and 7 Days to Die, this game is leagues ahead of its counterparts in my opinion. Miscreated is a beautifully crafted game and you can tell a lot of dedication has gone into making it's world. From graffiti giving you a sense of the world before the mutants came to be, or the rats that now crawl in the alleyways through every city scavaging for food, you can surmise the events that came to be.Miscreated's controls are fluent. It doesn't feel as clunky as Dayz Standalone for example.Loot is generally easily to come by, but you'll still have a harder time finding the more rare things such as crossbows or that desperately needed sniper scope. There have been times that I've nearly died but I finally found that Tomato Juice I was searching for to hold me over until my friends were able to reach me and help me out.Speaking of which, Miscreated has a very creepy atmosphere when playing alone, you feel like a survivor in the wilderness just trying to survive, there are many fantastic RP servers to choose from that I have never encountered someone who KOS'd. Everyone I've come across is playing this game for the fun of it, they mostly enjoy that player interaction and will at least give you a chance.This game absolutely shines with friends though. I have already met about 8 new people and group up with them on a daily basis to go exploring through the towns, cities, and even magnificent caves with waterfalls inside of them (Bring a flashlight cause they get DARK.)I highly recommend this game if you enjoy games like DayZ or H1Z1.

								GIVE THIS GAME A CHANCE.  Went in with very low expectations and I can say this game has delivered way more than I imagined. WELL worth the 20$ early access price. The dev team has come an extremely long way from early reviews and this game is a blasty blast. In comparison with DayZ, the bugs I've encontered have been few and far between. GREAT atmosphere and lighting. The weather effects may be the best I've experienced in any game. Fun enemies and PvP. Very respectable loot system. Cool base buiilding and crafting elements. Gun play is fun, and challenging. The enviroments are top notch, I really can't say enough about the wonderful atmosphere this game has. The citys are overgrown and have a lived-in feeling adding to the emersion, in my opinion this game is much more pleasing to look at than dayZ. In many ways this game feels so much further along in the development cycle than dayZ (which i compare it t often because its the only ther survival game I have massive time invested in). There are already cars and predators, which, at the time of this review are either not in dayZ, or are so buggy and complicated to get running they're not worth messing with.The (minor) Cons-Friends with lower end PC's have some trouble running the game, but its possible- At this point the guns, in my opinion, do not sound very good. But from what I've read some are place holders to be fixed in the future. And the gun shots arent heard from more than 200m or so. (At least for me and I use TB's)-Cars can be ninjas, that you cant hear until there right between your butt cheeks-The server joining menu REALLY needs to be overhauled and more intuitive to make it easier to join friends-Cant prone-Items sometime get eaten by the earth if dropped in houses or bushes- The UI needs a little work, but is respectable, and fairly easy to navigateBottom line, this game is a blast, and only getting better. Obviously this game is in early access, so the minor bugs I have foudn will be fixed. If youre looking for a survival game thats fun and beautiful, this is it.  "

								Miscreated is a stand-out Early Access survival game, and a butt-load of fun! This is not a clone of other survival games, the team at Entrada have been working hard on making a unique game. There is still plenty to come yet, but the game play is visceral and realistic. Loot is scattered around the map in the open, and hidden around houses and buildings. AI encounters are random and player interaction is just as random. You can hide, run away, attack or strike up a conversation. Maybe trade, or demand payment... You'll survive longer in groups, but you can't always trust everyone, so keep your gun handy, and loaded. Want to get a vehicle working? (aside from a bike <<you just jump on one of them and go!), you need to work with a team or hope no one steals your ride before you find all the parts to get it going. It is survival of the fittest after all. Work with a clan to create a base and help protect each other from other players and the AI mutants. (more variants and types of AI are still in the design process) This is not a Zombie-clone. The Mutants form part of the game back story, so if you want zombies, go back to one of the cloned games.  ""...Hell, in the end AC made just about everything, AC Sportsdrinks, AC Icecream, AC Battlegear, even AC Happytabs. I miss those. AC even gave us our wonderful mutant problem...""...ProsRealistClansMutantsGuns, Guns, Guns.

								Two words:AWESOME!Let me tell you how I got to that:There once was a boy that loved survival genre-type games. He bought Miscreated, and went on living, happily ever after.No, seriously, it's awesome. I mean, it's still in Early Access ALPHA, and has so many cool features that I sometimes get overwhelmed with the quantity of information that the game disposes of e.g blueprint crafting recipe... type-thing? - It allows you to craft more complex stuff. It's definitely worth buying. I have it, my brother has it, my (only) two friends have it. We have a lot of fun in this!			"

								Don't buy it right now, too early access, just search this on Google ""Miscreated can't join any server"". It's so early access that it's almost impossible to log into any server (specially in Europe), even an empty one. I've bought the game to try it out and so far could't manage to play one time. I've spent about 23 euros for the possibility of a good game I can't play. I have no question about it going to be a good survival game in the near future, so I recommend everyone to wait some more time for the developer's to make Miscreated somewhat more stable.EDIT: They sent out Patch #8 - 11/26/2014This patch is to address some of the server stability and client frame rate issues and does not contain any new content. It is the build we've been testing on the experimental server the last couple of days. BUT!!!NOTE: There is still a lingering issue where the servers will randomly cause connecting clients to hang at the Synchronizing screen. Because of this issue, we will still be restarting the servers on a regular basis for now. If you do find a stuck server, please post in the Bug Reports section of the forums and we'll restart it as quickly as we can.			"

								As said by alot of other players this game has potential. The PvP makes more some good moments. I had alot of laughs and fun while encountering other players. The PvE however is seriously lacking. Depending on where you are in the map or the population of the server you can go for periods of times where you are not going to encounter players. Perhaps your purposely avoiding them in order to build up some loot and items. A better PvE experience would fill this void and add alot of playing hours and excitement to the game. The mutants lack in diversity and were few and far between. They also don't pose much of a threat and are easy to avoid. This could easily be enhanced by spawning some of the creatures inside some of the houses or perhaps roaming the streets ""guarding"" the towns. Perhaps make it so it would require more of a group effort to get into certain locations for better loot. This would also enhance the PvP experience also both competitively and cooperatively. At first I was genuinely nervous entering houses fearing a creature might be inside. Haven't had it happen yet so the looting process becomes stale and boring. The game however did run smoothly and I didn't experience many bugs and glitches so far. All that said it's a decent game but it won't be one of my more regular plays. If your looking for that game that you can dive deep into and burn hours of your day like we tend to do as gamers this probably isn't the one. However if your looking for something early access and are patient and would like something to follow along with as it hopefully develops and improves this may not be a bad choice. I haven't played DayZ or any of the other apocalypse survival types so I unfortunately cannot compare.			"

								Hands down this is the best open world survival on the market. Miles ahead of Dayz in so many ways. Great graphics, base building, vehicles, controller support, and a total blast to play with a group of people. If you were initially excited about the genre of Dayz, but were in the end ultimately disappointed due to countless glitchy deaths like falling through flights of stairs, off ladders, or smashing your toe on a rock, especially after spending hours building your character, Miscreated will without a doubt fill that void and then some. I cannot stress enough how much this game kicks Dayz's a**. Incredibly impressed and seriuosly surprised how Miscreated has flown under the radar and is not more well known. 10/10.			"

								If you asked me a few months ago to write a review for this game it would not have been positive. It seemed just like a prettier version of a Dayz knockoff. Recently I took a second look and documented some of my play time and I am glad I did. The game is beautiful, without a doubt one of the prettiest enviroments I have experienced in any game, let alone a survival sim. It has lush forests beautiful water and all the homes look lived in. The developers paid close attention to make oridnary homes tell a story to the player. You may find a skull in a childs room, or boxes in a pile in a room as if the owners were attempting to gather their belongings and evacuate. These items a long with the scenery are some of the big pros to this game. Now, the game runs beautiful and the developers seemed to have paid attention to server optimization and making the game run smooth, as opposed to Dayz which in itself is pretty, but runs like a brick. The game features a crafting menu, as well as items to equip on your character. You can fight unarmed, but melee weapons and guns are available. Vehicles also appear in the game, as well as parts to repair them If there is a con, it is definatley the lack of player models and the limited amount of zombies. These things are trivial and will most likely be added in eventually and do not warrant a negative review in my opinion.			"

Even if you have nothing what so ever..Very unfriendly people.Annoying the Wolves.Hard to find guns most of the time get killed before finding a gun.Need a very good computer to play.Gets very boring having to walk very far,then getting shot by someone because you have no gun.Takes ages to find your friends if you don't know map very well.Overally I think it is woth getting if you have friends if you don't have friends I don't think it is really worth getting in my opinion.

								Decent survival game (which i like the most at this moment)If you're givin' up on Dayz development, then u should absolutely try this one, since its almost the same, just not that hardcore (simulator) It's more ""arcade style"" in shooting and movement, with 4x smaller map than Dayz and 36 players per server (ATM)Some bugs are annoying, like freezing game while looting a dead body, or some network leaks not registrating hits from weapons, but that doesn't happen so often. Developers working hard on the game, listening to the players and communicating with them, which is good, like you can find rarely a game in EA with so active devs.I see as everyone wants to hear comparison between Miscreated and H1z1:Just Survive.. I never played that game, so i can't tell you which one is better, but as far as i know some stuff and watched some vides from Just survive, i would definitely recommend you Miscreated, so try to give it a hit!

								Not worth it at this point in the game. It's basically just an environment filled with CryEngine basic assets and absolutely nothing to do. Entirely too boring for $25 price point Alpha Testing, what is there to test at this point? Maybe it'll change when they import their own assets and actually incorporate something to do to be able to test.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall, the game appealed to me from the start: crafting, survival, zombie-like mutants, and interactions with other players. There are some great positives about the game. It's  very beautiful with realistic terrain and a peaceful, post apocalyptic atmosphere. I met some great people that brought me into their group. This being said, it doesn't make up for the overall lackluster nautre of the game. It just doesn't deliver, even for an early release and especially for the price. -- World load times are very, very long. A little faith is needed to stick with the game when you log on as it seems that the client froze up. With a good computer and internet connection, it still takes a few minutes.-- It's laggy when you move or turn your head, making it difficult to get immersed in the game. It's also a HUGE pain for trying to fight when turning quickly is probably the most important factor in killing or being killed.-- There are few options for customizing the audio, video, or gameplay settings. Far far fewer than even the standard options offered in most games.-- You spawn with nothing and spend A LOT of time to gather even basic food and weapons. Upon death, you lose everything. There is no way to store items except on your person. While starting from scratch and high death penalty can be seen as desirable things, not being able to rathole items, create defensive structures, or spawn relatively close to your body is very tedious. Getting to even a basic level of combat readiness can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the luck of your spawn. Since PvE, PvP, and environmental hazards can lead to death relatively frequently, the fourth or seventh or twentieth time you have to start from scratch gets very old. -- Items are a Catch 22. Players make the game interesting and items help you survive the playres. Item spawns are generally slow and certain useful ones are denser in a handful of areas (such as finding guns at the airbase). This means on maps with the highest chance of dieing (large numbers of players), there are fewer guns, ammo, melee weapons, and even basics such as food and water. It's almost neccesary to go to servers with few to no people on them in order to stock up after a death, but without other people, the danger is removed and the game is much less interesting. What's left is about 20-30 minutes of chore-like scavenging. The spawn rates should increase with the amount of people on the server, but it doesn't. This means you are continuously unprepared/spending inordinate amounts of time preparing on a high-traffic server, efficiently gathering on a low traffic server where there is a neglible chance of needing the items, or being forced to regularly switch back and forth, suffering through the long world load times twice after every death. -- Despite a cool international community, the game doesn't support squad or multiplayer things for friends. The voice chat is difficult to hear and cuts out, almost requiring TeamSpeak instead of the ingame option. There are no ways to signal to them, or make a squad. It's difficult to tell people apart (my group took our shoes off to show we were allies -- if a stranger did the same, they'd blend in seamlessly). There is no revive or stabilize option (though this was mentioned as a future project) meaning that on death you respawn FAR away from your team. This takes a lot of time to run back to your team while they either sit and wait or run to you. Often, it is much quicker to suicide repeatedly until you spawn closer to them. A game which has suicide incentives like this is flawed. -- The items are boring. The food, water, and soda show the most diversity and still lack creativity. (low quality graphics, lack of humor or character in branding, uninteresting containers) Cars are difficult to find and repair, but once made are simply a slightly faster way of getting around. Driving is clumsy and doesn't offer adrenaline pumping speed, maneuverability, or offensive capability. After being used, you basically have to leave the car when you log off, making the return on time invested a lot less worthwhile. Guns are not customizable and have one model per class for the most part. A single revolver, handgun, bolt action rifle, semi auto rifle, shotgun, etc. Reloading is also a pain, requiring one to open inventory and manually place ammo into the gun. -- There are no safe zones, civilians, occupied towns, engaging or interesting NPCs, opportunities to trade, etc. Interactions with other players fall into three categories -- 1) they want to kill you 2) they want to join up to be protected from people that want to kill you 3) they don't want anything to do with you. Very shallow interactions. -- Fall damage is ridiculous. Even a minor fall, say 10 feet, can lead to death. Rocks are especially difficult since they act almost slippery. It would make FAR more sense to have a realistic injury, such as sprained ankle impairing movement speed, or even breaking ones legs on a decent fall. -- There isn't the ability to create a 'home' or defensive structure in this sandbox world. You can't build walls, barricade a house, dig into a hill, build a fort, establish a clan, set real traps, create defenses. Outside of this nomadic existence, there isn't a more defensive way to play. You either scavenge and kill with a team, or do so alone. -- You can't interact with most of the world. Buildings don't change and are not destructible. Doors can't be opened or closed anymore. Trees can be cut for wood but do not get chopped down. Things such as flimsy wood baricades or small trees will stop a full speed car. Sleeping bags can't be looted. Books can't be read. Objects such as dumpsters or boxes can't be moved. Boxes or containers can't be broken to see what's inside. -- Navigating is difficult and imo, unrealistic. Every road connecting cities and towns has signs poiting out directions, roads, advertisements, etc. In Miscreated, everything is pretty much along Route 88, all the gas stations look the same, and it's truly difficult to figure out where you are. The answer is to play long enough (and die often enough) that you memorize landmarks and spawn points. These are not iconic landmarks, mind you, but things like ""does the generic bridge have two, three, or four sections?"" Each town looks very similar, lacking even the most rudimentary differences like business or street signs. The maps found on boards near some spawn points should be able to be 'committed to memory' in the game, but instead, one has to actually memorize a 2D, non-topographical map which only outlines rivers, oceanfront, and land. Even without this, a player should have the option of finding a AAA map in a gas station to take along as an item. -- There isn't a plot or storyline.  It takes time to gather supplies, but you pretty much cap out at maximum weapons, carrying capacity, and ammo  quickly so there isn't much room for growth. PvP is largely who sees who first. There are no achievements or fun things to strive for. Killing mutant spikers and other players offers very limited reward of the items they were carrying (especially since if you killed them you probably have a decent outfit already). I spent about an hour getting a car and gearing up with my friend. After that, what do we do? Drive around the island waiting for something interesting to happen. Nothing did. This is a similar to most of my other experiences. Just my thoughts. All of these issues are addressable, but currently I'm just tired of wandering around, repetitively searching for supplies, preparing to fight, dieing, and starting all over again. There just isn't more to this game at this point. That being said, Fallout: New Vegas has finished downloading! See ya!			"

								Imagine if DayZ ran maxed out without all the issues and didn't feel like it was falling apart at the seems and then you'll have an idea of what Miscreated is. It's definately one of the best looking and streamlined zombie survival games I've played. It definately has a ways to go but the developers are in constant contact with the community and are always releasing patches updating and balancing everything. I will update my review once early access is over but I think it's only going to get better.			"

								If you are a fan of dayz, rust, 7 days to die, basically any kind of survival game, you will want to pick this up.  Yes its true that as of now its bare bones.  BUT.  I can see them in the future making this game funkin unreal.  The graphics and amosphere do this game justice for 24.99 that it is as of now.  It does have basically everything the dayz standalone has and its just came out in early alpha.  With enough support from us all it will be and could be one of the best games they make.  Cryengine is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing amazing in this game.  I have sli 670's and I pray they enable sli soon, but running on just one of them its maxing it out with just a couple minor tweaks here and there.   Get this game and watch it progress or just buy it now play for a couple hours then sit on it till its done.  Its a wise investment cause I know when this is fully released its gonna be worth a hefty price tag.			"

								All these fake reviews on here are disgusting, This game is not even remotley worth playing in its current state. I searched searver by player count, joined the server with the most listed players starting from top and worked my way down. It wasnt till i got down to one listed as 18/50 that i got one person to say hi, and then for 2 hours after that nothing. I ran everwhere and never found anything more than a chicken to kill. The only gear i found was 4 pairs of gloves an eye patch and a ball cap. Only 4 inventory slots... And you just run... and run....and run.... house after house. Why is this even in early access?  Sad to say this review prolly wont even make it on the page but i hope i can save a few people from wasting their money. DONT BUY			"

								It is so scary at night on you're one so much great sounds.Graphics are great they are even going to upgrade it when it already looks so good!System is pretty balanced just a little hard to find guides.Mutants are so scary at night but a little overpowered I think.Wasteland, Carlington and the 9mm handgun are a little bit underpowerd sometimes it takes like 4 shots to kill a mutant.It it almost impossible to find a sniper or AT-15 but it makes it a challange.The game is pretty good optimased but I think it can be better.The basebuilding is awesome but hard to find guides.Verhicles are not that hard to find but you need so much things for itit would be realistic if there would be a story after the car like the car has 3 wheelsand the rest of the parts full the owner had his wheel broken or something and went looking for one: this is just a rough sample of what I would like to see.The reload system isn't there but is going to be there soon you don't have to replace them in you're inventory.some bugs that are in the game=Verhicles clitch a lot a lot yes 2 times a lot now 3...A lot of car inventory glitches.And a invisible thing in the mid of the map crash my just stolen truck... :(-For those who made it to the end my final opinion for this game: So ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing awesome you should buy  for more support for the creatorsbecause they have a really small team but make pretty fast and decent updates.If one of the developers read this please react it would mean the world to me...-If you like it please rate it thanks bye? lol....wow this cost me like 20 minutes...

								I wasn't sure what to expect but the reviews were so good and it was just $10.  Within first few minutes of running around searching for loot (a blast from the get-go) I ran into another player who waved at me and invited me to tag along with him while we met up with his buddy. He was friendly and gave me a motorcycle helmet. I thanked him and we got separated while I was engrossed in searching and exploring. I searched solo for a while and found some nice gear. Suddenly I noticed that I was dying (not sure why) and ran off in a panic. While running by some buildings I heard somebody saying ""Hey, theres a fully loaded guy running by outside. I stopped to see who they were, half expecting to be quickly murdered for my gear. Instead, they basically stood by and waited for me to die so they could have my backpack and junk. lol. I tried to respawn but was stuck with black screen with audio. I force quit the game and restarted. This time I scored big. I found a military base, found a pistol, an axe, etc. Then while searching another building, I heard scary growling from outside. I got up the nerve to investigate. I ran out the door to see what it was; a dog, a zombie?  Then I notice some guy with ok gear running by so I take off running after him. Maybe he heard the growling too? I wave to him when he notices me and stops. I hear him say ""A friendly!"", turn my back for a second to survey the scence and he attacks me in the back with his axe and kills me. Ugh, you little punk!  Cannot wait to play again tomorrow and I will be looking for you kid! LOL. This game already has me hooked in 2.5 hours!

								This game is promising and there is a lot to learn. Like most early access games, it has it's fair share of bugs and such. Sometimes the game really hates you and doesn't let you connect to a server. The game does, however, boast full controller support for Xbox and PS. The developers are also very kind and active. What this game really needs is a big YouTuber or Twitch Streamer to pick this up, that would be a substantial improvement for this game. If you play this game and you can record with decent FPS, please post any video you can. From funny moments, tips and tricks, or tutorials. Also be sure to play with a friend as your chances of survival are increased. It is much more fun with a friend anyways. Combat and vehicles are always in a state of constant change. All in all, until storage is released (in which case I will update this review), you are better off playing The Forest.EDIT: They finally added storage in! Although small it is very useful.			"

After the big update i decided it was time to add it to my library.iv been a big fan of the dayz mod/standalone and i can honestly say this is so much better in so many ways IE map graphics gameplay and over all feel. also i just want to add, i was watching a few video about miscreated on youtube before i made my purchased and noticed that the game looked gorgeous and had doubts that my GTX 680 was up to task. too suprise the game runs perfectly max out SUPER HAPPY!! its just a shame i have to work or i would be playing this all day.

								Be prepared to run and scavenge a lot!The atmosphere reminds me a bit of Nether.Must say that hunger and thirst decrease quite 'aggressively'. This forces you to search for food and drinks, rather than exploring. Once you have a little stored you can venture out, but never to far, 'cause you never know when you will find refreshments!			"

								Very beautiful and immersive experience. Learning curve was a bit steep for me, but once I tweeked the controls to my liking it improved. Best played with friends that know some of the tools uses and the need for crafting guides. Lots of small things to improve in the coming patches but it is a excellent alpha game. I enjoy the struggle of finding ammo, food, supplies and grafting guides. The ""zombies"" and packs of wolves is a good element to overcome.			"

								ok we love the game but it is starting to get a repeated game, u start off getting clothes, foood and so, u build your base u get hungry u go to town for food if u are not so lucky u might get killed , then u get spawned so far from your dead body that u cant get back in time to loot your stuff, bad luck is your partner cant even loot all your stuff not even that cool bag u had on u. I acidently drop the tshirt with my army jacket in it, the tshirt dissapear with my army jacket. Last night we couldnt log in the game because of poor internet connection, tonight I log on our cars that we had is gone, the thing about the respawn of cars is not cool, u work your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•of to find all the parts and the car just just to loose it to some jerk we wants to steal it or it totaly dissapear if u dont log on in time. This game is about realism but in real life cars have keys so u should only loose ownership on death of a vehicle. The content of a vehicle should only be accesible by yourself and your clan that is realistic. Cars dont explode when hit by 2 shotguns hits, cars are to weak when it comes to peope or raiders shooting at it. Maybe a tire can blow or tank get a hole and it leaks fuel but cars dont explode when u shoot at it in real life it only explode in movies. Loot that falls on the ground dont just dissapear in front of your eyes in real life and also u dont eat like a pig in real life like these avatars needs food and drinks u barely start building your base and u have to run off to go search for food because we realy need storages.

								Miscreated is a beautiful game, graphics looks outstanding specially rain storms and the game has alot of potential. BUT like some streamers says (me included) the game just feels empty. You gear up a bit then what? you get tired of playing fast and i can't play 3-4 hours in a row like i do in Dayz because i lose interest after like 40-45 min. If they could work on that emptyness, this will be the Dayz killer! 7/10 (for now)			"

								Very fun and immersive hardcore pvp game even for medium mouse and keyboard skilled players with some crafting elements. Also fun trying to decide if who you come across will try to kill you or if they will be your new friend. I love games like these because of the rush and the way it makes your heart beat when you are in a gun fight and worried about losing all your gear if you die. Definitly worth 10$ sale price @ 1/3 the price of Dayz and I havent personally had any problems with hackers. I gave this game a negative review about 6 months ago until I tried it again recently and the game's mechanics and graphics and all around gameplay have exponentially/drastically changed for the better. Take some bong rips and lose yourself in this beautiful immersive game. 9/10 pvp survival game			"

								Lets start with is good, I like the game, it has great ideas and visually it isn't that bad with a large map.BUTEvery time I login i have nothing in my inventory and no idea where i am.it might be because i have played Ark for a long time and was hoping for a game i could log out safely and not wake up with my weapons being owned by someone else. also if you want to keep your items i heard that you have to stay in one server which isn't an issue if i could remember what server i had left.So hopefully someone will make a feature where you can store your favourite server like Ark.Other than that a 2 hours of exploring and gathering things, trying to repair a car, beat up a bandit that decided to try his luck, I still like this game and will play it in the future but not right now.

								Just another survival game? Absolutly NOT. If you're a ""survival barry"" like me, you'll probably be feeling burn't out from all the DayZ copies including the stand-alone. Set in a (quite evident) post apocalyptic future, Miscreated has managed to renew the feeling of that all too familiar ""zombie run"" many of you had experienced in one way or another in the DayZ mod.  This game features all the usuals we've come to expect with this type of genre but the team at Entrada Interactive has done it RIGHT whilst adding there own unique touch and feel the the game. The game is visually stunning and the dynamic weather events add a ""real world"" feel to the game, something missing from most other titles in the genre. If you want ""the"" survival game we have all been wanting for years then this is a serious contender. This small development team has giving me hope for this genre once again.10/10 Give them your money.			"

								I wasn't sure what to expect but the reviews were so good and it was just $10.  Within first few minutes of running around searching for loot (a blast from the get-go) I ran into another player who waved at me and invited me to tag along with him while we met up with his buddy. He was friendly and gave me a motorcycle helmet. I thanked him and we got separated while I was engrossed in searching and exploring. I searched solo for a while and found some nice gear. Suddenly I noticed that I was dying (not sure why) and ran off in a panic. While running by some buildings I heard somebody saying ""Hey, theres a fully loaded guy running by outside. I stopped to see who they were, half expecting to be quickly murdered for my gear. Instead, they basically stood by and waited for me to die so they could have my backpack and junk. lol. I tried to respawn but was stuck with black screen with audio. I force quit the game and restarted. This time I scored big. I found a military base, found a pistol, an axe, etc. Then while searching another building, I heard scary growling from outside. I got up the nerve to investigate. I ran out the door to see what it was; a dog, a zombie?  Then I notice some guy with ok gear running by so I take off running after him. Maybe he heard the growling too? I wave to him when he notices me and stops. I hear him say ""A friendly!"", turn my back for a second to survey the scence and he attacks me in the back with his axe and kills me. Ugh, you little punk!  Cannot wait to play again tomorrow and I will be looking for you kid! LOL. This game already has me hooked in 2.5 hours! I can't wait to see what the devs have coming in the future.			"

Some company started buying up everything and marketing it to the point they controlled the world in some Captitalists wet dream. They Made some drug that started mutating people and made things worse.  There's probably more story but i'm too much of a lazy gamer to remember.As for the mechanics, it's all pretty stable. Gunshots get my heartrate going, exploring is always fun, getting shot at by some 9 year old with a shotgun makes me mad. All the staples of a  good multiplayer game.The base building needs some work and tweaking for the recipes and placement issues, and the graphics DEFINITELY need optimizing. Either that or my laptop just isn't good enough, but I doubt that. And don't get me started on driving.TLDR good game so far: stable enough, fun to explore, a squeaker will shoot you in the face eventually. 8/10 IGN			"

								This game is acutally really good. On many levels it's ahead of the other games in this style of genre Dayz/H1. I am enjoying playing and look foward to see what direction it goes in. My only cons are as follows,The UI for inventory is on the small size.Also the server menuRating 9/10			"

								This is only survival game on steam which gets really better in every update. Devs are still working on the game and they are really trying to improve it in right way. This game is not abanoned like Dayz or going into wrong direction like Rust. Ignore the bad ratings and try it for yourself.			"

								It's gorgeous. Honestly mind blowingly pretty. And it's indie. It even looks better than Battlefield 1.The game itself.. Is lacking. It's just another survival game. Spawn in, run to popular loot, grab some loot, die, repeat. It has potential, though. The people playing this are absolutely fantastic. First day of playing this I ran to the airfield, where I met two guys looting. They joined us and then another guy popped in and joined us as well. I've now played for the last 3 days with one of the two first guys and I'm having a blast. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a while. With some good updates (like removing the stupid 3 hop limit, 30 second leave server thing (combat loggers will just use the instant exit game, so it's just a problem for the people who play fair) and de-sync bugs) and some additions (like favorite and recent server tabs), this could be great. The base building needs a lot of work. There's no point in spending your time making a base, because the storage system is stupid. You can only have 1 small box (10 slots) and a big box (not sure how many slots) per base, which is stupid. There is no purpose to base building except if you're a clan and have vehicles. The maps still not finished either, so there's a lot of potential. The new city (Hayward Valley) is so cool. It's like playing The Division like how it was in the trailers.It takes some time to get used to it, but I've pretty much learned the map. It's around 6x6km(?), and I pretty much know all the spawns. I like how there are no compasses in the game, so you actually have to use signs to navigate.Graphics: 10/10Gameplay: 6/10Community: 9/10Devs: 8/10Overall: 8.25/10Solid buy for $15. I got it on sale for $7 so definetely take advantage of it right now.			"

								I recommend this game. I personally ticked the ""not interested"" option time ago when I first saw it, but a lot of things have been added to the game. The graphics is good and with the weather system it's even better. As of now there's no storage system BUT the developers are working on the new inventory system which will include the storage system as well. The AI has been improved but it lacks of something still, and imho they should add more mutants around the map.However, it's a good survival game, especially considering it's in its pre-alpha stage. I personally enjoy playing it, going around to find food and water, weapons and ammo, and the best thing is that you never know who you cant trust. I myself feel lucky I found a couple of people to hang aroun with. Also, you can build your own base, and once the storage system will be implemented it is going to be even more useful.You can also drive a range of vehicles, like 4 vehicles I believe: a boat, truck, two cars I think. The nice feature is that you need several different items to start a vehicle: belt, fuel, oil, 4 wheels, spark plugs and car battery. As of now vehicles can be really useful to move around the map but also to store more items for yourself and your group.I do recommend playing this game. Most of the reviews are old but now the ""mixed"" status is not real.YOu'll find people killing on sight, yes, you will. But you'll also find friendly people. Just do your best to survive and team up with those who deserve it.Hopefully one day a roleplay community will come out ^^.EDIT: Storage system is out! They are still working on it, improving it actually, but you can store your stuff now. What are you waiting for? Buy this game! It's better and better with every patch they release.EDIT: 9/11/2016They are still patching this game.. since the release of the new inventory management and whatever they did ( can't remember, but they did something really important), they kept releasing patches and the game becomes better. Once the environment will be really challenging (it is challenging now too but only rarely), this is gonna be really great. We only need things to do except for looting and killing other players.I still recommend it.			"

								I got this game few days ago when it was 50% sale. For an early access game it was a good price otherwise I wouldn't botther to buy it.First impressions and what I think it should be improved:- When opening the menu, there is a simple design with a very relaxing music what is awesome. I would leave room for design improvements.- There is no character creation feature what I think is faulty, I am not sure if it will be a thing later on, but I am  girl and I like to play with female characters. In this phase i am obligated to you use a guy with a purple t-shirt most of the times or a pink beanie.- One thing that I think it should be important even for a early acess game is how you can play with your friends. Ok it is nice when you start playing you spawn in the middle of nowhere with some clothes on, on a journey to find your friends. I think this is acceptable at least once. Although as the game progresses and you get killed several times, the journey to join your friends get tedious. My first playthrough was 3 hours wondering in the map to get where my friends were. Even with the map I was lost. I am not sure there would be a compass item or if it exists already in the game, because I was moving in circles near clyde hill.- More signs would be useful, more crowded maps and life ( animals, birds). Its an apocalypse world, maybe but it should have more PVE  elements. By the way more cars and bikes would be great.- People should be able to fish, hunt for food, do fires, drag corpses.- Riding the bike in the first person view should be improved.- The bleeding it should be more visible.- When playing I found an orange track pants, I wore them immediately  because I thought would be a nice gag between my group. We  went to brightmor from the place we found the pants, to find out later on that all my items that were in the previous pants were gone. I feel like the clothes menu it should have the option ""get them"" or ""equip them"" without messing the items.Besides that, the game as really awesome graphics and weather system. I had a lot of funs with my friends ( when I found them), and it is all that you expect in a survival game. It has some vibes of Last of Us mixed with other survival games.I love the sound of the birds and the way the players interact with each other, afraid to being stab from behind. I saw a boat, a bus to drive, and other several random stuff that makes this game a very good early access game. I am playing these for two days. I hope they improve the things I wrote above, because there is potential in this game.			"

								Hi Luthias bringing you a recommendationMiscreated is one of the most beautiful games ive ever played.Please support the developers. They are working hard and theresenough piracy killing the future of great gaming. I looked at Day-Z,H1Z1, Nether and more and found to my delight Miscreated.The weather effects with a headset gives me a real feeling that ive only felt in real life camping in the wild. The sounds are perfectand you get nervous walking around at night with other playerslooking around on bikes and trucks. Hiding in the bushes till they move on is thrilling and the sounds the mutants make gets youall flustered looking in every direction. Map size is perfect and givesyou a real island feeling.Servers are still a bit quiet so please jump on this bus while you canthe players are friendly and survival is real. Enjoy. 10/10			"

								What a beautiful Alpha game, it's the CREAM OF THE CROP!  The graphics are nearly as beautiful as my Elizabeth.  They have a small but dedicated development team, (so things can seem a bit slow going for updates) but you can bet your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•they are churning out code as fast as they can.  Grouping is a must in this game, if you go in solo to a server that is marked PVP...expect to die alot.  Find a pve server and make some friends or go it alone and try to make as many friends as you can, so you can group up and stay alive.  The map is quite large (64 sq miles I believe), even though you can ""fix"" trucks and other vehicles up, expect to run almost everywhere.  You may find the occasional bike, which makes you a sitting duck to anyone that actually sees you on it.  The weather can play a huge factor in the game, as can the day/night cycle (which can be very frustrating if you spawn fresh in the dark near mutants or zombies).  Getting into a firefight in this game is pretty intense, especially if you have a loadout of great weapons (if you die, you lose everything).  If you like Survial Horror/PVP/Crafting, then check it out.			"

								I was a little sceptical before but now I like this game. The adventure and scenery are great and there is definitely some challenge. What people don‚Äôt really consider is that this game is in alpha and for an alpha game it is stellar. In the 10 hours I‚Äôve played I have seen maybe 1 bug which was enemy gunshots being very quiet that‚Äôs it! The game is well made and maintained and if you want an apocalyptic survival game this is the one to buy! And patch 36 adds hundreds of new items and new vehicles and its out so I say get this game while it‚Äôs on sale because it has so much potential and is pretty fun! The problems people say they have are not the game but their internet or computer but if you can run most gaes well then this game should run fine.			"

								First impressions;Bought the game yesterday and tbh, i didnt expect much; seemed like a nice zombie survival game and the discount from the summer sale made it pretty irresistable. This game suprised me in a good way; this game utilizes the potential of the genre (zombie/ open world) much more then say, H1Z1. The mutants that roam around can be a bit glitchy tho, but i didnt find it that annoying; they still die when i hit them. So if you need a zombie survival fix, liked h1z1/ dayz but got annoyed with bugs/ performance; try this instead, i dont think it ll dissapoint.			"

								Miscreated is a multiplayer open world survival game in which you fight against the elements, environment and living beings after a devastating war, you will start in the world with a T-Shirt, Jeans and a Flash light in which your goal will be to gear up by scavenging nearby houses, car parks, schools and other potential looting grounds for cars, weaponry, crafting components and tools. Combined with trying to avoid or possibly kill the existing mutants or survivors.Something to note considering every other survival game has this issue is, the community isn't entirely a "" Kill on Sight "" type of mentality which is good, you'll get people chatting with you, trading or even possibly grouping up to defend against bandits or you may even decide to build your own base and hoard all the loot in the universe.The developers also seem very passionate about their game and are listening to feedback and followed by that is great ideas for future updates which will definitely make this game even better, personally i would like to see more mutants so i'd be swarmed with no hope of surviving, possibly increasing the limitations on how many objects you can have in your base ( followed by storage containers so you can hold all your items instead of throwing some away ) also i would like to see the temperature system back, because i've heard people talk about it and it sounds very interesting.I highly recommend this game for i have enjoyed my time so far. I shall continue playing this whilst also keeping an eye out for the magnificent updates which take place. Join us now!!! we need more people to jump on and get involved in the carnage.			"

								The Good----------- Nice graphics- Great gameplay- Runs smooth as a baby's‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•br>- Awesomme community (havent been KOS 5 hours in)- Loot system works well and more logically than in other games imo- No hackers- Smaller map than most survivals out there(for now), to me this is a plus since i get to meet friends easier (no more running 3 hours to meet buddies)- IMMERSIVE, this is a big plus for me, the use of the flashlight at night, in old abandonnned graffiti house's or spotting other players from a far with their lights, or seeing animals move around, hearing flies near bodies and garbage's, etc...The Bad---------- The mutants, not only are they not scary, seems like they all look the same and are completely brainless. (im pretty sure this will change upon release.- Cannot host your own server, i wish this would change, probably get more people interested in the product but i think that is why there are no hackers for now. - The gunshots sound like‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•br>Verdict-------Yes i recommend the game, it works better than dayz and H1Z1 imo.This flew under my radar at first for a while, plus de publicity doesnt look amazing and looks more like a dayz clone than anything but believe me its well worth it. Dev's, change the miscreated logo and store front and get this game seen by more people because this is great work. "

								What can i say that prob hasn't been said already . This game i have had since release and i must say it has undergone alot of changes . In my opinion the Miscreated Devs have made a game that challenges Us  , brings us together , and makes us realize that not taking the shot is sometimes the most important choice you can take. To anyone on the fence abouth weather or not they should purchase this game . I will not feel bad in any way by telling you YES give it a try and i'm sure you will be hooked too .  survival games have to be watching what these guys are doing next cause there closing the door on all others . If you take one bit of advice about a game Buy this one you won't regret it			"

								This is a great zombie survival game filled with amazing imersive graphics provided by the CryEngine and awesome content to keep you interested. Overall I love this game and would highly recommend it. The only problems are, as it is in Alpha, bugs and glitches. The other annoying thing is you need a good PC, but if you have one, you\'ll enjoy the hell out of this game :)Keep up the great work devs.... xD			"

								A really fun game, people are friendly unlike Dayz. I was scared and was hearing people, then a guy ran up to me and yelled ""HEY BUDDY!"" and told me to follow him, we then went into a house across the street where him and his 2 other friends gave me a .357 Revolver, it had no ammo though. We then proceded to loot a trailer park and gather a bunch of supplies and then they found and gave me a crafted 5.56 rifle.We continued on through a major city and encountered 2 more guys who were friendly and we rolled in a group of 6. After that we found a car and decided to split up, some of us would guard it and the others would go back to the trailerpark for some supplies to repair it. Sadly on the way there, my game crashed, and one of the people guarding the car had disconnected or something. By the time we got back on it was just 5 of us and I had to go.			"

								Very fun game, realistic (minus the bugs) and has huge potential with the added features coming in patches.  Whitelist servers are a fantastic idea to prevent trolls, hackers and griefers from ruining everyone's ability to enjoy the game.  Most normal servers are ruined by griefer trolls who get bored of getting fragged on PVP servers so come to prey on friendly players.  so, not unlike every online game out there.  Price reduction or server population reduction for user-run servers would be much appreciated!Highly recommend!			"

I have recently bought this game and i think its absolute great and deserves more limelight,, and for more players to come play it. For an Early access game it really has big potential and i am sure will become more popular in time. If you want a nail biting game with plenty of hiding,scavegging, decent graphics, base building, hunting. Basically Freelance running, then buy this game guys, you wont be dissapointed.			"

								8/10 This game is getting better and better every update. I will say that this game is worth buying if you like intense PvP action, and meeting new people. It also has amazing graphics and it isn't like DayZ but more like a smaller version of it. This game is like DayZ but less running. So if you have a group of friends it would be great to play with them. You can find eachother in about 2-4 minutes. The map is very simple to remember and theres only about 6 main cities. The only thing that i've noticed about this game is the lack of people that play it. But every since they started updating the game more the game has gotten alot of people since beta. This game is still in Alpha but it is getting better as the days go by. The developers are making this game a amazing experience for all of their player base which is growing everyday.A great early access post apocalypse survival game that plays like an arcade-ish Day Z. The game runs very well and the cryengine makes everything look great. The developers of this game are constantly updating and adding new and unique features to the game (like tornadoes and wolf packs). I hated this game when it first came out and it got much better. Skip a year later and now this is the best survival game on the market. This game has got the best weather on any game ive seen. and transition from night to day with that early morning fog is great. In this game a flashlight is you best friend, turn it off and you will think your monitor is off. the best part of the game is its just plain fun. Did I mention TORNADOS.Positives- PvP is great- It isnt running simulator- Amazing Graphics- The game is only 10$- The sale happens a lot which you can get the game for 3 other friends for about 30$- Update daily- New clothing and gunsNegatives- Lack of people- Screen goes black after crash- Gun sounds are garbage- Weapons are OP, such as hatchets / knives / ect. - Hard to find ammoI don't really see anything wrong with the game other than the player base, and that the gun sounds are really bad. If the game updated the gun sounds and put more work into them and made them louder instead of making them sound like BB guns then the game would be amazing. As I said before if they started to update the gun sounds this game would be a great game and it wouldn't be as underrated as everyone says it is. 8/10			"

								I found a Russian dude who spoke little English, and he wanted me to be his friend. Reluctantly agreeing, together we aquired ""crafted"" guns and were essentially decked out in supplies.Then there were some gunshots in the distance, near the airbase we were in. My newly aquainted friend couldn't understand my concern for it. I decided to just ignore it for now.We ended up splitting up to scavenge, and I lost him. Suddenly, I heard gunshots very close to me, and I hid in an army tent holding my makeshift gun at the entrance.Someone calls out to see if anyone's there. It seemed similar to my friend's voice, but his English seemed normal.After waiting for about 5 minutes, I rush out of the tent to see if I can find my friend. Standing still, I was shot in the back, but not completely dead. Looking behind me, I saw someone about 50yds away shooting at me with a rifle. I end up unloading my entire clip into him, not certain if any of them even hit.I then proceed to book it down the highway out of the compound, and he doesn't follow me.I regret the day I left my newly aquired Russian friend to die.

								Played this for a few hours last night. Beings that the game is in alpha, I can't really trash it too much. Everything was pretty well laid out and accessible from what I could see. Items are rather scarce in this game; making it more of a challenge. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics and overall content and I can only assume it's going to get better and better. I had played The Forest prior to this game and this game gives me a little more of a Rust feel, but it's seemingly more realistic which is awesome in my personal opinion. I'll continue playing this game when I'm bored of my normal multiplayer FPS games or looking for a change of pace. Well done devs, looking forward to future releases.			"

My Rating: 6.5/10TLDR: Good game, but combat needs some work. Very fun to play with friends. I wouldn't buy it at full price.Don't let the ""Mixed"" reviews turn you away, this game is great. I've been following this game for about a year now, and I can say that they've definitely made a lot of progress. There are some flaws, which is to be expected, some more troublesome than others. But at the end of the day, it's playable, and most certainly enjoyable. Although, I wouldn't buy it at the full price of $20 USD. I bought it at $10 USD when it was on sale, and I'd say I got my money's worth.Pros:Decent sized mapPlenty of lootGood quality voice chatBase buildingStable serversVERY fun with friendsCons:Fairly unoptimized (40-50fps, recommended specs, med-high settings)Guns need a lot of work. Bullet spread/drop is somewhat random.Guns can be hard to findLittle to no feedback when taking fire until you're hitNo storageVehicle physics are somewhat buggyNon-directional voice chat "

								Note that I have been playing this game for longer than my steam shows up ( Other accounts )Despite what everyone says about it, it's a great game. The CryEngine with this set of post-apocalyptic settle is a great combo and it gives you a feeling of awesomeness. The people have been complaining about the past ""Lack-of-content"" but now it has been improvised a lot. I do recommend this game due to the amazing graphics, great gameplay and the best soundtracks for a survival game. It's fun to play with friends and it feels way better than , let's say, even DayZ. Please note it is still an alpha and will improvise, I guarantee!			"

								Miscreated is by far the best early access post apocalyptic mmo on Steam(In my opinion). The developers are really passionate about making this game (unlike the developers of DayZ who make their game worse with every update). Miscreateds environment is amazing. It feels like an apocalypse actually occured and you want to explore it to see all it has to offer. You can tell they were inspired by the Fallout series and this is probably as close as were going to get to a Fallout Online game. The player interactions are always fun and unpredictable and can lead to some crazy situations. Theres also tons to do. You can pvp, kill mutants, loots houses, trailers, buildings and more, craft weapons, build bases, fix up vehicles to drive and explore the map to find fallout shelters and caves. This game is worthy of your $20. So give it go, you won't regret it ;). I blew up my friend standing on some gas cannisters, then I caught on fire and became the human torch for like 20 minutes. 10/10

								At the time of this review, I am a developer of this game.This game has heaps of potential. And the team strives to reach that potential by updating the game with more content on a well timed basis.Yes, the game has its flaws such as connectivity issues, lack of certain gameplay elements and others. But you have to understand that it's still in Alpha. I'm not trying to use that as an excuse but it's a valid argument due to the fact that are about 14 people working hard to give you guys results.A lot of people have mentioned that there aren't a lot of things to do in the game -- but I've noticed that those reviews usually have less than 1 hour of gameplay.The game definitely requires patience if you want to enjoy it. Finding loot isn't a chore as there's houses and buildings usually containing a few items here and there. The scenery of the game really makes exploring it worthwhile. Combat is pretty difficult but very thrilling. Definitely recommend teaming up with friends to take on other players. Mutants are scarce in some areas but thriving in others (such as Pinecrest or Sultan).TL;DRPlay the game but give it time; 2 hours or less isn't going to cut it.Get some friends or go solo, you'll face thrills either way.If you don't want to get it now, at least be sure to keep an eye on it because a lot of features aregoing to be improved and implemented in the future.

								First of all, before i start this review, don't let the ""mixed"" reviews decieve you! these reviews are old! listen to the new ones! okay, back to my review. at first i didn't really like the look of this game. all because the reviews where ""mixed"" and as i mentioned it looks.. well plain and boring. i've read a couple reviews and there where lots of really good reviews, good enough to persuade me to buy it! i don't even know why this game has ""mixed"" reviews at the moment. so i've played it for a couple of hours and it was actually really fun! but i do admit they need to change the feel of houses, like make them different.. not the same. but all and all it's a really good game, i recommend you to get it and jump in!oh, and almost forgot, it would be sooooooo super delightful if they actually added a character customization.. seriously the current character looks deformed and ugly, no offense if it's based on a real person :D!

								I love this genre plus I love early access testing, but I have to shout out to fellow gamers that even EA games have stages. Miscreated is on a very early stage, I highly recommend buying it but keep in mind it needs a lot of work for it to be in a playable condition. At the moment you only get like 2-3 hours before boredom. Maybe you got excited about the graphics but that's just cryengine in effect, you will realize that graphics performance plus server issues destroy your overall experience. At the moment you have only few items to loot, no grouping system, a pretty weak anti-cheat system and the zombies are kinda useless. What really hurts the game is the slow development team posting a minor patch now and then without any extra content. I remember another game going this way..			"

								Welcome to Miscreated. ""The hardcore survival game, that will truly test your skills at staying alive"".Trusting others can be deadly in this game. But the pvp is good fun.I have made many new friends playing this game, it's perhaps one of the most rewarding aspects about this game / the community.Join a clan or make a clan, you will soon understand how powerfull playing as a team can be. Also all the extra things you can achieve, get upto. Base building is super fun. Build a massive base or a little cabin in the woods.Attack other bases or defend your own. When you join a clan, everyone can use each others base within the clan.Find guides to build a better base - Some are super rare, happy hunting.Mutants, they can spawn just about anywhere on the map. They can be rather deadly in large groups, you can even call them over, if you have a mic (capslock). I rather enjoy this feature.I use this ability, when players are running after me. Soon they will start to follow them instead of me. Since they attack anything close to them first.Weapons: Guns (Shotgun , Rifles), Crossbow, melee weapons / crafted weapons, & many more.Clothes: A insane amount of different types of clothes to loot. Matching sets ( Camo sets etc)Vehicles: Many different types, use them to get from A-B, or run mutants / players over with them. Store items in them. Some vehicles can carry more players then others, did i mention you can blow vehciles up... heheThe map is a decent size, so many amazing views to look at. From forest, to open fields... Towns & rivers. The Dev team have been working really hard to get this game looking stunning, & fun to play. Updates / patches are rather frequent. I think ""Miscreated"" , is optimized rather well for a ""Early Access / Alpha"". The servers are stable. The only next logical step is this next part:Click add to cart...go go go. Then i can shoot you or we can look at someone else getting attacked or shot. ""Eats popcorn"" while they die, loots body... ""why thank you very much""""Check out some of my pics of the game"".			"

								The game is great so far, but what it needs is to have a choice of male or female characters. Some kind of map would be nice, if not a map then lets us find a compass to use. How about letting us modify the weapons, such as supressors or maybe a bow and arrow or a crossbow for silent attacks.Thanx Sarah			"

								At the time of this review, I am a developer of this game.This game has heaps of potential. And the team strives to reach that potential by updating the game with more content on a well timed basis.Yes, the game has its flaws such as connectivity issues, lack of certain gameplay elements and others. But you have to understand that it's still in Alpha. I'm not trying to use that as an excuse but it's a valid argument due to the fact that are about 14 people working hard to give you guys results.A lot of people have mentioned that there aren't a lot of things to do in the game -- but I've noticed that those reviews usually have less than 1 hour of gameplay.The game definitely requires patience if you want to enjoy it. Finding loot isn't a chore as there's houses and buildings usually containing a few items here and there. The scenery of the game really makes exploring it worthwhile. Combat is pretty difficult but very thrilling. Definitely recommend teaming up with friends to take on other players. Mutants are scarce in some areas but thriving in others (such as Pinecrest or Sultan).TL;DRPlay the game but give it time; 2 hours or less isn't going to cut it.Get some friends or go solo, you'll face thrills either way.If you don't want to get it now, at least be sure to keep an eye on it because a lot of features aregoing to be improved and implemented in the future.

								For an Alpha game it is truly beautiful the graphics are outstanding. This game does not deserve mixed reviews as this game is like h1z1 but with way better devs more time spent into it less bugs crashes its amazing. I don't really pointing out downfalls in early development games but if you are wondering the only things ive had trouble with is the combat system needs just a little work its hard to shoot people who are running at you with bats moving constantly but maybe that adds some kind of balance I have had no experiences with crashes a few obvious bugs but the game is in great shape and im sure they are working on those as you read this If you're in to true survival the suspence in a combat situation after working hard to find loot then this is the game for you ignore other reviews as childs and other people tend to review after a tramatic experience with a bug or combat loss and tend to be salty I see nothing wrong with this game so far and it only gets better.

								Amazing game! Not sure why it has mixed reviews. I have 300 hours on it at this point and plan to have many more. Every time I play I run into a heart pounding situation. Like literally, heart pounding. The graphics and lighting are top notch. The map is a good size, and is getting bigger. The patches come out frequently, and are quite sizable.And the combat is so gritty.The base building! It's awesome. You start off with basic crafting. And you can find more recipes to create more advanced things. For instance, I can make a small generator that powers 5 flood lights. The Devs say they are going to be adding more stuff to power as well.There are vehicles in game and to get them going you need to repair them. Tires, fuel, oil, spark plugs, drive belt, battery. It's pretty rewarding when you get one going and can rip around with your buddies.I've tried lots of other survival games and this one is the first and only one that has me hopelessly addicted :D			"

								umm is this game good ? who knows, i haven't been able to stay alive long enought to do anything constructive. and not because of mutants, i haven't seen any. but because people still act like dumb animals and kill on sight. i don't know if the map is extreemly small or what, but there is ALWAYS someone close by with a hammer that manages to kill you in 2 hits. fresh spawns have no chance. it's actually worst then DayZ because you can't even tell the guy to screw off, chat system doesn't work. other then that, the graphics look good. this game has alot of potential if i could actually play. the mouse look is really wonky and i wish i could disable that and play it like any other FPS			"

								Maybe it's only the most recent patch that made this game worth playing, but it's fantastic. As a huge fan of DayZ's gameplay model of bare bones, high risk survival, but not a fan of DayZ's infinite development progress despite getting over $60,000,000 in early access sales, this is exactly what DayZ would aspire to be in a beta build or even close to release. The graphics are rich and detailed, the engine handles hit detection very well, crafting is mature, weapons and vehicles behave well and whilst they're rare they're not too rare. Looting is also much more realistic and requires attention to scrounge through piles of things and scanning environments for things that look useful, rather than the DayZ paradigm of opening inventory and walking until ground items show up in 'items nearby'. There's other negative reviews where people say it's crap because they got shot on sight. These types of reviews reflect poorly on the game but they're really other player behaviour. Of course people will shoot you on sight, it's a hostile environment. Perhaps it you don't like the type of game where you need to excercise constant caution you should play a different game that doesn't have guns, or survival, or any form of competition. Sure there's plenty to still sort out, like putting car tyres in your pockets, but this game is miles and miles ahead of DayZ. Get it.			"

								There's lots of indie games out there have good but unfinished games that completely drop work on it as soon as they make enough profit.Then there's games that may release poorly but the developers continue to polish the features and pour their attention into improving things.  Miscreated falls into the second category.  The initial release, from what I heard, was pretty bad.  But it's gotten steady updates with very open and hard working developers to craft it into a very promising survival game.  This is the kind of indie game that we should be supporting.  Maybe then other developers will take notice and realize that spending your time on a game and talking to the community can make a game that was once a complete bust into a very popular title.As far as the gameplay itself think DayZ but with better controls, inventory, and graphics.  There are a few areas still lacking but the developers are hard at work and I have little doubt that this game will only get better.			"

								This game is very good so far At first I was having a ton of fun and then when I died it was hard to get geared again so it was pretty ruff for me and my friend but once we started to build a base the game got very fun and we would store our loot in the base and just keep getting more loot and killing people and when we died it wasnt so much of a big deal you could easily put a ton of hours into this game. (THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT IS ITS A MORE SMOOTH VERSION OF DAYZ WITH BASE BUILDING AND MORE DRIVING.) There is even a bicycle that is faily common and helps you get around.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, this game is still in Early Access. I cannot comment on how much it has developed over time as I have only been playing it since the last update. (It was gifted to me by a friend who wanted to try it out. The game is graphically pleasing and runs smoothly on my system (i5 3750k, 8 gb Ram, 670GTX) and the weather system is amazing. When its raining heavily and obscuring vision it truly looks stunning. The controls feel smooth and apart from a few lag spikes on the server we play on it runs smoothly.It has its faults, some are minor (the rain is inside some houses aswell as outside. I have had a few instances were the game crashes and I have had to quit to desktop and twice the server has disconnected while playing. These however are teething problems to be expected in an early access game. If the developers stick with it and continue to update it then what we have is a game that looks like it could be truly phenominal. What I have played so far has been tense and atmospheric and the AI seems to be some of the better showings from similar titles I have played. It's been a while since I've played a game that has had me on edge as much as Miscreated has in a long time and I highly recommend it!			"

								The atmosphere of Miscreated, a survival post-apocalpyse type game, is extremely well crafted. Rats scurry about garbage strewn streets, alleys and old shops. Forlorn, tattered flags flutter from flagpoles jutting from the remnants of buildings, both large and small. The graphics of this game are some of the best I've seen, particularly the rain, which falls in realistic sheets and spatters and splutters on the ground in little pools.The mechanics of the game are similar to Dayz, except it all seems to work and the zombies aren't also half-ghosts who can phase through walls and punch you without moving their limbs. In fact, the PVE enemies are actually not zombies, rather mutated people.The game has vehicles already, something that took Dayz almost 2 years to implement. My play so far has been largely stable and consistent, with little lag or rubberbanding.Miscreated deserves to be highly regarded for a number of factors. It has a robust and stable platform, it has truly beautiful graphics, and the atmosphere of the game is very well done.I highly recommend this game, and urge you to give it a try. Don't miss this hidden gem of a game.			"

								This game has charming visuals and the world feels very ""lived-in"". Every house feels different despite similar models being reused. It plays like DayZ minus the gigantic map and with a slightly smaller player count in the servers. The UI is somewhat frustrating to fiddle with and the recently added weather features could definitely use some tweaking, but all in all it's a very fun game if you're into the DayZ style loot/survival game. Definitely worth the $10-$15 when it's on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								This is an updated review and totally honest, no fanboyism.PriceMiscreated is a really good game, and generally speaking (if you like its gender), I recommend you to buy it. MAYBE wait for a sale, or buy it anyway (its not expensive). But I gotta say it tho, I bought when it was on sale 50%, and that made it even more worth it, as in the state the game is now. I say this because this game clearly has potential. Its already good, but there is a LOT of things that can be added and modified. But the game is cheap anyway, so its a positive thing!GraphicsThe game uses the CryENGINE, so guess what? The graphics are ASTONISHING. The graphics on this game are AMAZING. Seriously, its so good, AND it doesn't have much FPS problems, which is surprising nowadays. Also theres are two specific thing about this game graphics that I need to talk about: the rain. The rain in this game is mind-blowing. Yes, its CryENGINE, but together with the atmosphere of the game, the rain is SO amazing. Seriously. When it started raining, I spent at least 10 minutes just looking at it. I entered a house when it started raining and it was so real, and the house really felt like a shelter that I didn't wanna leave. And the shadow/shader/illumination of this game is GREAT. You'll use the flashlight quite often.GameplayThe gameplay of this game is pretty straight forward. You can run, you can jump, you need food, you need water, you can get cold, etc etc. The inventory is really simple and straight forward and this is also a REALLY positive thing. I really liked the inventory system of this game. It is great. The gameplay is fluid and pretty solid. I like it.Mutants/ZombiesOk so, if you read some negative reviews of the game, there will be some saying that the mutants are glitchy and dont work. I don't know how it was before, but now, theres not that many problems. They will detect you, they will chase you (eventually they stop), they fight you, they give quite a lot of damage and can get you bleeding. You can fight them back, either with guns or meele weapons. I didn't find the combat glitchy at all. You need a couple hits (around 5) with a hatchet to kill them. It works as it should. BUT, keep something in mind: the AI is still a little bit glitchy. Maybe not like before, but still glitchy. If you enter a house, sometimes they will follow you inside, sometimes they will not. Sometimes they just say outside of the house colliding with a wall or something, and when you leave, they will not chase you anymore. So it is a little bit glitchy, but at least they never hit me through walls or anything like that, so its not that bad. And I don't know if the developers plan to change this in future, but as of now, theres not much mutants in this game.Current StateThis is the tricky part. The game is already good, it has a lot of funcionality. It has vehicles, you can get them to work, it has crafting, it has some base building (I didn't try base building, but as of now, they are basic I think). You need to find crafting recipes for some things. It has a good looting system/chance, food are quite common to find tho. Weapons are balanced, sometimes if there isn't much players on a server, you can find weapons more easily, but the loot chance is GENERALLY SPEAKING, balanced. Ammo is KINDA rare. There isn't much variety of weapons yet, though. But here is the tricky part of this game that may make you reconsider getting it or not: theres not much people playing, and the map is not very big. The game works now, its already good and you can have some fun, but it needs more things to be added and it needs more players. Sure, there is some full servers (35 people are the maximum capacity in the moment), but still, the game needs more players. The servers doesn't have shared hives (im not exactly sure of this), so that means if you play in a server, you have to login in the same server again to have your stuff. I don't like this for a couple reasons. And as I've said, the map has some city and it can get you some time to walk from one point to another, but the map needs expansion. Its not that big. When I read about the game before buying it, I read that the map was 1/4 of the DayZ map. I think it is smaller than that, like 1/5 of the dayz map or something. Its not very small, it takes you some time to go from one point to another, but its definitely not big.Glitches/CrashesSurprisingly, I didn't have many problems with this game at all! In the first day yes, I had some, in like 5 hours the game crashed 6 times but it wasn't the game's fault. My computer pagefile was deactivated, so it was giving me errors and frequent crashes lol. But I noticed something tho, if for any reason your game crashes when you are inside a vehicle, when you come back to the server, your vehicle lose all its parts (battery, spark plugs, drive belts), so you can't drive it anymore and have to find the stuff to make it work. That is a problem. But (if I recall correctly) the game didn't crash other than the times it crashed because of the pagefile thing. But maybe you can experience some crashes, my friend has, so I don't know. There is some glitchs with the inventory that maybe make you lose stuff, but you get the hang of it. So the game doesn't have many glitches and crashes to me, but it may do to you, so be aware of that.ConclusionGuys, if you are aware that this game is in early acess, its not complete and you may or may not face some technical problems and still wanna buy it, do it. You can still have fun with the game in its state. But KEEP IN MIND that it has more things to be added, a LOT more. I would say for most people its worth buying, because a LOT, and I mean A LOT of problems that people stated in the negative reviews section are fixed already, they are outdated reviews (not all of them tho). For some people I would say maybe wait a little bit for the game to be expanded, a bigger map and more stuff. But if you are waiting or planning to buy the game in the future and you find it on 50% sale, BUY IT. On sale, this game is definitely worth buying for everyone, even at current state.Rating: 8.5/10 "

								Good game so far, lots of fun and quite a few things to do like looting, building and combat, the game is in a very early state though so it crashes alot which can be frustrating if in combat, and the ingame server browser has no filter  or favorite option so sometimes its difficult to find your server. But im sure they will be added soon :)			"

								This game has charming visuals and the world feels very ""lived-in"". Every house feels different despite similar models being reused. It plays like DayZ minus the gigantic map and with a slightly smaller player count in the servers. The UI is somewhat frustrating to fiddle with and the recently added weather features could definitely use some tweaking, but all in all it's a very fun game if you're into the DayZ style loot/survival game. Definitely worth the $10-$15 when it's on sale.			"

								This is an updated review and totally honest, no fanboyism.PriceMiscreated is a really good game, and generally speaking (if you like its gender), I recommend you to buy it. MAYBE wait for a sale, or buy it anyway (its not expensive). But I gotta say it tho, I bought when it was on sale 50%, and that made it even more worth it, as in the state the game is now. I say this because this game clearly has potential. Its already good, but there is a LOT of things that can be added and modified. But the game is cheap anyway, so its a positive thing!GraphicsThe game uses the CryENGINE, so guess what? The graphics are ASTONISHING. The graphics on this game are AMAZING. Seriously, its so good, AND it doesn't have much FPS problems, which is surprising nowadays. Also theres are two specific thing about this game graphics that I need to talk about: the rain. The rain in this game is mind-blowing. Yes, its CryENGINE, but together with the atmosphere of the game, the rain is SO amazing. Seriously. When it started raining, I spent at least 10 minutes just looking at it. I entered a house when it started raining and it was so real, and the house really felt like a shelter that I didn't wanna leave. And the shadow/shader/illumination of this game is GREAT. You'll use the flashlight quite often.GameplayThe gameplay of this game is pretty straight forward. You can run, you can jump, you need food, you need water, you can get cold, etc etc. The inventory is really simple and straight forward and this is also a REALLY positive thing. I really liked the inventory system of this game. It is great. The gameplay is fluid and pretty solid. I like it.Mutants/ZombiesOk so, if you read some negative reviews of the game, there will be some saying that the mutants are glitchy and dont work. I don't know how it was before, but now, theres not that many problems. They will detect you, they will chase you (eventually they stop), they fight you, they give quite a lot of damage and can get you bleeding. You can fight them back, either with guns or meele weapons. I didn't find the combat glitchy at all. You need a couple hits (around 5) with a hatchet to kill them. It works as it should. BUT, keep something in mind: the AI is still a little bit glitchy. Maybe not like before, but still glitchy. If you enter a house, sometimes they will follow you inside, sometimes they will not. Sometimes they just say outside of the house colliding with a wall or something, and when you leave, they will not chase you anymore. So it is a little bit glitchy, but at least they never hit me through walls or anything like that, so its not that bad. And I don't know if the developers plan to change this in future, but as of now, theres not much mutants in this game.Current StateThis is the tricky part. The game is already good, it has a lot of funcionality. It has vehicles, you can get them to work, it has crafting, it has some base building (I didn't try base building, but as of now, they are basic I think). You need to find crafting recipes for some things. It has a good looting system/chance, food are quite common to find tho. Weapons are balanced, sometimes if there isn't much players on a server, you can find weapons more easily, but the loot chance is GENERALLY SPEAKING, balanced. Ammo is KINDA rare. There isn't much variety of weapons yet, though. But here is the tricky part of this game that may make you reconsider getting it or not: theres not much people playing, and the map is not very big. The game works now, its already good and you can have some fun, but it needs more things to be added and it needs more players. Sure, there is some full servers (35 people are the maximum capacity in the moment), but still, the game needs more players. The servers doesn't have shared hives (im not exactly sure of this), so that means if you play in a server, you have to login in the same server again to have your stuff. I don't like this for a couple reasons. And as I've said, the map has some city and it can get you some time to walk from one point to another, but the map needs expansion. Its not that big. When I read about the game before buying it, I read that the map was 1/4 of the DayZ map. I think it is smaller than that, like 1/5 of the dayz map or something. Its not very small, it takes you some time to go from one point to another, but its definitely not big.Glitches/CrashesSurprisingly, I didn't have many problems with this game at all! In the first day yes, I had some, in like 5 hours the game crashed 6 times but it wasn't the game's fault. My computer pagefile was deactivated, so it was giving me errors and frequent crashes lol. But I noticed something tho, if for any reason your game crashes when you are inside a vehicle, when you come back to the server, your vehicle lose all its parts (battery, spark plugs, drive belts), so you can't drive it anymore and have to find the stuff to make it work. That is a problem. But (if I recall correctly) the game didn't crash other than the times it crashed because of the pagefile thing. But maybe you can experience some crashes, my friend has, so I don't know. There is some glitchs with the inventory that maybe make you lose stuff, but you get the hang of it. So the game doesn't have many glitches and crashes to me, but it may do to you, so be aware of that.ConclusionGuys, if you are aware that this game is in early acess, its not complete and you may or may not face some technical problems and still wanna buy it, do it. You can still have fun with the game in its state. But KEEP IN MIND that it has more things to be added, a LOT more. I would say for most people its worth buying, because a LOT, and I mean A LOT of problems that people stated in the negative reviews section are fixed already, they are outdated reviews (not all of them tho). For some people I would say maybe wait a little bit for the game to be expanded, a bigger map and more stuff. But if you are waiting or planning to buy the game in the future and you find it on 50% sale, BUY IT. On sale, this game is definitely worth buying for everyone, even at current state.Rating: 8.5/10 "

								For a game with no story, I have had some of the most fun and dramatic moments on it. Not to mentin the visuals can be breathtaking. Sometimes when it is raining or a heavy fog rolls in and you're being chased there is just no way to describe it. I highly recommend this game, it's fun by yourself, and creepy, and it is possible to make friends. Just beware of most of the strangers!			"

								Easily one of the best survival/walking simulators I've played for a long time. For a game so young, it is very polished (not like some older games. *cough* RUST *Ccough*I play with a group of friends, mainly on experimental servers and it's a great thing to see the Devs at work and see the changes happen in real time. The latest addition is a massive city, many buildings to explore, alleys to get lost in and mutants to stab you in the face.  I'd reccomend Miscreated, especially at the ¬£7.49 sale price.GIve it a go. It's a game that'll omly get better as the community grows.			"

								This game is what dayZ or h1z1 could've become. I'm not sure if its still concidered alpha by the devs. For me it defenitly feels like a Beta close for full release. Gonna be really picky on my +'s and -'s.Possitive sides:+ Optimization is conciderably good+ The multiplayer is very good, haven't experienced rubberbanding unless the ping itself was high.+ Great balancing+ Amazing level desing and overal visuals.+ Enough content to keep playing for a while+ Great pvp, little people who KoS. A overal friendly community.+ Little/none hackers, atleast i haven't seen one.Negative sides:- Gui could use some polishing (my personal oppinion)- Character could go a bit faster - Some area's are a bit too dark for daylight- Things you need early on are a bit tricky to find sometimesConclusion / should you get this game?If you have the money and if you feel like playing a fun pvp survival game. Defenitly pick up this one. You will need a decent pc, if you are using a low end laptop or computer and you cannot run it, please don't blame that on the devs. This game is a great deal and easy to get in to. It gives you a real survival feeling and currently all it needs in my oppinion is a little more love on a small subjects.  "

Everything from the run down and overgrown homes, supermarkets, gas stations, and churches all have a post-apocalyptic feel and look stunning. My modest PC runs it at max settings without issue (i7-3770 and a Strix GTX 960).The second thing I noticed (but arguably the most important IMHO) is how much noticeably friendlier everyone is compared to DayZ. Of course there is still the occasional‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•bag that kills you on sight but 9 times out of 10 the people you encounter won't bother you, and may even help you if you ask nicely.Overall it certainly has my recommendation after a handful of hours in the game. It has bugs and sometimes it crashes but at its core I think it is already more refined than DayZ and offers a more fun (albiet currently more limited) experience for someone looking for a good survival game.

								I love playing this game. The graphics are beautiful and the level design is perfect. They are constantly adding content and making improvements to the game. If you were dissapointed by H1Z1 or Dayz this is one that won't let you down.			"

								OK, I really really like this game but the zombies are really hard to kill and damage you pretty good. And there is hardly ever just one after you, its usually a 2 or 3. I just feel like I'm running from them the whole time. But fun otherwise.			"

								I'm mixed on the Alpha version of the game.  Great environment, chilling undead, and fun investing the area.  The not fun part is spending 1 hour getting gear and getting ganked by PVP players.  If you could accomplish something in the game without the fear of other humans, the game would be more compelling.  There is no safe haven to run to and you lose all your loot when you die.  If you like PVP, you will like the game.			"

								The game is in Alpha testing as of this review. The game itself is great, great potential, great concept, and believable end of the world scenario.The problem is the players.There are PVE servers, or so the claim to be PVE. Which is great, because I really don't care for PVP. Not that I don't mind pvp games, but, when a server is listed as PVE it should be PVE. The problem is that there are those out there that pretend to be friendly, you know push f2 to show hands raised or wave as if they are friendly, then when your back is turned they shoot and loot. This has happened to me multiple times on different pve servers. Since this game is very realistic with health dropping rapidly once you get shot there really isn't anything you can do but bleed out and start over, or become a raider yourself. The game really devolves into 2-4 man groups killing eachother for petty supplies, no matter which server you are on. Gameplay is fantastic, but everyone becomes a hunter or the prey, don't kid yourself into thinking you can be friendly in this game.Edit: Since posting this review I have found a whitelisted server that actually does play strict pve. the players are friendly and helpful. There is the occasional jerk, but if a player is found to be breaking the server rules they are banned. I would suggest finding a whitelisted server with rules you like and joining it.			"

								 This game is a pretty nice alternative if you liked Dayz or Standalone but want to play something being devolved a lot faster and better. It does not have as much variation or the same amount of content but the team is definitely active and trying their best to make the game as good as they can. Updates are pretty constant with a full list of what‚Äôs been changed and added. I know early Access games are a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•sometimes and don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are bugs and it‚Äôs not perfect, but my personal experience so far has been pretty solid. They also have a pretty nice community, which is a plus in any game. If you want to give it a go and if you are a pretty open minded person, knowing that it‚Äôs not 100% perfect yet, then give it a go and see what‚Äôs up, otherwise wait till full release. I personally think this game is going places and I really hope the Devs keep up their amazing work. Also to the Miscreated team, if you guys need an artist for any promotional stuff or posters, hit me up!			"

 Review: Miscreated Last Review Update: December 19, 2016Version 44=== Rating 8.0 / 10 - Getting better and better === Pros & Cons  + Pros +  + Very good atmosphere and graphics, it will make you really feel inside an apocalypse, especially at night time. + Well recreated environments and cities+ Finding good loot is very hard and will take you a lot of time+ You have to look for recipes to craft more advanced things, enhanching exploration and discovery+ Solid base building system with traps, barricades, walls and accessory structures+ Zombies are a real threat, unlike in other similar games, and will kill you if you are not prepared+ Environment hazards like radiations, tornadoes, lightning storms and also starvation / dehydration are serious threats and make the game experience deeper and harder+ Overall stable net code and servers+ Not many bugs for being an Early Access, unlike many other games which are a full of bugs+ Group system - Cons - - Overall quite limited variety of Weapons, Clothing, Foodstuff and Accessories- Buildable containers are available, but limited to 2 per base.- You can build bases, currently, floating in the air. This leads to player bases being built in such ways that they cannot be raided.- Some graphical bugs, but many has been fixed- Zombies are often few and scattered around, no ""hordes"" as you would expect in a proper apocalypse- Invisible barriers around the map prevent players from going further, something like radiations would have been a lot better- Temperature currently has no effect on a Player's health whatsoever===I think this game has potential to become the perfect mix between Rust and DayZ. It is very good despite its alpha stutus. It is fun and can be played also alone but with friends is better.It improved greatly with the June and July 2016 patches: new zombie type, new map area, lots of new stuff to loot.-- UPDATE September 2016 --Lots of stuff has been fixed, new huge city of Hayward is now mostly finished and explorable with new military loot zones and also civilian.New improved infected AI and new super infected really make you stary on your toes.Some new weapons and clothes varied loot more.-- UPDATE December 2016 --A new enemy has been added, which is even more dangerous than a normal super infected.Many animations have been fixed.Many new guns and equipments have been added so far.Loot spawns have been rebalanced in a batter way than before.

								This is what DayZ Standalone is trying to be, this is what DayZ Standalone should have been. But you've either got what it takes, or you haven't and Miscreated has it all. The graphics , the sound effects, even the weather effects, everything about this game is just so beautifully crafted to give you a fully immersive experience that will leave you wishing all games were developed with the Cryengine! (When the machines take over, they're going to use Cryengine to plug us into the Matrix, mark my words.. You won't know the difference!).Edit: I need to add to my original review, that the KoS in this game is exactly if not worse than DayZ. It's getting boring already, there's no fun in being KoS'd by the ONLY other player on the server.  Once you've been KoS'd a few times in a game like this, it just turns into a grind each time you have to respawn (it took hours each time for me), spend a few hours gearing up, get kos'd, rinse, repeat .. Honestly though, I still love this game, the devs work hard at keeping it fresh and it's still way ahead of DayZ Standalone and the likes. Just wish it would attract a more mature (or just old school bandit, if that's your thing) type of player! If you don't like the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t KoS kiddy mentality of DayZ , then don't buy this game (the island is too small to avoid bumping into each other, even when there's only 2 of you on), KoS seems to be a part of this gaming genre these days! You can't escape it!Definately a game you play with a clan for protection, but as a solo PVE experience? No.When I play games like this (with rampant KoS) I start to lose faith in humanity! Because when it boils down to it,  these games prove that in a world without law or order, the majority of people are just nasty‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• The morons are outbreading the rest of us, this is how it ends!

								Easily one of the best survival/walking simulators I've played for a long time. For a game so young, it is very polished (not like some older games. *cough* RUST *Ccough*I play with a group of friends, mainly on experimental servers and it's a great thing to see the Devs at work and see the changes happen in real time. The latest addition is a massive city, many buildings to explore, alleys to get lost in and mutants to stab you in the face.  I'd reccomend Miscreated, especially at the ¬£7.49 sale price.GIve it a go. It's a game that'll omly get better as the community grows.			"

								This game is what dayZ or h1z1 could've become. I'm not sure if its still concidered alpha by the devs. For me it defenitly feels like a Beta close for full release. Gonna be really picky on my +'s and -'s.Possitive sides:+ Optimization is conciderably good+ The multiplayer is very good, haven't experienced rubberbanding unless the ping itself was high.+ Great balancing+ Amazing level desing and overal visuals.+ Enough content to keep playing for a while+ Great pvp, little people who KoS. A overal friendly community.+ Little/none hackers, atleast i haven't seen one.Negative sides:- Gui could use some polishing (my personal oppinion)- Character could go a bit faster - Some area's are a bit too dark for daylight- Things you need early on are a bit tricky to find sometimesConclusion / should you get this game?If you have the money and if you feel like playing a fun pvp survival game. Defenitly pick up this one. You will need a decent pc, if you are using a low end laptop or computer and you cannot run it, please don't blame that on the devs. This game is a great deal and easy to get in to. It gives you a real survival feeling and currently all it needs in my oppinion is a little more love on a small subjects.  "

								Personally this is probably my 2nd favorite game of all timethe game has come such a long way since the beginning of developement. at first, loot was SUPER rare and all they had was a t-shirt, a gun, and an axe. now they have over 10 guns, over 10 melee weapons, and almost 100 clothing options, not to mention gas masks, many vehicles, and EXTREMELY smart ai. it runs super smooth and the game has a great community. ive only been killed on sight by one guy XDover all i STRONGLY recommend this game to any Dayz lovers.good luck to all future servivors!!!p.s: ignore the first trailer the 2nd and 3rd are WAY better :)			"

								At the time of this review I have around 20+ hours of gameplay logged.As a veteran player of ARMA style survival games (DayZ, Exile, Breaking Point, ect.), and others like ARK, this game is scratching at an itch that faded long ago. CryEngine makes a game about surviving in a wasteland beautiful. While the game overall is a WIP (work in progress), its development cycle is hammering along. Honestly, I am not into the base building aspect, especially during an alpha phase that has no permanent foundations, but that doesnt mean there isnt good things there. The overall feel of the game is great with simple controls and a realistic and not cartoony weapon balance. I'm really enjoying the game but there are some things that I would like to see added. A server browser that you can favorite servers (so I know where my characters are without remembering/writing down IRL). Also more administrative ruleset toggles as the current PVE/no KOS servers can't be trusted (the last one I took a molotov to the face as I said ""hello"" to someone). People in game seem really excited about Miscreated, and i'm right there along with them.			"

								The moment i found this game on steam i thought to myself "" another survival early access game that fails to impress... "", and as i saw the comment section, it confirmed just that. But still, the fact that is was made with CryEngine intrigued me. So, when i saw it was on sail for 50%, i decided to buy it, and i have to say, i don't regret it one bit! Thinking about it now i would have even payed full price for it :) In my opinion it is better then DayZ, H1Z1 and Rust! It is the first early access game that i see a lot of potential for the future, and not just being an early access game as an excuse to being full of bugs and bad game mechanics. Recommend it 100%, i am having a lot of fun with this game! :)			"

								So, I used to hear bad things about this game...""It's just another early access buggy mess""""Day Z clone...""Blah blah blah. After seeing these large changes made and hearing a lot of positive things about it, I decided to get the game on sale (10$) and I'm pleasently surprised!Let's start off with the obvious stuff... the graphics... The game looks great. My first time loading into the world I was at an abandoned trailer park and noticed the world looking great on ultra graphics but the most important part to me was the performance...WOW. The game runs beautifully... I'm not sure how they've managed to optimize the game so well but it runs amazing (even better than the game it's supposed to be ""immitating"")I explore the trailer park a bit, finding food to eat, clothing items to wear, bandages for wounds, and items to help me repair vehicles, should I find one. Then I found the most beautiful thing ever... A crossbow. I was later ran up on by not a zombie...  but a mutant. An obvious human experimental abomination that surprised me (first scared drops of pee out of me) but surprised me when I found out it wasn't zombies in the game... Killed him with a few crossbow bolts to the face (and unfortunately realizing I couldn't retrive my bolts which made me sad.)After my initial point of contact with the mutant, the world started to change... the weather got dark and gloomy and it started raining heavier than I've seen it rain in a video game before. The water effects and enviornments were beautiful.The game needs work obviously, as it's in early access, but I think the devs would do a great job moving forward in making honestly one of the best survival ""simulation"" games that not only looks great but plays extremely smooth. Definitely check this one out if you're a fan of the genre, ESPECIALLY if you can get it on a discount, which it is at the point of writing this impression.			"

Maybe the bugs which comes with every update but thats normal for an alpha released game.And there should be more different kinds of Mutants (Different skins)Maybe the Mapsize should be increased but thats it.Pros:Really good GraphicsNice SoundsGood animationsVery nice Details and AtmosphereStable ServersA lot of lootable thingsGood GameplayPlease support these Developers for this Masterpiece!!!

Day 1: Spawned in Sultan met an random sweden guy he teached me basics and showed me the way to airfield. As the went there we met an American sweden guy tried to rob him, later we became friends, after some time sweden guy and us got crash(server just went offline) so me and american guy became friends and continued looting as we did, later found a guy from britain and we spent 7 hours exploring the map,looting and done some cool screenshots we were so amazed with the graphics we didnt even see how time went past so i spent 10 hr/s non stop and didn't regret it.Day 2: Me and my other old friend reunited and started exploring the map more, looted everywhere and started heading to northside cause we wanted to see the new city. On the way we found a bike so we thought it was an spawn so we continued going forward found an small city looted it came back and another bike spawned :D so we planed to build a base, it took long time but we didn't finish it cause it was only 2 of us and we were building a bigger base then we can manage to build. Later on my friend left, i went on discussion section and found a guy that is recruiting people so i messaged him and joined his group, and we met at the new city, had fantastic time exploring it. And in the end we went back to base and logged off.Day 3: Logged in nobody was online, so i arranged a meeting with my american friend in the northside but i  wasn't  playing long cause the time diffrence in real life washuge -9h for him so it was 2 am for him and 2 pm for me :D. Later on my buddie that invited to group came online and we started the journey to cave, on the way to entrance we found an tent, we were so excited we couldn't believe that it was left there, so our plan was to loot near the hill and the cave as we done that, were coming back to base and one of our buddies found a base with 2 tents and took them so now in total we have 3 tents :D stored everything back in base and my buddies went offline and i messaged my other friend from britain to join our group as he was coming saw a bandit running on highway and just sprayed the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of him and he didn't even know from where i was shooting cause he didn't even shoot a single bullet out his gun. Friend came on the highway exact moment looted him, went to small city got some loot and logged out.Okay bought 3 days ago and had a blast playing it cause it's so immersive and realistic im obsessed with it now. The community is one of the greatest and i love the dev team thumbs up for you :) "

Just walking in and staring at the floor with give you very little in this game.This game is great to play alone and would be even better with friends to help out.My Rating: 9.5/10 "

So Good I Bought it 3 timesWell i bought this game 2 weeks after release in 2014 and at the time i was severely unimpressed, the map felt empty with little to do, so little in fact that in the first spawn, another player who was seemingly bored, chased me for over an hour non-stop threatening to kill me all the way. It wasnt long after that i decided to put it down and thought ""another early acess rip off"" (there was a plethora of them between 2013-2014). I had completely forgotten about the game up until seeing some reviews on patch #36 I thought id give it another go, and im glad i did, it appears the developers have been very busy (far more busy than the bohemia studio for DAYZ standalone) the game looks beautiful and although not truly polished you can see what the developer is aiming to achieve, the improvements are vast and the gameplay is fun, with great elements of both PVE and PVP, the weather system is an immersive bonus. I love that they are adding other aspects of enemy not just mutants, the wolves also give you an extra sense of player awareness when travelling ( I would love to see more of this, from bears to mountain lions). All in all, its well worth the purchase on steam right now especially at ¬£7.49 , far better than Dayz, it appears the developers care more about their project here than making quick cash, a very well done and keep up the fantastic work.P.S. I have also gifted 2 further copies of the game to my eldest sons, who also so far enjoy it, and its pulled them from Rust for a while at least.			"

								This game is far from finished, and it is already a better ""survival"" game than H1Z1 ever even thought about being.  If you are in to a survival experience, and want a true survival game, buy this game and support the developers.  Dont expect it to be a finished prodeuct, but just know that the guys working on this game know exactly what a true survival experience is, and they are doing it. They could easily conform to the masses and complete the BR mode to make more money, but they aren't. They are sticking to making a core survival experience at heart, and I love it.  The world is truely immersive and is the best looking post apocolyptic game you will play with overgrown houses, stores, and streets.Do youself a favor and give this game a buy to support its development.  Storage is coming soon, they just have to rework how the servers send and recieve info.  Go to Entrada Interactive on youtube and watch their video from 2-20-16. It will explain a lot of things and answer a lot of questions you may have.10/10 development so far.... keep doing what youre doing guys!			"

Night time is much more terrifying as it should me. The lighting and shading make flashlights actually useful and often necessary, and the variation in the infected and the abundance of them makes the game more intense and exciting. Overall this game is headed in the right direction and with frequent updates I can't wait to see where is goes.			"

I have only 2 hours of playtime, but this is a story to be heard!Playing on US Server, searching military camp for supplies, find man looting tents, approach him and say friendly, turns out he's Russian and barely speaks ""Inglish"". He asks me to help search for weapons, as I do we find parts for vehicles but none to be found and fix, tons of guns and ammo though, two guys in a truck drive through, say they're friendly and want to know if we need a ride, russian friend says some russian words, does the ""Come On"" emote and proceeds to give them the middle finger, then blows one of their brains out, other guy tries to run and I follow up with executing him. Me and Russian Comrad now have a ride which we then use to run them over later on down the road. Found their base and wrecked havoc, decided to split the loot and part ways, proceeded to say some russian words and they muttered ""Comrad"" and walked off after a wave goodbye, I salute to you fellow comrad, may you bring mother Russia pride!Loot Find - 10/10Vehicle Spawn Rate - 3/10Friendly Community - 8/10 (Alot of friendly people, makes it hard to figure out who's cruel)Gameplay - 7/10 (Guns wouldn't fire, lagged a few times suddenly, which caused me to die, but overall ran pretty smoothly)			"

Early Access Review
								Einmal getestet und BANG!!!Hatte Miscreated als eines von mehreren Games aus einem HB-Bundle erworben. Da ich zigtausende Games im Backlog habe, checke ich manchmal 10-20 an einem Tag ab und ich muss zugeben das meiste davon wandert innerhalb von einer Minute in den M√ºllordner.Im √ºbrigen bin ich so gar kein Freund von MP, spiele fast nur Singleplayerspiele offline.Nun das hat sich mit MIscreated gewaltig ge√§ndert, ein einziger Schritt in diese geniale und wundersch√∂ne Welt und es war um mich geschehen. Was f√ºr eine Prachtgrafik und das alles sehr fl√ºssig. Der wahre Star des Spiels ist nicht das PvP-Gemetzel, dem ich sowieso nicht viel abgewinnen kann und auch nicht die Mutanten die meist eh zu dumm sind um ernsthaft Widerstand zu leisten, nein es ist die geniale Grafikengine von Crytek die dem Spiel zu wunderbaren Landschaften und im Zusammenspiel mit der realistischen Beleuchtung zu einer enorm stimmigen Athmosph√§re verhilft.Wer mal im aufsteigenden Bodennebel durch den Sumpf gewandert, bei Sonnenaufgang im Gebirge geklettert oder auch nur in der D√§mmerung durch den dichten Wald geschlichen ist, der weiss wovon ich hier rede, es ist einfach √ºberw√§ltigend.Und an jeder Ecke gibt es in der recht gro√üen Karte was zu sehen, ob man per Tauchgang oder Kraxeleien H√∂hlen pl√ºndern will, ein abgest√ºrztes Flugzeugwrack samt Leichen entdecken oder durch ungenutzte Atombunker kriechen will, √ºberall ist was zu finden und sei es nur ein versteckter weil nur per zu aktivierendem Aufzug erreichbarer Level in einem Hotel in der Hauptstadt. Man kann ganze Wochen mit der Erkundung verbringen und findet irgendwie immer noch was neues, zumal immer mal wieder neue Gebiete freigeschaltet werden. Selbst Motorboote sind vorhanden mit denen man die Fl√ºsse und das Meer befahren kann.Klar kommt dann auch noch der Storypart dazu, wobei Story bedeutet das man √ºberleben muss, egal wie. Das ist eigentlich nicht so schwer, denn Nahrung und Wasser gibts ja reichlich in den H√§usern. Nur bl√∂d das Banditen und Monster da oft auf einen warten.  Da hilft es nat√ºrlich bewaffnet zu sein, am besten noch ein Auto zusammenzubasteln, denn damit kriegt man jeden Mutanten klein. Lustigerweise kann man bei MIscreated sehr gut sehen zu welcher Sparte Spieler die Leute so geh√∂ren, da gibts die reinen PvP-ler, die nur gl√ºcklich sind wenn sie so viele Mitspieler wie m√∂glich killen k√∂nnen. Aber auch regelrechte Logistiker die ihen Basenbau vorher am Rei√übrett planen und die Teile daf√ºr zusammensuchen gibt es. Auch als Wandersimulator ist das Spiel geeignet und so kommen auch verkappte Naturforscher zu ihrem Recht wenn sie Rehe, W√∂lfe oder Eichh√∂rnchen jagen.Ich h√§nge nun schon seit mehr als 100 Stunden an dem SPiel, ein Wert den ich nicht so oft in so kurzer Zeit erreiche und es macht immer noch Spa√ü! Wenn ich mich durch Hayward schlage und bei jedem Schritt schauen muss das mich weder Mutanten noch PvP-ler erwischen, dann ist das schon ein geiles Feeling. Werde jetzt mal langsam mit dem Basenbau beginnen, das einzige was ich noch nicht gemacht habe. Mal sehen wie ich damit klarkomme.			"

Early Access Review
								With Patch 36, I finally can recomend this game. One of the best survival games out there, despite the reviews. It's best with friends who you can trust. You can die easily and that makes the game very intense. I'm a gamer for over 20 years now, and rarely played anything this thrillfull, there were many situations playing this game when my hearth started beating like crazy, and when I came out alive of them, it was overwhelming.Keep in mind, this is an early acces game, there will be bugs, crashes, issues you have to sort out. (but for me, worth it!)And another important thing you should know, it's a cryengine game, so to have fun, you need a beefy pc for it. (i'd say the lowest would be an I5 CPU with at least GTX 760, be aware though, patches can change optimisation in any direction).If you can get this with a discount, I think it's definitely worth buying. If you have to pay full price, look for other reviews out there before, so you know you would like this before buying.			"

								This game is obviously still a work in progress. However it is at a point where gameplay goes pretty smooth. The PvP is surprisingly really good. I would say this game is in much better working order than its competition such as dayz.PRO'S-PvP is great-Lots of loot-Lots to explore-Working vehicles-Great weather storms and tornados XDCON'S-Inventory system a bit buggy-Barely any pve maybe one or two mutants in an entire city-No base storage system to store your collected gear. (Devs working on this now)-Cannot break down clips of bullets or even combind them. So if you have 1 bullet left in a clip its basically trash.			"

Early Access Review
								I first got this game at the beginning of 2016 and was amazed with what it brought to the table. It was my first survival game however so I didn't know what others had to offer and at this point I didn't care. The first thing I noticed was that the devs were very active. When I first got the game I was annoyed with certain glitches but within the first month or two of playing most of them had been ironed out. This gave me a lot of faith in the dev team and they have kept that to this day.The weather system is one of the things I would like to draw attention towards. There are multiple different weather patterns that can strike at anytime. Heavy fog, mist, storms, wind storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, heavy and light rain. It makes you really appreciate when its a nice sunny day out and adds a lot to the immersion. Just imagine chasing someone down the road when a heavy fog rolls in and all the sudden you can't see 5ft in front of you and get lost in the middle of a field.The amount of awesome experiences ive had in this game can't be counted, all I can say is buy it. If you think $20 is to much then wait for a sale which happens every 3 months at the most and get it for half off. A wooping $10 for a game that you could spend as much time on as me. "

								At time of writing 11th March 2016, the game doesn't have any base storage options, the game without storage is frustrating, no getting around that, but please read on.The devs have said the reason for it is due to the Cryengine and they are having to rewrite a lot of code (which only one of the team can do), and so that will take time. They have said storage is coming.Don't be put off too much though, the game is still excellent without storage, for some of the following reasons:The graphics are superbThe game is logical - you find more food in kitchens for exampleVehicles are fun to drive...a truck going downhill on it's rims (no tyres) makes for a very interesting slippy experience! Slap some tyres on it and you have a fast, manoverable machine!The dark is terrifying whether you are stalking players or being stalked - this can't be overstated enough and is a real treat to be involved with, especially if you are in a group!There are plenty of KoS'ers, but also plenty of friendly players as well.The price is very reasonable for what you get and the 'cost-per-hour' of fun you will get out of it!Miscreated really does have the potential to be something very special, but it's not quite there yet.Definitely worth 15 quid though!

								Amazing graphics, especially when you're in the forest. Enough of a player base to find a good full server. You can only have very little storage though, and you can't build a base that will last more than an hour to an ax. Much much easier to raid than it is to build, so there's really no point. Can't hide bases that well because there's hardly and forest in the game. The forests are tiny and have roads running through them, while the big open terrain is usually just plains. I can't ever find any big forests. It's basically a much prettier dayz, except a few things...The worst parts of the game for me are that you can't keep anything safe, and the PVP is terrible. It took my 12 shots with a 9mm to kill someone at point blank range. It takes multiple hits with large fireaxes to kill someone, headshots don't usually kill, ect. The damage is waaaay too low to the point where it's about numbers and gear instead of skill and stealth, which makes for lousy pvp. If there was more to do other than pvp then it'd be forgiveable, but there's not. I'm still yet to find a survival multiplayer game with realistic damage. I do recommend the game if you are a graphics enthusiast.			"

								Seems like a fun game, can be slow at times with lenthy bouts of walking and the lack of items around the place is kinda annoying.  For example you can search 5 or 6 houses and come out with nothing of value maybe a bit of food..  Ammo and guns are hard to come by unless you spawn near the army barracks I've found, and even then you'll be lucky to get out alive.  You can't get into a melee fight with the zombies unless you have bandages because you'll just slowly bleed out after the fights over with no way to stop it.  The map is pretty big and there is a max of 32 people per sever so you'll very rarely run into anyone.  I was playing with 30 other people and saw 1 other person the entire time who just KOS anyway.Overall I think it has some serious potential, not that I'm an expert but as of now it feels like you walk too much and search too much and the rewards dont relate to the time you put into it all.  There was one point I felt like I was really getting somewhere I had a rifle with maybe 9 bullets but all of a sudden dropped dead.  No noise, no bullet sound or anything, maybe a glitch? but then I respawned and had no idea where I was and really didn't have the motivation to go back to searching identically made houses for the next hour.

Moments on we hid a bush waiting for players to come by, I found the opportunity and lied about that someone was walking few clicks from us he quickly looked in the distance I made him believed I was unarmed but deep within my Evil heart I hid 9mm Handgun the bullet broke through his brain and broke the trust as well but who F#$king Cares I got my backpack and got Sodas #Totalyworthit10/10 - The Game is pretty good and has very good potentialPROS - Beautiful Graphics, Good Mechanics, THE RAIN ON THE GROUND!, The feeling of surviving can be really FeltCONS - If you believe that Trust can never be broken, I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you not.The Zombies can swing faster than a plane.

MiscreatedOpen world multiplayer survival game.I only encountered some minor bugs (even though it is early access game), like I got shot at about from 10 meters away, but neved actually heard the shot.The game graphics are really nice, perhaps only thing that cought my eye was the flickering of the fire at nights, seemd a bit like someone playing with a lightswitch.Devs seem to patch the game quickly and the content updates are coming pretty constantly, so hopefully they are continuing with the same pace as this game has potential.If you have friends to play with and like survival games, you are really going to enjoy this one.Pros: - Everything looks great. - Runs very well and smoothly (at least on my PC). - Environment. - Base building. - Crafting system.Cons: - Needs more craftable items/furniture/building parts and more variation on them. - Bigger player base per server is needed. - Few minor bugsPlayed with patch 36.

I would say this game is in much better working order than its competition such as dayz.PRO'S-PvP is great-Lots of loot-Lots to explore-Working vehicles-Great weather storms and tornados XDCON'S-Inventory system a bit buggy-Barely any pve maybe one or two mutants in an entire city-No base storage system to store your collected gear. (Devs working on this now)-Cannot break down clips of bullets or even combind them. So if you have 1 bullet left in a clip its basically trash.			"

								20 minutes played. I feel I have enough experience to review this.First impressions: Better version of the beloved DayZ. Simply is.>Loaded near trailer park>loots trailer park>finds pretty crappy gear, bat and bag>finds food>makes way to strange steps of hope, sees map>sees airfield and goes there>first enoucter with zombie>chased throughout the airfield scary af.> finally lose it in the water>go back to airfield towers>a guy comes up trying to hit me, i‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•myself and jump>i die.8/10 pretty fun i can bet its more fun with friends, would love to start base building.

								First 2 weeks playing this, although i liked the game, really didnt enjoy every player i ran into claiming to be ""friendly"" only to stab me in the back for my gear or shoot me for my truck! couldnt trust anyone! Then i joined mrs miscreated's whitelisted pve server and day 1 there met some really nice and helpfull people, helped me build and traded me equipment. now after a week on that server its completely changed the game for me! i really enjoy playing now and made some great friends there and go places and do stuff together without having to worry about being ""jacked"" by other players! would recomend this game if you can get on a good server with friends, otherwise watch your back! more fake friendlys then real ones on most servers!

								I first looked at this game when it was just released. I saw it had potential, so I waited. I saw it was on sale, so I bought it.Honestly, it was a good choice, even though it was a gamble.Here's what people are interested in:Pros Active devs Beautiful Graphics Relatively friendly player-base Gameplay is very fun and challenging (Guns, Vehicles and Resources are hard to find) Really good soundtrack Decent view/viewmodel/fov settings (ability to switch from third/first person) Good controls & Player movement Big Map (With more to come) Human Interaction is really good. Frame Rate is good.Cons Early Acess Alpha (Which means lots of bugs.) Lack of zombies/mutants (Could be the server I play on hehe xd) (Could be just me but...) Sensitivity is sometimes messed up when running/sprinting If you're a solo player and you run into a group, you're most likely to get muggedI really enjoy the game, but the bugs are what (kind of) ruin the fun. You also die really fast when falling, lol.If you're looking for a DayZ killer, this is it.			"

								At time of writing 11th March 2016, the game doesn't have any base storage options, the game without storage is frustrating, no getting around that, but please read on.The devs have said the reason for it is due to the Cryengine and they are having to rewrite a lot of code (which only one of the team can do), and so that will take time. They have said storage is coming.Don't be put off too much though, the game is still excellent without storage, for some of the following reasons:The graphics are superbThe game is logical - you find more food in kitchens for exampleVehicles are fun to drive...a truck going downhill on it's rims (no tyres) makes for a very interesting slippy experience! Slap some tyres on it and you have a fast, manoverable machine!The dark is terrifying whether you are stalking players or being stalked - this can't be overstated enough and is a real treat to be involved with, especially if you are in a group!There are plenty of KoS'ers, but also plenty of friendly players as well.The price is very reasonable for what you get and the 'cost-per-hour' of fun you will get out of it!Miscreated really does have the potential to be something very special, but it's not quite there yet.Definitely worth 15 quid though!

								I brought this game todayOn the first day of me and my friends getting this game, me and one of my friends spawned incredibly close together. We immediatly went to pilfering to local houses for loot and managed to figure out where we were..We tried meeting up with one of our other friends, but instead managed to make it to the airbase..There was our first interaction with the natives of the server, aswell as the muties. We passed a courtyard, narrowly managing to avoid a shambeling mutant.Several fresh spawns were looting and pillaging the airfield as we got there. We decided to high tail it out of there, but we were not alone. We were being pursued by a being known only as Spec Ops man. Out of no where, we turned around and saw a man in Full military special forces gear came out of no where, after a while of us being held up by him, He flipped my friend off and dissapeared into the treeline. Not waiting for him to come back we ran as fast as we could. After ages of searching through pinewoods, we met up with my other friends. We managed to get gear, and plenty of it. There was a moment where I do recall one of my friends scremaing ""OH GOD BEHIND YOU"", This was followed by 3 super muties charging us from out of no where. I fondly recall screaming and running while shouting ""DON'T LET HIM KILL ME!"". After finishing of the muties, we proceded up a hill towards the northern part of the map. That was when the Spec Ops man made his appearance..But he was not alone. I remember one of my friends, his dying words being ""Theres someone in that bush""..The rest of our small group thought he was fear mongering, alas, he was not. One of my friends flashed the bush. All that followed was a swift shotgun blast and then there was silence..I still remember running for my life when I could have stayed and fought with my shotgun. But I would have died on that day..I can still hear their screams on the air. We will get our revenge one day, Spec Ops man. After my encounter which resulted in me becoming the lone survivor of that massacre, I fled north. As far north as I could go. I ransacked house after house searching for the bare neccesitys which would stop me from dying. I managed to get into the police station, in a old abandoned city. I had to fight hordes of zombies to get into there..But what I came out with allowed me to live. I then migrated back down south where I made new friends and made a small base camp that would allow us somewhere to regroup should the worse happen. I remember running back down the roads in the rain and thunder. Never far away from death, but I ran non the less. Now we are short of food after my friends went scavaging and were ambushed by Spec Ops man. So many innocents dead...One day, Spec Ops man..One Day..Day Two:Today, my friends went out in their seperate groups. Several did not make it back, but the ones that did had mighty storys to tell..One went all the way up north towards the large city and raided the police station, on his way back passing by a place called 'Clyde Hill', or as we later called it, military village. After several hours they managed to repair a truck that they had found there. It did not go well.On their way back to our base they managed to get it stuck in a ditch and were attacked by 2 roaming savages that managed to take down one of their number. Veangance was swift and lethal though, one of the Savages being cut down by a hail of weapon fire. Also the atmosphere when it rains is spooky as f*ck10/10Payed ¬£7.50 for hours of funProbably will update this story a bit despite the fact I am bad at writing and also if anything eventful happens.

								Okay, so my first review of this game was bad. However, after playing some I have realised that the devs and such are making good progress with the small crew that they have and have mad a lot of improvements since then.  I had a lot of fun playing this today and find that even the lack of player base there's still thing to do and fun to be had. Crafting has come a long way and so has the optimization of the game since I last played. All in all it is a good game for it being in alpha and hope to see it released soon and it's final form.			"

Pros: Amazing graphics and really well optimizedExcellent environment and foilage (dense forests and overgrown cities)Community as of this moment is quite friendly, half the time im riding in some randoms car who is helping freshies.Game is fairly hardcore, finding even 3 bullets for a gun has an amazing feel, looting is hard and requires a fair amount of time to thoroughly loot a whole building.Barely any bugs (only encountered 2 so far)Driving is fun and the cars are easy to use and not buggy in any way.The main city in this game is impressive to say the least, with a huge playing area and massive skyscrapers. Almost unseen in EA survival games.Cons: Not enough content as of now, only 4 different sized backpack and 15 guns, but to be fair it is much more than some other early access survival games (H1Z1 which only has a pathetic 4 primary weapons)Combat is a tiny bit sluggish, and some keys cant be pressed while others are being held down (going between third and first person while sprinting)Overall, Miscreated is highly recommended for the price. One of the most polished EA games on steam and much better than almost all the other hardcore survival games on steam.			"

								Looks beautiful and runs really well unlike a lot of other survival games.Combat is good.Map is fun so far.Loot spawning is good, you have to look pretty carefully.Weather effects are great.Lighting is very atmospheric when looting with a torch in the night.Vehicles can be repaired and used. All aboard the bus!Crafting and base building is basic but works well.About 40% of the players you meet are friendly and won't hack you up.Buildings have furniture and actually look like they were once lived in.TORNADOES!10/10Storm chasing in the apocalypse!

								You're here becuase you're tired of playing Day Z ALPHA. This is very much like Day Z. I jumped right in and felt at home quickly. It's not much better than Day Z but also not much worse, just slightly different. The animations are certinally better than Day Z but it has draw backs like not being able to switch weapons/ view/ turn flashlight on or off (or do anything really) while running; you have to stop running to do all those things, which can be a pain in the a** when you'er getting shot at. Graphics are what you would expect for a $20 alpha. Most of the screen shots on steam look enhanced. It's fun though. F*** Day Z.			"

It has regular updates that bring tons of new stuff and the developer are communicating with the community. TL;DR: All together it is the best post-apocaliptic-survival game out there in my opinion.			"

								It's great game in general. It's great for playing with friends since you have to get involved when you're doing pvp. The game needs a lot of communication so that makes it perfect to play with others. It's true that needs more optimization but it's going in the right direction. Give it a try if you want one of the best survivals at the moment.			"

								I want to quickly debunk a popular ""negative review"" that some people have shared, simply because they don't understand the full game, or have done little research.""- Review: There is NO character progression. It's permadeath. Your character gains nothing even if you play him for 100 hours.""That is entirely incorrect. Yes, there is no skill tree, such as in Infestation: Survivor Stories (I feel sick having to compare the 2 games), yet the progression is still there. When your character is created, you have nothing. Your items are expendable, as they are lost or used over time, but it's not DayZ. You can build bases. The longer you play that character, the more ""blueprints"" you find throughout the world. I've played for 63 hours and have only found 3 blueprints. There are 11 different blue prints to find, having up to 3 variations of each. Blueprints allow you to build traps, bridges, different walls, powered machinery, etc. Your chacter is able to build a better base over time, which is the only solid way to keep your items long-term. In some ways, your base is your character, and the mesh that is your character is simply a bi-product of how well your base is designed and fortified.The game has more content than 90% of the survival games I've played, and it's in alpha. They just added radios, with like 6 different bands and 40 different channels, so immersion is wonderful for roleplayers. Among the damn-near weekly updates, the devs have added original mechanics as well, such as a whistle emote that attracts mutants from a distance.Also, it's 10 bucks right now. Miscreated is well worth 1 Double-Bacon Cheeseburger with fries. Buy it.			"

								I have Played Miscreated, for 4 months. I know it is early access. The attention to detail is Brilliant. And with every new patch, new and more effects are being added. In is nice to see the developers, take such a interest in the game, and the players, who play the game. It has a fantastic game engine (CryENGINE). For me, I can go on any Server, in the world, ie (UK to USA or Australia) with almost no lag. And with new things in the pipeline, Base building is coming. The game is a,  joy to play. With each Update, that comes out New things are added, some more of the map is opened up, a big cave (which is very well done), and tweaks, to improve the game. Plus the New Crytech engine update, which give better Graphics, and shading. Update Base Building is in game now, and very easy to build, a basic base. Since I got this game, a lot has been added. With such a small Devopment team, this game has, what they have added in the last 6 months ( is Brilliant) A great game. Worth getting, with a lot to come, ie: Battle Royale in the Pipeline. 2016 is going to be a good year for this game & the players. Update: There is a New City being added sometime this year (2016), should be a big plus. And now the Weather, The Rain Tornado, is Brilliant. One thing about this game, you never know, what will be added next. 30/08/2016. Now the city, is open, most of the Building are open, a new hotel with a working Elevator (Lift), just starting to show, what can be done, & powered up Hotal at night, Has to be seen, to be believed. The Mutants, now can throw rocks at players, plus a super Mutant, takes a lot of ammo to kill.			"

								My Miscreated review:Miscreated is NOT a dayZ clone. You pigs who keep saying that every zombie apoc. type game is a dayz clone, need to shut the hell up.Miscreated does not have zombies, they have mutants, but there's really no difference but the name.The game is very quiet, you really won't hear anything but nature until you enter a populated place or meet another player/mutant. Gunshots however are very loud, and can be heard from far away.The game is also PvP based, as there's currently no AI that mimic players.My pros:- The game looks amazing, very generic response.- Players actually don't kill on sight  (most of them)- Scavenging is actually a very big part of the game, you don't just find a gun in every house.- Base building is very unique, takes a long time like Rust.- Everything feels like it should be there, things are placed where they should be placed- The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• trees don't require a 980ti to render.My cons:- There's currently no party system, only clans (which are useless)- Mutants have the same pattern (follow, hit, run, follow)- There's only one map, community maps are non-existant.- Freeze framing happens quite a bit.

								Picked this game up sometime ago but never really played much given I was so into Dayz.  However, have played it more recently with my other half and am loving it.Graphically gorgeous, runs extremely well for an early access, good frame rates, no lag or glitching.Working vehicles in game which you have to find parts for before running.  Quad bikes, trucks, baggage  carriers, tractors and boats!  Am loving it.We have explored caves, died of radiation poisoning, chased and attacked by mutants and crafted an FahQ bat!  Awesome!  Developers are working on base building which is looking great followed by hunting and cooking.  Cannot wait to get my camp built with friends.What are you waiting for?  Join the community and come exploring, surviving and have the odd fight here and there with other players.  You won't regreat picking this game up, it is only going to get better.			"

Even with a map 1/4th the size of DayZ's it still feels very expansive in it's current state, and even Miscreated being an Early-Access release it plays with minimal bugs for me. Lack of content is the only downfall I have noticed so far.. which should be expected during the Alpha stage of development.Overall Opinion:   9.6/10I feel Miscreated is on it's way to being a great game with developers that pay attention to detail and consider player suggestions, unlike other survival apocalypse titles here on Steam (*coughcough*H1Z1*cough*). For only $10 out of my wallet for a high-quality game Miscreated get's a two thumbs up from me.**UPDATE**As of recently Miscreated has been receiving flak for being in development since 2013 without actually looking at the progress the small dev-team has made. Many things need improvements still, but it's clear that the developers are focused determined.			"

								I highly recommend this game! The PvP is great, the multiplayer works amazing. Although it is early access and carries bugs. The devs are very quick on fixing them! Updates happen often, bringing exciting new content. (Usually Monthly Updates) The AI is great, looting is not very difficult especially when you know the hot spots. ;) This game is perfect for people who enjoy first person shooters. If you like to be sneaky and snipe, there are plenty of places in the huge BEAUTIFUL map. Interacting with players happens a lot even with their max population in a server is 36 players. People are easy to come by. Not all are hostile, but many can trick you. Never let your guard down! The game is great for playing solo, or with a group of friends. Base building takes some time, but it is fun! BUY IT, AND ENJOY! :D			"

Early Access Review
								This game, while it has it's problems, i would recomend this gameMapping:This game is very good at making the world feel huge, even if it is just an island, that is one thing it is very good at, ive played this game for week and am still disovering parts. While the game isn't the most beautiful (although that may be the fault of my pc having me keep most stuff on medium) but it can be very pretty, when your out just strolling, in a forested field and look up to  see that lens flare from the sun over it, it's just gorgeous. if there's one problem with this game's mapping it seems that each house and building is a model, meaning every time you go into a town and see a building, instead of loading that part of the map your loading a file, and this causes frame drops.(Removed: See edit)Items:The guns in the game are very realistic in my opinion, you shoot someone, they're going to  die, shot in the chest by a riffle, they can survive but they probably won't, shot in the head from anything and they'll die, no bullet sponges (except for the mutants which also usually die from short range shot to the head, just takes atleast 3 riffle shots to the chest to kill them) Most melee items you can kill someone and a mutant in 3 hits with an axe, hatchet, or nailed and barb wire coiled bat. The weight system and inventory is really decent in my opinion, the weight isn't super limiting and will only stop you when you try to carry a car battery, wheel, and jerry can. The inventory gives each item (excluding primary weapons, they must be equiped) their own slot, starting off with 6 slots normally (jeans and t-shirt) and you can slowly go up  with vests, back packs and bags, pants with more space, hoodies, and just so much, nearly each item of clothing allows you more room, at the cost of weight increasing for each.Vehichles:Probably the most glitchy part of the game, vehichles, with the atv and bike being able to fly off into the atmosphere when you stand one them when they'er stuck on something to never be seen again, this is probably a  understatement. the only real glitches i have found is with the vehichles, they get wheels stuck in the ground sometimes, atv and bike being launched 2 miles away to explode on impact with anything, same when trucks and cars when another rams them into something, sometimes they'll be pushed up and it flips them and launches them. these are all rare and you can probably avoid these most of the time. I personally love how with vehichles you hardly ever find them with a large ammount of parts, which makes sense with scavengers and raiders and all that‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and you go faster the more wheels you put on then when you are driving on the rim, and the only vehichles this makes a major difference in is atvs, and transports.EDIT: While i believe what most of the stuff i have said remains true, there's one problem. Fps, and optimizationThis game is optimized to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• everything is great except this, i can rarely get 30 fps on this game let alone 60, if you have motion sickness, stay away from this game, or find a guide on how to make it run better like i did. I can get a stable 60+ fps on most of my games at high-extra high settings, not this game though. This is the one thing they need to fix before putting it out as a full game and off of early access.Summary:I would give this game an 75/100 (original before edit: 89.5)Over all this game is fun to play. it can be fun to find people and make a group. The inventory and vehichle system is very good in my opinion, and the weapons are realistic in my opinion, the optimization needs major work and the game is clearly not ready to be put out as a full game, but I would still recomend this game.

Great graphics!  This game has crazy potential.The game does need bi-monthly updates, however small they are, it doesn't matter.The game needs more content .... especially crafting for survival and/or base building.No PvE Servers atm and they are needed.I have played H1Z1 A LOT and this game can beat it but it needs more attention from its developers.I'm excited for this game's potential and I will continue to play and help the developers.I'm excited for the future of this game!

								After 10 mins of wrestling with the game, I finally manage to find a server. Its night time.After wrestling with the controls, I pull out a flashlight and stumble around the night. I then accidentally drop my flashlight. This meant all I could do was walk around blindly, bumping into walls and running from what I think was the dead.After a long night of crawling around, cowering under a bed (because of hearing growls and gunshots),  it finally turned day.Slightly more confident because I could see, I strolled along the road and bumped straight into another group of survivors, Who I'm guessing was their leader, approached me with open arms, and kindly gave me some food, before shouting 'Now run you fat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•' as if this was an organised order, the rest of the crew proceeded to punch me and throw smoke grenades at me, all I could hear was their insane laughter as I fled into a housing district.For awhile, I bumped into various other survivors who were either hiding, or had no intention of saying hello with the occasional power walking zombie. After gathering a few more bits of food and water, I felt quite confident.Two minutes later, my corpse lay flat on the ground, with a neat little bullet hole plastered through one eye.10 outta 10, would wrestle again.

								After consulting every ressource I know before purchasing ONE and only ONE survival game, I've been attracted by the visuals of Miscreated at once. The concept of the game and the motivation of the developpers did the rest and I purchased it.Now, after few die and retries, I'm positively surprised to still find new things to do. The randomisation of the equipement conditions your experience and makes it different each time. Once you'll find guns at once and look for a fight, another day it'll be harder and will have to craft your spiked plank.The incoming content looks promising, the cooperation will be a must to achieve great things and carry the materials with your pickup to the construction site of your base.Last but not least, I think the game is more ""friendly"" than other games of this kind with simplified controls and UI. So far, I didn't encounter any bug, unexpected death or inventory loss. Remember and keep in mind that the game under developpement. The invisible walls are there just because these areas of the map are not finished yet.I run the game in 720p low settings on a 3 years old laptop, i5, Geforce540m 1Gb, 4Gb ram, Windows 7 64 bit.Don't forget you'll need a 64 bits system and a DirectX 11 video card coupled with at least 4Gb of ram to run the game.Very good impression, I feel very confident about the future of Miscreated.If you should try a survival game, this is the one.Miscreated will be the survivor of its genre, the concurence will be quickly forgotten or abandonned by their communities.

								I like the game and totaly recommend it to all people who loves the postapocalyptic survival genre. What I like the most about the game is its love for the mapdesign. The mapdesign and all things with it is just so freaking awesome, I've never seen so much love for details in any of the other survival multiplayer games. It really feels like being in a postapocalyptic world. Houses are old, plants growing over the walls, textures are well done, with grafity of the last ones, rubbish glittering over floors and stuff... I think that is quite important to get the right impressions! The map is alrdy quite big too and they working on it and make it bigger from time to time. But it never feels like you walking from one point to another for ages like I have experienced in other survival games. The looting system is well done as well. You literally find things everywhere. You just have to search in particular to get things together.The second I like very much ist the pvp part. You dont need to wait very long to get into decent pvp. There are 3 bigger towns and an airfield which is famous for its pvp. The weapon system still needs some work but it feels very well done already. The weapons are not that overpowered, especially the snipers, you really have to have a calm hand to hit somebody. Its not like in other games where snipers just laying in a hedges for hours and oneshot all the poor guys who trying to find loot and they actually dont know what just happened. Most of the time its more like, you hear a shot and quite quick you know you are under fire, so you rush into cover, a building or whatsoever... then the fun part begins. The moment you hear steps and you know somebody hostile wants you to be dead. Your heartbeat slowly increases. It can take a while after the actual fight starts because everybody know, If I loose this fight, I gotta start from scratch. Those moments can be so intense... I love it!The third part is the basebuilding... holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•it makes so much fun. You can build so beautiful shelter, little block houses, bases as little roadblocks or even really big forts where u store all your vehicles and in future the storage crates. You find your guides for the different parts and then you start to build your home, just the way you want it to look like. No predefined blocks. The basebuilding system is made a way that every base has its unique look.Overall I like the fact it is held pretty realistic. In groups you are really have to remember what your mates look like or he ends up friendly fired by yourself. There is no crosshair with any weapon which helps for aiming. To get vehicles going you need to find several parts, like drivebelts, oil, spark plagues ect. Mutants can be really dangerous if you dont care. First you start on the map you are really lost and no magic map is showing you where you actually are. So you gotta find out yourself what is where, where to go and so on...The game itself being in an alpha state is already well done! Sure it has still tons of bugs and things to be made better in future, lot of features and content to implement into the game so its getting interesting for a long term fungame but the devs working on it and they let you know they do quite often. I think the game has a lot of potential and being said I was never a big fan of its genre, for this particular game I want to be a part of its development and would like to see how it turns out in the end. If devs keeping up the good work on it, it will blow a lot of poeples minds!!!			"

								Revenge Simulator 2016, recommended.After weeks of being downtrodden, my friend and I finally found a vehicle, stocked up properly and performed a raid on an enemy base.We axed his gnome to death, killed his pig, found his hidden inventory chest and left ol' pigsy's entrails in the chest after taking everything nice.10/10 for prized possession slaughter.Edit:What a roller-coaster of a game! Once you get used to the fact that ""random stranger X"" _will_ kill you for no apparent reason you really start having fun.Last night a friend and I found a sweet pickup truck on the way to the airfield. He knew where a battery might be, so back to the airfield it was... right into the middle of enemy action.""Look out, there's a car coming up the hill"" he says. I spin around and try to find it, finally see it heading straight towards me where I'm trapped against a fence... three shots with the AT-15 into the grille of their sedan and the car is on fire. Then it hit me and I faded to black as I witnessed the satisfying destruction of the car and all but one of its passengers.The gear they stole from my bloodied corpse does not come cheaply.Later on in the night I respawned near a sweet tractor, got that bad boy going and then drove it from east to west on the map, slow and loud.What a game.

								This game is awesome it has everything i like when it comes to survival. post apocalyse world, decaying/ rusted enviroment, a large range of weapons, appropriate spawn locations and building. however ive only had one issue with this game and it involves the building. once you start you need to gather resources to reach the city where you get guns. you eventually get a lot of inventory space and get guns and so forth. but once you make your base you can only place 1 chest. which is only about 10 slots big. if you decide to play and build a base you wont have anything to store stuff in as once you fill your inventory as it cant even hold more then a bag which is what i think most people put their spare stuff in. this would lead to inventory issues. if that was fixed and maybe make building a little easier. this game would be perfect.

								Way too buggy in it's current state. Scavenging and fighting in the dark streets of Orca Island is fun however this game is infuriating beyond belief. Almost every time I'd log back in 50% of my items are gone from my body. Cars which take large investments of time to get functioning, would just blow up for no reason. Once I somehow found myself outside of the map, goodbye AT15 with full magazine because the game kills you instantly when you get out there. Losing hours of progress due to the game being highly unstable is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• time.			"

								Loving this game so far.Having recently started playing Dayz and Arma 3 Exile this caught my eye while on sale. Sunk some time into it and so far had great fun. Have met some mostly friendly people. One shady group that tried to duct tape me but i ran off and hid in a bush until they got tired of looking for me and ran off.Looks gorgeous - especially during sunrise and sunset.			"

ReviewThis game is immersive, beautiful and has next to no performance issues. It also has devs that actively talk with members of the community in hopes of making the game better in any way they can, despite it missing some features, it is a mostly fully functional Zombie Survival/PVP game, it even features wild life that can destroy you (my story below goes into this further), pick this up, play it for however long you want, you can always come back to it a few months later and be greeted with some new content/features. This game can make your heart beat fast, it can make you second-guess your morals. Ammo is usually hard to find but guns can be quite easy to come across if you look in built up areas (towns, the city, heck, even some stores). This is the end of my review, the rest of the ""review"" will be the story of my first life. The Story of my First Life This all took place in my first life, my first time playing the game. I spawned at the edge of a forest, I saw a few houses ahead, it was almost pitch-black, I went ahead and looted them, only finding a hatchet and a few useless pistol mags, I was shining my trusty flashlight in the house, it illuminating the house with me unaware. I heard a guy call out to me, turns out him and his buddy were just some friendly guys in the middle of nowhere with some assualt rifles, I followed them around a bit before we began looting the rest of this small town we ended up in, we walked into the forest for whatever reason and supposedly we were going to the city, so I tagged along, in the very waking hours of the morning, the sun just rising above the treeline we heard howls, it was the wolves, they began shooting at the wolves, it was a huge pack of them, easily 20 or more of them, I made a ran for it after being told they would hold them back, leaving them behind in hopes they make it out alive, they didn't, I never heard from them again. I was at the edge of the forest now and the sun had risen, I was now inside a large town, not a city but pretty huge. I came across roughly 15-20 people in the town, all looting, everyone was friendly, no one had guns, at least we thought so, I was looting a department store when outside out the corner of my eye I notice a taxi, it wasn't in a condition to drive but it was close enough, all it needed was spark plugs, two wheels, some oil and some fuel. I set out to look for it before coming across 2 people, both of them were friends and completely new to the game like me, so I told them about the car and what we needed and we set out to raid the town of every piece we needed, we managed to find spark plugs, oil and the two wheels but we lacked fuel, we couldn't find it anywhere. Anyway we went back to the car to install the components we had recently found around the town, before having a sit down and talking for about 10 minutes about how we're gonna find fuel and where we could, we were about to head to a nerby ""Gas Station"" before being stopped by what we thought was a fellow peer, he was on top of the department store, he offered us fuel for some of our clothing, we thought to ourselves, ""it's a fair deal, why not!"" but before we knew it he shot one of us in the leg, luckily we were already behind the taxi so I made my T-Shirt into a rag and used it as a bandage to stop him from bleeding, after we fixed up his leg we made a run for it, the gunman tried to shoot us as we started our run for safety, we bolted through the department store and ran into a nearby forest, he got a shot in my lower back, I was bleeding heavily, the gun man was still chasing us but he had to climb down off the roof so we were a good 50m ahead of him, next thing we knew, we were in the middle of a forest being amushed by a pack of wolves. We ran away from the town because we would've got shot if we was to head back to the town, so we ran to the other side of the forest, long behold our saviour, a massive water tower that was taller than anything we saw in the town, all 3 of us safely made it up the ladder but I was bleeding hard, luckily I had a spare rag and I stopped my bleeding just in time, I was on 2% HP, on the brink of death. Just as we thought we were safe and we made our way down the ladder, we heard more wrenching growls from the Wolves below, they waited for us to come down (now thats some impressive AI), I can't say how fast we climbed straight back up the ladder. We figured out a plan, 2 of us had axes, me and 1 of the others, I was on 2% HP, I was hungry, thirsty and I don't believe I could make it, I gave the axe to the unarmed one, in true heroic fashion they said to me, ""You'll make it threw, we'll make sure of it."" Those words have stuck with me since, I watched over them as they climbed down the ladder. I wished them luck and watched some fight off the wolves, I watched my only 2 friends get mauled to death by a pack of wolves, before my eyes, I couldn't take it anymore, I was hungry, thirsty and afraid. I made a decision honour their death and try to make a run for it, it was suicide for sure but if I could make it through, I could live to tell the tale. I ran for my life but the wolves were too fast for my frail, injured body. I died that very day.Thats my story. Edit: What is happening currently! I came across a player who thought I was going to shoot him on sight, I didn't so then we headed off to see his friends, we ended messing around for 10 hours and now we have loads of resources, tonnes of vehicles, tonnes of weapons and some ammo. We are the most powerful people in the server. I recommend playing this game with friends or trying to find a group of people to play with, it can make this game 1000x more fun.			"

								Very fun and enjoyable game!! Although...the pvp side makes it very hard to progress into the base building aspect of the game.Alot of players are like myself friendly play to see how far you can get, what crazy base you can build venture around learn the map and whats around but there is always someone that just picks off players for s@#ts and giggles which then start a chain reaction and you are left with a cluster of players shooting at what ever moves trying to get revenge making it very hard to do anything.A PVE server would be a great addition to this game can only hope it comes as the game develops futher.KEEP IN MIND DONT TRUST ANYONE THAT YOU DONT KNOW PERSONALLY.

								The best post-apocalyptic survival game on Steam at the moment. Better than DayZ in every inch. Developers care about it's development process and release updates at sequential pace (and it doesn't mean it contains only 1 item per patch). Due to their small team, sometimes something goes wrong, but they don't give up and work as hard as possible to keep the game playable. I can recommend Miscreated to everyone who is searching a very enjoyable and promising game but you need to have some experience in survival games because I don't want to kill you by accident when you will be walking along the road. :D			"

								Early Access Alpha Review: I've played many survival games, so for those who are veterans to the genre you will already feel like you know the game. The devs have done a good job paying attention to detail, the world is immersive and most buildings and houses have the ability to scour through them for loot. This game has the feel of a little of H1Z1 and DayZ combined together, just to give you an idea of what to expect.I find the community in this game to be a lot better than the usual KOS type that comes with most survival games. Many people will communicate, even if they plan to kill you. In my opinion having a little RP or dialogue goes a long way with these games and you will find more often than not people are willing to help or at least chat a bit before you get shot in the head.The cost is very good, I got it on sale for $10. For an EA you can't beat that price and you get more content than what is still yet to even come in other titles like DayZ standalone. I usually steer clear of early access titles but I saw how much the devs work on the game and are transparent with updates as well as having very positive reviews from others. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of survival games at a fair price.It's a mostly PVP focused game but there are some infected mutants to give you PVE. The infected which are like your undead zombies are at random around the map. The AI is a bit wonky with them but it's not terrible and there are even special ones that do more damage or are quite large behemoths that take a lot of ammo to take down. You won't find any huge hoards (yet) but you also have animals like wolves to be a threat to your survival as well.Vehicles are a bit buggy at times, they can get stuck on the random object or bounce around quite a bit, but still aren't terrible. Weapons are pretty easy to acquire but ammo isn't, so conserving your shots for key opportunities are critical. There are cool survival items like the walkie talkie which allows you to communicate with other survivors who also have one handy. There are just a lot of immersion adding elements, even the ambient sound is a scary at times. I would say the gun firing sounds need some improvement but they aren't horrible either.Overall the game is pretty well done for an alpha and I'm excited to see what comes down the pipe during further development. I wouldn't hestitate to buy now, especially if it's on sale.TL;DR - If you like survival horror, you want PVP, immersion, base building, good graphics that don't hog your system and a cool world than look no further. Miscreated has a lot of what other titles like DayZ still haven't even provided years into development.			"

								I love the game to death, it's really fun to play, even by yourself. The graphics in this game is amazing, even on the lowest setting! Theres a various ammount of locations around the world to visit and they are place in a reasonable distance between each other. When you go to visit any of these locations, theres a 'story' to it I guess you can say, and there's ALOT of detail in buildings and cities arcoss the map. I also like the fact that the devs usually work on bugs in the game before adding anything, I will say the game is still buggy, but it's in much better shape then when I got it. Heres the thing that doesn't stop me from playing, the community. When your in a server it's not like dayz (for the most part) you dont just walk into the towns and then get shot right after. Most times when I met a person on a server, it would end peacefully, I would have either diecided to join them for a bit, or just traded some supplies then go seperate ways. Yes like all survival games there are KOS'ers but unless you're on a server with 2 clans in the middle of a war, there aren't many times where I can recall getting killed on sight. If theres one thing I would like to see be fix or improve, is the base building. I know they stated this in the 'State of the Game' Announcement, but I would like to see it improve, especially with how many storage crates a land plot can hold.			"

								From the get go you are spawned into the world and immediately you feel the immersion, the world is beautiful and alive and the sound effects; from the wind, the rain (especially), to leaves rustling as you move through bushes, to footsteps on the pavement/floorboards etc - It really makes you activly listen to your surroundings so you are aware of potential dangers. It doesnt take very long before you are setup with items, upgrades and weapons and are a force to be reckoned with, you just have to apply yourself in the hunt.The only downsides that I faced were that it's stupidly easy to get raided by anyone, there needs to be early, mid and end game building tiers. Also inventory bugs where some items would disappear overnight or even after a simple relog.The game is definitly worth checking out, it's heaps of fun and has a lot of potential!			"

								First of all I would like to say I know the game is in early access,my point being that you can't find a axe or something to chop wood because you need to have a base to stash your stuff.Running around from towns to cities the whole time to servive is great but you can only carry so much in a backpack,so you leave items behind because you don't have a base.the idea of farming for car parts to get the thing going is great.the problem being you will find a vehicle of some sort start farming the parts and on your return another player already took the vehicle because he had the parts for it.My suggestion is that you must be able to lock or claim this vehicle for a certain period.So for a lone wolf like myself i find the game  boring but Challenging.

Top game this is i'll tell you.At the time of writing this review I may not have as many hours as you could possibly want me to, but even as a beginner Miscreated has given me some of the best experiences playing games that I could ever get.Once you log onto a server you are spawned into nowhere, only with clothes and nothing else. You will have no idea where you are, and with no map you will have to use the roadsigns to guide your way into towns/cities. But during that journey, you'll have to loot. Going in different houses, picking up gear from locations etc. Takes some time to do on your own (especially if a beginner) so try to pair up with somebody you trust and go ahead with finding loot. Once you get the hang of that, you'll hopefully have a gun, ammo, food and clothes. Even a ride if you get lucky.While looting you'll come accross zombies and all, and these can be difficult to deal with especially if you don't have any gear on you. Now, once you get your loot the best part of this game comes.PVP.You're going to be doing it whether you like it or not, and while your at it your heart is going to be racing incredibly fast. The thought of losing everything and having to start again will scare you, but you must overcome it.Even after the fights are over, your adrenaline will still be there and you'll love it.While I'm not going to compare it to other titles (as that's not neccesarily a good thing to do anyway), you'll come to find that the developers actually listen to their players and very often hand out updates and communicate with us. Also, this is a game that can give you one of the best experiences you will ever get from a game. "

								I am writing a review for this game, because I feel the 'mixed' rating it has does not do it justice.I'll start by saying, a long time ago I played the Day Z mod for Arma II and enjoyed that.    I have never played the stand alone version of Day Z as people warned me off buying that due to nothing being updated in it, and it taking a turn for the worse or being somewhat broken.This game, while still in Alpha as I write this, is giving me those addictive nostalgic feelings from when Day Z was actually good, plus it has more stuff in it (base building/crafting).The developers actually seem to care about this, and release regular updates/fixes.    It looks to be going in a really good direction.TLDR:  If you enjoyed Arma II Day Z mod, you'll love this to bits.			"

								I could be wrong but I think most of the negative reviews are from when the game was first released. I can't comment on these as I only bought the game about 3 weeks ago and have roughly 30 hours in game. I really like this game and have had alot of fun playing it. Having played Dayz Standalone, Rust, H!Z! and just about every other zombie apocolypse / survivial game out there I can honestly say this is my favourite and the one I would recommend to others to get into the genre. This game really stands apart from others, it looks beautiful, has alot of features already in the game and has so much potential. Add to that an active Dev team with regular updates / announcements / telling us what the plan is and you have a very solid early access game. Zombies , PvP, PvE, Basbuilding, Crafting and more to come, I would definately recommend this game.			"

								This game is absolutely great. I have 300 hours on h1z1 and 400 on DayZ. This game is much more playable then either one. If you're looking for a zombie survival game. This is it. The loot is pretty balanced but it could be a little harder But it's not that bad. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. Things are overgrown. And it really feels like apocalypse. The performance is great and the graphics are absolutely beautiful everything is really screenshot worthy. The only con is it is a Early access game. Which means bugs and incomplete features. But honestly. With that being Said it us very playable. Lastly, the community. Its great. You'll find some people who want to just shoot you really depends where you are(Airfield and Pinecrest are not great social places lol). But a lot of people are really friendly and trying to help. I strongly recommend this over any other EA zombie survival game.			"

								So after only 18 hours of play time (since yesterday), I've been loving this game, and if it keeps to evolve and grow, it's going to undoubtably be one of the best survival games out there, yes storage needs to be implemented and more than perhaps a few things need work, but how the game is right now, it can and hopefully will only get better. Keep up the great work devs, can't wait for the new update.A happy survivor :)			"

								Got to say, at first I didnt like the game too much, but that was because there wasnt a lot of people playing and I had no friends GAME play with. But then I decided to play the game again and try make some friends and now I have to say, THIS IS MY FAVOURITE GAME! I have been in the most insane pvp, blow up car, made a molotov, found a tent, made a base, etc.. THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND I GUARANTEE ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY! After you start knowing your way around the map the game gets even better, easy to find your friends and you will learn where is the best loot! Its similar to dayz, but i got say its better and more survival type game.JOGO EH IRADO DEMAIS, MUITA COISA PRA FAZER, MUITA EMO√á√ÉO e MUITO PVP. COMPREM ESSE JOGO TA DE GRA√áA quase!!! "

								Do not ever let your guard down, shoot first and ask questions later. why? because that is what everyone else does.Do not hesitate, you will be killed on sight.Not everyone is like that sure, but most are.I learned this lesson when i was just sitting at a campsight in this game while carrying 4 pistols, 1 shotgun, 1 crossbow, 2 smoke grenades, 3 sets of chemlights, food and water to last a couple of hours, a hachet and a load of protective gear that i took around 2 to 3 hours to get and was shot while just sitting doing nothing but waiting for the sun to rise again.Apart from players being hostile most of the time the game is actually good and the crafting can maybe be a lil bit tedious if you are on your own but once you start playing it is hard to stop and even if you do stop, you will eventually get back on it.

								Miscreated is admittedly not going to be for everyone, but if you're a fan of the survival genre I would recommend picking it up. Especially if you're a Dayz fan and trying to painfully tredge through the current state of the standalone game, Miscreated is a real throwback to the old days when the Dayz mod first surfaced and really kicked off the survival genre. It's actually quite similar in very many ways, and forgoes all the flair and over complexity that you see in all these other survival games coming out and brings everything back to it's roots without levels, stats, and a craft focus (though it does have some minimal crafting elements), At the same time, it learns from Dayz and incorporates some minimalistic things people wanted during that time, such as base building, heavier populated map (although smaller), mix & match clothes wear, and overall better terrain and scenary.. not to mention caves!Of course, it's not the end all either. Like any other game, it's got skeletons in the closet that must be addressed as well. That being said, any of this is likely subject to change or being fixed, so take it with an open mind and a grain of salt.. they're just things to keep in mind when you're considering hitting that purchase button... This is just how the game is presented in it's current state. Despite this review being positive, it's actually the negatives that I want to cover here below because, honestly, all the good stuff I feel you should see for yourself and it comes through playing the game.Firstly, although there is currently basebuilding, it's not very intuitive in the least. Theres no option for a snap function that allows you to line up pieces easily, so you're sort of stuck jimmying it around until it ""looks good enough"". Now, I'm not saying you cannot lay out a really extravant build.. I've seen some insane builds on there that of just made me have to stop and say ""how"", but for those who may not have the time or patience for taking all that time to line up that wall perfectly might find themselves becoming agitated when their base ends up not coming together right. I'm all for having the option to freely place base pieces... I love that you can, but a snap function would be nice, just saying. Bases are also currently marked and protected by land plot signs that MUST be placed on terrain. That's fine and all.... except, the problem here lies in the fact that the sign CANNOT be destroyed unless all existing pieces of the base are destroyed first. ""So what?""... yeah, I get it, you aren't out to destroy their entire base or take it from them, neither am I honestly.. just want some of that mad loot am I right? See, the problem there is that the game has no structural integrity for building. What this means is that people can create buildings that are floating off the ground, rendering them inaccessible by NORMAL means and theres nothing you can do about it since the area is claimed and protected and you can't build. There are ways to get to a floating base depending on how it's build and if you have access to the right things, but my point is that people shouldn't have to go through having to boost their way up in the first place!Secondly, storage..... I'll just come out and say it, most people hate how it's currently handled. You're limited to a single 10 slot box, and a single 20 slot box of BUILDABLE storage for your base. This is going to net you a total of 30 slots, mind you... you have to find the guide/blue print before you can even build the 20 slot box. Alternatively, you also have the option of storing items into tents of various sizes, and in vehicles as well... all of which the savy base builder will make accomodations for having available space in their base for. I get what the developers are going for here, and they've said it themselves. They don't want people hoarding items away and then never having to do anything about going out to get them, and yeah... I understand that, but still I think limiting it to just 30 slots buildable is just a little overdoing it, I'd at LEAST like to see about 50, or even just give people the option of building two of each box. You also may not store, and can only carry one single back pack at a time...which is on your back, that's it. Yes... even empty backpacks. Thirdly, and relatively short. Headshots are a little.... ""hit and miss"" at the moment. It's a widely known issue, but for some reason there exists a problem where headshots will not always one hit kill people, and other times it will. See the issue with that is that it is in fact NOT a feature. Headshots are supposed to be one hit kills, but for some reason doesn't always work out that way currently. If you should ever have a moment where this happens, don't be surprised, it's happens very commonly and for everyone. To my knowledge I do believe that they still take damage nevertheless, so.. I suppose it's better than nothing. Overall, I'd say it's worth the pick up, especially if you can get it in a sale. It does some things right, it does others wrong.. you be the judge of what you like, what you hate, and what you're willing to tollerate. If you want Dayz the way it should of been though, yeah, this is probably it if the developers take it in the right direction. Pros:+ Good, cleanly running graphics & FPS+ Beautiful map with many locations, buildings, and dense shrub and forest as well as caves+ Ammunition is found in random, oftenly low amounts with guns and around the map (no more 1 gun warrior pick ups) + May only carry 2 primary weapons (no one man armies either, and makes you consider your options when raiding)+ May carry as many secondary weapons as your weight allows it+ Base Building+ Vehicles with easy parts&repair system+ Clothes variety (with your inventory slots dependant on the clothes you are wearing) + No freaking annoying sprint stamina!+ Jumping stamina! (limited bunny hopping)+ No overcomplicated systems and RPG wannabe elements (just you, your gun, and your base..and maybe that guy you have handcuffed in the corner)+/- Weapon attachments (This one is a tricky one because they're JUST starting to mess with this, and the only current attachments are flashlights for some primary weapons and a scope for the M40 sniper) Cons:+ Weird audio issues (things don't always sound like they're coming from where they should be, footsteps lag so you might mistake your own self for being someone else and become paranoid, sometimes explosions and gunshots are completely silent)+ Weight limit (I know.. realism, but honestly really all it does is make base building a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•+ Base building is unintuitive+ Craft menu browsing is unintuitive+ Crafting is.... SUPER unintuitive (you can only craft one single thing at a time, no queue, must remain in crafting menu,  and you must click the craft button for every single object you craft) + Low buildable storage amount+ Abusable floating base building+ May only carry one back pack on you (only the one on your back), and cannot store them in storage+ Buggy headshots (headshots do not always one hit kill)			"

								For an alpha game it seems quite basic, however I have only just started playing this a couple days ago and I must say the weather effects in this game are absolutely brilliant. This game gives you the rust / day z feel even though it is in early stages and at times it gives me the jumps when it becomes foggy and you bump into someone in a dark house.The houses in this game are really unique in my opinion as they are all different and offer some diversity but what I'd like to see improved on would be the houses itself. Often in houses you see the odd bordered up window and doors but why not allow the players to fortify some structures and households? Nails, wood, hammer, etc and bam bingo you could close the curtains, border up broken doors / windows and essentially live there as a temp base. So far in the survival games out there I have not seen many that allow a feature like this and it is something I would greatly welcome.Also what I have noticed though while playing is the lack of mutants, I only seem to come accross one or two and as your typical survivor game it is running simulator all over again along with a lot of kill on sight players.With that being said, there are quite a lot of cars you can find so transport is not an issue, but you may be spending an hour to find the parts to get it running. (Or I am a noob and don't know the obvious places.) If I was to rate this game would give it a 6.5 or 7/10 for now as there is a lot of work to do but bearing in mind it is still in alpha.			"

								Its a  great game if you like exploring and searching for equipment , guns and provisions . Also good if you like co-op with other players to do raids or scavenging ( highlight of the game ) . Fighting mutants can be scary too if you're not careful .Remember to use caps lock to communicate , since everyone can see your dialogue in any server. A friendly reminder , this game is uneventful most of the time , unless you get to Brightmoor ( @SSH0LES camp there for the military gear , so it's a contested area) or Woodhaven ( sometimes there're a few players there ).So if you're the kind of gamer who hates all that walking and driving around , don't bother getting it. For those who are hesitating on whether to get this game , go youtube and watch some gameplay to form your own opinion.			"

Some gamma settings and disabling the dynamic lighting effects - transition effect - would be good. Granted, these issues are only localized to me, but still would be nice.A side from that, fun game and I will definitely check it out again, later on.

								I was a little skeptical at first being that it looks closely like a dayz copy cat, however personally I think it is way better. That maybe just because I prefer the layout better but so far I love this game! There are bugs of course which make it annoying at times but I know its a work in progress. Devs please continue to make this game. Things I would look forward to:Less crashes. Its a bit annoying when you get a group of guys together and have a ton of loot but the game crashes and you forget what server you were in.Favorite server list: This would be an awesome feature so you can quickly join a server where your most equipped charcters are located. Friends list: I have met a ton of nice guys on here and would love a feature to add certain players (specific to certain servers) that I could see if they're online.Final thoughts: This game is awesome. If you are debating to buy it or not, go ahead and pull the trigger. You won't regret it! If you do, consider reviewing the game so the devs can hear from the users on their experience.			"

								Only about 4.5 hours into the game and ive had fun from the begining.  It's alpha so a few small things here and here but an enjoyable experience.  Tough to find friends and favorite servers right now, which im SURE will change.  I see people complain about weapons and ammo being hard to find but that gives you more incentive to team up and not just shoot random people.  Ive barely broken the surface and i would definitley recomend the game.  You can kidanap people with duct tape, there are vehicles if you want to put them together (but running the map isnt TOO bad), and there are even tornados that can suck you up, what else could you want?   Its a cool game and I look forward to the new updates and changes!			"

								Miscreated is a promising survival fps with crafting & base building. At the time of making this review the game is very well optimized with impressive dynamic shadows and a large but somewhat barren landscape. Mutants & other players pose as the main threat although mutants are very rarely spotted, much like the zombies in DayZ. Exploration feels refreshing at first. You can enter every single building in the game world and loot melts in very well with the environment. I found it much easier to find them using my flashlight since all the small items on the floor and on shelves would cast shadows. It‚Äôs a small game mechanic that really gives it a lot of atmosphere. It does feel like it becomes somewhat repetitive after a while though. It‚Äôs very time consuming to keep scouring every corner of a building in the hopes of finding some elusive ammunition and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a lot of items in the game yet so there‚Äôs a lot of the same o‚Äô same o‚Äô. The sound is the games large downfall in my opinion. It‚Äôs awful.  The sound of gunshots does not have any dynamic. Even if you‚Äôre in an open field and fire a revolver there‚Äôs no echo. It sounds as if you‚Äôre firing it in a soundproof booth and it kind of just cuts off before the sound played through properly. Some effects sound very loud as if the source of the sound is very close to you although it could be a block away. The sound of footsteps sometimes repeat, making it sound as if there‚Äôs somebody else in the same building as you. Very annoying. I do however understand that this is an early access title and that these are all issues that will probably be fixed eventually. It‚Äôs a good game for what it is & I am sure it will eventually be a very good survival game. Worth the price right now? I would probably wait but keep a close eye on it. Buy it at a discount. If you love survival games but you‚Äôre tired of DayZ I‚Äôd give this one a go.			"

								I will not lie, i hated this game to start with. BUT, after a few hours and getting the swing of things this game is incredible! I know its in alpha but im already addicted to this, looks good, plays well and i love the idea of building a base and fixing a vehicle to get around, i do think the zombie part of it needs improved but apart from that these guys have a survival game spot on! I have never supported a game to make sure it devolops well but i will defo be supporting these guys! WELL worth the buy and if you havent played a survival game this will be the perfect one for you!			"

								For an alpha game it seems quite basic, however I have only just started playing this a couple days ago and I must say the weather effects in this game are absolutely brilliant. This game gives you the rust / day z feel even though it is in early stages and at times it gives me the jumps when it becomes foggy and you bump into someone in a dark house.The houses in this game are really unique in my opinion as they are all different and offer some diversity but what I'd like to see improved on would be the houses itself. Often in houses you see the odd bordered up window and doors but why not allow the players to fortify some structures and households? Nails, wood, hammer, etc and bam bingo you could close the curtains, border up broken doors / windows and essentially live there as a temp base. So far in the survival games out there I have not seen many that allow a feature like this and it is something I would greatly welcome.Also what I have noticed though while playing is the lack of mutants, I only seem to come accross one or two and as your typical survivor game it is running simulator all over again along with a lot of kill on sight players.With that being said, there are quite a lot of cars you can find so transport is not an issue, but you may be spending an hour to find the parts to get it running. (Or I am a noob and don't know the obvious places.) If I was to rate this game would give it a 6.5 or 7/10 for now as there is a lot of work to do but bearing in mind it is still in alpha.			"

								So, I noticed this game had a couple of updates since I last saw it. As a result I decided to give it a shot after all this time since launch. ProsAtmosphereEnviromentWeatherGunplayRarity of Guns & AmmoPrice Point ($20)ConsLimited MapLack of ContentVehicle IssuesCrashing somewhat frequentVarious BugsMisleading Steam PageThe game is indeed fun. I have enjoyed my time with it so far and will probably continue playing it, but all in all the game is a two year old Alpha early access title. It's still has numerous bugs and crashing issues. A seriously lack of content for how much development time it has had. Despite that, If you enjoy the survival genre, this game is probably worth picking up and seeing what you can get out of it. For $20, you have a decent chance of getting your money's worth out of it and I am sure they will continue to add content to the game even if it is at a painfully slow pace. On the other hand, if money is tight around your household I would recommend holding off on this title and save your money or invest into into a more complete title, such as DayZ if you're looking for a more hardcore experience or Shattered Skies/H1Z1 for a more shoot em up gameplay style.

								Game is good, could be great. One of the best things you can do in the game is get a vehicle that is until your game crashes you log back in and it runs you over.-Black screens-Game crashes-Okay at best building/crafting system(takes to long and is unrewarding as far as building goes in my oppinion) -Vehicle inventory stops working and does not allow you to use it.-Impractical vehicles bus gets stuck way to easily and can not climb most of the roads in the game.-The quad will kill you at some point very buggy vehicle can take damage just standing near it.-Feel like most vehicles can use a speed increase.  Takes 10x longer to build a base then break into one.Nothing is ever 100% safe when your offline.Adding more content would always be amazing but these bugs are frustrating and almost game breaking I would deal with that asap! -If  increase mapsize increase player count as well if the servers are not full game already feels very empty.

At first I was going to kill them however I stopped because one of them was singing. I enjoyed their comany. Now we play together from time to time however this game is a solo one. You will have to trust only yourself. You cannot allow yourself to think everyone is friendly. If you find a gun be prepared to use it on the next person you see. I don't care if they shout friendly or not you shoot to kill. Ive taken screenshots of everyone ive ever killed and have a gallery of 30+ dead. Don't be my next victim.

								So, it's quite fun until you get shot out of no where and die or find a car and spend soooo much time getting parts for it just to get in and be glitched to death. Besides a couple bugs and upsets, like climbing ladders, trading clothing and guns on dead bodies, the way loading weapons work, not being able to put primary weapons in your inventory, not being able to take something from a dead body while your teammate is looting the same body as well, THE STUPID FALL DAMAGE IN ONLY CERTAIN AREAS!, etc....Other than these, that I'm sure you will experience, it's pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fun. What I would like to see;More ways to capture people besides tying them up, like being able to chain them to you and make them follow you or being able to chain them to a pole. More ammo spawns! The weapons spawn just enough, but the lack of bullets suckkkkk, it ends up making people need to kill others more just to loot their ammo. Which kinda sucks because then you are always on high alert. Which I guess for some people is the best part, just the constant pvp, yanno :PI'd like the rarity of cars to become a bit more common... Finding parts for cars happens almost every other building or house you explore, but finding an actual drivable car comes almost never, unless someone is trying to run you over. More types of weapons, like brass knuckles or a whip lolLastly, CAMOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want a pretty shotgun to shoot a loser in the face with, not a dull lame‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•common skin. Screw that. come on!!!!!! pleaseeeeeeeeeAlright, that's it buh bye			"

								Do I think this game is complete? No. Do I think it needs work? Yeah, probably. But the main thing that sticks out about this game is that it actually gets updated. As of right now I only have a few problems with it, and the main problem is mutants. I just want a zombie survival game that has huge hordes, something to actually be scared of. Another minor problem to me which doesn't really affect gameplay is the look of the inventory and the main menu. It looks pretty generic right now, but it works. If they fix those 2 things, this will definitely be the best zombie/mutant survival game on Steam.			"

								Pretty cool survival game, definitely worth the money I paid for it, so far, but I for the life of me can't see much in the game. The lighting effects, though beautiful, hurt my eyes and make it extremely dificult for basic navigation. Some gamma settings and disabling the dynamic lighting effects - transition effect - would be good. Granted, these issues are only localized to me, but still would be nice.A side from that, fun game and I will definitely check it out again, later on. Hopefully be able to find a fix to the lighting issues.			"

								I was a little skeptical at first being that it looks closely like a dayz copy cat, however personally I think it is way better. That maybe just because I prefer the layout better but so far I love this game! There are bugs of course which make it annoying at times but I know its a work in progress. Devs please continue to make this game. Things I would look forward to:Less crashes. Its a bit annoying when you get a group of guys together and have a ton of loot but the game crashes and you forget what server you were in.Favorite server list: This would be an awesome feature so you can quickly join a server where your most equipped charcters are located. Friends list: I have met a ton of nice guys on here and would love a feature to add certain players (specific to certain servers) that I could see if they're online.Final thoughts: This game is awesome. If you are debating to buy it or not, go ahead and pull the trigger. You won't regret it! If you do, consider reviewing the game so the devs can hear from the users on their experience.			"

								Only about 4.5 hours into the game and ive had fun from the begining.  It's alpha so a few small things here and here but an enjoyable experience.  Tough to find friends and favorite servers right now, which im SURE will change.  I see people complain about weapons and ammo being hard to find but that gives you more incentive to team up and not just shoot random people.  Ive barely broken the surface and i would definitley recomend the game.  You can kidanap people with duct tape, there are vehicles if you want to put them together (but running the map isnt TOO bad), and there are even tornados that can suck you up, what else could you want?   Its a cool game and I look forward to the new updates and changes!			"

								Do not ever let your guard down, shoot first and ask questions later. why? because that is what everyone else does.Do not hesitate, you will be killed on sight.Not everyone is like that sure, but most are.I learned this lesson when i was just sitting at a campsight in this game while carrying 4 pistols, 1 shotgun, 1 crossbow, 2 smoke grenades, 3 sets of chemlights, food and water to last a couple of hours, a hachet and a load of protective gear that i took around 2 to 3 hours to get and was shot while just sitting doing nothing but waiting for the sun to rise again.Apart from players being hostile most of the time the game is actually good and the crafting can maybe be a lil bit tedious if you are on your own but once you start playing it is hard to stop and even if you do stop, you will eventually get back on it.

								The best post-apocalyptic survival game on Steam at the moment. Better than DayZ in every inch. Developers care about it's development process and release updates at sequential pace (and it doesn't mean it contains only 1 item per patch). Due to their small team, sometimes something goes wrong, but they don't give up and work as hard as possible to keep the game playable. I can recommend Miscreated to everyone who is searching a very enjoyable and promising game but you need to have some experience in survival games because I don't want to kill you by accident when you will be walking along the road. :D			"

								Early Access Alpha Review: I've played many survival games, so for those who are veterans to the genre you will already feel like you know the game. The devs have done a good job paying attention to detail, the world is immersive and most buildings and houses have the ability to scour through them for loot. This game has the feel of a little of H1Z1 and DayZ combined together, just to give you an idea of what to expect.I find the community in this game to be a lot better than the usual KOS type that comes with most survival games. Many people will communicate, even if they plan to kill you. In my opinion having a little RP or dialogue goes a long way with these games and you will find more often than not people are willing to help or at least chat a bit before you get shot in the head.The cost is very good, I got it on sale for $10. For an EA you can't beat that price and you get more content than what is still yet to even come in other titles like DayZ standalone. I usually steer clear of early access titles but I saw how much the devs work on the game and are transparent with updates as well as having very positive reviews from others. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of survival games at a fair price.It's a mostly PVP focused game but there are some infected mutants to give you PVE. The infected which are like your undead zombies are at random around the map. The AI is a bit wonky with them but it's not terrible and there are even special ones that do more damage or are quite large behemoths that take a lot of ammo to take down. You won't find any huge hoards (yet) but you also have animals like wolves to be a threat to your survival as well.Vehicles are a bit buggy at times, they can get stuck on the random object or bounce around quite a bit, but still aren't terrible. Weapons are pretty easy to acquire but ammo isn't, so conserving your shots for key opportunities are critical. There are cool survival items like the walkie talkie which allows you to communicate with other survivors who also have one handy. There are just a lot of immersion adding elements, even the ambient sound is a scary at times. I would say the gun firing sounds need some improvement but they aren't horrible either.Overall the game is pretty well done for an alpha and I'm excited to see what comes down the pipe during further development. I wouldn't hestitate to buy now, especially if it's on sale.TL;DR - If you like survival horror, you want PVP, immersion, base building, good graphics that don't hog your system and a cool world than look no further. Miscreated has a lot of what other titles like DayZ still haven't even provided years into development.			"

Early Access Review
								Hello, I am Steven and I have played 33.3 Hrs on record. I must say that in the beginning the game was pretty bad and had a lot to catch up on. Because a lot of other zombie survivals were already alot ahead, this game was essentially thrown under the bus. People tend to not read as well because it says PRE-ALPHA yet they still rate it bad because they expect a full game, when it is clearly stated on Steam AND startup. This game has developed in a short time, but is already ahead most other zombie survivals. It has good mechanics for walking, running, looting, good inventory setup, UI is good, however they could add an auto-run feature because after awhile your pinky finger tends to start to hurt, but other than that basic mechanics are good. The player-base is pretty friendly and not everyone is a KOS, I actually have made a few friends with people who were completely looted to the teeth and did not KOS me on sight. The game is absolutly beautiful for being a newer survival game (Thank you Cry-Engine). I was actually stunned how good the game was when it first came out, and even more things have made it stand out. There are signs posted around the map to really help find your positioning, literally... every town has at least 4 signs describing your location.. or just blatantly stating it. Overall I think it is worth the buy because unlike other survivals this game is heading up-hill at a fast, yet precise rate. The devs always are in contact with the player-base and they always have hotfixes if there are any problems with a new update that was release and had issues. Please, if you are interested at all in buying this game (Which not to mention I have found no hackers / scripters, ect. to be in) at all please take the time to read the NEWEST feedback on the game. Plus your contribution to buying the game will help the Devs create even more fun things to do in future releases. Hope this helps, happy playing! :)			"

I very much look forward to them adding more and more to the game in the future!			"

								Great game certainly one of the better survival games out there that is definitely a much better choice over games like H1Z1 & in my opinion DayZ this game is currently in early access but it is NOT clunky the combat runs smooth just like the rest of the game ive had no issues this far and the world and atmosphere of this game is just phenomenal. It is an underrated game i myself passed up a few times because of the older mixed reviews it got but since the last few updates this game has improved tremendously and is steadily improving. Of course there are always going to be those people in the review section going ""This game sucks i cant even load on any of the servers omg"" but thats to be expected with early access games and especially expected with noobs playing on potatoes. This is a good game as is and has only been improving since the past updates			"

								I have played Rust and DayZ, which are similiar to this, and I have to say; this is by far my favourite survival game yet. It has plentiful loot, a playerbase that doesnt have a KOS attitude towards other players, and the mutants are not very strong or plentiful, but they still pose a threat when starting up a new life. The fact that this gave is only $9.99 even gives more of a reason to buy it. So go buy this game, like now.			"

								Game is already awesome! And also very promising (OC it takes time to get somewhat near perfection).- PvP is awesome: You can form groups and hunt other players to loot for weapons, bullets and resources.- Sensation of fear! You probably won't care too much about dying if you have nothing to lose, but when you do, you surely will think twice (or a dozen times) before turning each corner.- Survival for the smartest! As a post apocalyptic world, battle for resources are unavoidable! And I'd say that having the best gun handed is not always the key to survive (nor to kill)! You have to have a brain (a good one)! You have be aware of the sounds. You have to watch all the area arround. You have to hide in shadows, and wait to strike at the right time! That's the key to survive!Well, I would point a lot of things that I like (and that I liked even more after the twitch stream), but opinions are unique.I'm aware that what please me, do not please others.- Mutants (and other AI) glitching, and with nothing to loot.- Items disapearing.- Not much craft variety (that goes for structures/resources/weapons)- other stuffAnyway. Those above were promised to be fixed sometime in the future... It's a relief for me, and I believe the Dev guys.I know it might take them some time to get all that stuff ready. But they can't get too lazy :vI think they should also work on things to do in long time play (and since the map has large areas full of nothing...).			"

								Miscreated is admittedly not going to be for everyone, but if you're a fan of the survival genre I would recommend picking it up. Especially if you're a Dayz fan and trying to painfully tredge through the current state of the standalone game, Miscreated is a real throwback to the old days when the Dayz mod first surfaced and really kicked off the survival genre. It's actually quite similar in very many ways, and forgoes all the flair and over complexity that you see in all these other survival games coming out and brings everything back to it's roots without levels, stats, and a craft focus (though it does have some minimal crafting elements), At the same time, it learns from Dayz and incorporates some minimalistic things people wanted during that time, such as base building, heavier populated map (although smaller), mix & match clothes wear, and overall better terrain and scenary.. not to mention caves!Of course, it's not the end all either. Like any other game, it's got skeletons in the closet that must be addressed as well. That being said, any of this is likely subject to change or being fixed, so take it with an open mind and a grain of salt.. they're just things to keep in mind when you're considering hitting that purchase button... This is just how the game is presented in it's current state. Despite this review being positive, it's actually the negatives that I want to cover here below because, honestly, all the good stuff I feel you should see for yourself and it comes through playing the game.Firstly, although there is currently basebuilding, it's not very intuitive in the least. Theres no option for a snap function that allows you to line up pieces easily, so you're sort of stuck jimmying it around until it ""looks good enough"". Now, I'm not saying you cannot lay out a really extravant build.. I've seen some insane builds on there that of just made me have to stop and say ""how"", but for those who may not have the time or patience for taking all that time to line up that wall perfectly might find themselves becoming agitated when their base ends up not coming together right. I'm all for having the option to freely place base pieces... I love that you can, but a snap function would be nice, just saying. Bases are also currently marked and protected by land plot signs that MUST be placed on terrain. That's fine and all.... except, the problem here lies in the fact that the sign CANNOT be destroyed unless all existing pieces of the base are destroyed first. ""So what?""... yeah, I get it, you aren't out to destroy their entire base or take it from them, neither am I honestly.. just want some of that mad loot am I right? See, the problem there is that the game has no structural integrity for building. What this means is that people can create buildings that are floating off the ground, rendering them inaccessible by NORMAL means and theres nothing you can do about it since the area is claimed and protected and you can't build. There are ways to get to a floating base depending on how it's build and if you have access to the right things, but my point is that people shouldn't have to go through having to boost their way up in the first place!Secondly, storage..... I'll just come out and say it, most people hate how it's currently handled. You're limited to a single 10 slot box, and a single 20 slot box of BUILDABLE storage for your base. This is going to net you a total of 30 slots, mind you... you have to find the guide/blue print before you can even build the 20 slot box. Alternatively, you also have the option of storing items into tents of various sizes, and in vehicles as well... all of which the savy base builder will make accomodations for having available space in their base for. I get what the developers are going for here, and they've said it themselves. They don't want people hoarding items away and then never having to do anything about going out to get them, and yeah... I understand that, but still I think limiting it to just 30 slots buildable is just a little overdoing it, I'd at LEAST like to see about 50, or even just give people the option of building two of each box. You also may not store, and can only carry one single back pack at a time...which is on your back, that's it. Yes... even empty backpacks. Thirdly, and relatively short. Headshots are a little.... ""hit and miss"" at the moment. It's a widely known issue, but for some reason there exists a problem where headshots will not always one hit kill people, and other times it will. See the issue with that is that it is in fact NOT a feature. Headshots are supposed to be one hit kills, but for some reason doesn't always work out that way currently. If you should ever have a moment where this happens, don't be surprised, it's happens very commonly and for everyone. To my knowledge I do believe that they still take damage nevertheless, so.. I suppose it's better than nothing. Overall, I'd say it's worth the pick up, especially if you can get it in a sale. It does some things right, it does others wrong.. you be the judge of what you like, what you hate, and what you're willing to tollerate. If you want Dayz the way it should of been though, yeah, this is probably it if the developers take it in the right direction. Pros:+ Good, cleanly running graphics & FPS+ Beautiful map with many locations, buildings, and dense shrub and forest as well as caves+ Ammunition is found in random, oftenly low amounts with guns and around the map (no more 1 gun warrior pick ups) + May only carry 2 primary weapons (no one man armies either, and makes you consider your options when raiding)+ May carry as many secondary weapons as your weight allows it+ Base Building+ Vehicles with easy parts&repair system+ Clothes variety (with your inventory slots dependant on the clothes you are wearing) + No freaking annoying sprint stamina!+ Jumping stamina! (limited bunny hopping)+ No overcomplicated systems and RPG wannabe elements (just you, your gun, and your base..and maybe that guy you have handcuffed in the corner)+/- Weapon attachments (This one is a tricky one because they're JUST starting to mess with this, and the only current attachments are flashlights for some primary weapons and a scope for the M40 sniper) Cons:+ Weird audio issues (things don't always sound like they're coming from where they should be, footsteps lag so you might mistake your own self for being someone else and become paranoid, sometimes explosions and gunshots are completely silent)+ Weight limit (I know.. realism, but honestly really all it does is make base building a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•+ Base building is unintuitive+ Craft menu browsing is unintuitive+ Crafting is.... SUPER unintuitive (you can only craft one single thing at a time, no queue, must remain in crafting menu,  and you must click the craft button for every single object you craft) + Low buildable storage amount+ Abusable floating base building+ May only carry one back pack on you (only the one on your back), and cannot store them in storage+ Buggy headshots (headshots do not always one hit kill)			"

								Although the game itself needs work, including: PvP, looting, mutants, and area accessibility - the devs clearly care about the game and its players. I've only personally played 4 hours, but I have had fun every second. There is a future for the game, and by purchasing you're supporting the devs - and basically the future of a very great game. "

My Miscreated ReviewOne of my 3 favorite games. The game does have lots of bugs, but with every con, their is a pro. Pros:   Fun co-op  Friendly community  Easy to learn  Intense action  Cons  Has a few bugs, mainly with Mutants  Has only 36 player slot on servers current  You can get stuck on things often   Sometimes ammo will be gone after logging on Things I want added to Miscreated  Be able to prone  Combine ammo clips *For example, I have 5 bullets in one clip and 5 in the other, I would be able to combine them  Better optimization (Not bad, but also not the best)  Higher spawns  More slots to servers  More variety of scoped/long range weapons Should you buy it? If you like survival games like H1Z1, DayZ, or Rust, this is a game that you are going to really like. When I bought the game there was an average of about 250 people on, and around 100 on during night time/early morning hours. Now I have seen it at an average of 600-700 people! The game is really growing after Patch #35 which added a ""Weather System"" and a sneak peak of the new town. Currently the new town is just being called ""Downtown"" which includes a skyscraper and many houses, gas stations, and even a new police station. I am looking forward to the new town release, and I am sure if you buy this game, that you will be excited as well. I really love this game and I think you should give it a try, considering that it is only $20, and goes on sale quite often.       Happy Surviving!             - Zunomic "

								So the other 2 current Jumping Juggalos were looting the derby because I got DC'd along the road, when I got there they kept telling me they saw 2 guys in the road. I got to them; we stood beside eachother and watched this guy stalk along the road until we realised his shotgun was pinned on us. His friend had flanked us and had pointed his 9mm at my head before proceeding to execute me, but, I was the only guy those two could see. Through a bit of hectic talking my friend shoots him in the face with his rifle as he loots my body, then the other with a shotgun begins a buckshot longrange firefight with one of us which gets shut down by the wastelander rifle.I spawn beside my executor and talk to him for a bit, then, mid conversation DC again.10/10 would DC again.

								I recomend this game and here's why:I bought this game in the sale for ¬£7.50 roughly and even at the full price it would have been worth it. I can imagine this game may be quite boring eventually on your own but with friends this game is a blast! I haven't had this much fun on a game in ages! Sure the game is Eary access... and what? I bought this game because I remember it used to have bad reviews but now it's mostly positive which gave me hope, and this means the Dev is trying to actually improve the game instead of abandoning it.The only problems with this game are that you cant loot a container while another player (even your friends) are next to you. Also that you can only get one container per base, but don't let that put you off this brilliant game, there are ways around this. For instance; Getting a tent for storage, using cars for storage etc...I love this game and I know the devs are going to improve it as much as possible. I give this a thumbs up because it's the best zombie survival out there just now! :) go grab it!			"

								I think a necessity for this type of genre, the Zombie Post-Apocalyptic Survival Game, is to remain in eternal Alpha stage. But nevertheless, this game so far is really cool. I'm an old school Day Z Mod player and this brings me back; same adrenaline rush, same frenzy, same oppression. Whereas Day Z StandAlone has failed us, this has some major strengths and seems to be shaping up nicely. I'm really enjoying it thus far as it soothes the itch of the need for this type of game after playing Day Z mod. I've played War Z and a few others, but this is the best so far.			"

I really love this game and I think you should give it a try, considering that it is only $20, and goes on sale quite often.       Happy Surviving!             - Zunomic "

								Great game i love the developers that just keep making this game better and better graphics are amazing... ive read the negative reviews and i dont understand what version of this game they are playing because the lag isnt bad. The only lag comes from servers wich if someone actually payed for a good server there wouldnt be any issue with the d sync. YOU SHOULD BUY IT.			"

								This game, unlike many other survival online games gets updates, and runs really well. Good graphics, already feels more developed than rust or dayz. I wasn't going to get it, gave it a shot and I don't regret it one bit :) (Also, I am using a gtx 950, fx-6300 and 8 gigs of ram and I am running the game at max with no stuttering, so don't worry about the reccomended specs.

								So I have a little time played on MIscreated.The weather effects make this game extremely unique. One moment we're searching for weapons/ammunition and then out of nowhere,a massive tornado heads our way. The crafting/base building system is buggy, but exceptional. I enjoy the aspect of being able to find more guides(recipes) out in the world.Opens up options for RP/Etc for servers.Weapons/Ammunition. More than likely you'll find weapons without ammunition not with it.The best thing that happened when first playing Miscreated is when I was first in the server,and I found a pig for the first time. I picked up the pig and began to carry it in my arms.I named him Roger. As I was going to carry him across the map back to base, I accidently dropped him and thenone tapped him with my gun. I only cried a little bit as I was harvesting some of Roger to cook on the fire later.10/10 Would play again in memory of Roger.			"

								I recomend this game and here's why:I bought this game in the sale for ¬£7.50 roughly and even at the full price it would have been worth it. I can imagine this game may be quite boring eventually on your own but with friends this game is a blast! I haven't had this much fun on a game in ages! Sure the game is Eary access... and what? I bought this game because I remember it used to have bad reviews but now it's mostly positive which gave me hope, and this means the Dev is trying to actually improve the game instead of abandoning it.The only problems with this game are that you cant loot a container while another player (even your friends) are next to you. Also that you can only get one container per base, but don't let that put you off this brilliant game, there are ways around this. For instance; Getting a tent for storage, using cars for storage etc...I love this game and I know the devs are going to improve it as much as possible. I give this a thumbs up because it's the best zombie survival out there just now! :) go grab it!			"

								I think a necessity for this type of genre, the Zombie Post-Apocalyptic Survival Game, is to remain in eternal Alpha stage. But nevertheless, this game so far is really cool. I'm an old school Day Z Mod player and this brings me back; same adrenaline rush, same frenzy, same oppression. Whereas Day Z StandAlone has failed us, this has some major strengths and seems to be shaping up nicely. I'm really enjoying it thus far as it soothes the itch of the need for this type of game after playing Day Z mod. I've played War Z and a few others, but this is the best so far.			"

								First off, beautiful graphics! Anyways this is the most well put together, realistic, massive multiplayer game out there! H1Z1 was an atrocious survival game like no one has room to disagree because it turned into a stupid deathmatch game for crying out loud....DayZ Standalone is good but has too many OP weapons, but Miscreated now is a game that makes you feel like you're really in an apocalypse. The houses in miscreated are all different and have vegetation and wear all on and INSIDE the houses, every house and i mean EVERY house varies like its incredible how much work they put into the houses unlike in H1Z1 and DayZ. Next is the weapons. Yes, there aren't many weapons but there are some weapons that actually might be found in towns like a simple hand gun or beaten winchester or huniting rifle (which is super rare), ammo is super hard to find like it really would be in real life which helps lower the D-Bags in the game and really makes people want to make a group instead of kill on sight. Best zombie game yet, runs like a charm, and is definitely worth the money!			"

								Miscreated is the only game I purchased during this years summer sale, I believe it was worth the $10.I like where this game is going from a survival and crafting aspect.  However, it is apparent they mimicked a lot of features you will find in Day Z in their own unique way.  I am anxious to see where this game goes but with the recent 0.60 patch with Day Z I find myself still going back to Chernarus. If you are a beginner wanting to give the surival genre a try this game would be a good start for you.UPDATE 01/06/2016:  I have been playing a lot this past week and after exploring more of the map and fixing up a car it has been pretty cool.  I am actually playing this more than Day Z just because its more unique and less buggy.  I know there are some negative comments about base building being glitched but come one guys, the developers already said base building needs attention, no need to blow your load all of the internet.  ITS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME!			"

								It's such a nice game and when you are playing the game, the time is going so fast. Sometimes finding a gun is impossible and you really need a dufflebag because your inventory is full so fast. I really want to play this game, but after an hour of playing the game crashes. When i first played it, I had freezes and I was able to fix it by adding two sentences in a map of the game. But after I fixed this it just crashes.. Maybe it's because I have an AMD, the game is not so good for AMD's as it is for Intel ;(The community is great and with almost 10 hours playing time, I made a lot of friends and ofcourse I got killed sometimes.To come to an end, I wanna play the game but I can't because when it crashes it makes me so mad, just found a gun and then it crashes you know..

The game has a big city with lots of interesting stuff. For example there are apartments, autoshops, hotels, and check points. Ammo is very rare. samething with guns. I really hope this game gets better. The map is curretly unfinished. the map feels kinda feel small when you get a car which is kinda hard.

								So I get the game expecting something like DayZ, I was mistaken, I've gotten something much better.I spawn into my first server and hear the distinct sound of a squeaker in the distance. I track the noise to an old white house in Pinecrest. When I spot the wild squeaker it appears that he is testing out controls or doing some type of mating dance tbh idfk what he was doing, anyways, I see the perfect time to strike. I sneak up on the wild squeaker and proceed to punch said beast. To my dismay, the squeaker panics and begins to scream and run around while holding down his VOIP key. He then tries to reason with me and asking to be my friend, I know this was a conspiracy, I couldn't trust a wild animal. So I continue to beat the squeaker. After chasing the squeaker down about 6 blocks, I hear one last shreik of panic and my last punch lands, I scramble to check his loot and long story short I got green pants. :^)Was it worth it? You may ask, and yes it is, one less beast to worry about.10/10 Would beat a squeaker to death again.			"

								A great open world survival game, you can tell its early access but a lot of things are nice and polished, the game world looks fantastic, swimming in water is super realistic, scavenging dark interiors with only a flash light is immersive.Pros:-great design/ concept-great graphics-detailed world-for an EA game its worth the investment cuz it will only get betterCons:-Mutants are sparse, there are no hordes yet -no real danger besides other people, you wont feel threatened and desperate to find something unless you come across other players, im hoping this changes in future patches and reading up on it seems like they already have plans for it -lots of looting, core gameplay so far is just looting, like i said before the mutants are very few, you will be lucky to see any (you can kill them with anything so its not a threat as of yet)As of this patch right now on 10/17/16The problem so far is there is no incentive to go out and hunt and survive, you can basically kill mutants with a squeegee they are very few, the lack of imminent danger is my only complaint and i know its something they are working on,  as ive stated before its a got great structure and i deff recommend it and keep this game on your radar its only getting better from here,			"

								a beautiful early access multiplayer survival gamethe vehicle system is unique and pretty realistic for a survival game ! you have to find parts to replace or install in a vehicle before it is usable but vehicles are an inexpensive tool for base building due to their mobility and expanded inventory, or just plain survival. plus, they're extremely cool to use.although this game isn't perfect right at this moment, there is definitely a lot of lovely work that has been put into it as well as some more polish that is in the works the thing that it needs the most right now is support and advertising  so by all means try it out ! if you have a couple friends with some cash to spare, you'll love this game's atmosphere and gameplay.

								Graphics = 9/10Sound = 8/10Survival Gameplay = 9/10I wanted to get into DayZ, but it was too clunky and buggy. Miscreated is early access and there are a few bugs...You can lose items through the floor, caches can disappear, you can fall through the ground if vehicle is flipped, headshots aren't registering properly, the game used to crash a lot, but a patch fixed most of that, sometimes you will get a black screen but a lot less likely now. There was a whole load of lag before too, but that's mostly gone.The game is rewarding when you find amazing rare items, but you can lose it all in a heartbeat, but that's how this game keeps you on edge. Base building is quite good too, so you can hide your best kit if you aren't looking to PVP. There are no KOS servers, roleplaying and normal servers out there, so you choose what you want to do.Not often do I write reviews, but I wanted to share this game with my friends and got a few of them playing it with me now. Enjoy!			"

								This game needs to get out of its ""Mixed"" review state because it deserves far better than that. I can only assume most of the negative reviews are from an earlier build. Miscreated is better than DayZ: SA in every way possible... Better graphics (thanks to Cryengine), better features, more detailed interiors and the game as a whole is far more optimised than DayZ. It runs smoothly enough without having to tinker around with the graphics settings. Only thing DayZ has over this game is the map size but to be honest, I'd rather play (and enjoy) on a medium sized map than an unplayable mess DayZ is, huge map or not.But change that god awful title logo, Entrada. Makes this game look like a cheap DayZ knock-off but your product is much (MUCH!) better than that.			"

								I debated a lot whether I should buy this since EA survival games don't really have the best track record, but I must say I don't regret buying this one bit.The Good:It looks and runs amazing well (granted i'm on a 980ti), I haven't even dropped below 60 fps once with maxed settings.Animations especially for the player are actually really well done for the most part. Of course certtain areas of the game such as the mutants need a lot of work, but they're (the devs) well aware of that.There is a lot of interesting loot already in the game and I like how you really have to search hard to find it. Still haven't found any vehicles though.The controls are very responsive (it's not clunky like some other games *cough* *cough*) and easy to pick up. After a solid hour I pretty much had all the controls down. One thing the developers definitely got right was the mood. This game FEELS like an apocalypse happened. There is nothing scarier than being upstairs in an overgrown house that's been turned upside down, at night, in the dark, with your little flickering flashlight, then hearing footsteps of another play slowing walking up. What I'm trying to say is the atmosphere is a 9/10 for me. It's almost perfect.The Bad:Unfortunetly this game just needs time. It's missing a lot of features, it can definitely feel empty at times, there isn't much else to do except collect loot and kill players. It's just one of those games where we are going to have to hope it all comes together in a reasonable amount of time. That being said I do really like where the devs are taking the game. If you listen to their latest Twitch Live Stream they pretty much address all of the major issues with the game and what they're doing to fix it. If it all goes to plan it sounds pretty damn awesome.Conclusion: The fact that the devs are focusing on making survival #1 priority gives me a lot of hope for this game. That plus the cryengine + the seperate AI company + all the new systems being added... well it's looking real good folks. Fingers crossed.   "

								Pros-Beautiful, exhilarating, optimized, entertaining, great building system, great loot, logical locations, well structure map, RELATIVELY friendly community (not as much kill on sight bull as DayZ), smooth pvp (not clunky), good voice communication, three chats (area, local, whisper), I' havn't dropped below 60 fps unless loading which is great for a game that requires on the spot decision making (especially when in a firefight)I have not played in a group or clan yet, I assume it's fun and hope to find some groups to hang with. But as of right now I cannot really comment on team play for this game.The Devs are really interactive and value community opinion very highly, this is honestly amazing. They update frequently which doesn't make me question where my money is going, or if this game will finish, because I'm certain it willCons-Buggy AI (although I've heard this will be fixed)Very simplistic inventory overlayNot a whole lot of content YET.Overall if you would like to play a great game, and watch it grow both in content and community, buy this game, and if you enjoy it recommend it to a friend!

								One of the best survival games to date with a great community behind it and a very regular player base .The devs do an amazing job and are constantly active providing regular updates that benefit the game and the way its played .You also cannot fail to notice the landscape around you while you play Miscreated its both visually stunning in appearance and practical when it comes to running and finding cover usually from bandits ( yea i do that a lot ) .                                                                                                                          This game has everything - great graphics , good weapons and loot , wild animals roaming the forests , swamps , lakes and ponds plus rivers full of fish .The game also has base building its easy to pick up and with a little work there is no end to what you can make .Miscreated has plenty of vehicles to drive , take a trip to the villages and towns plus the city.The game has a fantastic day / night cycle that adds to the atmosphere while you play .Miscreated is very polished and should be on your list of survival games to play			"

								The ""mixed"" reviews are consequence of earlier builds, the game is rather good now. If you were a big DayZ fan, you'll like this. It feels a lot like DayZ in many ways. I've spent far too much time recently getting a vehicle up and running only to flip it over on some cliff. 10/10 would recommend to DayZ fans.			"

								First off, beautiful graphics! Anyways this is the most well put together, realistic, massive multiplayer game out there! H1Z1 was an atrocious survival game like no one has room to disagree because it turned into a stupid deathmatch game for crying out loud....DayZ Standalone is good but has too many OP weapons, but Miscreated now is a game that makes you feel like you're really in an apocalypse. The houses in miscreated are all different and have vegetation and wear all on and INSIDE the houses, every house and i mean EVERY house varies like its incredible how much work they put into the houses unlike in H1Z1 and DayZ. Next is the weapons. Yes, there aren't many weapons but there are some weapons that actually might be found in towns like a simple hand gun or beaten winchester or huniting rifle (which is super rare), ammo is super hard to find like it really would be in real life which helps lower the D-Bags in the game and really makes people want to make a group instead of kill on sight. Best zombie game yet, runs like a charm, and is definitely worth the money!			"

								This game, in my opinion, should not have a mixed review, but more on the positive side.  It is a early access scavenging game that puts you in a ""Walking Dead"" kind of character role. Servers are very fun when the majority of people on them role play; but the game is also a good banditing game.Pro's (early access Patch #32)Each respawn starts different than the last, and spawn points seem random all over the islandYou can identify if a player has good weapons and gear by looking at them. Guns and weapons appear on character modelsLarge customization options regarding clothingLarge variation of ranged and melee weaponsVERY good atmosphere; constantly looking over your shoulderGameplay is geared towards scavenging for now (until storage is introduced into base building)Good loot comes in some very random places, not always in 1 certain spot.Easy enough to learnBullet physics apply when shooting; varies greatly depending on the gun you have irt bullet velocity, range and dropVery immersive country side with cave systems, hunting cabins, and a variety of vehicles to get around in (HARD TO FIND) Large cities, small towns, woodland communities, and your occasional country home.Gameplay encourages team work and alliancesCon's (Gameplay Less early development typical bugs) You cannot merge clips of ammo, remove bullets from clips; it would be nice to do that so that you're not carrying 4 half empty clips, and can reload your clips when safe. or take my .22 bullets from a clip to use them in a .22 rifleClothing does not yet have defensive bonuses (talk of bringing it in soon)There is no storage unless you have found and fully repaired a truck, but anyone can just come steal your truck and you will lose everything that you have stored in it.The current base building is clunky (that issue will be mostly solved when storage is introduced)It can be too easy to starve to death on populated servers due to many people scavenging / slow item respawn times - unless you find a gun and can kill a couple people who are wearing backpacks, and pray they have stored some food!Weapon and ammo crafting is lacking, or non existent - hopefully will improve as time goes on.I would highly recomend this game to my friends. It has a lot of potential, and from what I hear from friends, it is on it's way to being superior to DayZ. Happy Hunting,Dusty			"

								REFUNDED:Firstly i had no interest in this game at first until i saw someone else play it recently. Im a sucker for great graphics and games that run well. I was always in 60-70fps on high graphics.This game was alright at first even though the first hour i spent running around trying to find buildings and loot which i found very little of. the rest of the time was pretty awful i ran around the whole map and was unable to find anything other than axes, base ball bats, car parts, and sometimes food. I ran into 3 people during the time i spent playing this game and none of them had anything either. Bases were empty (player bases) and it seemed like nobody was online with me. I was playing on a server with 35 other people not including myself which means a full server and it apparently was times x amount of loot (easier loot) which is basically saying 0x3=0. I cant imagine normal servers loot system if i couldnt even find loot on this server. I really wanted to like this game but i guess ill wait a couple more months or a year to try it again. As of now it has nothing to offer and i was pretty bored the whole time.			"

								It's obviously Early Alpha, tons of things aren't working/implemented, it's poorly optimized, the enemy AI is pathetic currently (they stop chasing when they lose direct LoS), and the world isn't massive... but for some reason I'm having a blast. The game has plenty of potential, and it's just kinda fun to get a few friends together and run around collecting stuff and getting shot at. I can't explain why it's fun, it just is.			"

Early Access Review
								So, Ive wanted to buy this game since a few months but I always hesitated. It finally got on sale for the Halloween and I bought it. This is my Day #1 experience:1st spawnI had just spawned and I started fixing the video settings and trying to figure out the controls. It was night. Like hella dark, couldn't even see my arms. I started strolling around while I somehow managed to drop my only item, the flashlight (accidentally pressed wrong button). Trying to keep moving, I ended up in the middle of a road. Still couldn't see much and all of a sudden another player showed up and made me almost sh*t my pants. ""This is it, I'm dead"", I thought. But instead, the guy asked me if I needed anything and even gave me a gun with two bullets and a flashlight! I thanked him and he moved away. I kept following the road when I heard some roars. I noticed an infected in a small distance and panicked as I didn't even know how to equip the gun I had, yet. I decided I could slowly go past him and move away but no, that creepy @ss thing started screaming the hell out of its lungs as I got closer. So I started running till I heard wolves. I finally reached a town and in a few words, I accidentally fell from a big height, started bleeding and slowly, died. Spawn 2I respawned on a different place and after some time of looting around, I bumbed on a Swedish guy. He was really friendly I couldnt even believe it and we eventually teamed up. He taught me some handful survival tricks and tactics and it was all cool when we heard another guy (a Finnish one) who almost blew our minds with his carbine (he thought we would attack him). He got in the squad too and we all had a good time I believe. Few things I learned from the Swedish guy:-NEVER TURN ON YOUR FLASHLIGHT OUTSIDE OF BUILDINGS, you're easy to spot-stay close to bushes and out of the roads-always keep an eye on your health stats; everything below 50% means emergency-try to team up with people (friends playing with you are the best solution) or be careful as they'll probably kill you. -STOP CARRYING USELESS STUFF. even if you find a backpack (which you totally need in such a game), you want to save space for consumables and weapons. Better thing to do is to focus either on building a base, or a car or just surviving and so keep space for your purposes. The game is on Alpha version as stated, yet it lacks very few things from its full release. Mechanics are good, physics are awesome, graphics are exceptional. The menu options aren't many and the user interface is kinda good (it could be better but I see the devs have focused on the rest of the game and some fixes). I only found one small bug where an infected had glitched and stuck with an object but after a few seconds it was ok. The day and time cycle vary on each server as I've read however both night time and day time last long. And finally the game is not heavy especially for newer PCs. My old laptop with: i7 4500U, R9 m265x 2gb, 8gb ram, run at 40-60 fps at low settings with native (1366x768) resolution. However I read, systems with older CPUs and GPUs (e.x. gtx 670 or so) can run the game a lot better. If you like survival games where you can also build a base, create clans or play alone but also like the horror of the infected, this game is totally for you. 8.5/10 because of the lack of options on the menu. **Another last thing: If you play or want to play this game, don't be the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• who kills another survivor for no reason! Live and let live!			"

								I bought this game looks very cool and for the short time I played it was good. The one problem is my internet is too slow to play multiplayer around 1000ms ping. This game does not have single player I was hoping it would. Anyways the game seems cool but I have too slow internet to play it. One other thing is that it takes about 20 minutes for the game to load after clicking one of the multiplayer servers I don't know if that's an internet problem or what because it does that on my schools fast internet.

When I entered the village, there were two guys running. Then the guy at thr front said ""help, this guy is trying to kill me, please help"", so I decided to be a nice guy and not a douch in every H1Z1 player. After like a few minutes trying to get a hit on the guy who is chasing, another two player appears and joined the fight. the guy who was getting chased asked for help again, and the two new guys thought I was the bad guy, so they decided to kill me. 10/10 would get killed again for being a hero.

								This game is way better than i thought it would be for an alpha version. I personally think that it has one of the best PVP out there, so you should buy it now that is cheap.			"

								I bought this game looks very cool and for the short time I played it was good. The one problem is my internet is too slow to play multiplayer around 1000ms ping. This game does not have single player I was hoping it would. Anyways the game seems cool but I have too slow internet to play it. One other thing is that it takes about 20 minutes for the game to load after clicking one of the multiplayer servers I don't know if that's an internet problem or what because it does that on my schools fast internet.

								This game has it's ups and it's downs like any game. All in all I would recommend this game for people looking for an immersive and challenging survival game. The Dev team has a good head on their shoulders and they have big plans for the game. If they say that something is going to be put into the game. They put it into the game. No false promises with this team. Moving forward with this game there is massive potential. I played over 2,000hours in H1Z1 and had enough of Daybreaks big promises and under delivering of content. I enjoy playing Miscreated far more than H1Z1 and an added bonus. I've yet to encouter a hacker in this game which is great. One of the biggest cons in the game right now (2/18/16) is there is no storage. BUT it's coming very soon along with new AI. I can't wait.I hope this review was helpful to you in your decision! "

								As much I want to like this game, it has a lot of issues.  I know, this game is ""Pre-Alpha"".  But I really just don't fall for that junk anymore.  Some of the bugs basically make this game unplayable, such as your game freezing and losing all of your gear (on a computer that easily runs the game).  The fact that the mutants pose almost no threat at all to you because there are so few of them that you can play for hours and only see one or two at most.  There are so called ""PVE"" servers, but they are pointless and boring because there really isn't any environment to survive against.  Without other players to compete against, there really is no threat to your survival as long as you continue to loot.  Which turns out to have basically no value because you have gear but nothing to use it for, since mutant sightings are so rare.  In PVP other plays almost always Kill on Sight, and although this can be fun for the ambushing bandit; it tends to be extremely frustrating for the naked spawn who can't even get started without being killed.  Having tried to team up with others, this can be equally frustrating because one minute you are dropping them free gear, and the next they standby and watch someone hack you to death.  Then your ""ally"" loots your body.  Then when you come back to see if your gear is still on your body your ""allies"" purposely run over you with a car.  Unless you play with people you know it is pointless to try to team up and work together, because your ally is just as likely to shoot you in the back and steal your stuff as a bandit is.  I feel like with hundreds of thousands of dollars (or millions) that have been paid for this game that it should be further along than it is.  They try to rush these games out so quickly onto the steam market so they can start making money that they really never focus on any one part of the game at a time, instead opting to VERY slowly expand features of the game instead of addressing the bugs that tend to make the game unplayable.  Same thing goes for games like DayZ, H1Z1, etc. No one likes to log in and find that all of their gear is gone, especially when they spend 20 hours trying to survive bandits who KOS just to get some decent gear.This game has a lot of potential.  I just hope that they can fix the bugs and also make the game worth playing for PVE players.  No AI enemies makes this game more of a walking simulator than anything else.			"

								I won't talk about the game mechanics or anything, instead ill tell you a story. It was dead at night, I had been shuffling around a house¬† with my flashlight on looking for stuff, when I heard whistling outside. I cursed my luck and clicked out my flashlight, pulling out my baseball bat. Thats when it got scary. It was pitch black, couldnt see a thing, all I could hear was whistling all around. ""I saw your flashlight."" A man said, and I heard footsteps slowly coming up the stairs. I was shaking in my boots now. There was no way out. A light shone up the stairs, but I was in the corner. Up, up up they came, and just when I thought I was screwed. Bam bam bam! Shots lit up the night, the guys screamed. They were under attack. They started firing left and right, one guy came upstairs hit and I killed him with my bat, the other two were firing out the window. I grabbed the guys gun and his clothes, as well as his gear, and went back down. ""JOHN! HELP US TAKE THESE GUYS OUT!"" They shouted spotting me, and I walked towards them. But instead, I shot them both in the head. I called out,""Im freindly! I helped take these guys out!"" Turns out a friendly foreign guy saved me, we traveled together, until he tragically jumped in front of a bullet for me, and then I died by a stray molotov moments later. 10/10. Game will give you great memories.			"

								This game is leaps and bounds above DayZ and the like. Expect more player interaction, encounters, and the like, compared to DayZ.Granted I am 99% sure that this game was made as a DayZ clone, it takes the good components of DayZ, and makes it better. Smaller map, tighter gun play, and better movement.This is definitely a good game, and is highly recommended. The devs are constantly updating as well, which is nice as well.			"

								Miscreated, a great game full of well-implemented features and a lot of bugs.I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. I have spent time experimenting with the base-building features and I've got to say, they're really good. Base building allows the player freedom to build however he/she chooses. Every base can be built differently and is unique. For me, PVP in Miscreated has and will continue to be a big part of the game. This may be due to the lack of PVE content, but it is also a lot of fun. I've spent a lot of time combating both large and small groups. It's a dangerous world, and I really enjoy it. PVE content could be improved by adding more environmental dangers, more variations of mutants and even hordes of mutants. The survival aspect of this game is spot on. I've had several occasions where my friends and myself have almost died due to starvation. This also forces PVP and confrontation because you need food to survive. It really helps capture the brutality and savagery generally associated with a post-apocalyptic society. However, it is relatively easy to get water through rivers, ponds and much more. The visuals of Miscreated are incredible. The weather is incredible and I often find myself just admiring how good it is. The developers have done a very good job implementing weather and environmental visuals. There are many vehicles to choose from in Miscreated. The fact that there are a limited number spawned at once makes getting one feel like an achievement. Unfortunately though, the vehicles have issues. They can randomly cause you to die. This could be by falling through the floor, randomly dying when getting out of it or just flipping for some trivial reason. You can also expect to get disconnected while driving. This often leads to you losing the vehicle to someone else.There are so many other bugs I can report on. There is falling through the floor and losing everything if you can't swim through the ""underworld"" quick enough. Of course there is dropping items and having them disappear. I found that quite frustrating. I could go on but the list is long. Despite the bugs, the game is still amazing and has so much potential. The developers are actively improving and updating the game with new content and bug fixes. It is definitely a game worth purchasing. I highly recommend it.			"

								I've played this game for over a year now and let me tell you this game has grown and improved alot considering how small the developement team is. They update the game consistantly with huge patches, fixing bugs and adding new items, weapons, clothes and vehicles with every patch.(I've also purchased 5 copies for steam friends.)The reason i love this game is i cant find a single other game that can get my heart pumping like this game can. Every interaction you have is unique and challenging. The AI system is decent right now, since they released the new ai its gotten alot better and have added alot of new mutants and mutant packs.Sure it's not perfect, i mean its still a work in progress. The only buggs ive ever experienced is items falling through the floor(particularly ammo clips) and some slight visual bugs sometimes. There are no game breaking bugs honestly, my pc isn't anything special and I get 60 fps no crashes.If you are looking for a good mmo survival game then buy this game, its way better compared to the other EA garbage that plagued the steam community over the past couple of years. Buy this game and kill the garbage.			"

								This game is leaps and bounds above DayZ and the like. Expect more player interaction, encounters, and the like, compared to DayZ.Granted I am 99% sure that this game was made as a DayZ clone, it takes the good components of DayZ, and makes it better. Smaller map, tighter gun play, and better movement.This is definitely a good game, and is highly recommended. The devs are constantly updating as well, which is nice as well.			"

								I won't talk about the game mechanics or anything, instead ill tell you a story. It was dead at night, I had been shuffling around a house¬† with my flashlight on looking for stuff, when I heard whistling outside. I cursed my luck and clicked out my flashlight, pulling out my baseball bat. Thats when it got scary. It was pitch black, couldnt see a thing, all I could hear was whistling all around. ""I saw your flashlight."" A man said, and I heard footsteps slowly coming up the stairs. I was shaking in my boots now. There was no way out. A light shone up the stairs, but I was in the corner. Up, up up they came, and just when I thought I was screwed. Bam bam bam! Shots lit up the night, the guys screamed. They were under attack. They started firing left and right, one guy came upstairs hit and I killed him with my bat, the other two were firing out the window. I grabbed the guys gun and his clothes, as well as his gear, and went back down. ""JOHN! HELP US TAKE THESE GUYS OUT!"" They shouted spotting me, and I walked towards them. But instead, I shot them both in the head. I called out,""Im freindly! I helped take these guys out!"" Turns out a friendly foreign guy saved me, we traveled together, until he tragically jumped in front of a bullet for me, and then I died by a stray molotov moments later. 10/10. Game will give you great memories.			"

								Miscreated, a great game full of well-implemented features and a lot of bugs.I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. I have spent time experimenting with the base-building features and I've got to say, they're really good. Base building allows the player freedom to build however he/she chooses. Every base can be built differently and is unique. For me, PVP in Miscreated has and will continue to be a big part of the game. This may be due to the lack of PVE content, but it is also a lot of fun. I've spent a lot of time combating both large and small groups. It's a dangerous world, and I really enjoy it. PVE content could be improved by adding more environmental dangers, more variations of mutants and even hordes of mutants. The survival aspect of this game is spot on. I've had several occasions where my friends and myself have almost died due to starvation. This also forces PVP and confrontation because you need food to survive. It really helps capture the brutality and savagery generally associated with a post-apocalyptic society. However, it is relatively easy to get water through rivers, ponds and much more. The visuals of Miscreated are incredible. The weather is incredible and I often find myself just admiring how good it is. The developers have done a very good job implementing weather and environmental visuals. There are many vehicles to choose from in Miscreated. The fact that there are a limited number spawned at once makes getting one feel like an achievement. Unfortunately though, the vehicles have issues. They can randomly cause you to die. This could be by falling through the floor, randomly dying when getting out of it or just flipping for some trivial reason. You can also expect to get disconnected while driving. This often leads to you losing the vehicle to someone else.There are so many other bugs I can report on. There is falling through the floor and losing everything if you can't swim through the ""underworld"" quick enough. Of course there is dropping items and having them disappear. I found that quite frustrating. I could go on but the list is long. Despite the bugs, the game is still amazing and has so much potential. The developers are actively improving and updating the game with new content and bug fixes. It is definitely a game worth purchasing. I highly recommend it.			"

Worth it both on sale and full price and my top recommendation when it comes to survival games right now.+ Good loot distribution+ Non-abusive 3rd person view+ Good visuals+ Trustworthy Developers- Optimization could be improved a bit- Multiple small features could be tweaked, but that's probably going to change if we give the game some time "

								This game has it's ups and it's downs like any game. All in all I would recommend this game for people looking for an immersive and challenging survival game. The Dev team has a good head on their shoulders and they have big plans for the game. If they say that something is going to be put into the game. They put it into the game. No false promises with this team. Moving forward with this game there is massive potential. I played over 2,000hours in H1Z1 and had enough of Daybreaks big promises and under delivering of content. I enjoy playing Miscreated far more than H1Z1 and an added bonus. I've yet to encouter a hacker in this game which is great. One of the biggest cons in the game right now (2/18/16) is there is no storage. BUT it's coming very soon along with new AI. I can't wait.I hope this review was helpful to you in your decision! "

								I've played this game for over a year now and let me tell you this game has grown and improved alot considering how small the developement team is. They update the game consistantly with huge patches, fixing bugs and adding new items, weapons, clothes and vehicles with every patch.(I've also purchased 5 copies for steam friends.)The reason i love this game is i cant find a single other game that can get my heart pumping like this game can. Every interaction you have is unique and challenging. The AI system is decent right now, since they released the new ai its gotten alot better and have added alot of new mutants and mutant packs.Sure it's not perfect, i mean its still a work in progress. The only buggs ive ever experienced is items falling through the floor(particularly ammo clips) and some slight visual bugs sometimes. There are no game breaking bugs honestly, my pc isn't anything special and I get 60 fps no crashes.If you are looking for a good mmo survival game then buy this game, its way better compared to the other EA garbage that plagued the steam community over the past couple of years. Buy this game and kill the garbage.			"

								Somehow I haven't left a review on this game even though I've put 300+ hours in. Awesome, open world game where danger could be creeping just around the corner at any moment! Had so much fun playing solo, or with friends. A little discouraging when you die, as you lose all the stuff you spent (potentially) hours finding, but once you get used to the game, it's not difficult to gear up again if you know the right places to loot. Base building is ok but they look like shipping crates. I would rather they added something that allowed players or clans to take over homes in the city or something like that. Either way, amazing game, amazing graphics, thrilling and realistic guns, vehicles, textures overall. Also some nice hidden places like bunkers and caves if you're the exploring type. :) Worth the money.			"

								TLDR: By far the best real survival game on the market with the most potential. Not to mention some of the coolest dev's especially compared to RUST or H1Z1. One of the most beautiful detailed games I've played in years... I found myself playing in the rain and puddles during a thunderstorm.. jumping from bridges into rivers to be taken by the current down stream... fighting giant mutants over an oil canistor for a boat, after running out of ammo I was cornered in a gas station by two bandits with only a police baton... 10/10 would beat down bandits while being shot to death again... Falling from a giant radio tower trying to take a screen shot... This doesn't even count the 30+ gun fights I endured in the first day of playing. I killed with a police baton, 10+ different guns, different magazines, hatchets.. (mostly bandits) it goes on an on. IF you don't have fun playing this game you have no idea what a real surivival game is and you probably play RUST or H1Z1 BR or C.O.D. because those games tend to breed ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and delusional idiots focused on short lived pvp and 24/7 action non-stop. Those are not a survival games. Miscreated is. You actually have to look for loot. Closely. Use your flashlight. Eat food and drink. Ect. People saying food is everywhere, well not really. When you go on an adventure and can only pack so much you find yourself starving or bleeding out regularly.  Yes there are bugs, yes there are glitches, but this game is in alpha. Some of the recent $60+ ""finished"" games are more buggy and way less appealing. Out of all the surivival games I've played, rust, h1z1, ect. Miscreated has BY FAR the most potentional and their developers seem like a solid bunch. Do yourself a favor, get this game, get involved in the community, and give the dev's some constructive feedback to make this game the best survival game on the market. Right now its setup so when you die, you die, you don't have anything but a crate of loot at your base and no base spawning. Death actually means something and there is no‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•baggery like in rust. *The only thing I could see ruining this game is cheaters and script kiddies. (I didn't encounter any cheaters so far) It's one thing to be a bandit, it's another to use scripts to cheat in a survival game. No one gets mad, or rages... it's more just disapointment that there are such extreme‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•bags that have such tiny woodies they feel the need to feed their small ego's with narcissistic supply by cheating and scripting on people trying to have a fun time.

								I love Miscreated. I like it so much that I not only run two servers for this game, but I've also bought four copies of the game (once for each person in my home)!This game is a great post-apocalyptic survival romp on a fictional Pacific Northwest coastal island. There's great PvP action on most servers, PvE on some servers (some are better than others in this area), and even a few roleplay servers.What can you do in Miscreated? Scavenge for food, clothing, and weapons. Fix up cars, trucks, and four wheelers to drive around. You can kill mutants, get chewed on by a two-headed dog, hunt wolves for meat, and hunt other players. You can explore caves, a fishing village, other settlements/neighborhoods on the island, an airport, and even a city. Not in the mood to explore? Then place a plot sign to claim you own corner of the island and build a base. I personally really enjoy teaming up with other players to do basebuilding, scavenging, or even to take on groups of other players in some excellent PvP action!So what is there for players to complain about? There's not enough loot!  Actually, there is; you just need to learn where to find it. And it's a survival game, so food, drink, weapons, and vehicles are supposed to be hard to find. IMO, it's too easy to find loot, but I also have over 800 hours of experience in the game telling me where to find things and can get geared up in ten minutes in my first time on a server. Bugs! It's an alpha and there's a small team of dedicated developers behind this game; they work on the game around the clock. Even so, there will be bugs. Some players might think the developers are ignoring certain bugs, but it really comes down to the fact that some bugs are more easily squashed than others. Some players think that the developers waste time by putting in minor features rather than fixing bugs. The truth is that, like most development teams, the developers each have their own areas of focus and responsibility; just because one developer or artist has a few cycles to add something small to the game does not mean the issues bugging players are being ignored. Floating bases! Some players take advantage of a flaw in the basebuilding system allowing for the building of floating bases. Floating bases are an eyesore and usually cannot be raided (hence why players are willing to float bases). Players can rest assured, though, the devs are well aware of this being a gameplay issue and are working on a long term solution to both improve basebuilding and eliminate floating bases. Hacks - most reported hacks aren't. By far, most hack accusations are in reality just bugs, and the hacks that do pop into existence get squashed by EAC fairly quickly. You can't self-host a server. Some players think that Entrada has conspired to make buckets of money off only allowing i3D to host Miscreated servers. No. That's it. Just, no. As Entrada updates the game frequently, it's simply easier and faster for this small dev team to coordinate server updates with a single game hosting company than with multiple. I don't have the ability to see the future, but I'd bet that some time down the road players may be able to self-host - however, not until dev team can take time to tighten up the server code so that server admins can't abuse their ability to self-host.Should you get this game? YES! ...just watch out for the brutes - and I'm not talking about other players...you'll know what I mean when you meet one. ;)			"

Floating bases! Some players take advantage of a flaw in the basebuilding system allowing for the building of floating bases. Floating bases are an eyesore and usually cannot be raided (hence why players are willing to float bases). Players can rest assured, though, the devs are well aware of this being a gameplay issue and are working on a long term solution to both improve basebuilding and eliminate floating bases. Hacks - most reported hacks aren't. By far, most hack accusations are in reality just bugs, and the hacks that do pop into existence get squashed by EAC fairly quickly. You can't self-host a server. Some players think that Entrada has conspired to make buckets of money off only allowing i3D to host Miscreated servers. No. That's it. Just, no. As Entrada updates the game frequently, it's simply easier and faster for this small dev team to coordinate server updates with a single game hosting company than with multiple. I don't have the ability to see the future, but I'd bet that some time down the road players may be able to self-host - however, not until dev team can take time to tighten up the server code so that server admins can't abuse their ability to self-host.Should you get this game? YES! ...just watch out for the brutes - and I'm not talking about other players...you'll know what I mean when you meet one. ;)			"

Early Access Review
								TLDR: By far the best real survival game on the market with the most potential. Not to mention some of the coolest dev's especially compared to RUST or H1Z1. One of the most beautiful detailed games I've played in years... I found myself playing in the rain and puddles during a thunderstorm.. jumping from bridges into rivers to be taken by the current down stream... fighting giant mutants over an oil canistor for a boat, after running out of ammo I was cornered in a gas station by two bandits with only a police baton... 10/10 would beat down bandits while being shot to death again... Falling from a giant radio tower trying to take a screen shot... This doesn't even count the 30+ gun fights I endured in the first day of playing. I killed with a police baton, 10+ different guns, different magazines, hatchets.. (mostly bandits) it goes on an on. IF you don't have fun playing this game you have no idea what a real surivival game is and you probably play RUST or H1Z1 BR or C.O.D. because those games tend to breed ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and delusional idiots focused on short lived pvp and 24/7 action non-stop. Those are not a survival games. Miscreated is. You actually have to look for loot. Closely. Use your flashlight. Eat food and drink. Ect. People saying food is everywhere, well not really. When you go on an adventure and can only pack so much you find yourself starving or bleeding out regularly.  Yes there are bugs, yes there are glitches, but this game is in alpha. Some of the recent $60+ ""finished"" games are more buggy and way less appealing. Out of all the surivival games I've played, rust, h1z1, ect. Miscreated has BY FAR the most potentional and their developers seem like a solid bunch. Do yourself a favor, get this game, get involved in the community, and give the dev's some constructive feedback to make this game the best survival game on the market. Right now its setup so when you die, you die, you don't have anything but a crate of loot at your base and no base spawning. Death actually means something and there is no‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•baggery like in rust. *The only thing I could see ruining this game is cheaters and script kiddies. (I didn't encounter any cheaters so far) It's one thing to be a bandit, it's another to use scripts to cheat in a survival game. No one gets mad, or rages... it's more just disapointment that there are such extreme‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•bags that have such tiny woodies they feel the need to feed their small ego's with narcissistic supply by cheating and scripting on people trying to have a fun time.

								It needs a much better health system. I accidentally fell from the top of a very small gas station and hurt myself to 75% health. My health kept going down to 0% and I died. I had tons of food, a gun, a hoodie, a military backpack and water carrier, and great clothing. Not sure what that was about, shouldn't have died from one fall that barely hurt me by itself. Otherwise, it's a great game, pick it up.EDIT: Disregard my review above, I'm new to these types of games and didn't realize this was common. However, since this is a survival game, I do recommend to any devs that are reading this to make food and water less common. Very easily to stockpile both and get bored and start PKing, would be much more tense if I also had to worry about not dying from starvation and dehydration.			"

								This is an absolutely fantastic game and although i havent played many hours i can say without this is and will be one of favourite games ever. There are issues such as floating bases, and animation bugs but these have not made this game any less fun for me personally. If you are on the fence about purchasing this game i would highly recomend it and suggest looking at gameplay on youtube. Gameplay-8.5/10Gunplay-9/10Graphics and Environment-9.5/10So for me it is an easy 9/10 game.			"

								This game has a lot of potential. Great environment, sound, and attention to detail. I think what is holding it back are a number of things IMHO:1. Dedicated server - I can't create my own dedicated server to play with friends. Note, they do allow dedicated servers, but only with a specific vendor at around $40 per month. This is not an option for most people, and limits the use of the game. I get that they want to curb hacking/cheating, but a friend had purchased a 4 pack because they saw a bunch of dedicated servers during the free weekend, and returned all 4 once they found out this practice. It's too convenient that only one company can host. 2. Zombies - For some reason, I don't find zombies difficult. Perhaps I didn't find enough in one place to make it a challenge? I just outran or beat them to death so wasn't affraid to go to an area with them hovering about. 3. No single player - As I eluded to in the first point, I don't want to play with the irrate kill-on-site or sexual proposition crowd. What is it about being in an anonymous game that brings out the worst in people? Having a single player map in this world with more zombies and harder to find items would be great! At some point people will stop playing this game and the servers will be gone. For these reasons, I can't recommend this to folks that align with my reasons above. If you like the Dayz MMO KOS type of game, then this is for you. "

								I have been playing this game for 20ish hours now. Overall, I think it's off to a really good start. PvP is fun, as well as PvE. The thing with PvE, however, it is rather boring. It's fun exploring towns with friends, getting a vehicle working, finding better weapons, and building a base. As for the servers, I think there definitely needs better controls, such as no PvP or some kind of way to prevent KOS on no KOS servers. It would also be wonderful to have servers with much higher rates of mutant spawning. While there are bugs and broken things, it's still strong. I dont' think this will become another DayZ sort of thing where Devs don't do‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•for months at a time. It seems that the devs do update frequently and fix bugs as soon as they can.Overall 8/10			"

								This is my first review for this game, to be honest, i do really love survival games.I was H1Z1 players before, spend many times on that game and i got bored of it. So i think this is the good choice. This game looks alike Day-ZPro:- Nice Graphic- Many things you can do that you cant find it in other survival games- Nice Mutant-hard to kill, chase you till top of the world XD (They can swim tho)- Base build awesome- Hard to find loots, push you to explore whole the map- There's a Bicycle!- HorroristicContra:- This is a Hard Game for sure and sucks forthose who doesnt like hard games- Not so many people playin this game-700-900ppls/day- I know this game near realistic, but it sucks when it's night,way  too dark (my opinion)- Only few people that can get into one server, like 15-20 ppls- No storage container, so u need to keep all your stuffs in pocket or bag- If u want storage container, u need to have base and cars, so u can store your stuffs inside cars			"

Well, it is that good!-most immersive survival game out there-beatiful graphics indoors and outdoors (and it actually runs very well too)-nice balance between fun and realistic gameplay-enjoyable exploring, from big cities to deep forests, various different buildings like school or underground bunker-decent amount of items like CB radio, bike or T-shirt with ermahgerd cat-working vehicles (police car, truck etc)-creative base building-haven't encountered any bugs so farAltough this game is early access it feels pretty polished. I would recommend it for any fan of survival games.10/10 "

								I purchased the 4-pack as a gift for myself and a few of the friends I've been playing ""7 Days to Die"" with, excited by the look of the graphics in the trailer and how it seemed you could play in 3rd person (I'm a bigger fan of the over the shoulder style, so having that option is a big selling point for me). Shame on us/me for not doing some research beforehand to find out the developers haven't given players the ability to host private servers. We're looking to play just with friends, cut out the griefers etc., and not to pay an extra ~$40 to host our own. Penny-pinching? Maybe, but when we're just fine playing other zombie-based survival/crafting games that we've already got, which we don't have to fork out some more money to make playable by our standards, so be it.Would've liked to give the game a chance, but I've been ruined on MMOs without a private server option, and don't intend to throw money at developers unwilling to meet the demands of their players (surely our small group isn't the only one with that same mindset) for the headache it would give to what should be enjoyable gameplay			"

								 can't wait to see it come out of alpha, best alpha i ever played. the looks beautiful, i was playing at AA on and high in almost everything [motion blur and shadow] i didn't drop below 36fps with a 7970black. the game has some glitches that are not anoying except for the one that your items like my tactical knife and an assult riffle out of nowhere disappear i thought what was i going to do with out a knofe but as looting continued i found axes hachets catgo a lot of food, so luck was on my side. at the begining of me starting the game i was paranoid because everything was too quiet.  i started walking then i so happen that i was crossing through a bush and herd very loud noice of dry leaf that scard the crop out of me but it turns out i was making that noise lol. game mechanics is awesome so far. because everything was so quiet still i was still paranoid because i didn't know what to expect but i heard the monster were scary and fast so 2o minutes latter of playing the game i saw two monsters chasing for what it looked like a dog, so i quickly ran back for 3 seconds and put my head down. from what i saw they were pretty fast and they looked faster then me. i was 51%food and 36% on water drain i need water so with my bottle i wwent to the river and refilled my bottle i started walking down the river after i cross a bridge after a while i decided to test to see if i could swim. i looked around first to see that nothing will meet me at the other side, nothing was there, everything was clear as i was 70% on the other side i saw one of the infected... ohshit, i thought i hope my stenema doesn't give up on me from this little siming. i avoided that encounter. thats my first experience. this game is better then dayz and h1z1 put together, can't wait to see it come out of alpha.

								I dont usually leave reviews, however, I feel compelled to leave one for this under-rated gem of a game.I was looking for a post apocalyptic survival experience, and saw Miscreated on sale, so I went and took a risk and bought it, even after a friend of mine had recommended I didnt because they played months ago and didn't find it that good.I do not regret buying this game at all, it surpassed my every expectation, to the point I feel a review wouldn't justify my experience enough. Instead I'll write about my second play through (because I died pretty quick by bleeding out the first time)I began in the middle of nowhere, literally. I ran through a forest for about ten fifteen minutes, and just when I thought I would die from thirst, I found a small village. Armed with nothing but my flashlight (which you will need at night) I began exploring this small village.After searching a couple of houses, I really felt like this was a world that had ended, people had clearly lived in these houses at some point. From the photographs on the walls to the leaking toilets and the childrens bedrooms. As i observed the wallpaper peeling from the walls and struggled to find any decent still edible food, I heard a groan outside.Grabbing some dog food i slowly approached the outside of the house i was in, and after looking around for a while I saw it.A mutant.Feeling safe, I decided to try and sneak by into the next house, hoping to find a weapon.The mutant heard my footsteps on the grass and ran after me, so i started to flee.In a panic i could hear its footsteps behind me slowly fade and upon turning around could see the mutant walking away back towards the village. I followed slowly and quietly and explored some more houses.One house i went in had a couch completely covered in blood with a skeleton lying on the floor. What happened here?I went up the stairs, found a change of clothes and some antibiotics, along with a bag to carry more stuff and a beanie hat to keep my head warm.I went into the attic where I found a rifle and a few rounds. Yes, now it was safe to go outside and confront the mutant.NO IT WASN'T.After shooting the mutant and missing the headshot, it ran at me. I pumped another round into its face and it dropped lifeless in front of me.Oh crap, I was hungry and thirsty, time to eat and drink.I barely got chance to consume the little food I had picked up when I heard more sounds. More mutants where coming.The gunshot had attracted them, before I could figure out where to run it was too late, I died.This was my first hour or two experiencing the game, and I hadnt even came accross a real life player yet.It was a very tense experience to say the least, and really felt like a post apocalyptic world, from as little as the odd flashing light to the ability to repair cars after finding parts and building bases, this is the game I would recommend, over dayz any day.The graphics are beautiful too.I ran this on an AMD A10 processor with integrated radeon r7 graphics, so not even a graphics card in my machine at the minute. It ran perfectly fine on medium settings and even with some settings turned to high, If you want it to run with everything on extra high without a little lag you may need a half decent graphics card though.I highly recommend this game, and with it constantly improving, I can not wait to see what else the developers have in store.The best advice I can give is ignore any reviews and try it yourself, of course it isn't perfect with it still being early access...... but it isn't far off.oh, and don't get comfortable thinking you're safe, you are never safe.

								This is an early access title.+ Cryengine = yeah !!+ survival game = yeah !!- connecting to a server can take long / if you manage to get on a server that is.Often the client get's stuck while synching, or it just throws you back to the serverlist- performance drop in fps compared to other titles with the cryengine / get's hopefully ironed out.Due to it's an early access game and the lack of actual playtime, due to the above issues, i can not give an accurate review of this game.It's based on my first impression, and you might not run into the same problems as i did.I will change my review, either once progress has been made, or at a later point when the game has reached release date.Verdict:Buying this game is a gamble, like any other early access title !?/ 10			"

								I recommend for sure if you like DayZ. I've played for 2.4 hours so far finding food, drinks, hats, clothes and a hatchet. I killed one guy with my fists when he attacked me first. I saw some friendly people that didn't have anything so I went my way and ended up getting killed by a guy I ran into that had a pistol. This games graphics are beautfiul and runs very smooth for me. Had a couple servers crash on me, but no game breaker for me sense game was just released and it's in alpha. I can't stand the people that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and moan about brand new games that were just released and they know it's in alpha. Thank you devs I really appreciate the game and your hard work.			"

								A really good game. Similar to dayz and h1z1 but with better graphics. Fun survival mechanics, mutants (zombues) are actually dangerous. Only problem atm is not enough players (aus) SO BUY IT  ;)  (No storage at time of writing but it is coming soon)			"

								5 Good Reasons to Play Miscreated1 - Miscreated is an open world, sandbox, survival game. The world is perhaps one of the most beautiful and detailed in the survival game genre. One of the post impressive aspects to the world design is the narrative. Each location has thought behind it where the ruins of society whisper the stories of the people who once lived there.2 - The map is a good size and what I mean by this is that it's not too large, that ultimately you end up running around too much not getting anywhere, and not too small so that you end up running into bandits within seconds. It has two large cities and some towns as well as a Military base and air strip.3 - The Frames Per Second are excellent. The Cry Engine the game uses is renowned for having good optimisation features. There is little lag, if any, and good graphical options.4 - Base building is being introduced, if it hasn't been already by the time you read this. Lots of games have this but Miscreated is introducing something near to 70 customizable features, each looking amazing and suited to a post apocalyptic environment.5 - The community and developers are active. Support is easy to come by and news is current. It is in an accessible state where people can get involved and make an impact or take their place and actually get to talk to people who know.The Miscreated Website is here: http://miscreatedgame.com/You can buy the game here:  "

								Please don't let me down baby! Just want a good survival MMO where i don't feel like i'm playing another vurtual life (DayZ) some future galactic PvP game with minor obsticals with extreme hit ranges and required DLC [hacks] that gives you aimbot and wallhacks to create a hack off (Infestation Survivor Stories) Or where the enemies are extemely OP and can 3 hit all the way to a 1 hit and teleport behind and too you from miles away, and almost every time you come in contact with one you take at a minimum of 1 hit from them. The only way to obtain items is by killing them, and trading the drops to weapons because the spawns of weapons is so rare (Nether)-So far i'm extremely impressed with this game. I recomend the game completely ""So far"". For the game only being a few days old i'm already impressed with the game. I see so much potential in them and the game! My biggest worry are the hackers. That's what ruins every survival game and i don't want that to happen. I would just suggest stacking anti hacks on top of anti hacks to keep the game  as safe as possible. This is my first and probably some what only semi legit review i have ever done and probably my last. But Survival games are my number one thing. I'm really enjoying this game. I do recommend the game, BUT i would wait at least a week and read reviews of get imput from those that have it and see if they still think you should buy it. Because for $25 you're not really getting much right now. Yes you get to play through the game as it comes a long. But i would make sure the game comes a long well and the devs are not messing around. If they don't slack and mess around this game will come very far.			"

								Simply put, do not buy this game. If you're the type of person who likes to support people who don't care about its fan base to any degree, then by all means play the game that'll remain early access until you get grey hair and possibly a real zombie apocolypse breaks out.Yes, I was one of the unfortunate people who received one of the 'random bans' that are infamous amongst the forums. The ban that people complain about not deserving and how they cannot get a response from the devs.I was even one of the people who thought, you probably cheated, so stop whining and get what you deserve. I received my ban a week after I last played the game for no reason.On a logical level, why would I want to cheat and risk the 600 games I have on my account for a game in early access with no benefit for being 'the best'. I'm sorry but this company is full of cowboys who want your money so that they can continue to grow their ego's and think that they've created the next ground breaking game. Ground breaking it simply isn't.The game itself is a replicar of all the other zombie survival games on the market. They do some of it a little better than others, if you ignore the fact people are building bases that float in the sky and are unreachable to raid as well as duping ammo. The major problems are not being addressed by the devs, they continue to put in little things like a new colour of underwear before addressing bigger problems. The whole team do not care what you have to say, what you think, who you are, only how much money you're willing to spend. They have even mentioned the idea of putting in 'pay to win' items in the future.Do not waste your money, your time, or help these so called game developers further their mess. Stick to the indie games out there that matter, the ones with heart and passionate people behind them.			"

								I must say i'm honestly quite suprised by the amount of negitive reviews for this game. In my short time playing Miscreated it has already surpassed DayZ standalone.Miscreated is a generic zombies survival sandbox mmo thingo. But as a plot twist the devs seem like they actually care about this game, It looks beautiful and is atmoshperic as fuq. The sound design needs a tweaking but it's not terrible and the combat gameplay is on point. The map seems a bit limited compared to DayZ standalone which is fair enough given the attention to detail to the enviorments. Loot seems to be scattered around fairly and some of the player built bases i've seen look great. The only real pitfall of this game (at-least for me) would be the bugs and crashes, It seems to freeze after running a certain distance from what i'm assuming is to load in the next area. I've also had 3 crashes in the hour and half i've played. It could just be my rig though as the reports of crashing don't seem to pop up to much and as this is an alpha game it's pretty much expected to have these sort of issues.So long story short, the game is fun the enviorments are great, the survival aspect isn't frustrating like it is in DayZ.

								One of the better options for the Survival genre at the moment. Unlike DayZ, Miscreated has frequent updates. Whether this is a small bugfixing patch, or a complete overhaul, it is always a positive change. Loot is one of the most important aspects of a survival game, and this game's take on the idea is almost perfect. Good loot is not too hard to find, yet it's not stupidly easy either. Additionally, Miscreated is well optimized; looks good even in the lower visual settings and once again, unlike DayZ, it is not stupidly CPU intensive.=================================================================Positives=================================================================Extremely atmosphericUnique weapons and vehiclesActual working animationsAtmospheric soundsUnique locations and original mapIntelligent AIDecent base buildingThe majority of the community are friendly and helpful=================================================================Negatives=================================================================Poor UI design on startup menuOverpowered weapons such as the Molotov and Pipe-bomb=================================================================Suggestions for Entrada Interactive=================================================================Improvements to base building (Change the height of parts when placing ect)Nerf Molotovs and Pipe-bombs so they don't always insta-killImprove the UI in the startup menuOverall, this is a extremely fun game to play with friends or on your own.

								this game I honestly thought would be crap. Small developer team, no one I know plays it.I bought this game because I was just wanting to do a comparison between this game an H1.Miscreated is a game of stunning beauty, simply amazing pvp and heart racing survival moments. As soon as you hop into a high populated server you will then begin the experience. Definetley go to youtube and find videos to help find loot because it can be tricky coming to this game from h1. This game will keep you on your toes, and will leave you hungry for more for days to come. Base building is also incredibly easy and fast, isn't a hastle.Pvp is the real deal in this game. Bullet registratioin is on point, no de sync problems.Best way I can describe this game, is just give it a chance an get past the slow run speed. the developers really care for their game, an push out incredible updates. I hope to see this game have a battle royale mode one day.			"

								Is this game any good?Ok so a little context, I have played DayZ for many hours 600+, H1Z1 and other survival games yet NONE of them have immersed me as much as this game! Without going into much depth this game is a hybird of DayZ and H1Z1 (H1 playstyle with the DayZ environmental feel). BUT the one thing this games has that the others don't even come close to, is the small details. The little things that make all the difference. A few examples: I was looting inside a shed , turn to find rats scurrying around the alleyway. You brush past the curtains and they move (be careful if you're peaking)! Every part of the map feels as if someone has placed each individual object (no copy and paste). Ok, there are a limited amount of building models, however the layout inside changes making it feel as if you entered a seperate house. This list could go on, but I think you get the idea. The mutants aka zombie replacements are also very well done! Roaming the streets and chasing into builds scaring the life out of you! Headshot problem solved..... alert everyone in the area of your position ..... leave! I was lost exploring for the first few hours of my Miscreated adventure. I found a lovely fishing village and was admrining the sea view when it began to rain and a storm came overhead! This was the moment a huge smile came to my face... the rain looked so f**king real! The effetcs of the rain hitting the floor and brushing past the screen. I ran to the nearest house to get into cover. Inside I looked out the window.... the smile grew larger. Looking out the window at the storm was so realistic. Ever wanted to feel as if you were playing the walking dead (the barn scene moment in season 5)? Get this game.  It was at that moment something hit me, to the back of the head and I sadly past away. I guess someone else came inside to get away from the storm. Let my guard down while taking in the view ... thanks Miscreadted Devs ;P     "

								I got this game and started to play it and thought that it was a little slow and kind of just a lot of walking. Then I started to learn my way around the map and where the best gun spawns were, and then it began to get better. The best part of this game is that because guns arent very common when you get into a firefight it is truly exhilarating. I haven't played this game as much as I would like to but i think it  is worth the money, and it is always getting better with new updates.			"

								I played ""Daisee"" for over 1,000 hours of my life. About 400 of those hours were good, hard fun, killing arabs, bandits, being a cannibal and lots of other things. 600 of those hours were holding the W key, and witnessing all the map has to over. A bland taste of what the apocalyptic world could be. I found this game on the interweb, and it looked pretty. So I played it, and after about 40 hours of playtime. I learn to discover, I can drive cars! I can loot bodies! I can actually see my bullets hit the man in front of me, and actually kill him. And hell, I can stand on rocks. You may be wondering why I was so surprised to learn all these things, well... 1000 hours of ""Daisee"" can do that to you. Miscreated is updated about every month, and very little bugs, while Dayz devs spend a year copy+pasting a Arma sound engine and creating wolves into the game. Then when they were done adding two things they deciding to take a ""break"". I just like this game, simply because zombies dont hit me through doors.			"

								It's like a more polished version of DayZ but mutants instead of zombies. Only then with a nice community. And depending from what server you join, a lot less KOS. You can either live by looting the cities for supplies, or hunting in the wild hiding in the bushes. Base building is not the greatest, but is being worked on. Really enjoying this game.7.8/10			"

								This game takes all your predefined notions of the survival genre and completely blows them away.The game has one of the most beautiful crafted environments I have seen so far in a game. Great forests span across the map, vast plains full of grass, mountains that dominate the landscape, great rivers that flow and build up into larger ones, caves that need exploring with fantastic ambient effects, bushes which provide a momentary refuge from the prying eyes of other survivors, and all this powered by one amazing engine: CRYENGINE.Loading the game and deciding to join a server is a bit of a hassle, which can be easily avoided by using the steam server browser and filtering the servers by game.Once you join a server however, you enter into a broken down world, trying desperately to recover from a nuclear extinction level event. Houses are broken down, cities look completely abandoned, and the streets are roamed by one of your future ""friends"": mutants.However, don't think for a second that mutants will be your only problem.Like in any real life survival situation, interaction with humans is more dangerous than any monster or natural disaster. You will have to be very careful in dealing with your fellow human survivors, as they are the most significant threat to your well being. The game features an incredibly clear voice chat, aided by a bunch of emotes which add to the imersion.To aid you in your survival endeavor, you have a bunch of tools at your disposal: clothes, backpacks, weapons, vehicles, and many more, which can be found in the world in every nook and cranny (this game really expects you to show some dedication when searching for loot).The player vs. player aspect of the game is spot on! Headshots are lethal hits, no nonsence like shooting the helmet off or  damage reduction, weapons are accurate and easy to understand and the most important part of any fight is the element of surprise, which is helped a lot by the environment (bushes, trees, buildings, fences, etc.).Base building is still in development, but provides you with all the required elements to build a decent base. However, to build more elaborate bases, you have to venture into the hostile environment and gather recipes which teach you how to craft different base parts.All in all, I would probably give this game a solid 8/10, but just because it is still in Early Access Alpha, and I can see its potential. I look forward to all the amazing updates that the developers put out on a regular basis, which no doubt will force me to change my rating towards 9/10 or 10/10.			"

								This game is one of the best open world survival games out there. it has all the elements a good game needs, its fairly easy to get loot once you learn the map and learn where to look. yes you will die now and then but once you make friends you wont have much problems. plus if theres any noobs out there wanting to play this game theres servers that have no Kos [kill on sight] which means people are not allowed to kill you without talking to you first, which will give you the time to react to what they may do. it also gives you time to get a feel for the game before you go onto the hardcore 50/50 servers.The map is huge and slowly expanding but its easy to get around and learn. All the towns and citys have great features to make it feel like a broken down wasteland which gives the game a great atmosphere. The weather effects are amazing and look very realistic and they really change the way you play for example the thunder storms with heavy rain really put you on the edge of your seat especially during a gun fight.There is no real problems in this game apart from the odd people who kill unarmed players. but normally you find and meet great people who you may start playing with all the time. overall this is a great game and i recommend it to anyone who loves open world survival games. hope this is helpful			"

								When Compared to DayZ , this is a better visual game with similar sandbox experience and scavanging for equipment. Map is about half the size of Day Z , so running arouund does not get super boring. Players will not normally intend to shoot on sight like day z is known for instead they will group up . The Servers also save your gear and spot on the map when you exit. If you are a survial sandbox type of player. 100% try this out in comparision to Dayz. You will not be dissapointed Miscreated = better graphics , realistic crazy weather effects , wild animals and zombies. semi simulatiuon / Arcade survival.Day Z= More Realistic Simulation of  survial with lessor graphics and alot more running.

								TL;DR - Miscreated is doing a lot better than it used to. I would really love to see further improvements, some of which I outlined, and look forward to playing it more in the future and keeping an eye on it. The performance is acceptable provided you're on relatively recent hardware, and it's a damn sight better than DayZ Standalone.I've owned and watched Miscreated since it's unveiling in 2014. My play since then has been sporadic, giving it roughly four to six months before I jump in to see how the performance and content looks.With what I've seen as of this Febuary (2017), I'm pleased that I bought it when I did. While it doesn't look quite as smooth as the trailers would have you think, the team at Entrada are making solid progress towards a finished product.The map is growing. I've visited all of the towns and the big city, the majority of the tiny neighborhoods, and peeked my nose into most ever house I've seen. The world is mostly well crafted, though there are some things that could use polish here and there (See untextured bus interiors, odd light reflections, etc).The vehicle system is satisfying, and overall more functional than any other survival game that I've taken part in - It doesn't feel tacked on; it's much more of an achievement than it is in H1Z1, and it isn't quite so aggrivating as it was in the first iteration of DayZ, though some of the animations with it could use work.Weapons, and their accompanying modifications, are good. Incoming shots sound nice on the ricochet, though they're a little lacking in overall impact and oomph. The occasional glitch with attachments not wanting to hold hands with guns can be encountered, but that's something easily fixed in time I'm sure. The ammo system is very DayZ, Escape from Tarkov, et cetera - Load bullets into magazine, magazine into gun, reload, point and shoot. I did notice that the guns seemed to have a bit of fluctuating effacacy. One moment my shotgun would feel good, would drop what I wanted it to drop without a problem, and on other occasions it would feel like a BB gun, which was both confusing and frustrating.The crafting is a little odd. I'm not sure how I feel about it after coming from games like Rust, ARK, Conan, Hurtworld, et-cetera where people more or less innately know how to build a load bearing structure. They're taking a chance with that, and I think that it does have the ability to pay off provided people have the patience and the knowhow to take time with construction.The zombies and mutants are genuinely a threat. The smaller variety with needles-for-arms don't seem to be particularly smart, but their slightly more naked relative will hound you for a fair amount of time and neither are afraid to stick you in a corner. The neighborhoods largest rippling muscle friend doesn't take no for an answer and has no qualms with setting you back to square one. I recommend not shooting them with a .22.I was relatively pleased with performance overall. At 1080, and with settings as high as I could take them, I averaged out at 50 FPS. Occasional frame drops into the teens were uncommon but did exist, which would be a problem should those hiccups occur during PvP.The clan system is .. There. It ties in with the building system, and grants access to doors, editing abilities, et cetera - ARMA 3 Group system it is not, and it doesnt' disable friendly fire, but this is post-apocalyptic and to my knowledge the player characters don't have cyber implants to see where their clan-mates are. An item, or a set of items, that eventually do that would be nice however.Graphically, the game is usually aesthetically pleasing, though some problems should be expected. Animations are a bit buggy sometimes, in a quirky early access kind of way. Water will flicker in and out of shiny-ness, wrists will randomly break while moving and aiming down sights. Sitting in a car and driving will often make your characters have seizures in their seats, which is only slightly alarming.I did see room for improvement, most certainly - Primary weapons (and smaller backpacks) being placed in large backpacks and storage containers would be *fantastic*. You could tell me that I can't fit an AR-15 in a backpack, but you're wrong and I've tried it to make sure. This would allow for bases being more  than just a place to store food, ammo, and more base building supplies - It would add a profitable reason for raids to exist, which would certainly be an improvement. A colorblind mode would be nice as well, but who really wants to be able to see things?Over all, Miscreated has made phenomenal progress. I recommend checking it out, at least, and keeping an eye on it. While it might not be suitable for lower end computers, it can be a lot of fun with a group and it certainly has enough to keep people enjoying it for some time regardless of storage woes.GPU - EVGA GTX 1050 TICPU - Intel i5 6600k @ 3.5RAM - 16GBWindows 10 x64Samsung SSD.

								I was VERY skeptical going into this game seeing as it is my first Early-Access game i have owned. Hearing the horrors of early access games I wasnt expecting much. I was gladly surprised when I started up the game for the first time! The Early-Access feel of the game is noticeable but easy to look past once you're immersed in the world the creators have made. For as many recycled assets (which I wasnt terribly surprised by) the assets all feel like they had time and thought put into them. The only time this was a problem was when I was in a neighborhood looking through houses and every house layout is the same. I do hope that with time this is worked on. Overall the game feels good to play and other than lag here and there due to maxed out servers or different region servers, this game is a great experience. The biggest annoyance was that canging the resolution makes the mouse off calibrated for whatever reason on my settings so I have to play it in windowed mode. This is a very promissing game and I cant wait to see what the developers do next!			"

								Is this game any good?Ok so a little context, I have played DayZ for many hours 600+, H1Z1 and other survival games yet NONE of them have immersed me as much as this game! Without going into much depth this game is a hybird of DayZ and H1Z1 (H1 playstyle with the DayZ environmental feel). BUT the one thing this games has that the others don't even come close to, is the small details. The little things that make all the difference. A few examples: I was looting inside a shed , turn to find rats scurrying around the alleyway. You brush past the curtains and they move (be careful if you're peaking)! Every part of the map feels as if someone has placed each individual object (no copy and paste). Ok, there are a limited amount of building models, however the layout inside changes making it feel as if you entered a seperate house. This list could go on, but I think you get the idea. The mutants aka zombie replacements are also very well done! Roaming the streets and chasing into builds scaring the life out of you! Headshot problem solved..... alert everyone in the area of your position ..... leave! I was lost exploring for the first few hours of my Miscreated adventure. I found a lovely fishing village and was admrining the sea view when it began to rain and a storm came overhead! This was the moment a huge smile came to my face... the rain looked so f**king real! The effetcs of the rain hitting the floor and brushing past the screen. I ran to the nearest house to get into cover. Inside I looked out the window.... the smile grew larger. Looking out the window at the storm was so realistic. Ever wanted to feel as if you were playing the walking dead (the barn scene moment in season 5)? Get this game.  It was at that moment something hit me, to the back of the head and I sadly past away. I guess someone else came inside to get away from the storm. Let my guard down while taking in the view ... thanks Miscreadted Devs ;P     "

								If you like DayZ, Rust, or Unturned. This is the game for you. It feels like DayZ and Rust, but plays like Unturned, very basic, but can get complex. Im only a little bit into it, good game so far!			"

								I got this game and started to play it and thought that it was a little slow and kind of just a lot of walking. Then I started to learn my way around the map and where the best gun spawns were, and then it began to get better. The best part of this game is that because guns arent very common when you get into a firefight it is truly exhilarating. I haven't played this game as much as I would like to but i think it  is worth the money, and it is always getting better with new updates.			"

								I played ""Daisee"" for over 1,000 hours of my life. About 400 of those hours were good, hard fun, killing arabs, bandits, being a cannibal and lots of other things. 600 of those hours were holding the W key, and witnessing all the map has to over. A bland taste of what the apocalyptic world could be. I found this game on the interweb, and it looked pretty. So I played it, and after about 40 hours of playtime. I learn to discover, I can drive cars! I can loot bodies! I can actually see my bullets hit the man in front of me, and actually kill him. And hell, I can stand on rocks. You may be wondering why I was so surprised to learn all these things, well... 1000 hours of ""Daisee"" can do that to you. Miscreated is updated about every month, and very little bugs, while Dayz devs spend a year copy+pasting a Arma sound engine and creating wolves into the game. Then when they were done adding two things they deciding to take a ""break"". I just like this game, simply because zombies dont hit me through doors.			"

								I have been playing this game for quite some time. Learning out the mechanics, what the threat was, how to survive, etc. But this game has reminded me of a type of survival game I have been anxiously looking for. It can or will be able to customize your character, search cities or towns for supplies, vehicles, unique design for the mutants which I am glad are not zombies for once. Some situations I have gone through in the game gave me and my friend some laughs and other good times. When I play alone, I usually just explore the world or try to find and make contact with the other people on another server and they have been nice and respectful. Something that I would like to see in the future would be to probably give the player a little tutorial on the machanics because it took me a while to learn them all, how to get car parts, and how to collect resources; another thing would be to add more crafting recipes to make an axe or pickaxe so that it would be easier for my friend and I to collect resources without searching every house or building we can find. One last thing I would like to see, but doesn't have to are either more maps or one of those maps you see in a zoo or park showing where you are so that players don't have to relay on the internet and then look at every little part to know where you are. But if I would to rate this game, I would give it a 8/10 and would hope to see more potential out of this game.			"

								*FIRST OF ALL I LOVE THE CONSTANT UPDATES AND DEVELOPER COMMUNICATION WITH US*About to hit 100 hours on this game. My current favorite online game!PROS:-Wonderful encouters with a wide range of people.-Great game environment and sound, just being in a thunderstorm searching for food is amazing.-Weapons have impactful sounds. First time playing, I was wondering for like 40 minutes and suddenly a shotgun pops off nearby and my heart starts racing.-Cool gear to put on. Funny function gestures. -Boats, Cars, Trucks, Cargo Trucks, Buses, Taxis, Police Cars, ATVs, Airport Cart, Lawn Tractor, Bicycle.-Few features make certain towns a bit more dynamic, Like Haywards generator to power the elevator, Amalgamated Airfields Light fixtures.-Variety of weather conditions including Thunderstorms, Rain, Wind, Tornados, Fog.-Actual wildlife creatures roaming around, and caves throught the map.-Mutant variants, Big Bad Brutes, Mutant dogs, And the scariest of all, other Players.-Huge skycrapers that are lootable, one even has a plane that crashed into it, another plane some miles away from Pinecrest.-Roleplaying servers can be fun if you get in the right one.CONS:-You can't see what server you're on while ingame, makes it a bit tedious for friends to join or to remember which server to favorite(the recent server list isn't always in order).-Sometimes the hitboxes can seem off.-So far the Base Building isn't really good. It's too easy to break into with just one person. A group of 3 can penetrate within minutes. So I've stayed away from base building. (Perhaps make it so only certain craftable weapons and fire damage can destroy walls.)-Cars can get blown up way to fast with any machine gun. Fun to do to somebody, not fun when it happens to you. lol-Food and Hydration deplete too fast. This is a mutual feeling for the majority of the players.-Distinguishing Ammo. I'd like to see a static number on the bullet icon instead of a hover to see type.PERSONAL WISHFUL ADDITIONS:-Hordes of 10+ Mutants trying to chase you.-Be able to carry a third main weapon but only if you have a Duffel Bag equiped.-Increase the carry weight to 50-55kgs-Craftable Ghillie type cover for when hiding in the woods.

								Was originally on the fence about this game, but the more I play the more I like it.I played DayZ, Infestation, H1Z1, but they're all a travesty compared to this. It's atmospheric and although difficult to find loot, it feels really rewarding once you find some good gear. As I imagine it would if this were a real life situation. When I spawned someone ran up to me and said 'Hey mate, take these, you're gonna need em' and proceeded to drop a couple of beers before running off into the darkness.I didn't know what to do from there so I spent some time looting, and decided to make my way up to one of the glowing towers. After climbing to the top I found a gun and a walkie talkie. When I climbed back down there was someone waiting for me, told me to drop my loot or he'll kill me.Out of nowhere this guy got shot and killed, someone appeared from the darkness and told me to be careful.10/10 would recommend.

								Let me tell you guys a story.I spawn into a server And I ask in the area chat if anyone wants to group up. Guy responds to me that he does, so I look at the street signs, stand in front of a big Ad sign, and wait. Soon, a guy comes up with his pistol drawn, pointed at me.. ""I literally just spawned, so it's pointless to kill me, dude"" I said. ""Oh no. Don't worry. I won't"" he replies, still not putting away his pistol. I decided I didn't care. We talk and he wasn't the guy I messaged, but he does want to be a part of the group, so while we waited for the third guy, we started talking some more.All of the sudden, I hear the crack of a gun, andthe guy's head explodes. I panic because I'm out in the open, so I'm fumbling with my keys trying to get his gun so I can shoot back. Right as I pick up the pistol, I hear ""You okay dude? I totally saved you!"" I look up, saying ""What?"" I then see a guy on a red bicycle with a sniper rifle on his back. ""That guy was pointing a gun at you. I saved your life, right?"" He responds. ""Ohhh no! He was okay! We were just talking!"" I say. ""Oh. Sorry about that. See ya!"" He then proceeds to ride off on his bike, meanwhile I'm both dumbstruck and on the verge of laughing.TL;DR The community in this game is AWESOME!			"

								Very good game, brings out the good parts of DayZ with more. PVP is very satisfying, especially when you play with Craig. Let's see...he's shotgunned me mistaking me for an enemy. He's circled around my bush getting me shot, and he's also very blind. Looting for gear doesn't happen to quick but it doesn't take long either if you know what you're doing. 8/10 Would Recommend. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you Craig.EDIT: Game updates seem to be around monthly and this month's update has fixed a lot of little bugs and issues that my friends and I have found but chose to ignore so very huge props to the dev team for paying attention to those aspects			"

Quick Review10/10The game runs super smoothly and overall a great survival experience! Mashing together fun and awesome PVE with PVP elements makes the game truly fun!Long ReviewThe game is very fun with tons of teamwork elements, you have to work together to survive this harsh new world. Miscreated uses a lot of concepts from other games such as DayZ, but presents them in such a way that makes it unique. Not to mention the engine and game itself runs a lot smoother than most other survival esq games like DayZ. Having ran the game on multiple machines to test its capabilities, I have found on even the lowest machines I can still push out about 80-100 FPS on varied settings. Along with the very responsive gameplay and gun fighting, it all makes for a solid experience. PVEMost survival horror games the PVE is mainly just trivial and not too exciting. However, in Miscreated it is very challenging and could mean life or death for you and your allies (or maybe even your enemies. The mutants that walk around Miscreated are not your typical zombie esq enemies, they respond to the world around them and come in many shapes and sizes. From your normal walker types to the hulking behemoths, these enemies come at your with actual intelligence. Gunshots, light, and other sounds can all attract them, and when they attack, they usually come in numbers so be prepared! I would also like to note, if you can use some items as a distraction then you can lay a trap for enemies. PVPPVP in this game is like most other survival games, brutal. Yes there are some nice people, and some people who just do what they have to survive, but there is still always those pesky bandits! With the very smooth and nice gunplay, the good melee weapon combat, and all sorts of traps and other weapons, the PVP in this game is extremely fun! You actually feel adrenaline and fear during combat, knowing that every bullet you may use may be your last. Not to mention you may find yourself becoming a bandit rather than a nice person. Along with the dynamic weather, the PVP in this game is superb!

								Great game with active developers and frequent updates.Miscreated is all the loved things from Dayz Mod combined with many more new features and AMAZING graphics.In my opinion this game is definitely the next successful chapter in the legacy of the post-apocalyptic survival games.I rate this game 9/10 at the current state for several bugs and hope to rate it 10/10 when it will fully come out.

								I was VERY skeptical going into this game seeing as it is my first Early-Access game i have owned. Hearing the horrors of early access games I wasnt expecting much. I was gladly surprised when I started up the game for the first time! The Early-Access feel of the game is noticeable but easy to look past once you're immersed in the world the creators have made. For as many recycled assets (which I wasnt terribly surprised by) the assets all feel like they had time and thought put into them. The only time this was a problem was when I was in a neighborhood looking through houses and every house layout is the same. I do hope that with time this is worked on. Overall the game feels good to play and other than lag here and there due to maxed out servers or different region servers, this game is a great experience. The biggest annoyance was that canging the resolution makes the mouse off calibrated for whatever reason on my settings so I have to play it in windowed mode. This is a very promissing game and I cant wait to see what the developers do next!			"

								Very good game with some intense moments. I play as a lonewolf, wandering mostly on mountains and forests, going into cities for supply after a long observation from above. I found a lot of happy triggers out there, but also some friendly guys. It is like walking dead. You choose to shoot first or attempt communication. The first can provide you supplies. The later can provide you a companion. Or get you killed. I like it.			"

								Review (Updated: 1/24/17):Firstly, Miscreated is a gem. It's one of the true last remaining ""Survival"" titles available in early alpha. The team does not dissappoint. With slow but steady updates continuing, the game shows immense potential. I'll simply state a list of the pros and cons and illustrate to the devs and buyers an insight to ways of improving the title without stripping away its core values. I hope the Miscreated devs find this review helpful! PROS:- Great community overall. Not very many toxic players. Everyone isn't out for blood.- True survival atmosphere, the game feels alive. Ambience, weather, etc.- PVP as well as PVE. Players in every survival game or setting need a common foe to encourage trade, friendliness, and even communities.- Base building! (My personal favorite) Although building single-handedly is difficult due to weight restraints on your     character, it is unique in comparison to other games. (Perhaps making lumber weightless would be the way to go)- Vehicles! Boats, bikes, cars, trucks, and even the occasional ATV. All with their own personal touch.- Food! It's hard to come by at times. People would say that's a negative but it really adds a core aspect to Miscreated and the term survival.- Guns/Weapons. Whether it is a pistol or a bow, the sound is great. Loud, startling, sharp, like a real firearm. Ammunition is also hard to come by, but never too scarce. Handhelds make a for a pleasant and relatively silent way to dispatch your foes.CONS:- Slightly buggie. I say that sparingly. It's not nearly as bad as dayz or many other titles. I've had an instance where I fell through the map near the river and an instance where I died climbing a ladder in downtown. Weapons or items stay on your back long after ditching them. (Bats and pickaxes) Sometimes two bats will display after dropping said items and picking it back up. Buggy PVP. I don't know if it was intentional but I placed 3 shotgun rounds into a man's chest in a CQC situation. He managed to kill me and my girlfriend.*IMPORTANT BUGS: - Water and food meter go down very quickly when in a vehicle. I believe the game perceives distance in a vehicle as distance on foot. - Dropping items in a building usually results in items disappearing. (FIXED)- Climb ladder through walls. (FIXED)- AI. The AI in this title are nearly useless. (I'm sure the devs aren't even close to done so no worries) They can either walk right in front of you and not see you, or spot you from across the street. They're bland and dreary. The wolves are a bit more responsive from what I've seen. Adding a few more mutants would make for a much more intense PVE survival.- Building Plans. In order to build more luxurious bases, you need to find building plans or papers to learn more crafting abilities. I think this is a great idea but they are so rare! I think that is why base building isn't a strong component in the game.- Unfinished components* I know it's in the very early stages of development so this isn't necessarilly a con. It's more of an added complaint. (LOL) I. No push feature for vehicles or boats. I crammed a boat onto the shore and could not get it back out. 30 minutes of scavenging for parts gone down the drain. (FIXED)II. Only one storage crate allowed per base. I mean, what?! I spent days searching for the best loot, carrying the spare tire, waiting to place it all in a box and nope. You get one box with very minimal storage. It may have been intentional, but it is a flaw nonetheless. It goes against survival. I would horde all I could in a true survival situation.III. Female characters and more character models. (Again, I'm sure this is on the dev list) My girlfriend loves the game but she can never become fully immersed because she's a male characters. Seems frivolous, but I see where she is coming from. Sometimes you want to become the character, place yourselves in their shoes. Hard to attain when your character isn't your gender or even race. There should be an option under the ""Player Setup"" tab on the menu screen. Selecting a preset character as well as starting clothing. I mean, I spawn in with flip flops half the time. (LOL)I thank the devs for their hard work and the community for their loyalty. I hope this game excels beyond belief. Rust shifted into a whole new direction with ugly camo skins and unrealistic gameplay. Not really a survival game anymore. DayZ is just a failed, buggy, limited piece of tarp that had so much potential. You're our last hope Miscreated devs. Ha ha!                                                                                                                                                                                 -vMigz			"

Early Access Review
								My review of miscreated (scroll all the way down of the actual review of the game)*********one of my first interactions with players**********Just spawned in and found a chocolate bar and some duct tape. I left that area and saw a water tower in the distance and start making my way since I knew I'd be getting thirsty.I was crossing a bridge and then  all of a sudden a guy jumps out of no where and says ""none shall pass...."" (All of this happens over proximity talk in game)I said ""What""He said ""NONE SHALL PASS."" (sounds like hes 30-40 years old)Knowing it was from Monty Python I said ""well what do you want.""He turns around and gestures to a bush where 2 other dudes come out.(names ""carol"" and ""other guy"")carol said ""we require chocolate and  pop"". ( sounds like he is barely 16)other guy *goes behind carol.*the 1st guy on the bridge puts his gun away and looks at carol and started yelling  ""How many DUCKING  times do I have to Tell you, ""a shrubbery"" is what you say. No one gives a Duck that your hungry carol, you should of ate the rotten apples from the last guy.""Carol: ""Its called rotten for a reason, youll prolly die soon and there's not even a shrubbery in this game, how in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is he suppose to get one"". The other guy: *takes out shotgun and shoots carol in the head, and kneels down while saying*""Well there, now there's no carol either""*turns to origional guy on* ""it's one Ducking line, and he screwed it up 3 times.""*********Silence for a few seconds****************I start to move closer to the edge and start thinkign about jumping off the bridge*Original guy - ""dude my moms going to be‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•that you killed my brother again"". Other guy- well Tell her to hop on here and offer her shrubbery.Original guy- emotes *shush finger* *they both  snap back to looking at me*The other guys says ""Do you have any chocolate tho because I am at like 20% hungry?""*i throw him the chocolate* he eats it and we're all kinda sitting there for a second and then theOther guy:""Oh‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• yeah u can go""*slings shot gun over his back*, ""just next time go under the bridge, everybody gets one pass, like carol here"". I said sure and thank you. * i look under the bridge after i cross and see pungi stick traps, and while thinking to myself that sounds like fun"".I walk about 2 minutes down the road and the water tower is getting closer, get held up at gun point, this random dude doesn't want anything but my cloths..... Tells me to take it off slowly (which u cant), grabs them and runs off making fap noises.As I was texting my bro what just happendsome big black guy with a baseball bat runs up screaming at the top of his lungs ""Kraka up"" over mic and kills me with two blows to the head, before i could even react.************Actual Review**********SmoothLooks beautifulFully enjoy the lighting when entering a strcture in the game. (if you dont use a flashlight/sunglasses it may take a second for your eyes to adjust)Looking out windows looks great. shapes and colors look a little blurry which adds the realism and curiosityActions (grabbing, dropping, vaulting) are smooth and feel how they should feel in a fully released game.Loot isnt too scarce, not to abundantPeople are actually friendly and cooperate, of course some dontOnly ""early access game"" i felt like i got my moneys worth. Upset i wasted so much time on Dayz. Let the ends justify the means- Dayz at this point and time was a great template for Miscreated to be spawned in and be perfected through Dayz's (atleast) 3 year stint of glitchy and fat finger mecanics. going back to Dayz after playing Miscreated basic aspects of the game is like going back to your crazy ex, youll prolly do it when your drunk, but  regreat it in the morning.10/10 would recomend Miscreated10/10 would be part of a hate crime again.

The gunplay beats both arma and dayz. The grpahics are amazing and don't cause any performance drops unlike arma and dayz. Overall the game is going down a great track and I can't wait to see where they take it in the future.

Just the visual presentation and the attention to detail is abousolutely stunning! The map size are players per server is perfect for what it is right now. There is pleanty of places to explore and tons of loot. But not so much loot to where everyone has a gun around every corner. Even being early access the optimization is fantastic, pretty sure you can run this game on a potato. There are no major game breaking bugs and the developers are active within the community. So again to answer the question whether i would reccomend this game, i already have to pretty much every gamer i know!			"

								Loving this game so far every update seems to improve things not mess them up as should. All me and my friends are now looking for more public servers PVE only for basebuilding and looting only for new comers to learn like me for example ;-)			"

								If you like survival games, dont mind dying alot, and can stand to build a floating base full of trucks simply for storage space, then this is the game for you!!! Why a floating base, you might ask. Players. Axes. Period. Why use trucks as storage? No storage. That being said, with 300+ hours logged, I can safely say that this game is on its way to being a powerhouse in the survival genre. There are still some pretty hellacious bugs, but they do not occur with any regularity, and are sure to be ironed out eventually. Just sucks when they do hit ya. Trucks (particularly the orange pickup trucks) may teleport you out into the ocean beyond the world boundy; you may just be running and fall through the world; or you may disconnect while driving and log in only to find a possessed demon truck waiting to murder you. And yes, this means you lose all of your ...stuff. But, as I said, those are fairly rare occurances. Game mechanics are solid, environment looks beautiful, and its just generally addicting. I'm looking forward to a good too many more hours burned on this game. Recommended.			"

								Very good game, brings out the good parts of DayZ with more. PVP is very satisfying, especially when you play with Craig. Let's see...he's shotgunned me mistaking me for an enemy. He's circled around my bush getting me shot, and he's also very blind. Looting for gear doesn't happen to quick but it doesn't take long either if you know what you're doing. 8/10 Would Recommend. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you Craig.EDIT: Game updates seem to be around monthly and this month's update has fixed a lot of little bugs and issues that my friends and I have found but chose to ignore so very huge props to the dev team for paying attention to those aspects			"

								Let me tell you guys a story.I spawn into a server And I ask in the area chat if anyone wants to group up. Guy responds to me that he does, so I look at the street signs, stand in front of a big Ad sign, and wait. Soon, a guy comes up with his pistol drawn, pointed at me.. ""I literally just spawned, so it's pointless to kill me, dude"" I said. ""Oh no. Don't worry. I won't"" he replies, still not putting away his pistol. I decided I didn't care. We talk and he wasn't the guy I messaged, but he does want to be a part of the group, so while we waited for the third guy, we started talking some more.All of the sudden, I hear the crack of a gun, andthe guy's head explodes. I panic because I'm out in the open, so I'm fumbling with my keys trying to get his gun so I can shoot back. Right as I pick up the pistol, I hear ""You okay dude? I totally saved you!"" I look up, saying ""What?"" I then see a guy on a red bicycle with a sniper rifle on his back. ""That guy was pointing a gun at you. I saved your life, right?"" He responds. ""Ohhh no! He was okay! We were just talking!"" I say. ""Oh. Sorry about that. See ya!"" He then proceeds to ride off on his bike, meanwhile I'm both dumbstruck and on the verge of laughing.TL;DR The community in this game is AWESOME!			"

								Mostly Positive reviews for good reason.Great game that gets better with every update. Beautiful graphics ,  the lighting  is incredible. The moonlight in this game is second to none  as far as im concerned. The light at dusk and dawn is also something to behold. The weather is incredible , some of the best storm effects ive experienced in a game.Then add some tense, exciting combat and some basic but effective crafting and you have yourself a game that's well worth the money in my opinion.

Quick Review10/10The game runs super smoothly and overall a great survival experience! Mashing together fun and awesome PVE with PVP elements makes the game truly fun!Long ReviewThe game is very fun with tons of teamwork elements, you have to work together to survive this harsh new world. Miscreated uses a lot of concepts from other games such as DayZ, but presents them in such a way that makes it unique. Not to mention the engine and game itself runs a lot smoother than most other survival esq games like DayZ. Having ran the game on multiple machines to test its capabilities, I have found on even the lowest machines I can still push out about 80-100 FPS on varied settings. Along with the very responsive gameplay and gun fighting, it all makes for a solid experience. PVEMost survival horror games the PVE is mainly just trivial and not too exciting. However, in Miscreated it is very challenging and could mean life or death for you and your allies (or maybe even your enemies. The mutants that walk around Miscreated are not your typical zombie esq enemies, they respond to the world around them and come in many shapes and sizes. From your normal walker types to the hulking behemoths, these enemies come at your with actual intelligence. Gunshots, light, and other sounds can all attract them, and when they attack, they usually come in numbers so be prepared! I would also like to note, if you can use some items as a distraction then you can lay a trap for enemies. PVPPVP in this game is like most other survival games, brutal. Yes there are some nice people, and some people who just do what they have to survive, but there is still always those pesky bandits! With the very smooth and nice gunplay, the good melee weapon combat, and all sorts of traps and other weapons, the PVP in this game is extremely fun! You actually feel adrenaline and fear during combat, knowing that every bullet you may use may be your last. Not to mention you may find yourself becoming a bandit rather than a nice person. Along with the dynamic weather, the PVP in this game is superb!

								I would love to play this game. As a refugee H1Z1 player, Miscreated looks like the logical next step. Unfortunately, my PC is entirely capable, except for my graphics card which is JUST under the recomended specs & the game is unplayable for me. I was able to get a refund once I realized that even on the lowest graphical settings, with the resolution drastically reduced, there was absolutely no way.Just be very aware of the minumum specs for this game before you download. This isn't one where close enough will do.Still recommending it though. I won't leave thumbs down, just because my PC isn't up to the task.			"

								Really awesome game,Better than DayZ (standalone and Arma II mod) in my opinion.- Regulary updating (adding in-game items, loots).- Graphics are amazing! [ 10/10 ]- Pvp combat - great. [ 9/10 ]- Looting system also fantastic, realistic (you can find guns, items, etc. in places that no one looks at, always different loot spawn locations) [ 9/10 ]- Wehicles! (lil bit hard to drive, but its not BAD, u get used to it fast) [ 7/10 ]- Wolfs, monsters (zombies, mutants or how they called) not too hard to kill! When you start playing its bit difficult, but when u play 25+ hours it gets easier and easier! (know map better and places).Im playing with my friend, thats fun. I dont know about playing alone - but you can find cool people in this game.OVERALL: 8.5/10 ! worth a try. ;)SUPPORT THESE DEVS!			"

Went to the airstrip and got shot at but they could seem to hit me (or a different person)3. Gathered all types of random stuff (couldn't find a gun or car unless a flare gun counts)4.Ran into a lot of random people, mostly friendly players for the most part....This is where the entertainment began1.Two guys who are decked out start yelling at me over mic to follow them2. Follow them and are told to sit down next to these other randoms3. Wait 3 minutes as they gathered another person4.  Guy yelled sorry guys you have to die and proceeded to throw a molotov lolOverall pretty good game the playerbase is interesting for sure..just wish there were more access to weapons and cars.			"

								If your still waiting for dayz to final get there act together you can wait if you like, but if you want a quick fix this is game for you! for only $9.99 (while promo still going) you can shoot zombies but not really zombie something like a zombie in the face! if doesn't sell you how about !decent! base bulding, or just taking a jog in the wonderful enviroment if this sounds like you come join the 95% bandits that are already playing this game don't delay! (all seriousness it's a great game for $10 and with it being EA I have tons of hope)			"

								Miscreated has given me one of those rare gaming experiences where you found yourself thinking about it long after you put it down. Mostly I will play Miscreated with a group of 3-6 friends on teamspeak supporting each other and I believe that is the best way of playing the game. Helping each other scavage buildings, sharing supplies, providing cover and putting together vehicles. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard while playing a video game as I have with Miscreated. I have also felt fear, panic, frustration, and complete satisfaction when killing other players all while feeling immersed in this world. You really make your own experience in this game. One of my favorite moments was when four of us were in a vehicle and another player came out and asked us for a ride to another town. We let him in and instantly began plotting to kill him in our teamspeak. We reached the destination and as he exited he thanked us for the ride. We played it cool and wished him well while watching where he was heading. We turned the car around and stealthly hid it in the woods. This poor innocent player had become our prey and we were on the hunt. Hiding behind walls and being careful not to be noticed we saw that he had found his friend in this town. I called out to the others to his location. My friend drew his gun on them and unloaded onto the both of them while they were screaming out and pleading for their lives. We did not show mercy that day.This early access game of course has its share of frustrating bugs. Items you drop sometimes fall through the world, exiting a vehicle while its moving can be deadly, and I have gotten stuck in a wall and died. In these days you know what you're getting into when you play a game labeled as early access. It has not detered me from playing and it's nice to see the developers constantly adding patches, fixes and new things to the game. The community has been suprisingly great and helpful. I have had players give me directions and some will give me supplies without me asking for it just out of their own kindness.I would recommend to get this game with a couple of friends. To avoid friendly fire you will often find yourself panicing and screaming out ""WHO IS WEARING THE COWBOY HAT IN THE STREET?"". We have had a few friendly kills along the way but it did not come without a good story. With the experiences I have had and the stories we've shared, I have certainly got my money's worth out of this game.			"

								Most of the time I dont type reviews but this game needs it!Let's start off saying I'm a Day 1 buyer of this game, so I've seen just about all the bugs and everything.The first day I played this game made me want to rage but that didnt make me want to ask for my money backI told myself why not stick it out and see where this games gose. A couple months later or year later it's been coming out with more and more updates, I'm not talking about little updates I'm talking about the ones that Dayz doesnt even have yet!The guys/girl who's working on this game need a spotlight on them, I'm not saying this game doesnt have anymore bug because it does but they're out here working hard day and night to fix the problems.I'm a twitch streamer and the wife of one of the devs really comes by the stream to see what we're talking about need fixing and worked on. They're about the only dev team I see watching others stream this game and working to fix the bug and problems this game has, with this all being said I would recommend this game to anyone that would like to help the dev fix this game and make it one of the best games ever.I have some before and after pictures of what this game looks like and its amazing what they did to it! Here a little video of what me and my firends get into in this game!

								Miscreated is just really and underrated game. The whole atmosphere feels much more like an apocalypse compared to DayZ and H1Z1. It's nice to have mutans instead of your traditional ''zombie'' and the animations for guns, and stuff on your back is just sooooo good! Thumps up for these guys, they are really doing an amazing job to make a fantastic game!			"

								In it's current state, the game isn't very exciting to play. But you get a general idea as to where the devs are going with this, and I like what I see so far.I think this game, with a dedicated team, will surpass DayZ in pretty much any way. Just gotta make it more fun and don't fall - like 90% of the survival games out there - in a simple loot-kill gameplay. Right now, that's all  you do: circle the same city to loot it (same spots, same loot type that will respawn by the time you finish your routine) and kill or get killed. Respawn and repeat.I'd still recommend it, at least to negate the mixed reviews because this game deserves to be played.			"

								I want a 50/50 option, the game is fun, with some cool features such as the vehicles building/crafting. But for a game that has been in dev for 3 years, its has some optomisation problems, i can run GTA  5 at 50-60 FPS at med settings. At 1600xWhatever res and all low settings i get 30 fps, with lag spikes every 5 secs.If you have a 900 series GTX its no an issue of course. Fun with a group tho and for 50% its ok as the optomisation may be better in the future.			"

								This game is absolutely incredible and I cannot wait for the future updates. There is a lot more that the developers can do such as : Extra NPCs (bears, sharks etc.)  Make the caves dangerous and something you have to prepare for. (Almost like a raid maybe?) Add extra features to the clans (better identification and base building etc.)So far I have encountered a few people and the game makes it an interesting moment every time, you must find out if they are friendly and be prepared if they are not. Even without other people this game is intense and interesting, there are so many places to explore and so many things to do.I am really looking forward to the future updates of this game.(Check out my screenshots to see some of my ingame adventures.)

								I may not have a lot of hours in this game, so my review may not be as credible as someone with a couple hundred - couple thousand hours. With that being said, this review is just my take on the game so far. At first look you may think ""This is just a knock off of DayZ"" and continue scrolling, but you would be wrong. There are a lot of VERY SIMILAR features to this game that match the DayZ game features, but the major difference is - THIS GAME WORKS! The devs are actually working on making a game. They don't continue to add useless crap into the game. With that being said here are MY Pros and ConsPros:+ Graphics are STUNNING+ Game works and you don't get Dean Hall'd (Random death occuring in the game DayZ)+ Large crafting system+ Base Building+ Active admins on servers + No hackers+ Items Galore+ Mostly non-toxic community+ Active devsCons:- still in alpha phase, so the occasional glitch or bug- Map is small compared to DayZ- Run Simulator when you can't find a single vehicle in the cities- Non persisitent characters between servers (Character is server based)TL;DRBuy this game. Its much better than DayZ (Check my DayZ hours). Worth every dollar.			"

								Pretty fun game!Great graphics. Easy to learn interface. Lots of items to find. Rather large playing world. Lots of scary things to encounter. A game where sound is very important!Even though it is early access and still has lots of work ahead. It is already an amazing game!My Experience so far.Ran into a mutant on day one. Killed it, but I was wounded and bled out and died.Respawned. Avoided mutants and gathered lots of gear. Fell off cliff and died.Respawned. Gather gear and avoided mutants. Ran into a pack of wolves. Hard fight, but neither side lost. Wolves went on their way. I bandaged up and camped out in an abandon house and logged off for the night.Logged back on the next day. Exploring and gathering. Learned how to make bandages. Found 12 gauge shotgun. Stumbled into a town. Found an old bus. Started gathering parts to repair. Noticed some parts were being repaired while I was off gathering. Turns out another player was also repairing the bus. He had to also realise I was repairing it as well for the same reasons. Went into stalk mode. Followed him around without him knowing. Got dark. Set up camp in emtpy office building near the bus to await morning and watch the bus. After a long period the guy never came back. At sun up I decided to gather as many parts as I could carry from the bus and leave him to it.While doing so, I hear him speak. I freaked! Gun up! Frantic search down the barrel for the source! Nothing. I Ran. I hid. I waited and waited. I concluded I must have heard something else. A glitch maybe?Went back to bus. Started gathering parts. Two gunshots ring out and almost hit me. I arm my shotgun and run around the building and right into him! He has an assault rifle! Six more shots fire, hitting me a couple of times. I get off four shots, point blank, on him with my shotgun. Dropping him on the spot. I am bleeding bad. My one bandage has no affect. I go to his body hoping he has medical supplies. I die inches from him.Respawn. I am in a neighborhood. Start the grind of house to house searches. It's raining hard. Thunder and lighting totally drown out all sounds. I start getting paranoid. I scout out the windows of each house before I leave, just to make sure. Sure enough, See guy on roof of gas station around the corner. I stay clear of the window and lean to peek at him. He is looking for something...or someone. I have just respawned and have no weapons. He eventually leaves. Stalk mode back on.I follow him to the next town. I am scared and unarmed. At least he kills all the mutants in his path. So I am safe from them for now. While following him, he stops and changes directions. Back towards me! I jump into an old beat up van to hide. Guess what is inside? An AK-Freakin-47 with ten rounds in a magazine! I just grew some balls!I stalk with confidence now. I follow him to the edge of town. Where he meets up with his two friends. Scared again.I follow this group down the highway, staying in bushes, to the next town. I think they are aware of me now. One of them keeps stopping and looking behind him. I climb on top of a Quickie Mart to monitor them. He runs straight to it. OK. This is it. Lock and load. It's show time! Do or die!I post up. If he comes up that ladder, I am dropping him. He stops in the middle of the street, turns and rejoins group. They move on. A storm is coming and it is getting darker and the fog is setting in. I have lost track of them. I have to log off for real life. I hide in an old house. I know if I log off I will forever lose them. At least I am packing heat when I log back on.10/10. Would Stalk again.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR - Miscreated is doing a lot better than it used to. I would really love to see further improvements, some of which I outlined, and look forward to playing it more in the future and keeping an eye on it. The performance is acceptable provided you're on relatively recent hardware, and it's a damn sight better than DayZ Standalone.I've owned and watched Miscreated since it's unveiling in 2014. My play since then has been sporadic, giving it roughly four to six months before I jump in to see how the performance and content looks.With what I've seen as of this Febuary (2017), I'm pleased that I bought it when I did. While it doesn't look quite as smooth as the trailers would have you think, the team at Entrada are making solid progress towards a finished product.The map is growing. I've visited all of the towns and the big city, the majority of the tiny neighborhoods, and peeked my nose into most ever house I've seen. The world is mostly well crafted, though there are some things that could use polish here and there (See untextured bus interiors, odd light reflections, etc).The vehicle system is satisfying, and overall more functional than any other survival game that I've taken part in - It doesn't feel tacked on; it's much more of an achievement than it is in H1Z1, and it isn't quite so aggrivating as it was in the first iteration of DayZ, though some of the animations with it could use work.Weapons, and their accompanying modifications, are good. Incoming shots sound nice on the ricochet, though they're a little lacking in overall impact and oomph. The occasional glitch with attachments not wanting to hold hands with guns can be encountered, but that's something easily fixed in time I'm sure. The ammo system is very DayZ, Escape from Tarkov, et cetera - Load bullets into magazine, magazine into gun, reload, point and shoot. I did notice that the guns seemed to have a bit of fluctuating effacacy. One moment my shotgun would feel good, would drop what I wanted it to drop without a problem, and on other occasions it would feel like a BB gun, which was both confusing and frustrating.The crafting is a little odd. I'm not sure how I feel about it after coming from games like Rust, ARK, Conan, Hurtworld, et-cetera where people more or less innately know how to build a load bearing structure. They're taking a chance with that, and I think that it does have the ability to pay off provided people have the patience and the knowhow to take time with construction.The zombies and mutants are genuinely a threat. The smaller variety with needles-for-arms don't seem to be particularly smart, but their slightly more naked relative will hound you for a fair amount of time and neither are afraid to stick you in a corner. The neighborhoods largest rippling muscle friend doesn't take no for an answer and has no qualms with setting you back to square one. I recommend not shooting them with a .22.I was relatively pleased with performance overall. At 1080, and with settings as high as I could take them, I averaged out at 50 FPS. Occasional frame drops into the teens were uncommon but did exist, which would be a problem should those hiccups occur during PvP.The clan system is .. There. It ties in with the building system, and grants access to doors, editing abilities, et cetera - ARMA 3 Group system it is not, and it doesnt' disable friendly fire, but this is post-apocalyptic and to my knowledge the player characters don't have cyber implants to see where their clan-mates are. An item, or a set of items, that eventually do that would be nice however.Graphically, the game is usually aesthetically pleasing, though some problems should be expected. Animations are a bit buggy sometimes, in a quirky early access kind of way. Water will flicker in and out of shiny-ness, wrists will randomly break while moving and aiming down sights. Sitting in a car and driving will often make your characters have seizures in their seats, which is only slightly alarming.I did see room for improvement, most certainly - Primary weapons (and smaller backpacks) being placed in large backpacks and storage containers would be *fantastic*. You could tell me that I can't fit an AR-15 in a backpack, but you're wrong and I've tried it to make sure. This would allow for bases being more  than just a place to store food, ammo, and more base building supplies - It would add a profitable reason for raids to exist, which would certainly be an improvement. A colorblind mode would be nice as well, but who really wants to be able to see things?Over all, Miscreated has made phenomenal progress. I recommend checking it out, at least, and keeping an eye on it. While it might not be suitable for lower end computers, it can be a lot of fun with a group and it certainly has enough to keep people enjoying it for some time regardless of storage woes.GPU - EVGA GTX 1050 TICPU - Intel i5 6600k @ 3.5RAM - 16GBWindows 10 x64Samsung SSD.

With that being said here are MY Pros and ConsPros:+ Graphics are STUNNING+ Game works and you don't get Dean Hall'd (Random death occuring in the game DayZ)+ Large crafting system+ Base Building+ Active admins on servers + No hackers+ Items Galore+ Mostly non-toxic community+ Active devsCons:- still in alpha phase, so the occasional glitch or bug- Map is small compared to DayZ- Run Simulator when you can't find a single vehicle in the cities- Non persisitent characters between servers (Character is server based)TL;DRBuy this game. Its much better than DayZ (Check my DayZ hours). Worth every dollar.			"

								Miscreated has given me one of those rare gaming experiences where you found yourself thinking about it long after you put it down. Mostly I will play Miscreated with a group of 3-6 friends on teamspeak supporting each other and I believe that is the best way of playing the game. Helping each other scavage buildings, sharing supplies, providing cover and putting together vehicles. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard while playing a video game as I have with Miscreated. I have also felt fear, panic, frustration, and complete satisfaction when killing other players all while feeling immersed in this world. You really make your own experience in this game. One of my favorite moments was when four of us were in a vehicle and another player came out and asked us for a ride to another town. We let him in and instantly began plotting to kill him in our teamspeak. We reached the destination and as he exited he thanked us for the ride. We played it cool and wished him well while watching where he was heading. We turned the car around and stealthly hid it in the woods. This poor innocent player had become our prey and we were on the hunt. Hiding behind walls and being careful not to be noticed we saw that he had found his friend in this town. I called out to the others to his location. My friend drew his gun on them and unloaded onto the both of them while they were screaming out and pleading for their lives. We did not show mercy that day.This early access game of course has its share of frustrating bugs. Items you drop sometimes fall through the world, exiting a vehicle while its moving can be deadly, and I have gotten stuck in a wall and died. In these days you know what you're getting into when you play a game labeled as early access. It has not detered me from playing and it's nice to see the developers constantly adding patches, fixes and new things to the game. The community has been suprisingly great and helpful. I have had players give me directions and some will give me supplies without me asking for it just out of their own kindness.I would recommend to get this game with a couple of friends. To avoid friendly fire you will often find yourself panicing and screaming out ""WHO IS WEARING THE COWBOY HAT IN THE STREET?"". We have had a few friendly kills along the way but it did not come without a good story. With the experiences I have had and the stories we've shared, I have certainly got my money's worth out of this game.			"

								One of my first times playing the game, I spawn out of nowhere, agreed to meet someone up at a firestation. He had an assault rifle and I had nothing, so we head out and find someone else. He said the next town ahead is some friendlies (5 or 6) so we go check it out. We all met up and didn't shoot. I had a bad feeling about these guys, but they really seemed convincing that they were friendly. We continue to walk (me and the first guy I met) and then they told us to hold on, they wanted some food. So we all just stand in a circle, a guy comes up and shoots my partner in the head from behind. So I hit a guy with a bat and managed to escape the gunfire I was getting. This game is amazing			"

								The game is in early access so I expected there to be bad optimiziation, and expect to be kicked randomly from servers, there's also bad zombie AI, Other than that, the game is fun, it plays like dayz and h1z1, so you start your first 30 minutes running around looting, my only problem is it got boring fast, after getting a car, and fully decked out with weapons and supplies there wasn't much left to do. The map size is decent, and most of the time other players won't kill on sight, hopefully the devs keep updating this game and expanding the map.			"

								Miscreated is one of the best suvival games out there. The graphics are, in my opinion, the best that you can get in PC games (it's like Arma 3 graphics but with much higher FPS). The building mechanics in the game are ok, but they could be improved a little bit. The suvival system in the game is amazing. There are hardly any bugs out there, unlike DayZ. The map is also the perfect size and looks sweet.I do love that this game gets much higher reviews and more players in the future.			"

								I stopped on my bike in a puddle so I could fill my canteen with drinking water.  My bicycle exploded because it was in water.13/10 Walmart Bicycle SimulatorSeriously though, this game feels like post apocalyptic life. Desolate, scary at times, and you scrounge for the supplies you need.  I'm enjoying the game so far at about 8 hours.  I'm seeing that I have probably experienced about 70% of what the game has to offer.  I haven't explored much of the world, but from what I have its cool.  Buildings could use a little more variety, but its not too bad.  While the game is in alpha, the bugs are acceptable.  Bikes and vehicles are a little screwy, but I'm hopeful that these things will be polished in the future.  The creatures are few and far between, its real life people you really have to be worried about.  If you go running about full speed around town, you're bound to be seen and attacked.  However, you can stalk your way through bushes and dark areas and stay hidden.  This gives you the upper hand and allows you to decide if you want to approach someone, run or stay in hiding.  Speaking of hiding, there is nothing like building a shelter in the woods away from everyone.  It takes some work to chop the wood, craft the pieces, then put the pieces together to make your constructions.Overall, the game is a positive experience for me, I look forward to updates, more content, and the polish this game deserves.  You are not in for fast paced action, it's a slower paced stealthy game.  It has HUGE potential.  Please devs, don't let me down.  I don't always buy early access games, but when I do, they've all been successful.			"

								This game is the best of all the early access survival games I've tried. That's include Dayz SA, Breaking Point mod for Arma 3, and Ark. It's not without it's faults, but I can definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys this type of gameplay.First off, as you can tell in the videos and pictures, the game is gorgeous. It uses the CryEngine, so it kind of has to. On my old AMD rig (fx 6350 @ 3.9, 16gb ddr3, gtx 970) I was running a solid 60fps no problem. Now with my Intel build (same gpu, same amount of ram, i5 6600k @ 3.5) it runs well over 90fps with minimal stutter. HOWEVER, this game has some pretty intense stuttering. Running from one town to another, you'll feel the frames stuttering for half a second at a time every 20 to 30 seconds just out of nowhere. I've changed graphics settings multiple times and nothing has fixed it yet, but I'm sure with more optimization, it will clear up.The world is very immersive. When I play Dayz and walk through Chernaurus, I never see things that make me think I'm living in a dead world. Sure there's busted up cars and no people, but that's it. On Miscreated, you're constantly seeing skeletons, trashed homes, body bags littering the streets, and trash piled up in mountains around dumpsters and behind buildings. Immersion is an important factor in games like this, and Miscreated knocks it out of the park.The map is maybe a quarter or a third the size of Chernaurus. To some people, this might not be a good thing, but for me, I like it. It takes less time to find worthwhile gear, therefore if I die, it's not as a big of a letdown as it is on Dayz or something similar. All the major loot spots take an average of 15 minutes to get to from being a fresh spawn.My favorite part however is that there is little micromanagement to worry about. I hate how Dayz (I know I'm referencing it a lot, but these games are not that similar, just bear with me) has so many little things to worry about. You have to keep your character fed, hydrated, healthy, watch their body temperature, ect. Not to mention if you step off a ladder from two feet you'll break a leg. It's just too much to deal with. It makes the game seem like less of a game and more of a bother. This game however, you just keep your character fed, hydrated, and watch your health. That's it, and I hope it doesn't change.I won't go too in depth on base building as that's never been my thing really, but it is nice to have a fairly well fleshed out base building system. Storage is a bit of an issue for some people, but I feel it's nice for balance.As for cons, there's not much here. The stuttering is an issue, but it hasn't gotten worse since I got the game months ago, and there's been several patches, so I feel like if anything it will get better. I dislike people getting geared and killing fresh spawns, but that's just a by-product of this type of game, nothing the devs can do. Sometimes the base building is kind of finnicky and requires a lot of work to get a piece to sit right since there is no snapping. Cars and tents are limited to a certain active amount per server, so if a clan gets a hold of most of them, you have little chance of getting one for yourself unless you break into their base and steal them.Anyway, I feel this game is worth a purchase. Even at full price, you can get your money's worth if you enjoy this type of gameplay, but it does go on sale quite often.			"

Early Access Review
								I highly recommend this game, for a not so brief story af my short gametime read on. But TLDR, great graphics, great gameplay, updates, solid UI, neat features, a little scary, Not for low end PCs. Still VERY Early Access. I cant wait to see this game in a year.Day 1: I awoke not knowing where i was. I was disoriented (new to game) and mute (mic not working), all I knew is that I was alone. I wasnt too sure where to start, but i was near a road. So I followed it in search of friendly faces, shelter, and weapons.I ran into a small collection of buildings and managed to find some food and a stow pack. As i left my 3rd house someone called out to me in a friendly manner. I approached cautiously as i dont know what he wanted. But lucky me! He was friendly and had another lost soul with him. He said his name was Brian and his companions name was Neko. I was able to communicate with gestures (F keys) and text (game chat). Neko was mute like me but Brian had lots to say, most of it helpful. Brian handed me a spare pickaxe and said lets stick together.Brian said we were near a town called Pinecrest, and that we could outfit ourselves with gear and maybe a gun or two if we were careful. So we set out looting the occasional farmhouse on the way. As we neared pinecrest, off in the distance we heard gunshots so we knew we had to be careful. At the next farmhouse we came to, we found freshly killed mutants and knew that the gunshots were in self defense not aggression. This eased our minds a little as the person ahead of us was armed but hopefully not hostile to other humans.We never caught up to this mysterious stranger, we lost the trail when we split at a fork in the road towards Pinecrest. Nearing dark now and ahead we can see the town. The three of us tired, scared, and seriously lacking in gear set off for for the nearest building.... We never made it. We were ambushed right outside of town, Neko caught the first shots and down he went. Brian took off into cover, I tried to follow but i blacked out (game crash). And that's all i remember about day 1.Day 2: I awoke again, alone, right where i crashed, and a little sad because i probably wont ever see my friends again. Yet still had my gear! However meager it was. I decided Pinecrest was a little to large to tackle alone (and at night) so i skirted the town. I followed the road signs to a town called Sultan. It was much smaller and completely deserted. I started at the gas station and grocery store to fill out my pack. It was a goldmine, I found pants and a hoodie (for warmth and more carrying spots) at the Gas, and more food than i could carry at the Grocery.I headed into town finding no one. I had food clothes and medical supplies but i really needed a gun. i went house to house in the dark, finding nothing but a military canteen. Until at the end of town behind one house in a makeshift shooting range i found a 9mm pistol and 6 rounds in a clip! Again, Sultan is being very good to me. The last stop before i leave town is the church, outside is a toppled red bicycle, i think nothing of it, in the congregation area and between the pews there is nothing of interest. But in the basement i found what i now know is a rare item. A building guide! in my excitement i almost didn't register the ""Click"" that i knew to be the sound of a flashlight. I froze, and listened. Nothing. I slowly make my way out of the basement and up the stairs outside. As i reach the top i turn and see a man come out of the church. Before i have a chance to ask friend or foe, the barrel of his shotgun raised and fired. Missed! I raised my own 9mm pistol and pulled the trigger,""click!"", i hadn't put the clip in the gun! The in game voip chat explodes with a foreign language, this man has backup and they're on the way.I took the red bike and pedaled out of town with my loot and my life. Back out on the road i see a sign for Woodhaven and Horseshoe Beach. I figure if they follow me they'll think i went to the town so I headed to the beach as a thunderstorm starts to roll in. Near Horseshoe in an abandoned truck i found another weapon, my own shotgun, and 3 shells. I reached Horseshoe and took refuge in a house by the water and decided to wait a while to see if the storm would go away (it was ramping up my cpu when on the move 95-99%). I take a deep breath and appreciate all the feels I'm having, today has been a rollercoaster. But its not over yet.The voices are back, they sound far away but i don't trust it. I passed a larger structure on the way here and i guess its their base. I decide to sneak away under the cover of rain. Out of horseshoe, across the bridge but now there's a large 6 wheeled truck in the trees. Had i not seen it in the rain? Did the men nearby bring it? So i check it for keys and goods. Not only were there no keys, but they had removed the battery, belt, and spark plugs as well.No good, i guess its still the bike. I don't risk heading by the men and their base, so its left and up the mountain. After a long arduous ride over the mountain i come to a small cabin and decided i was far enough away for a rest. This ends day 2.Day 3: A new day and im feeling good. A new town was down the road (Woodhaven). Time for me to be the bully or saviour now. I climb down the mountain, (my bike had disappeared in the night) and into town. On my immediate left there's a gas station, in the parking lot are 2 mutants. I walk confidently up to one and blast it with my shotgun, it didn't die. I hit it again and it went down. I turn and switch to my pistol with 6 shots, i miss most of them. I'm not as awesome as i thought. As i turn to run away another mutant shambles into my view and is headed right for me. Only option? Up the ladder on the gas station (most have one) to the roof and wait for help.Its getting dark and the mutants are still down the ladder, i really trapped myself. I hear some shots ring out and a mutant goes down. Am i saved? No, no I'm not, because the next shot rips into my shoulder. Not a lot of cover up here, and i only have a single shotgun shell left. But i have bandages and food. I could wait the shooter out? Try and run past the last mutant? I never got to decide because the next thing i saw was a black screen with the words ""You Are Dead"" on it. 9/10 would live to die again.			"

								Miscreated is a game I've owned for a little over a year now, and in the beginning of owning it I will say I wasn't all that interested in it, mainly because their was so little loot and or nothing to really do (which is why early access and I get that). Now however, I've come back to it at a state where the game is much further along. Graphics have made huge improvement, loot is more plentiful, the overall playerbase has increased, everything now seems to be going in the right direction. Earlier on the games mutants were very scarce and virtually non-threatening because they couldnt catch up to you or they would just bug out and not even register you were there. Now with the new AI and addition of more mutant types the game is a bit more engaging and it feels like their is a bigger threat potentially making players want to group up instead of KOS all the time (which is believe is the intent of the game as a whole). Overall I want to say the game is great right now and I would highly recommend it to any person into this genre.To the Dev's keep up the good work and hopefully you can turn this game into the primary survival game that people flock too.Good luck to you all.

Early Access Review
								This title has had a long and bumpy road in early access so far, but its current stage is incredible. I will keep this review brief, but this game seriously deserves at least an 80% rating at this point in time -- and it is still being constantly updated and developed, too! It can offer countless hours of serious, intense fun either alone or with friends, and is far cheaper than I think it should be. Miscreated takes several cues from the ARMA series such as a free-look feature, leaning, and visceral gunplay. The graphics are phenominal; the visuals paired with the smooth, realistic feel offer an immersion factor that few games have provided me. Looting is the best I've seen in the genre -- you must actually pay attention and search everything in sight. The system is not a simple RNG with loot table inventories or glowing objects. The crafting system is intuitive and handy.Also, the mutants give the game an almost horror-like aspect, and are much more useful to the atmosphere than the overused zombie formula.Verdict: In my opinion, this is easily the best survival game out there and is only improving as time goes on. Try it out! You won't regret it.			"

								In all honesty I was skeptical about playing Miscreated due to the past mixed reviews. Though, after watching a few gameplay videos and doing some research to actually grasp how much work and time has been put into this game, I began to reconsider. I have now been playing for a little over a month and I feel as though the purchase was definitely worth it. I compiled a small list of pros and cons that I'm sure will shed some insight.System Specs:i7-6700k - 16gb DDR4 - GTX 970 4GB - Asus Sabertooth Z170 SPros:- BEAUTIFUL, well optimized graphics - Great Crafting system that shows alot of potential- Just about EVERY building is accessable.(Creates a more immersible enviroment)- HUGE detailed growing map- Weather. It's obviously still a work in progress but I have to say when I first experienced lighting during night time it made me want to wait out the storm in a near by building or camp as if I was actually there in the game. Cons:- UI is very buggy and tends to freeze when attempting to load sometimes(Loading the server list).- VERY demanding in terms of hardware.- Collecting and transporting items of size can be tedious at times.- The base building is almost exactly like Rust which I don't mind but I would prefer a more unique building style.Overall Opinion:I'm more than impressed with the work and progress the Miscreated team has put together. I have and will continue to recommend this to anyone who enjoys a game you can be immersed in for hours at a time. I personally am not bothered by the Cons at all because afterall Miscreated is still in an Early Access stage. I look forward to what the future holds with Miscreated and I'm glad to be a contribution!			"

								I stopped on my bike in a puddle so I could fill my canteen with drinking water.  My bicycle exploded because it was in water.13/10 Walmart Bicycle SimulatorSeriously though, this game feels like post apocalyptic life. Desolate, scary at times, and you scrounge for the supplies you need.  I'm enjoying the game so far at about 8 hours.  I'm seeing that I have probably experienced about 70% of what the game has to offer.  I haven't explored much of the world, but from what I have its cool.  Buildings could use a little more variety, but its not too bad.  While the game is in alpha, the bugs are acceptable.  Bikes and vehicles are a little screwy, but I'm hopeful that these things will be polished in the future.  The creatures are few and far between, its real life people you really have to be worried about.  If you go running about full speed around town, you're bound to be seen and attacked.  However, you can stalk your way through bushes and dark areas and stay hidden.  This gives you the upper hand and allows you to decide if you want to approach someone, run or stay in hiding.  Speaking of hiding, there is nothing like building a shelter in the woods away from everyone.  It takes some work to chop the wood, craft the pieces, then put the pieces together to make your constructions.Overall, the game is a positive experience for me, I look forward to updates, more content, and the polish this game deserves.  You are not in for fast paced action, it's a slower paced stealthy game.  It has HUGE potential.  Please devs, don't let me down.  I don't always buy early access games, but when I do, they've all been successful.			"

								This Miscreated Early Access game is probably my FAVORITE and most simplistically COMPLETE of the ""Early Acceess Survival"" genre. I have played/own DayZ, H1Z1 and any other BROKEN and Derpy Early Access on the market and this for some reason is miles ahead of it's competition. It took the simplicity from H1Z1 and tied it in with the Best Parts of DayZ to make one damn good Early Access. It's Scary, Exciting and has F*kin BASE BUILDING.... what more could you ask for? Aside from this I have yet to be killed by PvP and haven't met a single toxic player in the 10 hours I've played in the past 3 days. YES, it comes with some issues like when my frined couldn't download the Cheat Lient through Miscraeted but if you have half a brain it can be solved and it's more than worth it! Bottom line... this game is FUN.			"

								I played this game for almost a month now - specialized on diferent aspects on different servers. I have a nice base on one server - really nice and difficult to build and think of a way to keep others out. Also tried bandit style :)) not really for me, but works in larger groups. And the most basic find stuff to survive and quick decision making really gets you addicted. Best survival game for me.Still has things to improve like bad physics on the bike or bugs on log-out log-in, but improvements have been made and new features always get added even from players suggestions.85 hours on record and counting :)Very raw violence - should be totally rated M or R :D			"

								As you read this review, please keep in mind that I have not played other games in this genre (DayZ, H1N1, etc). When I first got this game about 6 months ago, I first noticed that it was very beautiful (CryEngine) but there wasn't a lot to do yet. The game was just looting and trying not to die. There wasn't a reason to build a base yet, so I never did. But then the developers started to update it more and more, and the time between updates got shorter. Now there's a variety of vehicles, and with storage added, reasons to build bases as well. The increase in features lead to an increase in players, too, which raised the tension and the stakes, and the fun. There's mutants and animals which add a lot of life to the world. During the day, I'm on edge. But at night, I'm terrified. I think it goes without saying that when you play a game like this, you should be much more scared of human players than of any creature or monster. This game delivers on that concept. I've never felt more tension or stress in either a singleplayer or multiplayer game before Miscreated.The vehicles are pretty good but you're likely to encounter a glitch when using them. For example, cars suddenly becoming silent, bicycles getting stuck in a curb or staircase, four-wheeler having a physics glitch (sending it into centripetal hell and killing you in the process). But these issues are rare and don't affect gameplay too often.Right now, it's pretty easy to get your base broken into; I'm not saying that's an unintended aspect of gameplay, but I wish there was a way to secure my belongings without making a ridiculous floating platform (which the devs are trying to eliminate, anyway). But maybe I'm just too dumb to hide my stuff well. This is a great game to play with friends; if you play it by yourself, it's still fun, but you'll become extremely paranoid, and it's downright terrifying to hear a stranger's footsteps outside when you're looting a house.In addition to the game's merits and ever-growing features, the devs are highly communicative on Twitter and Reddit, which is really nice, and a refreshing change compared to many Alpha games. I don't think I've had a better experience with an alpha title than I have with Miscreated. This game just keeps getting better all the time.			"

Early Access Review
								           I actually like the progress this game has made of the past months. First off I must say this game is huge. It runs fairly well and framerates have gotten better. The new lightning/fog mechanics give a greater ambience to the game. Visually it is more appealing then other survival horrors.  Basebuilding is fun yet simple. Weapons are hard to come by as they should be. Crafting has gotten alot better.  The flashlight along with night time adds another element to the game. One thing I will say is how the car/vehicle mechanics work. The fact that all cars start with nothing in them is a bit of a pain. Finding one tire on the map let alone four is quite the task. Perhaps the cars should spawn with all tires and add a mechanic that enables the tires to be shot and blown out. In a nut shell, I ended up spending four hours looking for car supplies and ended up with 2 tires and spark plugs, half a tank of gas, battery and and oil. Point is it took me far too long to the point where I just wanted to give up. I still to this point have yet to get in a working vehicle and have only encountered 2 and a handful of bicycles which were recently added. Another thing, which im sure has been mentioned and will be addressed is the Mutant rate/AI.  They have gotten alot better but are honestly almost do not exist in the game. Its to a point where I do not even fear them. Perhaps make them a bit tougher and have a better range of sight. Make them run the same speed as the survivors that way they are more cautious around them instead of simply running by knowing they wont catch them. I have actually seen a few players run around purposely having them chase them collecting several (5-10) and make a game out of it. While comical, I don't think the Mutant's AI were made as a joke.  All in all, this game has alot of promise and I enjoy what has become of it in the early development. The sky is the limit, Kudos the developers for sticking to it. Will continue to play. I baught a 4 pack for myself and friends so I am hoping convince them to continue giving Miscreated a chance. 8/10  "

								Early access but best survival game out yet.Working features:Loot, AI, cars, guns, base building, dynamic weather systemMissing features:Small stuff like directional VoIP, some parts of the map are closed off as they are not developed yet.The map is for sure the best feature of this game. Cool places to explore like cave systems and abandoned nuclear bunkers. The towns are ""hand crafted"" to the point where no 2 houses look the same. The big city up north is the best city in any survival town seen yet. The map is small but dense so you never too far away from a cool point of interest (town,airfield,cave,etc...)Base building is still in it's early stages... kinda like Rust legacy but there is a limit on how much loot you can hoard because you can't build more than 2 storage boxes and so you need to roam for food and water so there are not sniper towers where people camp all day. The ammo is rare enough too so having a ridiculos stockpile is rare.The game is finished enough to where it's fun for hours and hours of continuous gameplay and it will only get better.  "

								I first played this game about six months ago and I criticized it very hard. Any little thing that I saw that wasn't great I hated. But coming back to this game after that six month break (Because I got the game and didn't play much of it because of everything I hated) I realized how much effort was put into this game and how beautiful the game world really is. And I also realized that I did not want to like this game because I did not want it to be better than DayZ. But it is. Now I guess you can label me as a ""DayZ Guy"" because it is one of the most played games on my account, but just playing this game for 4 hours I already had way more fun then the 148 hours I have on DayZ at the moment. If you are a fan of survival games than you NEED to get Miscreated. It gets updated rather often which is what we all want when it comes to survival games. But there is one con to this game in my opinion. And that is the crafting system. It's just very inconvenient and difficult to use. Other than that you will fall in love with this game very quickly if you just appreciate what the game is now and what it will be in the future.			"

								Let me first say Miscreated is one of the most underrated games on steam. The time and attention to detail that the devs spend on this game is impressive. The different weather patterns all the way to looking for loot. Still in early development. Coming from arma (dayz mod, exile mod, etc) the map is smaller. However they make up for lack of map size with content which I believe is extrememly important! Almost every single building is not only enterable but has many different rooms to loot. Excellent chances for pvp. Weapons and ammo are a little scarce (I would personally like to have a little more ammo drops)A couple of draw backs I have (now understand this game is still in early development) is the storage in your base. I have seen many many complaints about wanting to stop ""hoarding"" of loot. I personally on all of my survival games love to go get more and more and more loot. I can never have enough. I hope that they make it to where you are not limited to 1 storage crate of each size because I really feel like with that little amount of storage there is little point to actually building a base. Overall I highly suggest giving this game a shot. You will not be dissapointed. ( and if you are then... oh well... more money for the devs to continue to make this an awesome game :D )			"

								This game looks absolutely beautiful and plays the way DayZ was meant to, as far as the immersion and most player interactions. The developers listen to and care about their community and update semi-frequently with good content and bug fixes.As all early access games are, it can be buggy here and there, but nothing too bad or game-breaking. Looting feels natural, realistic, and immersive. Vehicle spawn systems and mechanics work very well. A few things that could be improved are resource gathering for bases, gunplay, and menu interface.Overall rating: 8/10			"

								My first experience on this game was kinda fun. When i joined a server for first time , i've been handcuffed right on the spot by some mexicans. My friends couldn't help me since i didn't know where i was. I remember they asked me something like ""Yo, boy, who you voted with ?"" I said Donald J.

								Great game, perfect graphics even playing in low quality, also has rain and even tornadoes, in forenoon has fog that minimizes game vision making harder to see something, the game loot doesn't glow and to know where you are it's hard, the thing that is missing it's a group system. Then in few words, this game worth it the invested money for a version that is in Alpha.			"

								Game has too much pottential realy enjoyable unique experience for a survival game I would realy recommend this game but me and my friends have some ideas that would make the game much better.‚óò- We need a way to navigate at least a cumpass would be very good‚óò- Sound effects of flies and seas can be reduced they are much more louder then they should be that I can't hear anything while near a trash can becouse of the flies.‚óò- There are simple bugs while driving for exemple car randomly explode on the way for no reason and while driving with friends third person camera goes kinda crazy and car looks like it jumping or something.‚óò- If there would be any way to increase the weight limit that would be nice it becomes realy annoying later.‚óò- Clan members should have something to locate them on the screen like names on top of their head or something like in arma III couse otherwise clan is useless.‚óò- Make the cars tougher please it's realy stupid that cars can get demaged very bad from little things.‚óò- In some reasonable locations car spawns should be added or increased.‚óò- Some animation should be added for cars and some should be fixed such as entering the car animation or entering the car while aiming will keep you aiming in car without a weapon‚óò- If there would be a way to lock the car that would be awesome. Maybe something like after you install all the required parts for the car and it's ready to go car should have a key inside it that can be picked up and that way can't be stolen instantly and to reset the key you have to replace a part inside the car or something like that.‚óò- There could be a minimum navigation(gps) inside the police cars that can be seen in first person view.‚óò- For weight limit there would be something like limit is 50 but after 40 you lose your ability to run and jump.‚óò- There should be car repairing and modification using metal parts.‚óò- More building types please it becomes pretty boring to loot same apartments again and again.‚óò- Some objects like fances should be climbable its realy annoying to get stuck inside sometimes.‚óò- There is a bug that after filling a canteen it still says empty on the inventory and wont fix until you reopen your inventory.‚óò- Zompie encounters should be increased its realy hard to see or find a zombie in game.‚óò- There should be other ways to carry the flashlight like ducktaping or maunting it to the helmet or T shirt or finding an already flashlight maunted helmet.Optional: There can be something like after you die with large amounts of weapon loot you should respawn with one of the melee weapons to protect yourself becouse after respawning in the same place you die its realy annoying to get killed by the same guy again and again.Thank you for reading I hope you consider adding these features to the game sorry for my not-perfect english.

								I've played alot of post apoctoliptic survival games and honestly this is one of the best I have played in some time. The game looks gorgeous running on the cryengine, gameplay feels fluid and easy to get a hang of. The mechanics are all there with the crafting system, food and water hunger system and all of it is super impressive for an early acess game. Among all these types of games I play so far this and dayz are my too favorites. The only ""glitches"" I have found have been the actions and some things involving the mutants but unlike other survival games you can acutally kill them and or get away from them. The develepors are super responsive and are always updating and making tweets to make this game even better! I highly recommend this game to everyone who loves this type of genre to get it, you wont be disappointed.			"

								11/10 Ran friend over with a bicycle and killed him.-----------------------------------------------------Real talk though.Pro:This game runs like champ and the atmosphere will give you chills.especially at nightime when its so dark you are forced to use the flashlight. I've put a really okay amount of time into DayZ. It's sad to say but with only 4 hours into this game so far it's already better. Nothing will beat the times I have had in DayZ but this game captures the genre very well. It did what all the other ""Sur-zombie Games"" couldnt do. Capture the feel of how a desolate world with some sort of viral aftermath should have.When going in looting it feels scary, it feels distant, and you will feel alone.It looks good. It Runs good. It. Feels. Good.Con:Server browser is poop.minor bugsNeeds updates (if that can be counted as a con)TL;DR - Runs and looks 10x better then DayZ, server browser is poop, 11/7 is gewd, would run buddy over with bicycle again.

								Although there tends to be a little bit of a shaky start and sometimes files are corrupted (easily fixed, just googled the issues), I'm glad I bought this game first and took some time to compare these reviews to that of DayZ, which has apparently become infamous for KOS players and not as many freed up servers. Also, it cost less and it's definitely worth it. I've played for at least three hours straight literally just walking around and getting accustomed to the environment and controls, and I can't say how many times I caught myself jumping at the slightest sound (howl or snarl alike).While I'd love to try DayZ and other games like that, I'll be sticking to this one for a while. I don't want my gaming experience to be ruined by KOS players, hackers, etc. If I can just sit alone in a server by myself, I don't care. It's fun, immersive, and I have been stuck in the night cycle for a while and I decided to take a break to write this (because holy crap, I'm sick of flinching at the breeze).Only ""cons"" for me is trying to remember my server names for certain characters, but I'm pretty sure that's easily taken care of, and MAYBE the fact it's a little laggy no matter how low the graphics are. I don't mind the drag in the camera (turned motion blur off) or the lack of tips or map.			"

								Awesome game, I've got to say I was nervous after I purchased and read some of the reviews others have left but this game is very, very good. There is room for improvement but what others have to remember is the game is still young. The only dislike that is really annoying at the moment is the servers. It takes a very long time to actually get in the server you want (you'll find you stick to one server because of base building). Speed the server up and this game can really go far.			"
