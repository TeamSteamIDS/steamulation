Early Access Review
								Even though it's not finished I believe this game blows Game Dev Tycoon out of the water. The only thing GDT has on MGT is being able to build and distribute consoles, which could possibly be added in the future. (I'm not going to compare this game to Software Inc, because it's more about software in general and doesn't go into too much depth(yet) with game development like this and others in the genre).Features-Build each room within your building, giving you more control over your company (you can have 100's of employees if you want, it gets a little hard to manage in it's current state, but hopefully that will be fleshed out more)-Employees skills raise by developing/working (Game Dev has this as a mod, but I feel it works better in this game) also the skills make more sense (GameDesign, Programming, Graphics, Music & Sound, Office Work, Speed, Work Will).-Employee needs (Bathroom, heating/cooling, and furnishings)-Research new genres, topics, engine features, game sizes (B - AAA), and game improvements.-Has WAY more Genre and game topics than GDT, and there is no game genre/topic matching (which never made sense to me, there's no such thing as a bad genre/topic match in the real world, only bad games).-Release updates/patches for your games after release. (In the beginning you won't be able to fix bugs during development, but you can after release by either patching the game, which will remove a lot of bugs. You can update the game and choose to remove some bugs while also improving the game, which will improve sales as well).-Eventually you can have seperate rooms to improve your game:              ~Game Design (Remove bugs during development and improve gameplay, also where you make game reports)             ~Music Studio (obviously improves music/sound)             ~Graphic Studio (dem textures)             ~Motion Capturing (recently added, I'm not to sure on the specifics, but I believe it improves graphics/gameplay) -Sell developed game engines and make money off games made with them (you can select the initial price of the engine and the % you receive from sales)-Customer support room to keep your fans happy once you reach a certain amount. Can also run campaigns to increase fan base-Publish your game through other companies (they will produce and distribute your game, and occasionally market it).-Publish your own games! (To do this you need a production room and a storeroom. You can actually choose how many copies of a game you want to make, including the price and things like a t-shirt, game manual etc. You can also re-release older games and eventually release game packages)-Marketing!-Build a Server room and release your own MMOs! (Yes Game Dev Tycoon has MMOs too, but it works so much better in this game) You actually choose the Subscription price of your game and have to have enough servers to support your subscribers. Unlike other games, once your MMO stops selling copies it stays on the market, and you can release expansion packs. Expansion packs will act as seperate games (in terms of sales and marketing), but it will also make your base MMO start selling again. There is also a F2P option that is not usable at the moment, so hopefully the way MMO's work in general will be improved.-Licenses for movies, books, or other games that you can buy. I honestly don't even use this feature as it's not necessary and there's always another game already released under every license anyway so I don't really see the point.Possible negatives-(This one really isn't a big deal, but it annoys me). I'm not sure if the Dev is foreign, but the FPS genre is called Ego-Shooter. Never heard this term before and I don't like it at all, I could see ""Ego-shooter"" being used for more arcadey style games like Doom, Serious Sam, and maybe even COD to an extent, but it's not a term used in the U.S.-Managing huge teams can be annoying if you want to make sure you have the best people for each room. There is an auto-assign feature, but I'm not sure how it decides to assign employees.-As I stated before, you can't create consoles like in GDT, but hopefully it will be added.-The aspects of controling the way your game turns out (other than the skills of your employees) have specific settings for each genre that are considered ""correct"", but in my opinion GDT's sliders don't work much better.-No real End game as of yet, and no New game+ like GDT has.-Each genre has pictures for your game that depend on the level of technology applied used, but don't differ between topics. Ex. if you make a Fantasy Rpg and a Knight Rpg on the same engine, the pictures will be the exact same. Granted no other game in this genre has this from what I've seen.If you enjoyed GDT then buy this game, it's way better IMO. I believe this game is worth the price even if it's not finished.			"

												Now that the game has been released, I guess it's time to give it some attention. According to Steam Spy, this game has sold ~50,000 copies while Game Dev Tycoon (GDT) has over 1mio owners here on Steam alone. In my opinion, this doesn't reflect the games' general quality at all. It's not a perfect game, but a good tycoon sim and a lot better than its direct competitor GDT. I will try to argue what makes this game good on its own, but I guess some comparisons to GDT have to be brought up. But first, for the lazy ones:TL;DR: It's a good game. Do you like games like Game Dev Tycoon or older tycoon games like Theme Hospital? Buy it. It puts together the room and staff managment from Theme Hospital with the game dev elements from GDT. Is it perfect? No, it has some problems that might annoy you.After choosing some attributes of your company founder, in which country your studio is located in (which will have impact on your sales) and the game's difficulty, you'll start as a small dev in the early 80's. In the beginning, you'll try to survive by making small (and probably mediocre) games and doing minor additional missions to earn some money. As the time passes your possibilities and obligations grow. You have to research new technologies, build different facilities to ensure the quality of said technolgies in your games, hire staff specialised on those techs (or hire uneducated ones and put them into your training facilities), fix bugs, release updates to keep the game interesting, create marketing campaigns, analyze your games etc. You'll also have to switch your studio's location: In the beginning you develop your games in a garage. But you want to end up being a big publisher with over a hundred staffmembers working for him. So the garage might not be the perfect place for long.This game offers you a lot of different means to make some money. Besides the obious ""develop a game and give it to some publisher to release it"" these are some of your options: you can start developing a console, you can become a publisher yourself that releases not only his own games but also other studios' games. If you do so you have to manage the content of your boxed games (will it come with a coloured manual and a free T-Shirt or will it be a bland box with nothing but the game's CD in it?). You even can become the next Electronic Arts and buy other developers, harvest their success and after you have ran down the company sell it again.This is what sets the game apart from GDT, imo: the possibilities. You can focus on becoming one thing or do a lot of stuff at once. This raises the replayability of the game greatly. Another difference is the game's size: in GDT your highest amount of developers is around 6 or 7 guys. Well, in Mad Games Tycoon you might end up with over 100 people. You can have one team that does nothing but developing updates and expansions for your latest World of Warcraft clone. A different team does nothing but market your games and consoles. Working at multiple games at once? Not a problem at all. Fire all your dudes and do nothing but earn money with the games coming from other developers? Sure.But the game has some problems. When you play it for the first time you can't know what it takes to develop a good game. Sliders decide, how much focus your developers lay upon a certain aspect of the game. How do you find out the perfect placement of a slider? Trial and error. You can analyze your games later to check if your slider placement was correct, but it will take a while. As soon as you know the perfect 'slider position' you'll produce one great game after another. This also was a big problem of GDT and while the devs in this game made it a tad more elegant, the same problem remains. A different problem of the game is its way of building: Sure you can design a nice office that looks nice. But it will be more efficient to put as many desk as possible into small rooms. Your staff won't mind as long as you give them what they want as soon as they complain. I also have some problems with the game's visuals. It looks like a tycoon game from the 90's (while obviously having nicer textures etc.). You might find that charming or disturbing - that depends on your taste.But in the end, this is a game worth its 15 bucks (or your regional equivalent). It's a great and fun indie tycoon game and worth a shot. Like in so many tycoon games you'll get your money's worth, if you like this genre.			"

								A game in the vein of Game Dev Tycoon that aims to add some more depth with features like building & outfitting rooms.While the added complexity is fun at first, the underlying mechanics don't work well. The success of games seems to depend entirely on the amount of ""points"" invested into them. That is, if you have a good and/or large enough Staff, producing a lot of graphics/sound/tech/gameplay points, EVERYTHING will get great reviews.I just got a ""Music FPS/Sports""-Game without graphics to get the Game of the Year award...I prefer the Game Dev Tycoon model, where even if you sink extreme amounts of time and money into something, it might still flop because the initial concept just doesn't work. Just like in real life.Another aspect is the economy. Income & Development costs do not scale well. Now this might be due to the fact that due to the abovementioned problem, ALL my games were getting 90%+ reviews no matter what I did, but essentially I ended up with unlimited money at some point. There is also not a really good progression system. Basically my first smash hit allowed me to go straight from a small studio to a huge office building, hire 40+ people and spam games with multiple production rooms/studios. Simultaneously, I could train a dozen code-monkeys in the training room which are now maxed out in most stats and producing the aforementioned >90% games en masse.Now of course a lot of this might still be due to alpha status and might get finetuned down the road, but at its current state I would not recommend the game.Overall, it does not handle its own complexity well and is fairly easy to exploit. A lot of refining in regards to the ingame economy is needed in order to make it more challenging & fun, so buying it now is really kind of a gamble.			"

  Introduction            	Mad Games Tycoon is a really cool simulator that allows you to form your own game studio and rise through the ranks, from your garage to huge mega million dollar company. You can’t deny that Mad Games Tycoon does not seem a bit similar to Game Dev Tycoon (I guess a lot), but this is not a bad thing. I personally loved Game Dev Tycoon and Mad Games Tycoon deserves love in its own light. The one thing that really sets Mad Games Tycoon apart from Game Dev Tycoon is the fact that it allows so much more customization.(Office Upgrades, Storefronts, Paintings, Plants, different desks, and bookshelves One of the huge draws that Game Dev Tycoon had for me was all of the references to real life game companies and devices; Mad Games Tycoon only expands on this and creates even more amazing references and jokes. (Cupcom, EA, Pony, L ★, and tons more)  Pros                Tons of real life references Typical/Amazing gameplay Ton of customization  Great amount of graphic options Plenty of upgrades and gameplay elements     Cons               Slow paced Music gets a bit annoying (This may just be me) Not as simplistic as Game Dev Tycoon     Conclusion                 	Mad Games Tycoon is tons of fun and just builds of the Game Dev Tycoon formula. If you had fun or are looking for something more complicated game dev sim, Mad Games Tycoon is exactly what you should look at.  It add tons of customization and more in depth game elements. Mad Games Tycoon is a must have for anyone who enjoyed Game Dev Tycoon. -HiPFiRED   If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

								Mad Games Tycoon is a game with an identity crisis. It's not sure whether it wants to be an economic simulator for the games market, or a game studio micro-management simulator, and because of that it fails pretty poorly at both. A lot of the reviews laud the game for doing more than Game Dev Tycoon, but Game Dev Tycoon's simplicity is part of why the game is attractive.The micro-management in MGT is quite tedious at times. When you create a game, you have to select all the priorities, focuses etc. This part is fine. You then have to click on your graphics department and improve the graphics, then click on the audio department and improve the audio, then click on the QA department and improve the gameplay, then click on the motion capture studio and improve the filming & animation. Six times for each of these departments. Similarly, you'll need to micro-manage your production department.The marketing department can auto-repeat its campaigns, but I'd like to see this expanded into a queue system, where you can give a department jobs and have each job executed when the last finishes. I'd also like to see the ability to link up the QA, graphics & audio departments with a specific development department, so that when I start making a game, those departments automatically queue the improvements I've researched (or at least, so that when I add things to my queue, they're automatically done on the right game).The development cycle is also very inaccurate. My team of 16 developers (plus 4 QAs, 4 graphics, 4 audio, 4 motion capture) could barely put out an MMO *expansion* every 3 years. Treyarch is a similar-sized studio, and they can put out a full AAA title every 2 years. Game Dev Tycoon has a 'hype' system which allows me to predict my game's sales. In MGT, I can run a media campaign but I can't have any idea how much it's influenced sales, how many people it's reached etc. It would be great to see more media interactions like interviews, followup articles when my games reach landmark sales or news about my competitors' games.This brings me onto the other side of the coin, the market simulation. It feels like MGT is trying to simulate a market, this is something I really wanted in Game Dev Tycoon, but it's a very poor simulation.The competition never seem to decline. They grow until they are valued at $200 million, and then grow no more. A market simulation should correctly simulate their studios in the same way it simulates mine, with the games produced, their scores and their marketing determining which companies thrive and which die and/or are bought. Similarly, I've not seen any of the console manufacturers die. Atari, Sega, Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony are all active in 2050 in my game, all sitting between 8 and 20% market share.If you're going to simulate this, you'd also need a better media engine to display the information to the player. My competition are buying each other? The RPG market is saturated right now because 5 AAA RPGs were announced at E3 this year? Right now it feels like the competition only exist to be bought and to offer me terrible games to publish. Similarly, the studios I buy, even after being upgraded to 5 stars, rarely give me a game with higher than a 70% score. These studios were winning Game of the Year before I bought them.Companies should be created (it wouldn't be hard to create random company names) on a regular basis, most would go out of business after one game, but some would go on to be a success. Companies should buy each other. Publishers should buy developers. 'Franchises' should exist, which have fans (separate from company fans) and are transferred when you buy their owners.Minor bones to pick:- Random game titles destroy immersion, 'Rabbit Quest' the sports simulation and 'Ice Hockey Manager' the ego shooter? Please create lists of topic/genre specific terms and a better algorithm to create the names.- Engines are ridiculous. I managed to get from 1980 to 1995 without releasing a game. I just researched, created engines and sold them for $0 + 40% of profit. I made an absolute killing and got to my 3rd office this way.- The game is too easy. By the end I could buy all the devs for pocket change, and none of them grew to my size/scale.- No Linux/Mac support in 2015.- Performance was poor even on modern (i7, 8GB RAM, Intel HD4000) hardware.- The Marketing menu doesn't have a confirm button. ALL of the other menus do. This has caused me to waste $ on the wrong campaigns multiple times.- Staff item requirements are ridiculous. I had to buy a cheap refridgerator for my staff room even though I already had the expensive one, had to buy an orange chair in an office where everything was blue, etc.The game is not without its positives, you really do get a lot of choice, and a lot of control over the focus and design of your studio. You get to know your staff, you can train your teams; you can find a publisher, self-publish or even publish other studios' games. The game has charm and can be enjoyable at times. It's just that the lack of difficulty and a deeper market simulation overshadows the positives.MGT has a lot of ambition, but really isn't well-tuned in any of it. It is in early access, and if the developers can tighten the scope a little and fix the balance issues, it shows promise to become the forerunner in this emerging niche. Until the developers make the changes I've mentioned, though, I wouldn't recommend anyone spend their money on this title.			"

												I'm a huge fan of tycoon games and this one is probably one of the best I've played, BUT:Most of the positive reviews were in regards to EA development and developer's response to players feedback, not that much on gameplay itself which certainly has some flaws. After 24hrs of playing this game, I feel a bit dissapointed, and I will try to explain in as much detail as I can.Some of the biggest flaws for me at least are replayability, game depth and difficulty and some minor flaws are lack of polish in certain areas.-ReplayabilityI had only 2 restarts before I made it to the endgame, from the earliest start (1980), slowest game setting and highest difficulty, where I managed to get to a pretty big profit and it all started to become pretty much repetitive. I don't feel that there is much to be done differently in a new restart, so I really see no point in doing that.-Game DepthAlthough there are quite a lot features you can add to your games, the closer you get to an endgame, the more you feel like there is not much more tweaking to do. I pretty much soon found myself cranking the game speed to max, selecting everything there is for my new games or my updates and started looking for something new I could do to amuse myself, but sadly there really wasn't much more to do, and it was only year 2014. Sure there were some new technologies comming up, but I really didn't care much about them, as they wouldn't make much difference because you could repeat your last succesful recipe and make the best game over the competitors.-DifficultyI really don't find myself as a harcore player that plays games on legendary setting, and I've played only few games on highest difficulty, but in this game I decided to start immediately after I figured the basics in the tutorial, and succesfuly made it to the endgame, continuously being on the top over my competitors, and even producing 100% game in the early endgame.-Minor flawsI personally feel there should be some automated procesess like managing an auto-update of your game for your developers over a certain period of time. Also there should be some kind of an option to save room layout because every time I moved my company to bigger offices, I felt pain of creating rooms that were working for me in the previous office, and not to mention selecting my workers one by one and assigning them to appropriate rooms all over again. Overall, I feel the game was fun for about 20hrs, but if I knew that it would be only one playthrough for me, I definitely wouldn't pay more than 10$ for it, because I like my tycoon and management games to be much more replayable than this one.Still Recommended - 8/10 "

								Mad Games Tycoon is a pretty awesome game developer management sim. It's one of the few early access games I've bought, but I'm irrationally obsessed with Game Dev sims like Game Dev Tycoon and Game Dev Story. Eggcode's take on game dev management adds much needed customization options and depth to the experience by allowing you to build rooms and assign employees to specific rooms to perform specific tasks.Before I get to the bad, I would like to say up front that I freaking love this game. I've had tons of fun and I think it's absolutely worth the purchase if you enjoy tycoon games or want another take on the Game Dev Tycoon style of management sims. The team at Eggcode is a standout example of how to do early access right and deserves recognition for their constant bug fixes and content patches that range from adding new rooms and employees to improving the UI. That's also part of the frustration of this game. I'm sure that this was a gameplay choice, but having to build special rooms for certain tasks gets annoying. For example, the games core development all happens in one room. Bug fixes have to take place in a seperate room for QA. If it takes the QA team longer to squash the bugs than it takes for the core team to finish development on the game, the development room is rendered useless until you choose to launch the game. Not to mention, the development team can't help fix bugs unless they're dragged away from development and pushed into the QA room. I get that the music studio, art offices and motion capture rooms should be standalone, but why can't the core staff improve level design?That is my biggest issue. Everything else is a minor problem. I don't like how many clicks it takes to assign tasks to almost every room except for the development rooms. The UI isn't that great. The art isn't terribly nice to look at and I wish there were more (or custom) logos to choose from. But the art didn't effect my enjoyment.Like I mentioned above, I love this game. It's fun and I've lost afternoons to this game. I can't wait to see how Eggcode continues to improve this already enjoyable game.			"

								I've put 20 hours into this game and I'll probably put many more. I've played several Game Dev sims and this is the only one besides Game Dev Tycoon that I have thought was worth the money. I loved Game Dev Tycoon and have spent quite a bit of time on it, I was even part of the group that bought it back before it was on steam and was still in development. I have crafted numerous companies in that game but was always at the end left wanting a little more. Mad Games Tycoon gave me that. There is a lot more to being successful in this game and once I got the point my company was making real money and was in a medium sized building I found myself constantly engaged. Between marketing, development, research, employee training, meeting employee desires, hitting trends, contract work, rearranging, etc I stayed on the move constantly. The career felt so much longer than GDT's (which if you can't tell is the standard for me) and I even wanted to keep playing after the consoles stopped rolling in from other companies, which is usually when I would restart in GDT. It took quite a few hours to get to that point too because you can choose several options when choosing difficulty regarding how quickly time passes. Of course in game there are the standard Sims style speed buttons but you can choose how quickly beyond that days pass. After 20 hours I have a company worth 16 billion dollars with several successful consoles, MMO's and AAA titles to my name as well as a 97% positive reputation in the industry. Even after all that I still want to keep playing, maybe even restart now that I know what I am doing and see how fast I can get back to that point. I loved this game so much I actually took the time to write this, my first written steam review. That should say something.Gameplay: 10/10Replayability: 8/10Fun Factor: 10/10			"

***Disclaimer: This is a long review! Sorry.***Allow me to preface by saying that I own both the Kairosoft original 'Game Dev Story' on my phone as well as the similar release Game Dev Tycoon here on steam. Huge fan of both, but there was always something missing in a way. I feel like this game takes the things that I liked about both of those games(time/micro management), removes the things that I didn't like(RNG), and adds a few new things to keep me engaged(building)! I spent all day playing this yesterday without even realizing it. How do they compare? Here is my breakdown so far: Game Dev Story/Tycoon- You reasearch technology and genres while doing contracts in between for extra cash so that you can eventually release big titles, gain fans, and maybe even take over the world? The not so fun thing about these games was that if you got lucky and managed an amazing score on a certain game, future releases would be forever held to that standard which in turn made it very tedious to try and stay afloat while releasing a quality product that your fans would like. Half of the time the score would seem a bit random even if you did all the right things like combining the right genres and putting your strongest team to work on the more dificult parts. It would get frustrating when you would lose power or your machines would break down, ruining all progress on any of the titles you work on. This isn't so bad at first, but it happens more as the game goes on which effectively makes the time and care you put into making a good game title pointless. You also had to grind out 'Research Points' to be able to learn about anything which took valuable time away from making money among other things. In short, while fun at first, but was hurt by seemingly RNG mechanics and too much micro management which I never thought possible. Mad Games Tycoon- Still research everything from technology to genres but it only requires money. You can actually design your game company with special rooms just for your developers, researchers, marketers, customer service reps, etc. You can even build a warehouse/production area so you can publish all your games in house and watch them fill the shelves! It made it really easy for me to keep track of who does what and making sure they were on task. You don't have to worry about a previous game's high score effecting future releases with unrealistically imposed standards. You don't lose power or progress and your employee stats are much clearer and easier to gain. You don't have to grind research or any other kind of currency besides just money which allows me to spend my time doing other things to help my company thrive. Training your employees is much less costly and everything from their stats to the game creation seems to be a lot more streamlined. I also love that you can change where any of your employees are working with a simple click and drag.As far as early access titles go, this product is pretty polished! My only gripes are that once your company starts to get REALLY big the game starts to struggle with the load. I had the big 2 room office which is the largest one you can get and while most things were still running smoothly, the hiring window was really laggy. I also wish there was a way to hit pause on the game time while a dialog box is open notifying me of something so I don't lose time in between tasks. Things to keep in mind:This game, like its predecessors, can be very unforgiving at first til you learn how everything works. Expect to restart your game a few times within the first hour of playing as you get the hang of it. Don't be afraid to exlpore and make mistakes. Try new things! When in doubt, save first! You can reload if things go badly.You have toggles on the bottom of your screen in case you keep accidentally picking up furniture when trying to click an employee.Keep an eye out for a sad face icon on the lower left hand side of your screen. That is your employees trying to tell you they need something to thrive. It's usually shelves or fire extinguishers so fix it. Otherwise they work at half their normal speed.			"

Recommended First I will say it is different to its competitors, this game has a lot of different featuresFor an early access game it is extremely stable no crashes I played for 11 hours straight without a crash and for me it is bug free, the game play is smooth controls are simple and basic which is always good in this style of game.Game looks good very clean and crisp looking, it has a wide range of resolutions it even has mine which is 5760x1080 so this is great start.Of course it is early access so everything is not in the game yet, but because the game plays and feels so smooth you would almost think it is in finished state, it is very hard to find decent early access game that does not have to many issues and this game is one of the good ones defiantly worth its current price tag.The game is a lot of fun a joy to play and I look forward to updating this review as they add new things to the game.Review here if interested

								Since many of you will probably compare this to Game Dev Tycoon, I suppose it would be a good idea to base this review off of that.For starters, Mad Games has much deeper strategy that what is in Game Dev Tycoon. You also have competing game companies that you have to deal with if you want the sacred GOTY Award. Or if you'd prefer to be aggressive, you can just buy out all your competition.As far as comparisons go, they both focus around creating vidya games as well as the gaming empire that surrounds them. Your lil people level up the more they do things, and bankruptcy is a huge threat.Or to put it simply, Mad Games Tycoon is an excellent compliment to Game Dev Tycoon, and they're both good on their own.

								To sum up this game as simple as possible, take Game Dev ""Tycoon"" and then add in standard Tycoon space/room management, and you end up with this. It has a lot more things to do game play wise then GDT and feels more enjoyable even in early access but definitly does feel like it suffers from the same issue of GDT of each genre having a perfect slot for the sliders  to get the best sales, so doesn't really let you make silly things unless its in the tending right now things.With that said, if you hated GDT then this probably isn't for you, if you thought GDT was meh but like tycoon games like Theme Hospital, Rollercoster tycoon, et then you may find this game enjoyable even though it has some of the same issues as GDT. And if you enjoyed GDT and hate normal Tycoon games then you may not like it, and if you liked GDT and love other tycoon games then you will probably love it.All in all it's definitly not a must buy, but this is definitly much more of a tycoon game then GDT was and has more things to do.  I personally liked this game a lot more but I also grew up on games like Airport Tycoon, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Railroad Tycoon, etc so I probably like tycoon games more then I would if I didn't grow up on them.

												THis is more a review of what the developer has done in regards to the Steam EA process.I truly believe that Valve should use the development process, history and community interaction of MGT as an example of just how Early Access CAN and SHOULD be done.So all I want to say besides that is to the developer.....Congratulations on moving to the full release - I know you have put a huge amount of work into this great game. You have listened to and taken advise and suggestions from the community, worked quickly and diligently to remove bugs and worked clearly and logically forwards in the updates and improvements.EVERYONE who uses Steam EA should take note that THIS is indeed how to do EA.I hope you have/will make bucketloads of cash.....and that you then take a small break, then carry on working on MGT whilst stunning us with your next EA game concept.THANKS......

												I love this game. Think Game Dev Tycoon, just you can also be a publisher, more topics, far more indepth, with customizable buildings, a plethora of different room types each with their own specific role in the production/develop of video games, items to customize your Game Company, unlimited time span to play in, and best of all, ludicrously addicting gameplay. And it's only version 0.15! Yes, I know, I sound like a total fanboy... but Game Dev Tycoon left me wanting/craving a Game Development Company Management Simulation that had real depth, that could expand upon the already simplistic yet addicting gameplay with a tad more strategy. Well, this game is it. Absolutely recommend the finished product!Full Release Gameplay:

Early Access Review
								I don't often review Early Access titles, but I also don't tend to buy them either.  This is a very worthy exception.  As a game dev myself, I've definitely played Game Dev Tycoon and had my fun with it but found the lack of depth quite lacking.  I wanted more control over my environment even if it might not resemble a real game studio.  Mad Games Tycoon brings that to the table - this is the first one I've played that felt more like I was crafting an actual studio and reacting to the market place with all its ups and downs.For an Early Access release at this price point, I'm surprised at how much is already in the game.  At this point you have a functioning sandbox with a compelling upgrade tree and system to work out for progressing your company.  Customizing the office to do what I want is already there, letting me prioritize how I want - including making multiple projects happen at once as my studio expands.  You can decide pretty early on how you want your studio to function, as a studio that primarily specializes in its own projects and later on you can even build your own production warehouse and start printing and publishing for others.  You can be a handheld developer or a AAA MMO powerhouse.  The sheer amount of options you can build up to as the projects grow in complexity is mind-boggling even at this early stage.Right now the biggest con is that you hit a point where about late game you start to run out of research options.  There's no campaign or score, its just the sandbox, so you will hit a point where all you can do is just make millions.  It takes quite a while to hit that part, and the office space upgrades in particular are expensive enough to give you goals to work towards, but there isn't as much competition as I'd like.The other big con is that the tutorial is VERY short and a lot of features are not well explained when they come into play, leaving you guessing how they work.  For example, random events don't provide a lot of data on such things as how long they last - a big deal when you're camping on a game to release it to market AFTER a market crash!  A lot of the data the game tracks isn't useful either, or broken up over several screens when it should be in just one.  I was particularly annoyed that I couldn't just pull up an easy stat screen on a finished project that included release date, sales, financial data, and scores.  The guesswork in the development process could also use some fine tuning - right now, after you ship one game in a genre, the next one you ship in that genre will display arrows providing hints as to which direction you need to devote resources... but nothing more concrete.  It would be better if after shipping a LOT of games in a genre, the UI became more precise to let you know exactly what the sweet spot for resource distribution is.  Right now there's also no data given when you assign priorities to development, leaving you guessing even when you've succeeded as to why you did well.I bring these issues up because updates are rather frequent at the time, and address things like this.  I'll be keeping an eye on this game to see how it keeps shaping up.			"

								First i have to say good job, this game is amazing, i've never seen anything like it.This is not even close to Game Dev Story or Game Dev Tycoon, the depth this game offers and plans to offer is beyond anything these games can offer with or without workshops.You are off for a big rollercoaster of ups and downs it depends on how well the devs listen to positive feedback and how much they  care for the fanbase (which i think will be huge!)The Game Dev Tycoon niche can be expanded to new heights, people always wanted to build video games, it's the dream of any gamer, but nobody knows how to do programming, graphics and such. These Tycoons allow us to live our dream, and the more complex they are the better for us !Early Access State : Playable, a lot of content, probably over 50+ hours of content.Price : Good, could be more expensive for what it offers.Pros : Depth, fun, easyCons : None for now, no bugs, polished game.Update : 13 Hours into the game346$ Million266k Fans33 Years inStill developing new engine researchTop developer in the worldTried producing my own CD's, you can add goodies such as tshirts, posters, pens etc to your CD packagingHave lots of MMO's like WoW/Elder Srolls Online and my own games out there !

												This game is basically what Game Dev Tycoon should have been. Much richer, many more options and game customizations, much better progression and buildup. Because of that it may feel, at times, that there isn't enough information about all the different options. But that's easily remedied with a little good old fashioned trial and error.The wacky company names that are meant to resemble actual companies are a nice touch, but it definitely feels that Game Dev Tycoon also recounted actual historic computer gaming events (on top of the fake names), whereas this game makes no such attempt. Not exactly a gripe, but still worth noting, imo, as I found that a bit lacking.Already thoroughly addicted. 9/10			"

												Mad Games Tycoon is like the Name already says a Tycoon Game. Your task is to build a Game Studio from scratch.  I am a huge fan of “Game Dev Tycoon” so I wanted to play this one for quite a while, and I’m glad that I finally found the time to do so. It all starts small…in a garage...Gameplay Mad Games Tycoon plays like a typical Tycoon game. You start off with some Employees and a few basic skills. As the game progresses you can hire new Employees and build different rooms for the different aspects of Game Design.For Examples: Development/Research/Marketing and many more!When you earned enough Money you can buy a new Building for your Studio. What I really like is that you have to build the Studio by yourself, there are no set rooms. It is all in your hands, and you have to decide how much, of the limited, space each Department gets. Also it is to you furnish every room and check if your Employers like to work for you. Each NPC has their own set of skills in different categories like Game Design, Programming and Sound etc.    Besides that, the game offers you a huge variety of different genres and topics for your games to experiment with.The Game mechanics are working well together and supplement each other.Also Mad Games Tycoon never gives you the feeling to be lost. Beside the good tutorial, the new Gameplay features are added with good time intervals in-between them so you will never feel overwhelmed. I was always exited for what comes next. The game has 4 different difficulties from Easy to Legendary and different “speeds” so it offers a challenge for casuals as well as for pros.  Technic Nothing I can complain here. The graphic is good and helps to keep an overview, which gets important later when you are moving into the bigger Buildings. I never had a single stutter or anything else in my whole playtime. Only the music got annoying for me after some time. Story If you want a Story this game is not for you. Conclusion If you are a fan of games like Game Dev Tycoon or other tycoon games I can definitely recommend the game to you. You will get a great and fun Tycoon Game which offers you many hours of Gameplay. If you’re new to such games but interested in the topic I would say “go for it” The game has a good tutorial that will help you to get into it and it never overruns you with its features.			"

								Enjoy simulation and time management games? Fan of titles such as Game Dev Story/Game Dev Tycoon? Look no further! Mad Games Tycoon is what you have been waiting for.Designed to be deeper then the previous games mentioned and since it's on early access it should be constantly evolving with player feedback. Decent graphics with multiple zoom levels, some amusing tongue in cheek humour and a reasonable soundtrack. Currently without a tutorial but the UI and controls in general are very intuitive so that wasn't a problem. Great game already and one thats easily recommended. Cheers.

												TL;DR: At it's core, this is a more fleshed out Game Dev Tycoon.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of small annoyances born from sloppy design that before long start to add up.  Unless you have a lot of patience, it isn't worthwhile in its present state.  Only recommended if it's on sale, or if a patch cleans things up.I'm writing this review because, honestly, I like this game.  At the same time, though, I can't really recommend it, because of a lot of small issues that add up to a few big ones.This game is, at its heart, a combination of Game Dev Tycoon and Theme Hospital.  It's different enough from the former that things will go very badly for you if you try to use any prior experience.  The latter was what initially drew me to the game, but unfortunately the implimentation leaves a lot to be desired.  In fact, that's where the first big problems start to show up.Much like in Theme Hospital, the player has to create several specific rooms, each with their own unique function.  These must be furnished with a number of items, including generic work stations, cabinets, trash cans, and so on and so forth.  Rooms can only be rectangular, and must have a non-blocked door, but not next to a corner.  This seems like a really, really minor thing, except that it inevitably leads to having to Tetris rooms, sliding them around with the 'move' function until you finally manage to squeeze everything together.The second nuisance is the variety of things rooms require for furnishing.  Having a lot of things you can add based on your tastes is a good thing.  Having a lot of things you HAVE to add, lest you incur a penalty until you find a way to squeeze them into the already-cramped space, is just annoying.The biggest offender is the First Aid stations: you need one of these in every room people are going to frequent, lest they randomly become 'injured' and unable to work for an obnoxiously long span of time.  And even if you've added them to every room, sometimes they just don't work; having to delay a release for a month while you wait for the one specialist you need to recover from a random injury gets old quickly.But the thing that REALLY bugs me is that, if characters don't have a clear path from place to place, they'll just teleport there.  This isn't a bug, there's an animation for it.  This severely undercuts the need to try to be ergonomic, and considering the ratio of space to crap is already a problem, it quickly becomes easier to just stop caring.  At which point a good chunk of the game becomes a tedious distraction, rather than something fun and interesting.The 'Game Dev Tycoon' half of the game fares better, but still has its share of annoying issues.  The biggest of these is that the game is somewhat player-hostile.  The tutorial doesn't explain the stats, failing to intuit what the sliders have to be set to will result in games that fail to make back their development cost, and relevant information is frequently stuck in sub-menus far away from where it might be relevant.Game Reports are an excellent example of this: for starters, you're unlikely to even be able to get them before Year 3, at which point you'd have to already know a good chunk of what they tell you.  Before that, all you'll get is cryptic reviews and the rare email from fans telling you that one of the sliders was too far in one direction or another.Once you've managed to unlock the QA room - WHY they're tied to the QA room instead of the Reaserch Room I cannot begin to fathom - you have to have one or more developers tie themselves up with writing them.  The menu for selecting which games to get reports from is buggy; there is no button to start the queue, the only way I could get it to start required checking off reports until the menu closed itself and the devs started writing them.  While Game Reports are being written, you can't look at existing Game Reports unless you build a second office, or start development on a new game.The entire interface feels kludgy: the Bank icon appears in SOME menus when making selections that have an associated cost, but not others; the escape key does different things depending on where in the menu system you happen to be; information alternates between being readily available and hidden behind several layers of menus; the stats don't have tool-tips, but the engine add-ons do; you get a little picture of your in-game avatar at the start of a new game, but you have no means of customizing it at all, not even the option of picking from among the various pre-fabs that will make up your employees; vital explanations for what things actually MEAN are nowhere to be found; the game remembers slider positions from the last game you made of ANY genre, so you have to either write down their previous positions or avoid making more than one type of game; and so on, and so on.  This feels like an Early Access title that got released six months too early.And the most frustrating thing of all is that past all of the irritation and clutter, a solid game is THIS close to happening.  There is a much greater importance on employee management, and it's a ton of fun to create developer teams for several genres.  But more often than not a parade of things will get in the way, and before long the slog through the sloppy interface and the constant micromanagement of trashcan-radiator-shelf-desk-photocopier arrangments drag the experience down, until it isn't worth it anymore.

Early Access Review
								To be honest: Mad Games Tycoon was more fun then i expected. In my opinion it delivers enough to be worth buying at this stage of development. Be aware though, it's much different from Game Dev Tycoon. Thats either a pro or a con, depending on the way you look at it. I think its a pro and both games are fun in their own way. One isn't better then the other, they're different and can both be lots of fun.If i would compare Game Dev Tycoon with Mad Games Tycoon i would say GDT has more focus on the game development and less on business simulation, where as MGT is much more of business simulation tycoon. For example: in MGT you spend relativly more time on upgrading your building, producing games in your factory and managing your staff. And creating a good game itself isn't much of a challange in MGT, compared to GDT.Pro's:- enough content to meet the expectations at this stage of development- lots of charts and stats to play with- gameplay looks promising, with the more content and challanges it can be a pretty nice game- actual business simulation elements in it, havn't seen that for a while in a game!- lots of fun possibilities, like your own game factoryNeutral:- okay graphics and sound, nothing special- could use some customization options for the chartsCon's:- controls are a bit sloppy, but can be changed pretty easy i assume- creating games isn't much of a challange, it does'nt have to copy GDT but it could be made a bit more challanging- at the point where you run a big business, it gets a bit hard to keep oversight... this could use some work			"

								Since my previous review was from February last year, I thought that it was time I updated my review.Mad Games Tycoon (MGT for short) has seen a lot of progress in the last year. This early access titlle is one of those pears that will continue to see updates until it is finished. The developer continues to improve the game and has on ocasion fixed reported bugs within twenty four hours.Admittedly, that doesn't happen often, since it's better to do a lot of bug fixes in one then dozens of patches to fix single bugs, but it HAS happened. The game supports many languages which is mostly done by other people. That being said, Stefan (that's the dev's name. I think.) could definetely  improve his English. It's a world language and if you release a game on Steam then it's first language should always be English. Well, in my humble opinion at least.My opinion of the game hasn't changed. It is definetly worth purchashing and if you have doubts... Watch a let's play. That should at least show you what the game is like.Now, there are a lot of people who compare MGT to other titles. I'm not going to name those titles here, I don't want to start yet another bash fest, but keep in mind folks, there are only 'so many' ways you can do a game like this.While the art is simiilar to some titles, that could be because of how the game is made.As always, this title is in early access, so some features are still missing, incomplete and there may or may not be imbalances. Always keep early access in mind, because it is ALWAYS a risk and the game can ALWAYS be abandoned mid development for various reasons.Trust me, I know. If and when you buy any early access title, and it goes sour, then you don't have basis to complain. You knew what you were getting into, and the risks you were and are taking. Anyway, buy or not buy?Definetly. BUY.			"

You have freedom here to play how you please; whether that revolves around creating games, leasing your state of the art game engines, or publishing games for other developers. You can CHOOSE how to play and it works perfectly. Mad Games may be in early access but please don't let that deter you. There is already so much here for you to play around with. All in all, Mad Games Tycoon is a really fun management/simulation game that plays like a fully realized early access game.			"

Early Access Review
								Despite the title, Mad Games Tycoon has no correlation to the other Mad game, Tv Tycoon, despite both games sharing a very eerily similar title. The devs deny it but can't help question the likeness. Regardless, Mad Games Tycoon has more in common with Game Dev Tycoon, except that MGT is more indepth and has a lot more too it.Already as an early access title, its got enough features to keep you entertained. Where as Game Dev Tycoon is more of a mobile type of game, and rather simple in design, Mad is designed to be more PC worthy in that it has a lot more features such as running your own production machines, storage and servers for online games that you have to setup. You also have to setup a support team for technical support, and keep your dev team happy and productive with amenities dotted abuot the office. Although I've yet to see any direct consequences of NOT having stuff around to keep your employee morale up, it may become more prominent later on.There's also the fact that you can essentially build your own office and place things where you need them. Mad Games Tycoon definitely reminds me of an old PC game called 'Startup' that had a lot of these features, but in the end was a very poor implementation. MGT seems to have gotten it right, so far at least. Their are a few shortfalls however that the game lacks that I hope the devs work on in the future, this including staff categories and perhaps a more immersive background experience, perhaps a road and some animated cars/people walking by including all the noise that comes with that?I'm also not sure if modding features are ever going to be supported, but hopefully they will.Regardless, if you liked Game Dev Tycoon, or even, if you didn't like it and thought it was too simple, then I can recommend this as so far its a great title, and it looks to improve even more in the near future.

								Ever since I completed Game Dev Tycoon in a few entertaining evenings I have longed for something more.  I waited with much eagerness for some kind of update or sequel but sadly none was forthcoming.  Well thankfully this game came along and I really couldn't be happier.  My review will compare it to Game Dev Tycoon.PROS:Game is slower - it really allows for you to get stuck in and enjoy all the little components that involve running your company.  Also allows for you to keep up with the market instead of being one step behind all the time.More to develop - Not only can you develop games but you can also develop game engines (which is a great way to make some money) this is a lovely touch.  There is also more to develop in terms of what you want in your game.  Plus when you come to produce your own game you have some freedom to decide what to include in the box and how much you want to sell it for.  There are also many more genre's and topics Buildings - it's refreshing to be able to build and equip your own offices.  Much more freedom to decide how much you want to spend/how many people you want working on something.Staff Training - much easier, much quicker and much more effectiveCONS:Can get annoying when people won't work for you because you don't have a certain fridge or seat.  In some cases I have had the luxury version but people won't work for me because I didn't have the cheaper version.UI can get a little annoying.  I can't think of how to describe it but the expanding boxes type of thing becomes monotonous and you have to go through a few boxes sometimes to get what you want.  Be good to be able to pick multiple things too, especially when selecting platforms.  The screen can become a little cluttered also.  Be nice if the full screen would work but I can't seem to get it to do so.No ability to develop your own console (at least not that I have found).No tutorial although it is easy enough to figure out.OVERALL:This is a really good game and I'm sure it will continue to improve.  It is far better than Game Dev Tycoon and provides an enjoyable gaming experience. "

												I don't usually write reviews for games, but for this time I will.I brought Mad Games Tycoon while it was in early access, back in 2015.The developer has been consistently updating the game, with patches and improvements every week, which is a good sign.Not only this gives me confidence in the team, they also listen to feedback.My experience with Mad Games Tycoon is enjoyable, I had no issues with crashes, even in early access.

Early Access Review
								I love Game Dev sims. Game Dev Story was one of those games that managed to burn away many hours of my life. It still is one of my favourite games on my iPhone. And for a long time, it was also pretty much the only game of its kind. Thankfully, Game Dev Tycoon came out in 2012. While it managed to be similar to the aforementioned game, it was also a bit more complex and supported mods. I played it a lot back in the day, but it never became an evergreen for me. Thankfully, Mad Games Tycoon has been in Early Access for some time now and I think it's the right moment to write this little review of it.Mad Games Tycoon takes a similar, but more complex approach to the topic at hand: You start off in a garage, alone, with your new company and you immediately get to build rooms, Theme Hospital-style. You even get to buy furniture, which has some impact on hiring new employees for your young studio. More talented people only pop up, if your company has enough stars, which in turn are determined by the quality of furniture you have in your office. At the beginning, you won't have a lot of stars, since you need most of your money in order to finance your first games. While they are cheap to produce at the beginning, you have running costs, like the salaries of your employees and of course the upkeep of your studio.Producing games is relatively simple at first. You define the name, genre and focus of your game. Each genre has a different focus, so you'll have to experiment and invest in a quality assurance department in order to find out what's the perfect mix. The closer you get, the higher the critics score your game and the better your game will sell. Later on, you can even combine some genres, but some combinations work better than others. You also take care of updating your games, which can have a positive impact on sales.While this certainly sounds easy enough, there are additional things you can take care of. You can decide to develop your engines yourself, which has the added benefit that you can sell said engine to other game producers and get a fraction of the money they make with games that use your engine. This means you'll also have to invest time and money into research. Buying a licence for a third party engine is an option too, of course, but you'll be loosing a portion of your profits.When your games start getting bigger, you'll need to invest in a quality assurance department and dedicated graphics, music and motion capture studios, in order to improve those areas of your games. This also means you'll need bigger offices quick and this is where one of my biggest problems with this game can be found: When you get a new office, you'll need to build all your departments from scratch and reassign your entire workforce. Now, this is manageable the first time around, but it gets tough quickly. In one of my games, I had a workforce of over 100 people and it was impossible to assign them properly in a timely manner. Sure, you have the possibility to arrange them by five different attributes, but that is not enough. The game lacks a filter for unassigned workforce, which makes life harder than it needs to be. Maybe this will be added at some point later in the development.The latest addition to the game is console development. While it doesn't look like it's completely integrated yet, it is pretty awesome to research and develop your own console and push it on the market to let it go up against the NES. You can set the price for your console and developing for it is pretty cheap. Unfortunately, right now I haven't managed to develop an exclusive title that turned a profit...While the gameplay is fun and the systems are comprehensive, the presentation still leaves a bit to be desired. Graphics are simple, yet functional and the music is ok for the first couple of hours but soon starts to get on your nerves. Some soundeffects are overused, especially the telephone, which thankfully can be switched off separately. Performance takes a notable hit too when there are more than 100 people working in your studio.While these are some important complaints I have about the game, I'm also certain that at least some of those things will improve over time. But right now, Mad Games Tycoon is the Game Dev-Sim to go! It's more complex and more satisfying in almost every way compared to similar games.  "

								This game is one of my favourites. It combines aspects from games like GamersGoMakers and Game Dev Tycoon to make an amazing Game Studio Simulation. An all round super-fun game.Pros: -Amazing office building and customization-Brilliant Character customization-Unlocks system is a very good concept-Much more historical than other games, the vanilla game features a lot more platforms to develop for-Any Game Dev Tycoon player or GamersGoMakers player will know the feeling when you make a game engine then 2 days later there are new things to research which make your games better, well in Mad Games Tycoon you can improve old engines by adding stuff to them after release. You can also sell your engines for other companies to buy!-Adding in things to improve your games like Copy Protection, Buying engines and rooms like the Graphic and Music studio, Customer Support and Quality Assurance are great!-Being able to self-publish games is super cool, being able to choose what goes into the box when you sell your game is also just fantastic.-Being able to make patches, bug fixes, MMO Addons and Langauge packs for released games is awesome-Many other features which generally make the game amazing...Cons:-AI pathfinding when you put them in a room can be messed up-Game isn't very challenging after a while-Could do with a workshop so the Community can create mods (more topics, genres, consoles etc.)9.5/10 And its still in Development! Hopefully if they can fix some of the issues and add a few more features then the game will be a 10/10. In my opinion better than Game Dev Tycoon and GamersGoMakers, would reccomend highly.			"

												When Mad Games Tyccon was in Early Access, my feelings for it were quite mixed.I played it for a while and thought it was fun, but it had some poor choices in it's design, and it clearly showed. First of all, it was a drag to start with. Originally, you had to build rooms, place items, place all the mandatory items, create a staff room, place stuff in there, hire people, research a ton of♥♥♥♥♥♥ and then FINALLY make games. To add on to this, the employees needs got stupid at times. I cannot tell you how many times I had to buy new ♥♥♥♥ing couches because a guy didn't want to be hired because the couch I had wasn't orange... allot, actually.These issues bugged me, and mainly detracted me from ever touching the game again... ever.When I heard it got a 1.0 release, I rushed to re-download it and... holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ my issues with the game were addressed!The full game now includes:-A starting state that's less cumbersome and lengthy-Actual fun for more than a few hours!-Time periods to be selected!-Auto-build rooms!-More options!-Employees that aren't complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥nozzles to youAND MORE!I've only just played 20 minutes of the 1.0 release, and so far, I'm impressed.THIS IS HOW YOU DO EARLY ACCESS, DEVELOPERS! TAKE NOTE FROM THIS, NOT ARK!			"

												---- Preface    This game is pretty darn good and it's FINALLY out of Early Access! I bought this game a while back in late 2015 right after looking over the shoulder of my brother who was watching a lets player playing it. I just had to have it because it looked so darn good... and it WAS.    So why is this game so good? Months before this I had bought Game Dev Tycoon and thought it was the most addictive game to ever be released on steam. I played that game for long hours and long nights and would be quite fulfilled, but something was missing.    One might jump to comparing this game to Game Dev Tycoon, however while the game is about making games and becoming a successful game developement or console developement company Mad Games Tycoon takes Game Dev Tycoon's preface to a whole new level in terms of gameplay and offers a much more refined experience in my oppinion.---- Game Dev Tycoon vs. Mad Games Tycoon    Game Dev Tycoon was a brilliant game back when it was released and to this day it provides a fun experience but Mad Games Tycoon gives MUCH more freedom to choose what you want to do with your company. Game Dev Tycoon forces you to follow one path. The only thing you can hope to do in Game Dev Tycoon is to make good games and produce consoles so you feel extremely limited whereas Mad Games Tycoon lets you make almost any type of gaming company that you want. You can be a developer, engineer, publisher, console maker, or my personal favorite: PUBLISHER'S ♥♥♥♥♥! Yup! You can be Bungie, Infinity Ward, Dice, and Treyarch in this game! Nothing like being Activ-Vision's or Electronic Artist's ♥♥♥♥♥ ammaright? Jokes aside, this game gives you many more options than Game Dev Tycoon for what kind of company you want to be. You can also customize your building and choose what kind of offices there would be and how big they would be and where they were. Bottom line, this game is SOOOOO much more customizable and less stream-lined than Game Dev Tycoon. Whether or not that is a good thing is up to you but I LOVE this game's customizability.---- Pros    - Balanced and Rewarding Gameplay    - Not Terrible Graphics    - Runs Well and Doesn't Crash (as far as I have played)    - It's Just Dern Fun---- Cons    - Game Gets Boring at the End    - Graphics Not Amazing, But for a Theme    - Doesn't Really Seem to End, Just Goes On---- Last Thoughts    Mad Games Tycoon is a pretty darn good game but it is not life changing. It's a lot like Game Dev Tycoon with a heck of a lot more to do and a lot more freedom. If steam had a /10 rating system I would rate it at 7.8/10 -Too Many Rooms			"

								This is actually a really fun and awesome game! Although it has it's flaws, it's an outstanding game. There is something that I just keep wanting to be added in...-Franchises/IP- Wouldn't it be cool to create your own IP even bigger than Mario or The Legend Of Zelda series? I always thought it was cool and it'll be super funn to do this. And you can crete cross overs with your own IP and even Ip from other companies! Also make a couple spin off games and have the option to include third party characters in too!-MMO Expansion Packs- MMO's get a lot of money and stay alive for quite some time and it'll be even better to create expansion paks for them. After a while, your MMO just stops selling and it never sells anymore until all subscribers unsubscribe. It'll be awesome if you can create an expansion pack and it suddenly just boosts up your sales and it can either increase your subscibers or just decrease at its normal rate depending on how good the game was rated.-CONSOLES- You need to create consoles in this game. It's a must! Something cool to do as well is also develop a console with partnering with another developer/company to increase the sales, but you would have to give some profit to your helper (Maybe we can decide how much control they have. The  better it sells but less income for you, but little income , and when you give them little control, the console sells less, but you get more profit)And that's pretty much it! Keep up the Good Work!			"

								I wish listed this game, and decided to give it a try when it went on sale via Steam.My expectations were fairly low given that Game Dev Tycoon is already out there, and the fact that this is in early access.  That said, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I had severely underestimated this game.  From a strategic standpoint, as well as various gameplay options, it provides a deeper experience than Game Dev Tycoon (not to continually compare the two, but I'm having a difficult time avoiding that). The added element of designing how to utilize your blank work spaces was a welcome wrinkle, as compared to other games of this type.  I've purchased and played Game Dev Tycoon, GamersGoMakers, as well as Game Dev Story on mobile.  To me, on balance, Game Dev Tycoon was the best of these games.  Once this version is complete, I believe this will be the go-to ""game making"" game for me.If you're a fan of Game Dev Tycoon, this is a must-buy.  Especially if you can get it when it's on sale..  Just make sure you can set aside a few hours first.10/24/16 Edit:There have been significant additions, updates, and various items cleaned up since my initial review.  The developers have been making those improvements steadily, and have been communicative about issues that have arised.  The price of the game has doubled since I initially purchased, but I would say that I would gladly purchase it at the $14.99 US price poitn that it's currently at, given how much enterainment it's provided.  Original recommendation stands, if you liked Game Dev Story, this is a must purchase.			"

Early Access Review
								|Disclaimer: Game goes on sale regularly, so don't pay full price, if you want to buy it.|This game is developing slowly, but steadily into the right direction. It's already completely enjoyable to play and feels feature complete for the price tag.There are a couple of games similar to Game Dev Tycoon out there and this one has become my favourite, because it just keeps throwing features, genres, technologies and stuff at you all the time, basically incorporates the entire Game Developing and Console Developing features from GameDevTycoon while improving on it.If you have played Gamers Go Makers or GameCorp DX you will realize that the genre actually offers a lot of possibilities in regards of adding rooms and facilities. Mad Games is the only game in the field that let's you create big teams doing different things in different rooms with a decent presentation.In addition you get stuff like MMOs with a Server Room, Sequels for great games and Add-Ons for the MMOs.The game development itself is pretty much the same in all games. You can use look-up-tables on the net to create the perfect game or stumble your way to perfection with your own table, or memory. With all the Genres and Topics in the game you will probably go crazy making your own table and definitely unable to remember everything that worked with all the sliders.Mad Games not only takes the ""hint"" feature that Game Dev Tycoon introduced with a patch, but it also lets you re-apply the same setup from a previous project. The advantage being, that you can develop an RPG, then a Sports Game and then another RPG, load the RPG settings and re-adjust from there on out, instead of being forced to manually switch everything back from Sports to RPG. And thanks to the ""hints"" that appear, the more you develop within a certain topic/genre mix, the more of those hints you will see and the better your team becomes.Is it the perfect game? Not by a long shot.It's way too easy too be a successfull developer and the result is that I have no idea how platforms and genre mixes work.Your workers don't age and their wages are quite low in comparison to what they start earning for you. This makes the game easier, but on the other hand you don't get the management horror of a Software Inc. , which is nice.Once you develope a great MMO game you are done. It's GG. You could say that this is realistic and you are probably right. Just look at the history of Blizzard. If you are going for money, go for subscribers. You can also release a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sports game every year without learning anything in the process or improving the engine, so that's realistic, but also too simple.Overall the best reimagination of the original GameDevTycoon concept by Greenheartgames. I'm sure we are going to see another one of those in the future that will surpass Mad Games, but for now I'm declaring it the best game developing tycoon out there.I wish there were more games in that style. Especially if they could switch from Game making into a more detailed movie making simulation. A blend of the classic Molyneux' The Movies with the now 2nd Generation Indie Management games would be the best.For the presence, we have to stick with Mad Games Tycoon.			"

								This is quite possibly the most entertaining, management-simulation game, that I've ever had the pleasure of playing. You're able to use your imagination and creativity to increase your own entertainment. Developing a huge range of game genres, giving you the ability to explore your brainstorms. The game gives a basic layout of how a real world game development process takes place, giving you the ability to make the blueprints as if you're a game designer. Managing your economics, making decisions to invest in a game ,or to develop your own game engine, or invest in another developing company, are all a part of the fun!Balance: 9  The balance is top-notch, but it's near impossible to receive 100% rating on a game. That should be simple on easy.Graphics: 5  They're not very important, but could always be improved.Music: 4  Basically the same music throughout the whole game.Content: 8  It has a lot of neat features to improve your experience.Controls: 9  Easy to pick up right away.Gameplay: 10  It is beyond entertaining and can keep you occupied for hours!Overall: 7.2  "

								Gameplay: 8Graphics: 7Sound: 7Depth: 11Value: 11It is hard to believe that this game is in early access because it already feels like a full fledge game. The game is very addicting as I have been playing it almost non stop since I got it. The game is well worth the price escpecially because there is still more to come. This game is like The Sims and Game Dev Tycoon had a child and that child then became a prodigy. Pros: Lots of content pretty much equal to Game Dev Tycoon with mods. Building your own company is fun especially since you build it Sims style. More than enough content that the game could be considered a release game. Gameplay is very addictive and provides lots of upgrades to keep you playing for quite sometime. Will take awhile to reach the biggest building but that is a good thing.(Just small annoyances)Cons: During the building menu sometimes the game will not recognize how big you want to build a room but the confirmation box only makes this issue a small annoyance. Some menus seem a little clunky like not having a cancel button if you accidently click on an object. Tutorial is really short and leaves out some important items around self production. Making games as contracts never seems to be worth the trouble over regular contracts.			"

It is a great game to play alongside with a friend or many friends (Eggcode, perhaps add a multiplayer?). I would say it is much better than another more limited game, Game Dev Tycoon. I would say I would rate, as of current, a 7.5/10.PROS:- Decent Graphics- Varying locations for a development studios- Is trainer friendly- Well put together gameCONS- Every update eliminates saves. Seriously, Eggcode, fix that.

												I tried all of them, and of all the gamedev sims this one hits the mark. It's got nice visuals, and building your studio adds a lot more depth than just making game after game and upgrading like the others. What I like about this game is the growth potential- you start as a one-man studio and can end up a large publisher, complete with production facilities- and you can buy out your competitors. Basically a lot more to do, but everything is still kept simple and, er, manageable.Also the devs showed exemplary Early Access behavior, showering us with updates and improving an already playable game on a fairly constant basis. There are a lot of management-type games coming out lately, I wrote this review with the hope that this one gets the attention it deserves. If you want a game dev sim, this is the one; for business sim fans, check it out too. it's worth a look for sure.			"

I would love to be able to expand over multiple floors /buildings not just be confined to the single floor.2. Object placements need to be finely tuned, I go all OCD when it comes to arranging things exactly how I want them, and atm, its a little annoying.3. Able to branch out to other things other than just programming games. Web based, Operating systems, Computer systems.4. The game speeds are way to fast, would prefer the entire game to slow down a bit, as its basically pointless early on to make games for anything other than PC.5. Be able to follow a created item from start to finish, more involvement in the programming design, packaging, sales etc.6. At the completion of a game, would like it to automatically slow(option) the game, otherwise you miss a month when its on highest speed setting.7. Be able to manufacture more than 9,999,999 at a time. At the end game level, its really restricting not being able to produce any amount you please, especially considering its easy to sell 20-25million copies of a game.8. I'm sure Ill think of other things later. Just woke up. =)9. Please take this game all the way to conclusion. Not enough good tycoon games in the world.10. BYE!!			"

Early Access Review
								I was hesitant at first to buy Mad Games Tycoon until it was 50% off, but after 10+ hours of the game, I am becoming increasingly happy with the game and the community are very nice people. You, the reader already knows that you are your own game development company, but more of a Sims effect is placed in the game, because you the owner are to create different rooms including development, research, etc. and place objects in there including desks, etc. The more starred things you purchase, the better employees you hire and the further efficient your staff and you are.Making the games is a fun process. It varies each game you produce, but it can get annoying considering it gives you hints as to whether which side you should make your game. For example, do you choose more of a focus on graphics over gameplay or vice versa, and after creating a game for that genre, it would give a suggestion to go to say, the graphics side of things. It can get very easy and with the limited amounts of genres and topics, it is easy to reproduce the same type of game with the same focus under a different name and get a high rating.The game however, is in early access still (I'd say mid Alpha as there aren't all features implemented yet) and for right now, the basics are there, they just have to be developed more. For example, I'd love to have more of a intertwine between the games you make and how that affects the NPC world, does it affect the sales of your competitors, or vice versa. The similarities are there with Game Dev Tycoon, but I think both are distinct. They follow the same basic guideline of making games, but both do so in a different way and I personally think Mad Games Tycoon is much more in-depth so far than Game Dev Tycoon, especially in the Alpha stage.The later part of the game (Past 2010) is not fully developed yet. The NPC companies work still the same, but I find an unbalanced effect happening. Playing in easy, by 2010, I have released about 10 games with three hitting first on the all-time charts, by 3x what the NPC game was. My three would final sell at 13+ million copies while the highest NPC one would be 4.5 million. Another example is, less features pop-up following 2010 and I have noticed by 2020, the game has stopped releasing consles, features to develop, but NPCs still release there games. To expand on this though, I'd think that everything hasn't been implemented purely because with all features so far in the game being researched, there is 41 or 42 features (and with the improvements in features like parallex scrolling compared to basic scrolling) the usable count in a AAA game (mind you, AAA games allow 50 features max) is about 33. Thats my own real flaws as it can become increasingly easy late game, but then again, I'm playing on easy and haven't really tested the higher difficulties as I had did a full playthrough of normal, but that was prior to a patch recently while buffed the difficulties of all levels.At the moment, I'd say buy the game. I have had two full run throughs in about 10 hours, with the game setting on easy and me fast forwarding everything. It isn't a full finished product yet and the updates are regular (actually the updates coming every week or week and a half and if a hotfix is needed, a hot fix comes about 2-3 days following), though in saying that it is solid enough to have run throughs without being bored. The use of NPCs which are a major hit, different variaties of producing the game including motion capture studio, etc. and the building effect make this game a solid outing thus far, more in-depth than GDT personally, and with a suggestion thread that the developer usually follows apart from his own wishlist (though the thread will stop recieving suggestions on April 30th), the game will improve along the way and become better.Currently, a rating is not needed but I recommend buying it at your own risk. For the average player that plays this, you can easily get 15 hours out of the game minimum, and I haven't done that yet because I had only bought it a week ago, though I have only had playthroughs mainly on easy, and will go to the next difficulty soon. If you are still hesitant following my review, if you do like these types of game, wait until it goes on sale because if it does on the summer sale, it will most likely be 50% off and will be $7.50, though sale or no sale, I think it is a must buy for the management fan.----Thanks for reading my review!

												I'm a sucker for games like this, business management sims.  This is hands down the deepest of the bunch.  I have played Game Dev Tycoon, and while that game is fun, it's very simple.  Also, my biggest pet peeve with GDT was that, absent mods, the popularity of the systems was easy to anticipate.  The nintendo-like console would succeed, the dreamcast-like console would fail, the same topics and genres went well together.Mad Games Tycoon fixes this problem by giving you an option for randomizing the popularity different platforms and topic/genre combinations.  This means that every play through can be completely unique.  I love the engine optimization, and that you can sell your engine and actually make money off it.  I love the fact that I get to choose the layout of my office, hire as many people I want, the game is great.To give an example of depth, when you get big enough, you can start producing your own games.  This isn't as simple as choosing self-produce.  You have to have a production room and buy production machines to make the games.  Then you have to have a storage room to store the copies.  Then you have to choose how many copies of the game you are going to produce.  You don't want to produce too many, cause then you'll have huge stacks of the game sitting on shelves, but if you don't produce enough, you won't be able to meet demand and you'll be losing money.  You have to watch the sales of the game and watch the amount of copies of the game you have on hand, so if supply starts running low, you have to produce more. This is just one example of the complexity and depth of this game.  I love it.  It's my new addiction.			"

								To begin I would like to say that this game is in alpha so take everything with a grain of salt as it may change in the future. I like were they are going with this game. Game Dev Tycoon had small problems such as a limited staff to start off with. Also once you make one type of game you cannot make a game of the same type or it would bomb. I feel like that does not represent real life game development at all. Mad Games Tycoon changes that. It keeps the similar layout that Game Dev Tycoon had and allowed for you to do what you want as many times as you want. Like to make mid evil rpgs make as many as you want. With that being said there are some problems with the game(Its in alpha to be expected).First MMOs do not make since. You can make your game have a subscription fee yet not have but a small fraction of the game sells have the subscription. Also with the production costs and server costs they make very little to no money. Also right now it really doesn't have any type of penalty for making a game that makes no since such as some people have said in their reviews. You can make an music RPG/shooter and get game of the year. Of coarse stuff like this will more than likely implemented later down the road. Also if you get into the game some and hire a lot of people money will never be a problem. This is do to the fact that a game can get more than enough points to be game of the year if you have the staff, and make serious money from anything you develop.I will recommend the game if you have the money and don't care that it is in early development. If that is not the case pass until it releases in the coming months.			"

								One of the best early access games iv played in while. These are some of my keys points iv gathered while playing the game: Gets updated all the time with valuable features,is on a great state of constant improvement,great performace,great management simulation,releastic reviewing system for games,enjoyable.Iv also picked out some improvements for this game they are as follows:Needs to have more settings,Needs to have more language options, Need more offices because the large office simply doesn't cut it at end game, maybe a multi-story building,Needs more game names for the AI.Just to some up, i would recommend this game to anyone who has prevously played game dev tycoon as i believe that this game is an upgraded version that goes deeper into simulation and the management aspect. If your new to these type of tycoons i would definitely recommend this game to be the first one you try as i believe this is the best game tycoon on the market.			"

								As someone who played Game Dev Story, then played Game Dev Tycoon (which was a copy of GD story), this I can say is not a copy at all. It used that Game Development genre and took it to the next level. This game can be played in so many ways, you can make games, produce games which could be your own or other companies. You can purchase shares of other companies  and produce their games or have them only make games for a console you develop. You create rooms for each type of office and there is just so much more.It is slightly challenging due to the lack of tutorial for explaining what each thing is or does and some tutorials help in providing how to make games great but they don't know some of the features it seems as well. There are very minor issues with the clashing of objects when placing them down.OVERALL, A MUST HAVE if you even think you like these type of games.			"

								There is no denying that this game has taken a huge amount of inspiration from Game Dev Tycoon. The game feels similar due to a similar layout, a lot of similar functions, and even the music is oddly reminiscent of Game Dev Tycoon. The thing this game does well though, is that it locates a lot of the flaws in Game Dev Tycoon and fixes them. This could easily have been called Game Dev Tycoon 2 and no one would have doubted it for a second. I personally love that this game lets you have more than one development team, more than one research team, etc. It increases the pace at which your company grows immensly and it gives you more to do while waiting for a game to finish developing. The production element is also quite interesting, as you can print your own games and determine price, rarity and more. You are also able to buy other gaming companies, and release their games as your own, where you take the majority of the profit. While it's a fun element at first, it can get quite demanding if you own a lot of companies, as they produce a lot of games! If you're like me, you'll even forget to release your own games and instead just rake in 100+ million every year releasing other companies games. Overall, the game runs extremely well for an early access game. It has a lot of cool features and expands brilliantly on top of an already terrific design by Game Dev Tycoon. It'll be interesting to see what other features they have lined up for the completed version, but so far I love this game!			"

												A great tycoon game with a lot of content and more importantly, many ways to explore that content. It's definitely a ""never the same game twice"" kind of game, even when loading from a save file and playing from that point on - depending on speed and difficulty settings, combined with random events, I've had all kinds of experiences, from the company that skyrockets to become an empire in a handful of years, to a small company just barely managing to make ends meet after thirty years in the business due to some overly ambitious decisions.You can basically grow into whatever kind of company you want. Sure, you could make top of the line games that come in a box filled with extras like a t-shirt, and pamper them with updates and expansions to keep it selling for a long time. You could also just focus on cranking out a ton of solid but unremarkable games and ride sheer volume. You can nurture franchises, or even publish other companies games for them.You can even churn out buggy movie tie-ins for consoles if you so please - and can manage to make it profitable.What's more, there's plenty of starting options too - starting decade, an option to leapfrog to an office (rather than starting in your garage), randomization options, speed, difficulty - there's plenty to explore that will have an impact on your game.It's an excellent tycoon game and I'm glad to continue developing the Sexy Puzzle Moms series of puzzle games, aimed at adults with the theme of fashion and eroticism.

												I'm glad to have played this game, making dark RPG games titled No Pants Dragons, playful Shooters called On My Back, and outlandish Simulation games called Going Outside. This game is definitely at the forefront of Simulators for game making. Not that the ""topic"" is flooded at the moment, but I've played them all mostly.Mad Games Tycoon gives lots of options and locations for building your company, not just office or studio, but eventually a game making conglomerate. It's lots of fun getting there too, buying or making game engines to power your games, hiring and firing employees and making them do thankless menial work like customer support, it gives you a good sense of being a di- i mean boss. The games gets continuous updates since its release and continues to improve, and I hope it does because even though I've thouroughly enjoyed it it's falling a tad bit into a gameplay pitfall. It uses the same slider method of ""making games"" as other simulators. My problem with this is this is not a good method in my opinion, because it's easily solved by opening a guide and just notching as you see to get appropriate scores. Pretty much all aspects of getting a good score for a game can be solved by opening a guide. At that point all the fun goes out the window. Game making suddenly becomes less about making funny/cool games and more about copy-pasting a recipe for a profitable game. I know you're saying, ""Oh, then don't look at a guide if you don't want to be EA!"". Well, failing over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, to eventually get to the point where you're basically writing a guide that's already been written, is not fun either. At least not to me.Besides that aspect of Mad Games Tycoon, the fact that the bathrooms are the hardest rooms use space in efficiently, and the like it or hate it graphics they got going on, I sure can recommend it, because I had a blast playing it! If you loved Game Dev Tycoon, Game Dev Tycoon, and the like, you're prolly gonna love this! I'm sure they'll keep improving and I'm looking forward to seeing it in full!			"

												I loved Game Dev Tycoon. If you're thinking about buying this game, there's a chance you do as well. But after having put some real time into Mad Games tycoon, I can say quite frankly that I'm probably never playing it again. It's not meant to be a diss toward them -- it's a great game, through and through -- but MGT is better in almost every sense of the phrase.MGT is a tycoon game wherein you build a game studio, release games (no, you don't actually make them/ can't play them), and eventually work your way up to producing consoles, MMOs, and more. If you've played GDT, MGT probably sounds pretty familiar. But in this game, you're actually doing floor layouts for your buildings. Your options when hiring workers are better. The gameplay feels smoother and more polished. You can self-produce your games and go into publishing the works of others. There's even an admittedly-dodgy stock market system where you can buy out your competition. All told, MGT is a lot like GDT... only there's more of everything, and everything feels better-refined.Well, almost everything.MGT does come up short in a few aspects, most notably with its failure to include a Steam-like distribution service that would cut out physical media production altogether. When was the last time you bought a game in a brick-and-mortar store, with a disc and everything? 2005? Yeah... this game needs to offer players the ability to publish on/ create a service similar to Steam. GDT has something sort of like this, so why doesn't MGT?Another problem, one that befalls most tycoon games in general, is an utter lack of creative throughput. When designing a game, you can basically that game a name, a broad genre, and a couple of basic topics... and that's it. Where are the sliders for making stories more intricate? Where's the mad-libs-style topic input where I'm defining protagonists, antogonists, and setting? Where do I design the game to feature open-world? Offering these sorts of customization options can make a game considerably more fun and addictive, even if your choices don't have real consequences. Rock God Tycoon lets you write music. The Movies allowed you to make films and watch your creations (why the crap isn't that game being remade?!?!). I want more options when making games, even if I can't play them!All told, Mad Games Tycoon is a very fun, addictive game. It has its drawbacks, but every game does. If you're into tycoon games, this is one I very strongly recommend picking up.			"

								This game has pretty much perfected its genre. It has a depth that no other game development sims have. The skill floor is just low enough to be able to jump in with just a little help from the tutorial, while the skill ceiling is unimaginably high. There are many ways to increase the efficiency of game production, from assigning staff to certain departments, making sure you're fitting the current trend, and even having a reasonable office layout. The different kind of company you can be also beats out any of the game's competition. You don't even have to rely solely on games. You can produce state-of-the-art engines and license them, you can be a games publisher, and you can even be a console producer and just make a first party game every once in a while.All in all, this game is thoroughly enjoyable and a definite must have for any fan of game dev sims. 9/10 in its current state.

												Played since release day and it is wonderful, up until you get your profit margins up.The game functions well to a point, but once you cross that threshold it becomes clear there is no method of preorganizing teams, determining training status, or even refining youremployees other than drag and drop.  With more than 200 employees it becomes impossible to control many of them.The game needs a Human Resource room where it can make teams of devs for specific offices, inteview, and assign training automatically.Also when the game gets too high up in profit and employees it crashes when trying to allocate new space.  I've included a screen shot.Recommending, but remember it's still flawed and buggy once you become a success.http://i.imgur.com/e4qz8LL.jpg "

												Played since release day and it is wonderful, up until you get your profit margins up.The game functions well to a point, but once you cross that threshold it becomes clear there is no method of preorganizing teams, determining training status, or even refining youremployees other than drag and drop.  With more than 200 employees it becomes impossible to control many of them.The game needs a Human Resource room where it can make teams of devs for specific offices, inteview, and assign training automatically.Also when the game gets too high up in profit and employees it crashes when trying to allocate new space.  I've included a screen shot.Recommending, but remember it's still flawed and buggy once you become a success.http://i.imgur.com/e4qz8LL.jpg "

Early Access Review
								Great cheap game! The idea is to build a successful video game development empire. 1. The beginning is a little tough. Game development is expensive, and you rarely make a profit. I recommend concentrating resources on research and development of an engine in the beginning, at least then you can make some money off others. 2. The tutorial is rather brief, and just brushes the surface of things. Basically, how to build a room, hire staff, and develop a game. A lot of the finer aspects need to be figured out after, but it's not that difficult.3. The sounds I find slightly annoying, so I just mute it.4. If you plan for expansion you should do well. It's tricky to get that first profitable game, but once you do it seems like things start getting a little easier.Ultimately for $8 there is plenty of play here.			"

												As a fan of sim & tycoon games, I'm very glad I supported this Early Access game.  It provides a great mix of simulating some small details as well as the big picture of the game development industry. It ranges from picking physical game package contents to buying out other game developers and publishing their games. I find that type of end-game stuff to be more satisfying than comparable games. They've also added specific development departments/studios like for testing (gameplay) and audio, which for a price help boost certain aspects of the games being developed.The game difficulties are true to their names, and I appreciate that genre-specific tips earned with dev time don't just give away precise levels for what it takes to make the best games. The trial-and-error nature exists, but the Game Reports help indicate when certain things like casual vs core gamer balance are just right, and trending topic & genre can help. Even if you get all the sliders right, its still really tough to get 100% on a game - As I've only done it once - On Easy.  More elaborate MMO and F2P mechanics have to be handled different than retail games.  The devs addressed all the bug reports I've provided during Early Access, and I like the choice community-fed ideas that have been put into the game.			"

								Still in Early access, and i'm already loving it! I've spend my fair share of time playing Game Dev Tycoon, reached an endgame multiple times, and had fun almost every time, although as usually in tycoons grew tired and gave it up due to lack of challenges after 35 years of carrer as games tycoon, and limited possibilities to make games.Here, in Mad Games Tycoon i have way more of influencing every aspect of the game. How many devs are working on a game, how many people are working o different aspects of it, like sound, graphic, quality control, marketing etc.I'd still love to know few things more - e.g. if making campaigns for titles in development influences their initial sales or if im burning money making international game magazines campaigns while producing the game...Or when should i stop making game updates for my titles and how is it possible to make a game update that costs more than the game itself :)But after all, game gets regular updates, often forcing you to start from scratch, you struggle to make it past few tough years in your parents garage , and ultimately make a big♥♥♥♥♥games company that hires over hundred employees, presses its own games, sells them etc.Very fun to play with, i'm most certainly giving it a reccomendation, and i'm anxiously awaiting future updates (like digital distribution, bigger buildings, influence on position and lifecycle of consoles and ability to make games for no longer supported consoles.

								-Early Access Review-Well, where to begin with Mad Games Tycoon? Would I recommend it in its current state? Yes. Yes I would.I bought this game today, I played it non-stop and have now ran out of content after building my one man in his garage into an enormous empire with around $2270m. More content will be added in the future as a few rooms are locked and I assume more techonology advancements and the likes will be added, so fun fun!Pros:+Its addicting, seriously.+The customisation for the rooms is interesting.+Plenty of choice and competition.+There is already a fairly large amount of content, even for an EA.+The graphics are nice and fit in well with the theme.+The choices when making a game are pretty cool and varied.+The different stats on your workers allow for some tactical placement early game.+Updates appear to come quickly and in response to community demand, which is nice for an EA! (Cough, Starforge, Cough)Cons:-The music. God damn. I had to mute it after about 20 minutes as I felt an urge creeping upon me to douse my computer in petrol.-Placement of items is still a little so-so, I've bugged it a few times and had desks stuck in walls and objects placed over the tops of each other. (Just another minor issue with EA)-The MMORPG's subscribers drop off in drones randomly you are also unable to make expansions at the moment, if I'm wrong correct me. ( I just didn't see a way)-Once you have money, it is beyond easy regardless of difficulty.-Needs more level 3 publishers to allow for greater yeild on your prefered games. (Current set-up makes RPG's less than profitable)Interesting bits!* The random speech is quite fun actually, with strange little references to other games.* Some of the current bugs can be funny and are not particually game-breaking. (one of my workers was typing on a plant and cupboard)*The names - Seriously - They are great little knock offs. I love it!To sum up, even in its current state it is well worth the purchase and the time. The developers are community-centric and update often with bug fixes and content. There is much more to come so pay up, support the developers and reap those rewards!Current rating: 7/10 ~Liquifiction			"

								All credit goes to the developers who have been very active in constantly updating this game.  The game is very addictive.  I keep starting from the beginning just to relive the experience of genres and features available at different timelines.  I do think that the number of clicks can be reduced further but i guess feature/bug fixes are far more critical for playability and so i hope the developers will get to looking at the big picture at later point of time.

Early Access Review
								I've never been a fan of early access. Also, I have never written a worthwhile review before. This game changed my mind on both of those. ***How I feel about Early Access and these developers***My problem with early access, I've seen to many games cost $20+ for a game that is anywhere from 10-40% complete, and that just doesn't seem fair to the consumer. I have also heard when games have been sold cheap for Early Access but then has to be repurchased upon realease. Both of these are reasons that kept me away from Early Access. This team of developers has changed my mind on this. Eggcode has made me happy to finally be a pleased supporter of an Early Access game. They release a sizeable update approximately every week. It shows that they care about their project even though they could take the money and run right now. Also, when I bought this it was clear and upfront that the game was considered 15% whole. This was a great change than what I've seen. With each update it shows that they are listening to the customers and are on top of things like the small details such as March 24th when to numbers would display switched with each other. This didn't need to get tackled so rapidly, but they chose to be on top of even the small details.***The Game***This may or may not be the most accurate depiction of the game based upon when you read it because updates are happening approximately weekly. The game had a good bell curve of difficulty. I felt like I was trying to climb and try every angle at the beginning with little success but enough to stay afloat. As you succeed at creating games or doing contract work you can afford to keep employees. They are not extremely dynamic yet, but after about 2 employees they start requiring items such as a couch for ""sitting,"" vending machines, (humorously) toilets, arcade games, etc. These employees have monthly salaries which make you have to continue working. The employees cost more as they level up later in the game. You can train your avatar as well as your employees which lead to better games and faster contract work, but cost more as the get better. Your employees have multiple facets: making games, contract work to make some quick money, marketing to sell more games, customer service to keep your fan base happy, and research. The games seem to change with time. At the beginning you can make a game that sells ""enough"" to keep you going, but as the game progresses your one man or woman indie game team won't keep you alive. Later in the game it does take a team to make good games happen fast enough to sell on whatever the current market is. There is more to say about this game. I spent 20+ hours making 10+ billion dollars and called it quits at that point with a team of 25 fully trained game developers, 8 customer service pros, and 8 marketing pros. I look forward to ""replaying"" this game as the updates progress, and hopefully I can update this review as time progresses.?/10 the game isn't finished so this wouldn't be valid. It's an enjoyable game that goes at your pace. Late late game is a breeze, but other than that I have no complaints and this game is currently the best Game Tycoon game out there.Thanks Eggcode for changing my mind about Early Access Games!  "

Early Access Review
								Mad Games Tycoon is a lightweight management game focused on the games industry.Lightweight in the context that the player is not flooded with analysis sheets left and right or financial reports but instead cuts through to the point - center attention on management and keeping the corner of the eye on the company liquid balance. Effective and fun._____________________________________________[ early access review @ 20 August 2015 ]The topic chosen is quite appealing and I must comment on the alter-names and logos of all the companies I know by heart given I went through them all during my PC gamer life and those that really made history like Microprose, Ocean and Activision just to say a trio.The graphic department is competent. It does what it is intended - gives movement, colour and life to a ""time sheet"". There are some issues with colours but nothing that takes away value. My guess is some further work on it.The sounds are there. Mechanic types and directed mainly to the alerts and to signal the progression of the tasks being performed. Would enjoy some variation and explicity especially on the events like the games conventions and marketing campains.Mad Games Tycoon mechanics are good and open way to great diversity. We have all the technical departments in place, at least the major ones and the liberty to self manage a dynamic shift of responsabilities on the different offices is notable when compared to other tycoons where there are limits. For example I can build mini offices with all the necessary departments and develop several projects at the same time. Other tycoons fail at this. A plus on this mechanic.The Marketing and Customer department mechanics need more depth, after all they ARE one of the most important aspects of the gaming culture :) Also it would be top work if we get the reports for the campaigns.The Games Engines part is weak at best. While games can be buggy the engines are flawless. I bet this part will change for the best so we can develop a subsidiary dedicated to engines with their own issues, so better branching par with the Production mechanics are needed.In the optimization side, the game can demand a bit from the shared graphics laptops. With a dedicated graphics everything goes very smooth. This being said and from a propective buyer point of view one would expect a average specs laptop with an SSD to run it okay especially with all blows and whistles turned off. It is early access and this can change as well.To close it, this will be a entertaining game. Very fun at this stage already even with all the raw mechanics.If attention is given to the core rules of the game in the upcoming development cycle we might have a lot more to review.A great Indie project.

								Let me start by saying I am a mad tycoon fan!(failed pun, right?)Not going to say the game is great, it isn't. But it will be. It's not another of the ""had potential"" games. This game HAS potential, and its developers know how to get there.Despite having some really bad grammar issues, which are being solved, there are frequent updates, and they're reasonably active around the forums, which is a big plus for any game, especially an Early Access game.I don't like mentioning other games during reviews, but you can't help but sort of compare it to the likes of Game Dev Tycoon, which is far simpler, and probably easier on the eyes, since Mad Games Tycoon has the ability to build rooms, furnish them and even decorate a bit (wish you could turn the fan movement off, though). Since you can build rooms, it's easy to imagine that you can build them to any size you want, while having a big variety of office sizes to choose from, as well as a big variety of rooms to build, from Development Rooms to Research, Marketing, Server Rooms, and even a couple more that are still not active.Not a fan of branding a tycoon game by its graphics, soundtrack or even story (since there's hardly any), since the gameplay is pretty much the important part of any tycoon game, and oh boy, does this one have it.I do recommend this game, not only for what it is right now, but for its actual potential, its active development team and its active community.

 You must be Mad.... Over the last few years, there has been somewhat of a resurgance of the tycoon genre, and this is a further product of that. The 'game development tycoon' genre popularity started a while back with games such as Kairosoft's Gave Dev Story, and since then different studios and developers have improved and refined the formula. Out of all the various options out there, I feel like this game has the potential to stand out in the crowd. It allows the player much more freedom that we have come to expect from this style of game. You start off in your humble office and rather than the predictable start of just grinding out the games from the get go, there is a bit of extra work to do, and that is where this game plays its ace. The design element of this product is very good, you place down the walls, door and features of a room and then start to utilise the area to it's full potential. This game reminded me after a few minutes of the Bullfrog classic, Theme Hospital, and that is high praise. There is still a little 'polish' that could be done, mainly with some of the mechanics and the game interface, however, for an Early Access game, you'd be mad not to give it a go...			"

								This game is a fun Game Development Tycoon game. I have played Game Dev Tycoon in the past and really loved that game. This game takes the game development tycoon genre to a new level.With way more options and depth than Game Dev Tycoon, this game is really worth the buy if you like Tycoon games.Start with a low budget in your garage and make it all the way to a multi-million business. You need to build room and hire people to work. You can make more than 1 game at the time and patch released games. Really recommend this game eventhough it's in Early Access!

The ideaWhat a brilliant concept to offer gamers a simulation of the gaming industry, making sure that every player has a positive emotional connection to the virtual goods he deals with - games are fun! I know this one is not the first to use the idea, but it is an advantage nevertheless in comparison with other simulations that take you into a cookshop or a truck cabin. At least for me, it worked very well. The gameVisuals and music do not show that this is an indie production at all - it is all well done, in the bright and cheerful spirit of Sims 3. You can even play dollhouse by choosing and positioning furniture until everything is perfect, but this is optional. Just like for many other things like repeated tasks, you can choose automation and grouping functions for that and avoid tedious micromanagement if you don't care for that. Like all tycoon games, this one gets repetitive anyway after a while because you just amass more and more money by doing similar things. However, this one is superior to others because of the historically accurate technological progress from 1980-2018 that gradually unlocks more and more features and increases complexity, until you can really feel the effort of years of development and cooperation of four or five different departments until a big AAA title can be released to the market - and receive its ratings.  My journeyGetting a perfect review, making a 100 % perfect game that gives my customers a good time, that was the lifetime dream I started with when I built my first little office next door to my garage. I studied new inventions, I struggled with my bank loans, I hired more and more staff (gamers and nerds like me whom I could very well have befriended in a real-life situation like that) - and together we grew bigger and more respected in the industry, until one day, I finally achieved my first 100 % score. It felt amazing! After that, game development lost a lot of its appeal, but I could choose a completely different path: I made money, as much as I could, by doing contract work for other companies and creating MMOs - my biggest title was online 20 years and earned me 12 billion dollars! And with those riches, I bought out all my competitors and made them produce games for my very own gaming console, making it market leader eventually - while I sat back, drank my coffee and watched the cash flow in.This was my journey in this game, and even though it lasted only 20 hours, I found this virtual life experience to be very memorable.VerdictThe game is still in development (updated regularly), and it still has some little flaws. But in the end, they did not bother me that much. I am very satisfied and give Mad Games Tycoon a 7.5/10.			"

								Mad Games Tycoon starts off just like GDS and GDT, you start off in a garage and it's a struggle to release a good first game, however once you have had your first good title, the game seems to get too easy, you just get better and very rarely fail, which is a shame as it would add to the realism if you made bad games as well as good ones.Mad Games Tycoon has all the features you love from GDS and GDT, but expands up on them, not only do you make games, you also build the studio and you can become an exclusively Production compay only company, which is a really good feature, you build a Production facility and a Store House and then you can make money from selling other companies games and with this you can fail if you don't pick the right game to publish.There is a feature that allows you to buy rights to Movies and Books and then produce a game from that book or movie, they have their popularity and also have their funny parodies of other Movies and Books, which some of them are quite funny and relevant to todays Books and Movies.The work spaces you get to buy and occupy are pretty big and fairly cheap as well, the only problem is when you get to the final Office, it becomes a little laggy, this is especially noticable in the Hire menu, but this is the only lag that I have spotted so far.The menus are easy to navigate and simple to use, though they do look like they have been pulled from a mobile game, the scrolling is a little slow though, but this is by no means an issue.After roughly 6 hours of playing I seem to have done everyhting in the game, it progresses a lot faster than GDT and GDS, which I hope is by design for future features.You can buy out your competitors which allow you to publish their games if you want or you can let them continue as they are, though they don't seem to make you money unless you publish for them.Pros:Easy to learnA lot to do while waitingA nice building mechanicCompetitors that actually have a presenceCons:Too easyThe progression is a little too fastGets a little laggy once you hit the last officeMenus feel like they are from a mobile gameOverall I find Mad Games Tycoon a very enjoyable game, I will be looking forward to what the devs have planned in the future.

								I love this game so much.  It is such a 'feel good' game, on top of being an amazingly balanced 'sim' game. I always find myself coming back to it and making new game companiesm, and playing it in so many different ways.  The dev keeps adding in new ways to keep the game fresh, and each time it makes it fun to start again and get rich...well, of course after tanking a few comapanies.  But seriously, it's so awesome that he listens to community feedback, so +1 there.For the most part it is a sim game where you build a game developing company.  Like all sim games, you must choose what to put your resources into, as well as hope for some good RNG on your side!  Half the time I play I make games like ""The Second to Last Fantasy"". or goofy pun names...and don't forget the go-to alliteration names.  The fans want a ""Sports"" game about ""Robots"" -  Robot Racketball!  They want a Puzzle game about Gangsters - Mafia Monopoly!  Of course every now and then you try to actually come up with real sounding names and making a serious company, which is a whole new way of playing.  This game is just so fullfilling, from the kid in my, all the way to the adult in me.  I always get real nostalgic when I play it.  I have played 100s of sim games in my life, they are by far one of my favorite genre of games, and I can easily say this game is in my top 5.  Definitely worth the buy.  Happy gaming all :)			"

Character development, office customization, focusing on type of game development you want to specialize in, managing your finances (they key is to be frugal too)...overall...A+++			"

								The ability to customize room sizes, decorate your building, make MMO's WITH expansions makes this game spectacular to me. I simply cannot play this game for an hour, it is too addicting. If you love sims (esp. from Game Dev Tycoon) I cannot recommend enough. I don't think I'll ever go back to Game Dev Tycoon after playing this awesome game.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is fantastic! Even out the gate as an Early Access title, which I normally avoid, I was spurred to finally see what this game was about. I'm a pretty big fan of Game Dev Tycoon so I was interested to see what this game brought to the table.While it is a bit clunky at places, this game overall looks and feels like a finished and released title. This game pretty picks up where Game Dev Tycoon left off and goes so much deeper!Where in GDT you were forced into a pretty tight box and basically competing against yourself, here you have more freedom to do waht you want to grow your gaming empire. While it does have a learning curve, this game is fantastic.Pros:Features for days and weekly updatesMost UI sections are easy to useUpgradeable spaces for your businessCreate your console and produce your gamesTime sinkBeautiful atmospheric sounds and soundtrackCons:Staff interface is kind of clunkyLearning curve is steep to startMouse controls (for me) are very sensitiveTime sinkTraining works but seems inefective at timesSome minor spoilers below!Some things that do irk a bit more about this game are that there is no really easy way to manage the staff. You can mass fire people but there isn't a master list showing everyone's skills. You can look at one skill at a time but not all of them at once. It would be nice if the AI automated staffing wouldn't just arbitrarily place people in whatever room. I had a person with 80 office work end up in the research office.All in all even with small issues aside, a solid 9/10.			"

								This game is shaping up to overtake Game Dev Tycoon. For an early access game, it is pretty much feature complete. It is much more in-depth, and has some great ideas that add to the game's realistic feel (like developing and selling engines to have a cut from the competitors profits). Unlike GDT, it includes some basic spatial management in the vein of Theme Hospital, meaning that you have to do some floor planning and deal with the furnishing issues. That isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I'm ok with this - if only you couldn't buy the best equipment available straight out from the beginning and had to unlock it instead. Production and marketing are supposed to be just as vital for your success as research and development. Speaking of which, Mad Games Tycoon is always telling what technology you are researching (rather than using the generic '3D graphics level 2') and even showing what the game you are developing is supposed to look like (not without some quirks - I have developed a FPS using the early 90s technologies, but the screenshot was more like Counter Strike).So far, all of the concepts implemented in Mad Games Tycoon look good, and the only issues are the game balance (for instance, once you have unlocked the engine development, you can switch to it and never bother with developing actual games to stay afloat), the interface that requires some easing into, and the updates that break your savegame compatibility. All of these issues are perfectly normal and excusable for an early access game. I'd like to add that during my 30-odd hours of gameplay I've not had a single crash, which is a no small feat for an EA game either.TL;DR:Pros:+More content and depth than the other games of that genre;+Frequent and meaningful updates;+Stability.Cons:-Balance issues;-Some major updates break the savegame compatibility;-User interface.Bottom line:Highly recommended for anyone who is into that genre/topic.

								This game takes the dev tycoon genre to the next level. Having played and loved Game Dev Tycoon I decided to give this one a shot. 9 Hours later of continuos play I can confidently say its great. The game is immersive and has far more to it than others in the same category, it allows you to go from strength to strength without making it seem ultra hard. Some things to note for improvement, having to place the required furniture for staff becomes annoying when you have had to purchase an enormous office with upwards of 15 rooms. Another area thats needs improvement is the endless notifications, although they can be turned off, I still like to know whats going on in the game without having to achknowledge every single notification. The pros at this stage far outweigh the cons and for an early access game it has managed to deliver a lot.			"

								Not a bad game. But- ""CAN SOMEONE PICK UP THAT DAMN PHONE?!"" -If you liked Game Dev Tycoon- ""GUYS! THE PHONE!"" -this is a more customizable version of that.Gotta admit though,- ""CAN YOU PLEEEEEEASE GET THE DAMN PHONE?! WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT GRABBING THE DAMN PHONE?!"" -the damn RINGING PHONE needs to stop. I don't know if it's a glitch or what but every minute or two an digitized ringer goes off. Randomly. It's distracting enough to NEARLY make the game unplayable. It's that incessant. Otherwise? Good game thus far, I'll revise this as I play.Please guys, fix the damn phone. Please? For me?EDIT: In the options menu, there is an option to disable the phone sound. Use it.EDIT 2: My main irritation about this game: the initial reviews. It's irritating to have a graphics-based guy, and have the reviewer bash the graphics or sound or whatever like its the modern era. Having the reviews be relative to the general era of gaming would be nice.			"

								I just wanted to pass 2 hours....On a serious note: The first time playing through, you will probably bust, it's really lenient on letting you not go bankrupt, so you have a decent safety net if you make a smash hit game. It does get kinda laggy when you get the biggest office with a lot of people to market and make the games. It could also be my computer which has a 640, but I'm not sure yet. If you've played Game Dev Tycoon, you would like this, it offers a lot more in terms of editing what goes on in the company side. I can't wait for more updates.This has quickly become one of my favorite games as its updated often, and all the new updates added a lot to the game.edit: So I figured I would update this by saying the game direction is great, they've added so much into it, and you can now use old saves when they update! The game has no bugs or crashes that I've encountered yet.			"

								Like ""Software Inc."", this game takes a lot of cues from ""Game Dev Tycoon"" in the sense that you'll be able to make games and sell them on the market, reasearch and unlock new features to add to your game engines, hire employees, and more.  Unlike ""Game Dev Tycoon"", you can build your own rooms (though not the building itself).  I also like the fact that you can sell game engines and set a market share...that is, you gain X% of the company's profits on their game should they use your engine.  Finding the right ticks on the sliders can be frustrating (setting focus on graphics, gameplay, etc.) and you'll often get bad scores until you get a feel of what each genre/topic calls for...though if you've played ""Game Dev Tycoon"", you'll be no stranger to this.  It's pretty stable and looks good, making it an easy recommend.

								       Excellent game! This game allows you to simulate what it's like to run a video game starting in 1980 all the way to present times and beyond. This game has a lot of depth, and is loads of fun. At times, it can seem frustrating: Just keep in mind that starting out isn't always easy. This game is a bit of a process of trial and error, until you find that perfect balance of space and resource management. There are currently 6 save game slots (Awesome! Wish there was more tho). As of right now in Alpha, they are often needing to wipe saved games to accomodate for the new features that they add and change. I thought I would be more upset with the save game wipes, but it actually wasn't bad- It wasn't until starting over that I realized all the things that I could improve upon from my previous game. This game is not hard to figure out, but has lots of depth and thus takes time to truly master. As a musician and aspiring game dev, I found this game to be enlightening in some ways. Obviously it is ""big picture"" stuff compared to the day to day work of a single game dev, but it is interesting to consider all of the moving parts. It is astounding to see how time, society, console popularity, choice of game engine, marketing techniques and various other aspects all affect success or failure of a game.                         Also, I wanted to avoid comparison, but I knew I couldn't. I own this and Game Dev Tycoon, both are excellent games. I feel that, at the moment, Mad Games Tycoon is a bit more complex and advanced. Both are truly awesome games in my opinion though.			"

								Yes, yes...  all you're games are belong to me.If you've ever dreamed of building a super cool game company, and wanted to watch your dream grow and then suddenly be snuffed by a large bank to whom you owe millions of dollars, and who you can't possibly repay because you're game sales have no staying power, because for some reason, the public doesn't appreciate your killer new RTS about a super cool donkey civilization trying to save the world from the evil rabbit robots, well... you've come to the right place.It seems my goal is to create as large as company as possible, so I can layoff 30 or 40 employees instead of just 3 or 4 of my closest friends working out of my garage, when the walls finally cave in.  Build rooms, put people in them, make them create games, research techs through the years, train these people so they stay on the leading edge, develop new techs like quality assurance, graphics labs and sound studios.... and build and use them.  Get some marketing types and stick them in a room to sell your games, some phone workers to make you look professional, and eventually some big printers to mint your own games...  that's about the way it goes.As tycoon games go, it is actually very cool.  The only thing about it I don't like much, but is probably unavoidable, is that when you move your company to a new building you have to completely redesign the entire interior.... but no big deal.The developer is fast.  New content comes out all the time, and the updates and bug fixes are rapid fire as well.  There are a few bugs still, but nothing that really affects your game play.  Just annoying, little things.

								A Quick Review  Mad Games Tycoon is the perfect mix of a complex management game and a friendly time killer. This game has tonnes of features that are PERFECTLY eased in to the game play to make sure not to overwhelm the player and all simple to use with a good interface that may need a new skin as it dose look a tad tacky but  to be honest you do not play this games for its looks. Mad Games Tycoon has a good difficult curve prior to the update as now you have to earn the respect of other game companies to get contract work as before you would only get contracts when your money was low, this was not only unreal but it made the game alot harder starting off.In conclusion this is a very good tycoon game but do not expect pretty graphics, definitely worth the money.

You can create your own consoles, buy other developers, publish others games, add 4k and VR support, and more!  They update the game very frequently (unlike the other game dev sims).It is definately the best game creator simulator I have played (I have played almost every single one on steam).  ________________________________________________________________________________Update 12/06/2015They just added achievements a few days ago (along with a few more updates in the previous weeks that i have not played)Every update this game just gets better and better.  It is the most in depth Game Dev simulator/tycoon out there.  I highly recommend this over every other one (not saying you shouldn't play the others, just that this one is my favorite)._________________________________________________________________________________It is like Game Dev Tycoon in some aspects but this one is alot more in depth and complex.  If you liked Game Dev Tycoon you will like this.  It has tons of topics, upgrades to the buildings, staff, and many different things you can research along with alowing you to do patches and much much more.  Would no doubt recommend this game.			"

Game Dev Tycoon meets The Sims!Mad Games Tycoon does not only allow the player to create a Software Company, the player also needs to care for its employees’ needs in order to hire and motivate them to work (pay and perks). Do you want that RPG specialist who is also great at the graphics that your own engine supports? Then you will have to buy a certain “furniture” or an “arcade game” first before he or she even considers to accept your job offer! A Fantastic Idea!The game also runs really well for an Early Access application. I’ve not encountered a single bug, yet. Sure, there are some features that are not in game but that comes with the territory. The devs also really take into account its customers’ ideas into incorporating them into the game’s updates.However, one major flaw that I’ve come across thus far is that Save Games from prior game versions do not load properly whenever the game updates. The player loses hours of gameplay and progress that way. Nonetheless, it’s really not a consequence because starting over keeps the game fresh while offering new contents and its own challenges.A few things I have on my Wishlist are the following: Be able to quickly sort through applicants by certain genre or feature specialties when hiring new employees Be able to have an idea of projected sales from Marketing to help with self-production Random events in gaming industry that cause competition to fail and rise (i.e. random R&D breakthroughs that become players own license, market recessions, bankruptcy, or even new competitions such Indie Devs) More end game features such as Digital Download Services, Market Investments, Building our own consoles or platforms, to name a few 8 / 10 – Great Early Access game! Greatly recommended and worth checking out!			"

Even developing and selling your own Game engines.... Plus with some tinkering even adding real names of consoles and developers/ Publishers. 10/10 Shining gem amoung my collection. Recommend to all with a passion for business sim games.			"

												I really like this game. It`s a great addition to the Tycoon family of games. It is a nice game visually. I like the evolution aspect. You start out small and grow your buisness into larger and larger facilities. The R&D aspect is very nicely done and easy to understand. I really like the way diferent departments of the company all work together towards the completion of a game. Pros   + Good looking game       + Research is well done       + Lots of new buildings to grow into       + Lots of game topic       + I belive you getting value for the current price point ($16.99)Cons   - later in the game it can be handful managing a large staff       - game consoles do not reflect the proper percentage of the markrt share. I'm selling thousands                     of them and creating games for the console, But the market share shows less than 1%, but i'm         making large sums of cash.I also have seggestions to maybe help expand the game play. Make a legal department in the game. It would be interesting to have them deal with issues like, copy right infringement, piracy, colaboration with other rival companies to create games, consumers sueing your company for damage clames because of a game. There are many other scenarioes that could be created. This would reflect the real world issues faced by game developement companies.In closing this is a fun game with hours of interesting content. It is very similar to Game Dev and a great addition. I recommend this to anyone.			"

								Even in its current unfinished state, Mad Games Tycoon is a great game! Initially I thought it looked like a Zynga-esque rip-off of Games Dev Tycoon, but I took a gamble on it during a sale and to be honest I find MGT is the better game! There are very many similarities between MGT and GDT but Mad Games feels like the less mobile-version game of the two. It has a watered down, but still enjoyable, Sims-ish building/management component that GDT does not. But the best element about the game in my opinion is the actual game making itself. I found it infinitely more enjoyable and transparent than GDT, where the quality of your games feels like a crap shoot and you are not penalized so harshly for being imaginative and drifting from obvious genres. Instead of the Tech/Design ratio thing GDT has, MGT has a numerical graphics/sound/controls/technology pool which is influenced by the visible stats of your staff, making way easier to understand where you game succeeded/failed. Similarly, any feature extras like 'sprites', 'vibration controller support' etc contribute directly to the game in transparent ways that make sense, such as 'sprites' contributing to the graphics quality of the game, 'vibration' improving the controls, etc. Also, every update the dev releases (which is about 1 a month or less) has been excellent and not just bug bashes, and he seems very responsive to feature requests on the Steam forums. He has also been very cooperative about making the games files available for modding, allowing us to rename companies and products to their real-life counterparts.So if you like GDT, I recommend this! I find it like a less mobile, more in-depth and (most importantly) more transparent version of GDT, and even then it is still an early access with features being added to it! "

								So i have played quite a bit of Game Dev Tycoon and another lookalike of it (Cant remember the name of it though) but i must say that both are easily outclassed by this very enjoyable game. It takes most of the elements from Game Dev Tycoon and adds some new ones, the biggest new feature would probably be the Theme Hospital/Sims based building customization where you decide how large your various offices should be, which objects should be inside etc. The game is currently in Early Access though i'm not sure if its in a late Alpha state or in Beta. However the game functions fine though i'm getting a bit of a framedrop as i get into the later parts of the game. There are also some features which are currently locked because of the game being in Early Access. However aside from that the game performed really well which really surpassed my expectations because of it being in Early Access. The developer is currently updating around every week or close to that at least. The only real negative thing i can say apart from the framedrop is that each update makes you unable to load your old games but you can easily make a playthrough of it in that period so that's only really an issue if you want to play it a short amount of time each day. So yeah i would recommend buying this game if you were into Game Dev Tycoon or similar Game Developer simulators			"

								Don't judge on time, I bought this game after I played it at a bro's.Building your own engine is the best way to make money, gives you a chance to be open with trial and error, you get to make games obviously, but you can do more with them, give them better quality/gameplay exc. If you want to push yourself further, get into console development, costly but can be very profitable.If your interested in Game Dev Games, this would be the best one to go for, cause there is more to do, more to offer, early access so more content will be added, and you do everything you could in other game dev games but with more to do, more to focus on.I got upto year 2187 because I was maximizing my staffs skillsBut made alot of mad games on the way, profiting in over $9999milMade a few MMO's and added a couple of expansions with max content, was making average about $200mil with each MMO. So profit can easily be made there aswell, just getting there can be a pain, unless you make and sell engines, or know the right mix and match for games.Overall I like what this game offers apposed to the others on the market, only flaw for me though is once you reach year 2015 things start to settle down and the game gets pretty dull, other devs are still making games but no new consoles come out. So basically it only gets easier from 2015 unfortunately.9/10 I know its still early access but the fact they are going further than any other game dev game and doing alot more than just game and console development speaks for itself. I have high hopes for this game, keep up the great work dev's!			"

								Yes, it obviously is very much based on that other game dev tycoon game. The title is a bit underwhelming, and I expected a pretty bad rip-off. At first, I thought I was right, as the starting situation, with your company in your basement and a car next door reminded me quite a bit of a certain other game. However, soon you realize that this game has more features. You can design your office, controlling the size of each room and what is being worked on in that room. You assign dev- or research projects to a room, and the more people work in it, and the more advanced they are, the faster the result is done. You can even start to produce the games yourself, which requires a manufacturing room with CD presses and a storage room (make sure you get both, they dont need employees in them, but before you have both, production won't start, and you wanna have the game available as soon as it was developed).Moving to a bigger space requires a bit more work... you sell old office stuff, move into the new space... and it's all empty. So you have to build those walls, decorate and furnish the rooms and assign your workers, which of course still get paid while you build, so it helps to go room by room so you can assign people quickly. In general, the game has more detail than that other game (Which I enjoyed a lot as well, btw!!), has more options and features which DO make sense, and seems to be shaping up quite nicely. My first play-session lasted for 3 hrs straight with no break, and I am looking forward to continuing. Not sure how much replay-value the game has once you have become the big and rich tycoon, but until then, its a very enjoyable and slightly addictive game.			"

												It's a great game, would honestly say that this is what Game Dev Tycoon SHOULD have been. Think the sims meets Game Dev Tycoon, and you have this curious little gem. My only, ONLY complaint, is a lack of Linux support, I have a work laptop that runs much better in Linux than any other system, and this would be a great game for when it's down time at work or just on the go. If it get's Linux support, I'd give it a solid 10!			"

								Mad Games Tycoon is a very good game for it being in early access. The game is far more complex than say Games Dev(Which I am comparing it to) as it has a more in depth look into the Game developing world. My only real problem with this game is everytime the game updates your save is lost, so if you have made a lot of progress you will have to start over although not from the very beginning as the game allows you to start with a small office building.Overall I would recommend this game if you are a fan of Games dev like I am. This game has a future.			"

It its fun, its madly fun, and are some of the reasons why:You can choose a lot of things to put in your games, form its genre to the people who design it, to the way you can publish it, etc.You can make your own office and customize it,  you can even customize workers, and yourself.You can make your office better at whatever you want, making excelent rpg shoters with great sound, or making puzzles with great playability, or even making a publishing, marketing studio.All of those things make you feel like putting a kind of hearth in your games, in your workers and in your company.  The only thing that doesnt fit at all is the difficulty level, when you hit certain level of time, like in the 2000´s, you can sell almost any game, it doesnt matter if choosed the hard setting, 8.5/10  "

								For a Game in Alpha to be this good is astounding. The controls are a bit iffy and has a little learning curve but once you get the hang of that things get fun. Now you need to be prepared, this game is not at all like Game Dev Tycoon. Game Dev Tycoon focuses more on developing games to make money. Mad Games tycoon focuses on expanding and creating not just video games, but game engines as well as the layout and size of your building. There are a little things that can be frusterating when you make your first few games but once you get into the swing of things it's easy. In this respect the game is alot more immersive than GDT because you honestly never know what the finished product will be like. This game is great and even though there are a few buggy things (Which is to be expected when a game is in alpha) the dev team is working hard to fix it. 9/10 for the experience alone.			"

								While this is early access in my opinion it is a solid game as it stands with a decent amount of features and depth already, i like you can select which country to base your company in and choose what your character can specialise in. Those of you who remember the Theme Hospital game will recognise the same room customisation, buying of furniture, plants, vending machines etc. (something else I like) and the ability to grab hold of any lazy employees and plonk back to their work station.This is a more indepth Game Dev Tycoon so chances are if you enjoyed that game then you will enjoy Mad Games Tycoon, it will take a fair bit of working out how to make decent games and I very much enjoyed doing so. Only thing that really irks me about this game at the moment is that when trying to pick up your employees its very easy to grab a piece of furniture (like the desk they are working on) instead, hopefully its something can that can be addressed in future updates.Very keen to see what updates follow, definitely worth getting.

								A great simulation game.This early access game is already the most comprehensive, funny and polished game in this niche category (Videogames Development Business Simulations).And the fact that it's still in early access means that the Devs are still introducing a lot of new features and requests from the players.________________________________Pro:- Tremendously comprehensive list of features. You can do practically everything that comes to your mind, from developing your games or game engines, modifying, updating, selling or reselling them in budget editions or bundles, to making your own production factory,  hiring and training your employees, acquiring subsidiaries and make them do the main work while you sell services.- Projecting, expanding and decorating your headquarters is very funny, it remembers me of the old Hospital Tycoon.- Games reviews are really articulated and they point out the  strengths and weaknesses of your games.Cons:- Videogames Consoles market shares are a little unbalanced and too predictable at the moment, but they're working on this.- For a better immersion in that time, It lacks some form of media news/events not related to the videogames industry.

								Mad games TycoonA building simulation with a little bit of skill building sims. Like the game Theme Hospital but with computers instead and the ability to upgrade your working conditions such as garage or office building.You raise the stats of your people and produce a mass of games in hope of being the best and keeping your business afloat. Story along the lines of Game Dev Tycoon. All features of Game Dev Tycoon are in there including Making your own system, doing side work, and  creating mass games that blow peoples minds. Upgraded graphics and more open ended gameplay make this a pretty good game. I like that I have a choice in what my people are going to doand where. You can even pick employees with special skills and traits that you want. I personally enjoy giving my employees what they need and even messing with them when they do bad by taking away things like the bathroom. I love the new explination system as it gives you more in depth information on things and offers beginners a better understanding of what you are doing. I can't really say much about how to get a perfect game but there are online  tutorials and such out there that you can look up. You can  make the game easy or hard and cater to your desires of running a business bankrupt or making it a success. I miss some of the cutesy graphics but I guess that the new ones are just as good. I got frustrated at the move object function until I learned how to turn it off as I kept selecting items I did not want and in a time sensitive game it is not good for you to waste any precious seconds when in threat of bankruptcy. Also, when you delete a room you get nothing for it. So if you spent 200000 on it and remove itbecause it was too small, you lose 200,000. There is no way to enlarge or shrink a room.  So, in my opinion it is just as good as their previous game but polished a bit for those seeking better emersion and more stuff. I find myself stuck on it for hours when I play it and oftenlose track of time as I micro manage my little simmies into an early grave.			"

								I been playing this game too much!  I think its a very fun game and I can see why its a early access.  There are definitly some things they could make better.  I think they should take a look at Game Dev Tycoon and put in some of those ideas.  I like those simple scenrios that pop up, things like someone wants to buy your engine, or sell you secrets.  I hope the building tool gets smoother and you put in more items to buy.  I'm sure the programmers have their ideas but maybe I'm asking for too much.  I'm hoping that they provide downloads for the early access but it seems like we have to buy the finish product.  I cant wait for the finish product though and I do reccomend this game if you love the SIMS type of play.  I hope there is a story mode version, they add in, when its all said and done.			"

Early Access Review
								Alright update 14.06.2016, the game has been updated pretty regularly and there have been SO MANY things added and I've restarted this game SO MANY times. I don't think I'll ever get bored of restarting the game. I've not yet finished it on the hardest difficulty, but it seems fair if you have played on normal or hard before and have been successful. Now, I HAVE TO give this game a thumbs up and a recommendation and a good score and whatever else it wants. I'm tempted to just buy a few more copies and share them with my friends just because the developer is that much awesome. -------------------------------------------------------------------------All my initial problems are fixed. The game also now has enough content to warrant a buy. I say, go ahead, get it. I also want to add that whenever I suggest something, it gets enough attention so that it is either fixed or implemented as a feature or option. The developer(s) of this game is amazing and the community is also working. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.Go to the bottom for TL;DR version.This game has a lot of Theme Hospital inspirations. Like how your staff needs radiators to be productive or how certain staff members can only be hired when you have certain items. The game's atmosphere is nice on its own and it has a lot of topics and genres and features for your development journey.Now, let's talk about the downsides of this early access. First of all, there isn't much of a tutorial on how things work, the only tutorial you're given is at the start and it's pretty simplistic. After that you have to unlock certain stuff by doing other stuff. Researching a feature to be able to make your own engine for example. However, the buildings that you unlock have no tooltips whatsoever and you can only go for a trial and error approach. They do have tooltip boxes though so they're sure to be explained later on in an update. There are also some minor grammatical errors or typos but nothing too bothersome.Now, if you have bought the game and you're just starting out, don't invest in the last 3 skills. They are only ever useful for research, marketing and support. Get skills other than music, sound and graphics since those are the first few employees available to you and you can just get one if you need.TL;DR version: This game is like Theme Hospital meets Game Dev Tycoon. It is in Early Access but it doesn't have any bugs that I can see. Only issues are, late game lag (can be solved by lowering graphics etc.) and npcs getting stuck (can be noticed easily) and some minor typos. The game deserves its current price tag. As an Early Access game it gets a 9 out of 10.-----------------------------------------------------------Warning, this review is out of date. The problems mentioned here may or may not be present in the current version.Edit: Performance issues with having too many employees seems to be fixed or at least alleviated. Teleporting employees now only teleport to the door if they can't find a path to their desk or where they want to go, which is a good thing. Late game seems like a bother because of the training room and how employees get so little experience from actually designing games.			"

								Early Access ReviewUpdate 27/01/2016 - Original Review below this update. This game has been continually updated since my original review and there are some changes I would like to share (there are many more but these are some of the main ones I find)- Lots of bug fixes- Added missing rooms such as Motion Capture & Recording- More info around Staff- Can now develope and sell your own consoles meaning even more ways to make $$$Still some things to sort out- End game is still a bit too easy as making successful games is still a bit formulatic but has improved since original review. Updated ConclusionA fun game that has gotten better and better.  If you like tycoon games this is one I would recommend and is a load of fun even though it is still EA it is feature rich and stable. Original EA ReviewQuite a fun game, in similar vein to Games Tycoon but more expansive.  Essentially you start as a games developer in your garage and work your way up to mega corp.  You need to hire staff, match their skills to the various assignments and train them up. You can build a large variety of rooms and need to decorate them to improve productivity (must like theme hospital).  Getting larger offices means you can build larger rooms and dedicated more staff to the room etc. Also you need not focus only on game dev, you can also go the publishing route, publishing other developers games which is neat.  One thing I also like is once you have released a game and if you have publishing facilities you can re-release them later at a discount and also make bundles, thus increasing your profits for that game in the long run.  Still a few issues to sort out, a few bugs and also to address (which I believe has been) the fact once you reach mid-point the game gets easier and getting good score games is a bit too easy (again this is being fixed).  Overall a highly addictive game thus far. I will update this review when the game is released but right now it is in a very good state for Early Access.			"

												You're going to hear a lot of things comparing this game to Game Dev Tycoon. Yes, they are bothing game simulators but Game Dev Tycoon is a very toned down version of this game. This game has a lot more options and I find it a lot more enjoyable to go back to this one than the other one. Both are great games but this is more of a game of what Game Dev Tycoon could of been.

								Review written when game was in patch 0.150121AStill in early access, but I think that even in current form this game is better than Game Dev Tycoon. Definitely needs polishing and even optimizing as well as more features. Lacks tutorial currently, and this makes starting the game quite hard for new players.I can recommend this game, but I'd really suggest not buying this until it gets finished if you want the best experience. These kind of games tend to get stale pretty quickly unless you really, really like them.			"

												I gotta say, having played most(?) of the Video Game Industry Tycoon games, this one is my favourite.+ It allow customisation of your office with a wide amount of objects to place down.+ The Dev team have been on this game for a year and in that year added features that are to me pretty big and wanted as it gives out more options to choose in your adveture to our current year.  e.g Languages, Buying other companies, Game updates, Icons(you can add your own), Servers for MMO Games, a Mad  Games Convention(E3), Game Size, Rooms to make an aspect of your game better, Platforms, Buildings, Consoles  Development and a literally tons of Hot Fixes which makes the performence, the UI and general gameplay much faster,  easier and fairer.I would add more but I don't know what else to add as I put most of it in the second Pro.It runs well on my AMD A4 6210, 5 GB Ram, AMD Radeon R3 Graphics Card Laptop.So far i think the dev gives out an average of 3-5 updates/hotfixes a month.It does get annoying that occasionally when the game updates, you can't load in old saves due to a new features or a change but I don't really care.And that was my first somewhat long review.I definitely would recommend this to any tycoon lovers.

								I'm going to keep this short. Its a Game Dev Tycoon rip off but so much bloody more, this is what GDT should aspire to be its a great game with lots of depth and options making it more than just adding points to a specific group. The game is constantly evolving and I'm honestly amazed that the devs are constantly updating this game with relatively high quality updates. Its massively evolved from how it was 3 months ago even more so from 6 months ago. I'm very happy that I bought this game and hopefully you guys will too because these guys have earned the support in my opinion.			"

								I like that you have to create the area u work in as well as work on the game. It makes it more of a challenge to play than GDT. I hope that the developer allows the abilty to alter the controls because the touchpad has no way of rotating items and there is no buttons that do it unless im mistaken.Overall an improving that should do well when finished			"

												Mad Games Tycoon suffers from a major lack of feedback.  Unfortunately in the beginning there isn't much of an indication of what you're doing wrong.  Worst yet, when your game does somehow succeed, there's no real indication of why it did well either. Let's start off with what this game did right.The progression of building your business is really there.  For example: Upon your third year you can make a marketing department or when you have enough fans you'll need Customer support to continue to make them happy.  Once you have enough money you can expand to a larger building site and create break rooms and larger toilet facilities for your staff. Developing your own game engine.  This really helps out on the profits.  This also gives you a good feeling of what technology is out there and what other engines you are competing against. Researching is extremely important.  It isn't just about developing games and engines, it is also about researching what topics and genre's and components are out there as well.  If you don't keep your research up, you will certainly fail!Different staff are available at all times.  There are even such ""legendary"" workers that you can hire such as Sid Maier (misspelled on purpose)Now for the reasons for not recommending this game:There really isn't much feedback at all to why your game did well or badly.  I've made so many consecutive worst game of the year's that I simply feel extremely frustrated rather than having fun.   You would think that the higher the numbers the better right?? Nope.  What about the stars next to the numbers??  Nope.  I still don't understand why one game fails and another succeeds!!The game does an extremely poor job of explaining all of the features once you do become a bit more successful.  I suppose it's a bit self explanatory, but if you're not ready to trial and error you'll never know it was there.I will state here that it's not like I didn't try to understand this game, I tried looking up what other people has done.  I've asked my buddy who purchased this game during beta.  Yes, once in a while I hit a beauty and I do well but most everything I've tried blows up in my face. I've even tried to avoid creating games until the trends lineup and then trying with the proper engine and legendary workers.. and my game STILL falls flat on it's face.... AND I DON'T KNOW WHY!!!!

			Developed by Eggcode Progression of the business simulation is nicely handled. However the overall lack of feedback on projects entirely ruins the game as you do not know why your games do bad or...

								I started the game thinking ""Wow, now I can write the kind of games that I would want to play!"", but after a while I found myself adding excessive graphics at the expense of story, building space base simulations instead of fantasy RPGs and putting an excessive amount of work towards the sounds instead of  working on the core gameplay.Why? Because I wanted my games to sell to the masses.10/10 for the dose of reality.			"

								I think that once this game is fully developed, it will be absolutely fantastic. Right now, I still can have fun with it for a little while, but there are a lot of problems and the game is lacking polish. I'll still play Game Dev Tycoon to scratch this itch for right now, but I really think 'Mad Games Tycoon' is going to be great, eventually.			"

Early Access Review
								I just want to get this out of the way: I know it's an Early Access game, so some of my issues I have with the game will hopefully be fixed.  Until these things are fixed, I only give it about a 51/49 Yes/No ratio.I owned Game Dev Tycoon before this, and I can say Game Dev is better.  But if the bugs/glitches/simple things get worked out, I could see this being better after the full release.I'll try to make it simple.Goodness:+ Quite in depth compared to Game Dev+ You can buy out other companies...succumb to my money: You keep the 1 and 2 star games, and I'll save the others for my company to make moneys ^_^+ You get to build your studioGripes/Complaints- When you build your studio, you have to completely retool it EVERY TIME you get more space.- Simple things like clicking on the X to get out of a window only work about 50% of the time (HUGE issue)- Translation to English is fairly poor.  Needs VAST improvement (GODZILLA ISSUE!)Overall, think about getting the game, but unless you're patient enough to hope for updates in the future, you may feel a slight buyer's remorse.  I know I did until I sat back and looked at the big picture.			"

								Really nice game so far.  The endgame isn't complete and its not quite as polished as Game Dev Tycoon yet, but then that's why its an Early Access game.  A lot of games have attempted to take the torch from GDT, and most have been total dogs(looking at you GamersGoMakers).  This is the first one I've played that I felt has real potential to surpass GDT.Totally worth the 15$I give it a 7.5 out of 10.  With easy potential to hit 10/10 if they keep doing what they're doing.Update; They've had tons of patches and lots of new content since my first take on the game.  But they still need to tie it all together with a satisfying end game.  8.5 so far, with a 10 still within grasp going forward.			"

								i actually like the game so far and it is one of the few early access titles i purchased, that still gets really worked on (and where i also see the changes!) My first round was a little chaotic and i had some problems getting my sheit done, but when i understood how stuff really worked the starts went more and more fluently.Which leads directly to my problems with the game:  It feels to easy and i can't really tell how the game ratings are really made up. It seems like that from a certain point on i can do whatever i want and it always becomes a 85 - 90 at least.Then there is a lot of stuff that still would be awesome to be added (long list on the forums here on steam)Anyways, i still love playing it from time to time and compared to game dev tycoon i already like the fact that you can pretty much buy the other devs. A thing that i actually like is, that you can develop several games at once, personally i can't really be arsed to do so... to much micromanagement for me, with setting up a perfect team for it etc			"

												If you're a fan of the genre and/or a fan of Game Dev Tycoon this game is worth buying.When my web was down over Christmas I played this so I'd say I've got closer to 70 hours in it.It has some negatives as some other people have pointed out but its a fun little game with more depth than the aforementioned Game Dev Tycoon, if you can get past the lackluster visuals there's some fun to be had. Its a time killer more than anything, after about 20 hours it became more about trying to beat my previous best rather than playing the game and it did become tedious.However for the price you'll get enough time out of it to warrant the purchase, I fully recommend this.

												Let's talk about the few glaring flaws first:- Borderline atrocious UI. It's ugly and it's not super intuitive. This game is not a ""looker"".- The game does a poor job of explaining its mechanics.- Poor grammar at times.If you can get past those cons, I think you'll find the most complex ""game development"" game released yet. Mad Games Tycoon offered me more control & flexibility over how my studio was run than I expected.+ Building out your studio room by room (may be a con for some, but I enjoyed it)+ Developing your own engine & having the option to license it to other developers+ Having the option to release games through publishers or publish your own games+ Being able to publish games from other studios+ MMO's and special ""add-on's"" for MMO's (you even have to have a server room)+ Special facilities for graphics, audio and quality control departments+ Full control on what is focused on during development via slidersI could go on. I found the game surprisingly deep and I'm having a lot of fun. I recommend this to anyone that has enjoyed other similiar titles.			"

As much as I'd like to write about the faults or bugs within the game that put you off you simply can not because of how quickly they are updating this game.By now most people will be put off by when they see ""Early Access Game"" - I know I am, I've been burned too many times now. This game gets updates and features added weekly - sometimes twice in a single week. If you want to play a game that gets updated, has potential and a clear build path this is the game dev for you.

								When I bought this game I found it to be really fun. It had many features, reminded me of the games from 1990's, when graphics where far from what they are now, but the idea and fun factor were everything in the games.Mad Games Tycoon is changing rapidly. Developer adds features, polishes the ones that are already in, and it is a really, really good game. Personally I can recommend it to anyone who loves tycoons. But be warned - THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE!EDIT:I came back to the game after many months of not playing... as I wrote before - it changes at a very fast pace. Now it's a pretty much complete game that is extremely addictive and fun. I really do love it.			"

								for  an early access its a really good game,  you have full control over pretty much everything & can spends hours playing without even realizing it, the one & only real complaint is that every time they do an update you loose all you progress & have to start over, all your rooms all your trained employees gone.  other than that really cool tycoon management game			"

								Note: This is a long review so if you plan on reading read to the endSo this is a game I had picked up recently due to the interest I had had in it a while back. Playing games like this I find pretty enjoyable and  have done my fair share of Game Dev Tycoon, seeing this I immediately jumped to the conclusion that this was a rip off of that very game. And boy was I wrongSo not only is this a game that takes the functions of Game Dev Tycoon and other Game Dev Sims it improves on it greatly allowing you to go into a deeper creation of your games, although not too far away from where it's aging older brother set the benchmark. By this I mean the ability to impliment copy protection for your games allow it to be released in other languages because it isn't all about the english speaking world and above all else it expands on what Game Dev does with it's combinations.What does this mean? Well this is quite simple where Game Dev had the massive list of topics with the  5 root genres with the 6th researchable one of casual games coming into effect early on along with Multi-genre and MMO being unlocked later into the game, Mad Games Tycoon  goes balls to the wall with the progression of time since Game Dev's release these roots have branched off  to a collection of 16 genres for you to combine with one another to experiment and create the best games, and as time goes on maybe this will increase even more.The Key element of this gameplay however is the other side to it, Game Dev is you sitting at your desk making money by making good games and then having you move into a bigger space and hire more people to sit at deska and help you make money, that may be putting it bluntly and to be fair there is other stuff to do like research and so on but stripped to it's core that is game dev. Mad Games Tycoon however decides to borrow elements from the late Maxis'  collosal franchise of the sims where you have to care for these people in more depth, you give people the multitude of rooms to work in along with a bathroom and break room as well as tending to their needs so their will to work for you is great this hopefully allowing you to get more done in your games and tilt the tide to get that higher rating and more money.There is however one issue with this game that I have and that could partially be blamed on me as well. Mad Games Tycoon at the moment of me writing this review has no tutorial mode and if it does I can't find it, It does have an easy mode option which starts you off in an office space however but that really doesn't do much when it comes to learning the mechanics and the key gameplay elements. it took me a while to find out how to even build a room to work in let alone make a game and even then the sliders are easy to work around, but i wasn't too sure on how it would work. With words either side of the bar  I was unsure if moving it closer to one way meant it was a higher priority or that it meant it was a lower one because of the way Game Dev worked with the bigger bar meaning more time, and i'm honestly still not sure to this day.Don't let this bring you down as eventually when you learn how the game works you can easily get into the game even with the difficulty. all of these games are the same fundementally with the rinse and repeat and if you don't succeed try again aproach with the idea that someday you will hit it big and from then it is smooth sailing.Overall then this is a strong game even in it's early access state and is in strong standing within the Game Dev Games, although this review constantly made comparison to Game Dev  it does not mean I think of it as a worse game, I would honeslty say I believe that Mad Games Tycoon in it's current form is on par even without the tutorial and I really hope to see this game through to a full release where then it could take it's place on the throne of where Game Dev Tycoon currently resides			"

								First impressions are that the feature list is exstensive and very enjoyable althrough streamlining of controls and visuals is key to this as feels a bit clunky but regular updates could solve this Have played game dev tycoon and game go makers I feel have to get used to this more sim like style again but seems good, a story mode would be nice as well as sandbox mode will update but can recommend this game for the fun factor and it's exstensive feature list,UPDATED REVIEW 14/08/15I still recommend this game very much recent patches are streamlining the interface without loss of features plus bug patches, Late game play is when it becomes more fun it all comes together and I can see the developers vision for the game and interconnected dynamic company system that has you wanting to exspand your company also leads to many choices in where you want to take your company.      The base game as it is is very playable, this is probably the most unrestrictive dev game out there still a little tricky getting started but once past the learning stage the game becomes more and more in depth than you initially realise with amount of connectivity within your company rooms, selling owm hard copy games, buying shares, all the game development feautures so on                  This is almost the dream developer game just needs a little more polish			"

Mad Games Tycoon is a management simulation where you get to create and manage your own game development studio.Mad Games Tycoon is very in-depth when it comes to developing your own company. You can specifically place each room inside of your studio such as a development studio, quality assurance, marketing etc. You can also decorate and place objects inside your studio to satisfy your employees needs and wants, hire employees and a great many other things!The aspects of the game that i thoroughly enjoyed are:-Customisation options-Plenty of offices varying in size-Detail-Difficulty settings for every player, hardcore or casual-Loads of settings in the options menu allowing you to turn off or on specific things in the game-Fun and addictive gameplay-Controls are simple and easy to use-Regular updatesCreating your own consoleBuying out other game studiosAspects of the game I didn't particularly enjoy are:-Hype for a game is capped at a max of 100 instead of being dynamic (nitpicking)I really couldn't think of anything else i didn't like about the game.Obviously as it is in Early Access (soon leaving Early Access) some features that I'd like in the game are not there such as: creating DLC for your games or creating early access games and perhaps even player mod support for the game etc. But those are my personal opinions, still a fantastic game and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes management simulation games.I'd give it an 8/10, a very good game with little to complain about.

												Very good game. Some tips. Play legendary. Build one room for each function. Keep expanding rooms as needed. Alway do production contracts with the machines. Hire people who are fast and good. For game design have one of every feature. Game gener should be second to features. Hire as many people as you want they make money not cos money. I have built a console in 20 years on legandary no problem. Always research Consoles as you go. Try to focus on 6-7 game types not all of them. In the begining hire as many people as are available. Don't try to ne a hero and figure out the slider settings. just write them down and use them, you need to move on to different games so just try to move fast. always move to a bigger building when you can. Keep departments close that you access regularly. Close to developement. Price sales at 19 and forget it. always have a fan club going to get fans. Always have as three games ready in June for the booths. Fans are a priority. I absolutly love the game. You may want to listen to something elese while playing as the music is repetive at best. There is no voice actiing. I have probably played more hours of pc games then most people on earth. If I say it's good it is.			"

												There are too many flaws to count in this game: the graphics are terrible, the sound is bad, the ui is very very buggy. The person/mascot/paperclip person is creepy with his pervy smile and tight black v-neck t-shirt. It's impossible to read the notifications so you have to live without them. A lot of important information is hidden deep within the menus for you to discover too late in the game. And yet, I found myself binge playing it and enjoying myself immensly.I bought this game on sale after reading a lot of its reviews. So far I made it from a single person studio in 1980 to a AAA giant in 2016 (with one failed and three super successful MMO titles that grossed hundreds of millions), but I hear you can play this well into the future. As a gamer in real life, the choices I make as a developer in the game echo reality: should I release the 6th installment of my uber successful series, where profit is certain but creativity is nonexistent, should I maybe probe the market with a cheaper title that explores a radical new genre/combination, or do I dare invest all of my effort into making a brand new concept for an MMO, knowing there are dozens of millions of development and production dollars at stake? There's a lot more of this type of openness - you can decide to be an SDK focused busienss and sell engines to other companies. You can venture into console development and production. You can develop titles for other publishers, you can publish other developers games, you can create annoying candy crush clones with a F2P model. The game's biggest strength is how it puts you in this historically accurate simulation of gaming history and lets you be part of it in whatever way you choose.Since the game offers no real guidance about how to succeed, I was left with my background of playing a lot of video games since the late 80s. So far they seem to have served me well in picking genre and topic combinations, making target age group and game balance decisions (when you make a game you need to set a series of sliders to balance things like graphics vs gameplay, functions vs atmosphere and so on). I did not read anything about how to play, because I didn't want to ruin the experience, and this led to me learning some game mechanics (like the effects of reputation and the fine balancing act of pricing and packaging) fairly late in the game, so I am curious how I would fare in a second run. I'm also curious to try to play in hard mode - would it be arbitrarily punishing or a well thought difficulty curve?UPDATE: On my second run I became a multimilionaire by 1986 and by 1990 retired from the business because it's really hard to manage such a big company. I bought out most of the other development companies and made them make games exclusively for my consoles.I sincerely recommend getting this game.			"

								I just can't stop coming back to Mad Games Tycoon. Every couple of months I find myself spending a week as flat out as I can on it. It is addictive and satisfying - exactly what a tycoon game should be!The synopsis of the game is such. You are a small scale aspiring game developer working out of your garage. You need to make it big in the gaming industry and you do so by researching technological advances in both hardware and software. You employ the people who you believe will make you the best games and then you plan the game to be developed according to the current trends.The devs have clearly struck a real good balance in so many aspects if you ask me. For example; sometimes you may think that you are onto a whopper of a game... only.... it flops - generally for understandable reasons. That is when time starts ticking and bad decision making would almost certainly spell  B.A.N.K.R.U.P.T.C.Y.  However, delving into some serious debt with the bank is an option. I mean what is the difference between going bankrupt with a debt of $200k or going bankrupt with a debt of $1.5m? (The answer is nothing - except of course for the differing amount but that is irrelevant as it has no impact upon you). What I am coming to is that the extra borrowed cash used to make a good game has been enough to bring the company back into the black and I have gone on to build a massively successful gaming company thereafter. What is my underlying message?  THE GAME IS FUN AND REWARDING!! Devs don't read the next statement.  I have gotten my money's worth many times over already IMO and yet the game is still in Early Access!!  Well worth the money for a really cool tycoon game. Can't wait for the next. 10/10 for Replayability7/10 for User Interface 10/10 for Developer Continuous Dedication			"

								In my opinion this game has become best of its kind. Compared to Game Dev Tycoon, Game Corp or Game Dev Story (Mobile), this is the one that has the most depth, by far.A mix between Theme Hospital style building, and development that progresses nicely and gets more advanced as you play is great. Updates are regular and meaningfull. Even tho this is still an Early Access title, it now feels that it is closing to its complete state (The game has run a long time for me without major bugs, and I have yet to see it crash).Therefor I am not afraid to recommend this game to anyone that is interested in the genre. You are probably here reading reviews for a reason, so go ahead, click that green shiny button!			"

								Well, I have to say that I really like this game. I bought this game the day after the release on steam, ended up playing it for a while and thought it was pretty fun.  There were a couple features lacking then, and some problems with a couple other things at the time. However, unlike a lot of the Early Access Games that get dropped when the developers feel like they did enough or got enough money; Eggcode has had updates since the release. To me it seems that the developers are open to ideas that the community has and would look into adding it if they think it would work well with the game. They also arn't shy from hearing about the bugs in the game people find, for me though the only real 'bug' I found was just a missing word, only because I was looking to hard at the history log at like 2 am. Sometimes the controls can be spotty but they always end up getting better overtime. Overall I have no real qualms about the game and very much like where it is heading.If you where to ask which early access developer I like the most It would probably be these guys because I have seen the changes it has taken place in the past year. This would be on my Recommendations for early access games or just Fun games in general.Keep up the good work! :D			"

								There's still a lot of work to do, but this concept has got a lot of potential to become a knock-out fun time consumerer. It already is in a sort of way, but it's still a short-term addiction.The interface is a shameless copy of Theme Hospital. Let's just be honest about that. But why not use something that has proven to be solid instead of reinventing the wheel? There's something very appealing in being in charge of a gaming company. You start from your garage, being small time and struggling to keep the annual figures in green colors. You have to work a way through developing games, hiring staff, expanding your business and getting fans.The strength of these 'tycoon' games, is that they don't demand much graphical attention. What does demand attention, is detail. I want to have to make important decisions: do I take out a loan? Do I invest funds to reignite a game? Do I have to cut the budget by firing staff? Some elements of a typical Tycoon game already show, like deciding to take part in a yearly game convention and expanding your fanbase or the endlessly staring at figures and gauges towards planning your next move.If you're a fan of tycoon- or simgames by any stretch of the imagination, you'll like this game. There's a satisfying depth in developing your own games and there are a lot of possibilities to do so. I can only recommend to the creator to add more depth. As much as possible. I mentioned Theme Hospital. Remember how you were able to turn up the heating at a certain expense? More heating means the people will feel better, but it presses on your budget. I want to be thinking about these managerial decisions. If that can be provided, this game can become a long-term addiction.Some advices for enhancing the game: add a toggle gridline, show the measurements of rooms when designing them, add the option to redesign a room without having to delete it, being able to take out a loan, easy dispatch of staff (not having to pick them up one by one), more gamespeeds (the first speed still feels a bit too fast, especially later on in the game).Keep up the good work!

												At first I didn't like this game at all. I couldn't figure out what was going on and it seemed vaguely too much like Game Dev Tycoon. But, once I gave it a chance, I loved it. It has a lot of nice features that give it a depth other similar games might have glossed over and it seems to have tried to cover all the bases. I've clearly played it a ton and that's because I keep wanting to start over with new knowledge of how the game works which, for me, is a good thing. I definitely recommend it to any game dev genre fans and hope to see a sequel in the future.			"

Status;""IN PROGRESS""First off... its not Game Dev Tycoon, not comparable. Played both now for hours.This game is faster paced, more in depth, and has so many more attributes to follow as if you were running your own game development studio or corporation.Get this game if you like Tycoon games, we guarentee you will enjoy this!Not easy, but very easy to learn.Replayability is great.Polished, you get to create your space for each department.Many publishers to choose from.Many genre's and market choices.Good graphics and no lag what so ever.No crashes yetThe content just keeps coming. Amazing run and devotion!Tips; (Dont bend over in a public restroom! No... seriously... don't... )Spend slow, build slow, get some cheap games out first to get your revenue going.(Its fun to grow slow and watch it come out huge! Really huge!)Dont hire anyone but your dev team to start, and make a bathroom, otherwise it can get messy! Be sure to include a water fountain, plant, fire extingusher, and top desks in every room.Buy it, you wont regret it if you played Game Dev Tycoon and enjoyed that, this game surpasses all it had and has so much more.Guarentee you will really like the work done and the hours of play! THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST in the Tycoon Genre.This is a solid buy as they come but the devs wont respond to email, so good thing there is no ground breaking problems as of yet.  They make a lot of posts and updates but don't really listen or interact with the community, which is sad with a homerun like this. Your only good as your fan base guys.

								At first it seemed like the game was too hard. I tried many approaches and I have discovered a way to make it really easy. It feels a bit as if I am using cheats. I just keep playing to see what's next.I can't say it is an innovative master piece because the genre has been done a couple of times now by other developers. However, this is the only game that combine a bit of Sims with Game developing. Still, it doesn't go very deep and you start to wonder how decorating your office really affects your overall performance.I would also say it is a bit pricey but I still recommend it. It is currently the best Game Development Simulator out there.8/10 - Good			"

								This game reminds me of the games in my childhood. If you'd like to play games so called 'tycoon', this game is good for you. This game follows the common track of tycoon games. Money, hiring, facilities, development... so it's easy to get used to this game. Yeah, unfortunately, this feature is its weakness, too. Of course, this is early access and I know I have to endure some uncomfortable ones... but where is a tutorial? Although this is quite simple and easy to play, just a short tutorial is needed in every game. I didn't know how to set up my office so I thought it was a kind of bugs.  Moreover, the more employees you hire, the slower this is. Now I'm in the biggest office with about 40 employees but its speed is too slow for me to play this anymore. I recommend it but only for tycoon lovers and ones who are sick of complicated games. If you are not... well whatever.			"

								What I enjoy about this game is that its Game Dev Tycoon but bigger. Although lacking for late game content (New systems and features kind of stop arriving around 2008) Its still alot of content, and with frequent updates and this game still being in early access means that there is still a great game with huge potential. Comparing when i first got this game a few months ago and playing it now i have seen the game grow with the adding of gameplay features like new rooms and random events to adding things like achievements. My one big complaint about this game is the lack of a custom logo option (having to pick from a closed set of logos rather than getting to create my own.) Personally i would enjoy being able either to pic from a selection of shapes and colours or even being able to upload my own logo form my computer into the game would really inhance immersion, but all in all this is stil a great gameId recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed Game Dev Tycoon or any tycoon game really, as it provides a fun game and challanging businees simulation.

								I had loads of fun with this game. It really does improve on everything on existing ""Gave Development"" games. The biggest downside however is near the end, and not a lack of end-game either. What I've noticed is that once you start making bank, you've made it to the bigger buildings, and then you move into production and self publishing. I had every room in the game in my building, and it was the most micro-managing I have had to do since StarCraft 2. For me, it lost a lot of it's character and enjoyment as soon as I hit this roadblock. Developing games quickly becomes just a side project alongside the many many other side projects you have, and it becomes very reptitive. All said and done, it's still a great game and it will keep you entertained for hours, and this is still alpha! There are loads of things I'm sure that will be added on, improved, and possibly flat-out removed.			"

								Mad Games Tycoon - The First Impressions ReviewThe Cons- Currently there is no real way to gauge production, for example, your company just made a game called ""Bob and the Destroyers"" the game gets an average 75 to 80 rating. There is no system that lets you know how many copies you should produce. This leads to a guessing game on the overall rating, hype, and fanbase of your company to create an estimate. If Pre orders became a thing in game like maybe in 2007 or so then it would make being a publisher easier.- Currently there is no real way to assign your subsidary to create a sequel to a game, I find that most of my game sequels are 4 - 5 years apart, however sometimes my dev studios are busy trying to make a new IP and I forget about a previous one that was fairly decent in success, this leads to a ten year gap sometimes between some games. If you could assign a subsidary to create a sequel, and control the engine used as well as the platforms, this would make it easier to keep your greatest of Sagas or trilogies going while being able to focus on new projects and games, of course the level of studio quality will influence the games overall rating, so chooing wisely would be in your best intrest.NeutralYou cannot create subsidaries, conventions, or create handheld consoles.Okay this is more of me nitpicking small details, but this is something that would really be cool or interesting to do.Scenario: Your company is growing and you decide you want to make a subsidary becuase you plan to publish your own titles, creating a subsidary would be a big investment like buying them out is. You start out and have 5 options, for 3 million you can make a one star subsidary, 5m gets two star, 7m gets 3 star, 10m gets four star, and 15m will make a 5 star subsidary, the inital investment is steep, from here subsidaries could be given more directions, for example you could create a deadline for the AI controlled subsidary to come out with Two new games every year or so. This could affect not only the goodwill of the company (value) but also affect the rating of the games it creates.On game conventions, making one called AGX (Arcade Gaming Expo) which is a play on the Penny Arcade Expo or PAX that is cheaper to participate in but also yeilds less attendance and hype would be great for smaller companies, or the ability to create your own and make proceeds from the companies who attend the event, of course this would also be another investment.Right now we have the ability to create home consoles, but if this could be expanded to handheld that would be a cool feature alongside having both the Home and Mobile markets split into two seperate identies would mean your company could have their home console and mobile console on the market at one time. Positive Influences+ You can virtually create any kind of company you want to. If you wanted to you could creat a game development studio that is independent and has no set publisher and develop for PC only or you could create over time a game dev and publishing company that publishes and makes 100% of the profit, or you could go as far to challenging Katari or Mintendu by becoming a Hardware manufacturer owning subsidaries and publishing console exlusive titles making your market share rise. You could even only do contract work and make minimal money to operate but keep yourself small. The choice is yours.+ The gameplay is addicting and challenging at higher difficulties, in essence you create your own problems and have to make the correct choices to manage your companies funds and gain foothold in the market.Overall I give ""Mad Games Tycoon"" an 8/10 for my First Impressions Review. This title has a ton of potential to wipe the floor with other Game Dev Simulators, also I would rather state this game is more of a Game Industry Simulation.			"

												i don't usually bother with reviews so don't bite my head off for this. the game is pretty well made for an early access and considering how far along it has come already, my only hope is that by the time it releases, it becomes a true masterpiece. the achievements alone are hard enough for you to actually need to play for about 20-30h and the replayability factor is big enough. unlike gamedev tycoon, the game still has room to improve so that's a pro. can't really think of a con unless you hate this type of game (in which case, there's no point in you reading this).EDIT:been playing this one for a while now so I'd like to think I'm somewhat wise now. yea, the graphics are ancient, the game feels repetitive (once you're at your 25th or so run), the game looks like it was modeled after the hobbits themselves (""you can learn all there is to know about them in 2 weeks yet after a life time, they can still surprise you"") but there's something that just keeps begining you back. i don't know what it is, still trying to figure that part out. don't expect great graphics, expect a level of complexity on par with the C&C franchise (pre RA3) that makes your head spin.if you're expecting pros and cons, read other comments. if you're expecting the ""wisdom"" of an old RTS player, here it is: in the past 10 or so years, this is just about the best strategy you'll find out there (and yes, I do mean strategy game), unless you feel like picking up a game made before 2006 (and trying to make it work). and i hope that the devs either let the community mod it or keep those content updates coming (or both).

								It's extrememly addicting.I made an engine for free that takes 50% of profits from devs.I made games such as ""0/10 Crappy Shouvelware"", ""I'm broke lol"" and ""aopisdjfaopeifj""I forgot to publish other people's games 90% of the time after signing multiple contracts.I found the worst employee, who happened to be named Dean, nicknamed him ""THE DEAN MACHINE"" and forced the staff to worship him as he proceeded to do nothing for at least half of the playtime experience.I installed 20 heaters next to the publishing machines in one room so the employees would stop complaining. They did.I devoted an entire room to nothing but cabinets becuase the employees wanted them.I noticed that the employees had an inseperable connection to cabinets.They wouldn't stop wanting more cabinets. I had an unholy ammount of cabinets but it wasn't enough.So I took all the cabinets and put them in my office and became the god of cabinets.I ended up with 600 million dollars and 1 million loyal fans, getting GOTY every year and Dev of the year ever year.This game is hands down 10/10 no questions asked. It doesn't even feel like an early acess game it has so much to offer.			"

								Just thought I'd quit playing the game real quick to put up a review. I'm really impressed. Especially since this game is in alpha. It already feels complete. And honestly, this is probably the deepest game dev sim I've played. There are good ones out there (Game Dev Tycoon, Game Dev Story) but this one reaches almost every aspect of game development. Or it close, at least. Props to the devs for making this game. $15 well spent.Edit:This game gets very hard after you have around 20 million dollars. Lots of micro-management. Would like for that to be slightly better.Edit 2:Did not realize you could have more than one desk per room. Wow I'm dumb...Anyways, that takes off the mass amount of micro-management. This game is truly great. 10/10Edit 3:Yea...went back to fix typos. Just one quick thing: The amount of updates parallels to that of Unturned (Another great game). They constantly update the game, adding new stuff (and bug fixes). It gotten immensely improved in the past 2 months. I'm probably getting redundant by this point, so here's the end of the review.

								At first it seemed like the game was too hard. I tried many approaches and I have discovered a way to make it really easy. It feels a bit as if I am using cheats. I just keep playing to see what's next.I can't say it is an innovative master piece because the genre has been done a couple of times now by other developers. However, this is the only game that combine a bit of Sims with Game developing. Still, it doesn't go very deep and you start to wonder how decorating your office really affects your overall performance.I would also say it is a bit pricey but I still recommend it. It is currently the best Game Development Simulator out there.8/10 - Good			"

								I've played GamersGoMakers, Gamedevtycoon, now this. Although this is above those, simply because I have to manage things. This game makes you manage, and something like publishing a game, and producing 1 Mil copies will destroy your company. You have to make your employees happy, you have to make use of all the space in your office you can.      Which is another thing, the custom building is amazing. I've spent atleast half a hour designing my company.8/10I can't wait until it's out of early access, and I hope this game continues to be updated.Update#2   It's really amazing that this game is still being updated, It really makes it a better game. Well this game isn't completely finished it almost feels like it and it has tons of hours of fun. With all the new updates this game has become a lot more balanced and amazing and with the updates still rolling inI think it deserves a better score.9/10			"

								This game reminds me of the games in my childhood. If you'd like to play games so called 'tycoon', this game is good for you. This game follows the common track of tycoon games. Money, hiring, facilities, development... so it's easy to get used to this game. Yeah, unfortunately, this feature is its weakness, too. Of course, this is early access and I know I have to endure some uncomfortable ones... but where is a tutorial? Although this is quite simple and easy to play, just a short tutorial is needed in every game. I didn't know how to set up my office so I thought it was a kind of bugs.  Moreover, the more employees you hire, the slower this is. Now I'm in the biggest office with about 40 employees but its speed is too slow for me to play this anymore. I recommend it but only for tycoon lovers and ones who are sick of complicated games. If you are not... well whatever.			"

								I had loads of fun with this game. It really does improve on everything on existing ""Gave Development"" games. The biggest downside however is near the end, and not a lack of end-game either. What I've noticed is that once you start making bank, you've made it to the bigger buildings, and then you move into production and self publishing. I had every room in the game in my building, and it was the most micro-managing I have had to do since StarCraft 2. For me, it lost a lot of it's character and enjoyment as soon as I hit this roadblock. Developing games quickly becomes just a side project alongside the many many other side projects you have, and it becomes very reptitive. All said and done, it's still a great game and it will keep you entertained for hours, and this is still alpha! There are loads of things I'm sure that will be added on, improved, and possibly flat-out removed.			"

								A more developed version of Game Dev Tycoon. As of this writing it is not substantially superior to that game,aside from some capacity to move objects and place them, but the developers are adding more features and making the game otherwise distinguish itself; once market forces are added and behave in odd ways the game should be immensely interesting.

								Let's write a quick review:At this stage I would give 8/10 in this game.Pros:- Nice graphics and sounds. Nothing big, but fits well into the game.- I do not feel the pressure to release a game. I can spend time on enhancements.- There are just enough areas the game covers, from game engine development to production.- Quite good interface. It's easy to reach anything.Cons:- It is a bit annoying that after I finished a game, my development team cannot do anything if I select 'release later'. My team should improve the game, develop bug fixes, add new features, etc...- The music team cannot finish their work if I choose 'release the game' even if I set a long, lets say '24 weeks later' option. The whole game release process should be revised.- The review should come after I finished everything, even improvements! Now it happens immediately after I selected 'release game'.- I am not sure, but it seems that even if I started repaying my bank loan, when I have enough money to repay the whole amount, the original amount will be taken from my account.Improvements:- There are tons of topics to research. With a 4-member-team I can easily reach a point when I do not really have anything to do just reasearching new topics. A small checkbox with title ""Continue topic reasearch when finished"" would come handy, so I do not need to go through the research topic procedure in every 3 seconds.- There are areas that need some additional help information. Bank loans (about the amounts that need to be payed), production (how much production capabilities per week I have), buying properties (how big each offices are) and similar things.			"

Early Access Review
								First, I want to mention that I NEVER recommend Early Access games unless the current product is entertaining, and well worth the price you pay. That is the case with this game.I've played Game Dev Tycoon, and Game Dev Story (not 100% sure that's the name...I'm talking about the Kairosoft game), so I know this niche genre pretty well.It will take a second to adjust to the way things are done in this game. The complexity I've always felt was missing from games like this is here in abundance. You need to manage how your resources are used to develope each game, and hire/fire employees...standard stuff. However, this game requires you to use the space you have to the absolute fullest. You need to section off areas of your garage/office into designated areas reserved for developement, quality control, research, marketing, bathroom, employee lounge, and much more! The game unlocks things as you play, so it attempts not to overwhelm you. I have to admit, even though I love these kind of games (and am pretty good at them) on my first playthrough I did find myself getting a little overwhelmed. I kept finding myself feeling like I was playing catch-up to the ever increasing demands of the game, and not in a good way.EDIT: On my second attempt, things went MUCH better. I can honestly say that this game is the best Tycoon game I've ever played. I pretty much just lost an entire day in this game, and enjoyed every hour of it. It can be kind of complicated, but it's definitely learnable through some trial and error. If there are bugs, I haven't seen them. There's an element of Sims at play here, as it can be fun setting up your offices, decorating them, and all that. There is a lot to this game, but it's simple once you spend some time trying it out. Expect to fail at your first attempt, but just view it as a learning experience.Long story short, this is the best game developer tycoon game ever made. Game developer story and game dev tycoon can't hold a candle to this game. Worth every penny. The best part is that it's still in Early Access, which (if the current state of the game is anything to go by) means it will get even better than it is right now.My rating- 9/10A small message to the devs, if they should happen to read this, please get rid of that obnoxious phone ringing. One more thing...when employees are working, i think you should go with either the progress bars, OR the little icons popping up above their heads. Not both. The only issue I have with this game is that there's a lot of clutter all over the screen, and it sometimes blocks out things that the player needs to be able to read. One last thing, I think the demands of the employees should be reduced, frequency-wise. It feels like it's happening a little too often that my employees start working at half speed, all because I don't have enough cabinents (or something similar). It's kind of strange how hiring employees is restricted by what pieces of furniture and stuff you have. If I have a luxury sink in my bathroom, why would an employee demand I have the cheap one before I can hire him/her? If you have a better version of an appliance/furniture/etc. it should count towards employees that demand a lesser version.EDIT #2: This game is receiving updates from the devs, FYI. They are consistently adding features, here and there, that expand the game in meaningful ways.			"

								There's a lot of ""game design"" type games on the market. This one has potential, but in its current state you come to a standstill after about 5 hours of gameplay.PROS:- Interactive choices, you can build your own rooms and add furniture. Style is reminiscent of Theme Hospital.- Ability to add decor is nice. Some employees may require for you to have a specific piece of furniture or decoration before they'll work for you.- Large variety of topics and genres to build games off of.- Ability to train staff is nice.Edit 05/29/15:- Recently added feature allows players to release game updates for their games.- Recently added ""Quality Assurance"" room allows players to bug test their game prior to release.- This game is updated frequently enough that I keep coming back to it, giving it lots of replay value.CONS:- Needs a bigger variety of staff to hire from. After a while the only ones I could hire were the ones I fired for having low stats. Edit 05/21/15: This was fixed in latest patch.- Game starts to get really slow and laggy at the biggest office upgrade. Maybe I just have too many staff, I dunno, but it got really sluggish after a while. Edit 05/29/15: I don't know if this was actually patched, but in my most recent game I noticed this is no longer an issue while playing the biggest office. (Nothing on my end changed, so I assume this was a result of a patch.)- Lots of features not implemented, which brings the game to a standstill in its current form.			"

								Great game, its a lot like Game Dev Tycoon but with the ability to build your own office and a few interesting options, such as creating and selling game engines and buying licenses for movies and the like to make games for.The first 10 years are really fun and challenging, but at this point the end game is quite broken.Once you can afford R&D you can easily stay ahead of the game engine curve, so every game you make gets a 90+ rating and earns mega bucks. Then you can spend that money on a production facility and cut out the publishers, which is super low risk and earns way to much money. Finally, half your building is devoted to servers for your MMO subscribers, and you are earning millions more in passive income than you know what to do with.			"

								Before I start this game is amazing, these comments will only to be to ask for improvements upon the game. The first thing is the space. There is not enough space for you to build everything at a suffiecent size and not all of the items have been added in. Second in the late game the game starts to have horrible lag spikes. I have a beefy gaming computer and I was having issues, so I can't imagine how bad it might be for someone who doesn't. The Third one is the game can become boring, can you possibly add some flavor events or some real competition to spice things up. Fourth its to easy to make amazing games especially early on, make it where the characters actally suck at everything, so we may groom them for what we want them to do. The next one, fifth, The game doesn't give you enough information making it hard to figure out your building layout, or just whats going on. Sixth keep up the good work the game is really turning into something promising, love it. Oh and can you please implement all these ideas however you like and then remove and add if necessary. Love the game. :-)			"

								Yup another great game dev game!This game is NOT a clone of game dev tycoon.It has so much more to it.It has a great sims element where you build your office and make sure you have the right items in your office to keep people happy.You really feel like your making a game much more then game dev tycoon.The author has improved the game so much over time.Soon we should have the ability to make consoles which will be nice.The list of plusses to this game are to long to list.I love that you can have multiple development offices and such actually make multiple games at the same time.You can do things like lower the games price to extend how long it sells.You can produce you own games and even make collectors editions(so to speak) that have t shirts posters pens trading cards etc in them sell them all out then rebox the game for the average joe at a lower price with as little as a cd. Seriously a fun game and I totally recommend it.If you want a more indepth game with more replayability Buy this, if you want a simple game that you should be able to play on your tablet buy game dev tycoon. As for me I bought both and recommend you do so as well.			"

								#include <stddisclaimer.h> // This is an early access review. Deal with it.First up, this is a game I have no trouble recommending you pay for in Early Access form. Why? Because it's remarkably free of bugs, glitches, and in a fully playable - albeit incomplete - state. This game is what Valve should REQUIRE developers to have before they're allowed to sell Early Access. So yes. What you'll be getting is a completely playable game, minus some mechanics. Is it going to crash on you? Honestly, probably not! Is it release ready? Well hell, Prison Architect released missing a lot more than this seems to be. There really is no reason to NOT buy this game before release! Even if the developers up and vanish into the aether tomorrow? You're going to keep playing this game. If you got into GDT (and who didn't?), either you're going to love Mad Games Tycoon or you're going to hate it. Think of it as a more complex GDT in some areas, less in others, with a dash of Hospital Tycoon thrown in and Airline Tycoon too. (I think it was Airline Tycoon I'm thinking of.) Hire developers! Wait, hold up. Build an office, buy furniture, THEN hire developers! Release ga-oh, crap, it's full of bugs. Build a QA department! Wait, I need to resear-build a Research Office! Get the idea? Don't feel like the hassle of developing games? Then build and license engines instead and release a game once every 8 years or so! (OHAI EPIC!) Sick of the competition? Amass a fortune, buy them out, and SHUT THEM ALL DOWN. Build a console and destroy those losers at Poni! There's no wrong way to play, and the added complexity creates DEPTH instead of ""do X for X's sake"" grinding.10/10 would buy Idi Software and consign to a life of grinding FPSes for me to publish again			"

								I have never written a review before in my life, for literally any product. I don't fill out online surveys. I don't respond well to people calling me and asking if I have time to answer some questions. I NEVER GIVE FEEDBACK. Yet, here I am, writting this review. That should say something about how passionately I feel about this game. This is exactly what I have been searching for. I love it. I cannot stop playing it. It's absorbing my life and ruining my sleep schedule. If you like logistics you'll love this game.It's still early access, but it's already a great game. I don't know if developers read these reviews, but I have only a few complaints. 1. When your company gets large and people are wandering around it becomes impossible to find people and move them to a different room.2. I feel the game is paced too fast. I think that one game year goes by in 20 minutes? I haven't really timed it out, but it is too quick. I think that they should slow down how long you get to spend in one year, or at least add the ability to adjust the game pace (making faster makes the game more challenging).Those are my two biggest complaints. And they're not even complaints. I don't know how much longer they plan to keep it in early access, but this is a well put together game right now. I can think of a lot of features it would be cool to have (for example the ability to release early access games, the ability to develop mobile app games), but I can't think of anything this games needs to complete it.If you like the builder/management sim type games, you will love this game.You will be obsessed.

Early Access Review
								Mad Games Tycoon - The First Impressions ReviewThe Cons- Currently there is no real way to gauge production, for example, your company just made a game called ""Bob and the Destroyers"" the game gets an average 75 to 80 rating. There is no system that lets you know how many copies you should produce. This leads to a guessing game on the overall rating, hype, and fanbase of your company to create an estimate. If Pre orders became a thing in game like maybe in 2007 or so then it would make being a publisher easier.- Currently there is no real way to assign your subsidary to create a sequel to a game, I find that most of my game sequels are 4 - 5 years apart, however sometimes my dev studios are busy trying to make a new IP and I forget about a previous one that was fairly decent in success, this leads to a ten year gap sometimes between some games. If you could assign a subsidary to create a sequel, and control the engine used as well as the platforms, this would make it easier to keep your greatest of Sagas or trilogies going while being able to focus on new projects and games, of course the level of studio quality will influence the games overall rating, so chooing wisely would be in your best intrest.NeutralYou cannot create subsidaries, conventions, or create handheld consoles.Okay this is more of me nitpicking small details, but this is something that would really be cool or interesting to do.Scenario: Your company is growing and you decide you want to make a subsidary becuase you plan to publish your own titles, creating a subsidary would be a big investment like buying them out is. You start out and have 5 options, for 3 million you can make a one star subsidary, 5m gets two star, 7m gets 3 star, 10m gets four star, and 15m will make a 5 star subsidary, the inital investment is steep, from here subsidaries could be given more directions, for example you could create a deadline for the AI controlled subsidary to come out with Two new games every year or so. This could affect not only the goodwill of the company (value) but also affect the rating of the games it creates.On game conventions, making one called AGX (Arcade Gaming Expo) which is a play on the Penny Arcade Expo or PAX that is cheaper to participate in but also yeilds less attendance and hype would be great for smaller companies, or the ability to create your own and make proceeds from the companies who attend the event, of course this would also be another investment.Right now we have the ability to create home consoles, but if this could be expanded to handheld that would be a cool feature alongside having both the Home and Mobile markets split into two seperate identies would mean your company could have their home console and mobile console on the market at one time. Positive Influences+ You can virtually create any kind of company you want to. If you wanted to you could creat a game development studio that is independent and has no set publisher and develop for PC only or you could create over time a game dev and publishing company that publishes and makes 100% of the profit, or you could go as far to challenging Katari or Mintendu by becoming a Hardware manufacturer owning subsidaries and publishing console exlusive titles making your market share rise. You could even only do contract work and make minimal money to operate but keep yourself small. The choice is yours.+ The gameplay is addicting and challenging at higher difficulties, in essence you create your own problems and have to make the correct choices to manage your companies funds and gain foothold in the market.Overall I give ""Mad Games Tycoon"" an 8/10 for my First Impressions Review. This title has a ton of potential to wipe the floor with other Game Dev Simulators, also I would rather state this game is more of a Game Industry Simulation.			"

												i don't usually bother with reviews so don't bite my head off for this. the game is pretty well made for an early access and considering how far along it has come already, my only hope is that by the time it releases, it becomes a true masterpiece. the achievements alone are hard enough for you to actually need to play for about 20-30h and the replayability factor is big enough. unlike gamedev tycoon, the game still has room to improve so that's a pro. can't really think of a con unless you hate this type of game (in which case, there's no point in you reading this).EDIT:been playing this one for a while now so I'd like to think I'm somewhat wise now. yea, the graphics are ancient, the game feels repetitive (once you're at your 25th or so run), the game looks like it was modeled after the hobbits themselves (""you can learn all there is to know about them in 2 weeks yet after a life time, they can still surprise you"") but there's something that just keeps begining you back. i don't know what it is, still trying to figure that part out. don't expect great graphics, expect a level of complexity on par with the C&C franchise (pre RA3) that makes your head spin.if you're expecting pros and cons, read other comments. if you're expecting the ""wisdom"" of an old RTS player, here it is: in the past 10 or so years, this is just about the best strategy you'll find out there (and yes, I do mean strategy game), unless you feel like picking up a game made before 2006 (and trying to make it work). and i hope that the devs either let the community mod it or keep those content updates coming (or both).

It's massively playable and if i am correct with what i discern, this has real depth and replayability and i suspect will have more.The devs display a real love for gaming and an understanding of economics, management and gaming history. Time management gets a little RTS as the game evolves. Totally in a good way tho.If you like Game Dev Tycoon or Game Dev Story, this is going to rock you.Fellow Kairofans, This is for you.			"

								The year was 1980. Reed, the sole proprietor of Angry Panda Studios began his journey. Over then next twenty years APS would be the laughing stock of the gaming community. Always being the underdog drove Reed. He stayed afloat for another decade when he decided to hire another person. It was this ragtag team that formed what would be referred to as ""The Big One."" With both employees focused on producing a game of epic proportions history would be changed forever. The release of their game generated nearly 500 million dollars in revenue for the company, thus expansion began. APS became a titan in the gaming world almost over night with over 30 employees on staff 24/7. Reed decided it was time to unveil the real reason he started APS in 1980, to take over the gaming industry. With all staff members devoted to one project they created a monster, a hellish beast. Critically acclaimed and winning game of the year this game pulled in over 10 billion dollars in revenue and stayed on the market for 20 years. With such a large income Reed purchased all competitors and forced them to close, making Angry Panda Studios the studio of the year, every year.			"

								First off, the updates come weekly, great for a early access game. The game itself is quite addicting. Confusing at first, so much that's thrown in your face, without a tutorial. If you're not used to this type of game I'd advise giving a quick look at a guide on this game while playing it, until you get the hang out it. Really fun and definitely will hold your attention for awhile. Best to buy when on sale however, as the full game will only last a few hours, then you'll have to restart since you can't go any bigger, but still fun, lots of different avenues to take. ENJOY!			"

It's Game Dev Tycoon, but with replayability and more things to do than watch bubbles all day.Being able to design your own offices adds a lot of charm.The only parts that actually seem ""Early Access"" are the occasional, tiny, bug. (Like the window close 'X' button doesn't work on some windows, so you just need to right click to dismiss it) and the end-game is still unfinished, so once you become  a billion dollar mega company it can get a little dull. The upside is that starting over from scratch is still a lot of fun.			"

								Entirely playable even at this early state, and entirely addicting. It is only going to get better, as the future plans and ongoing updates and support are excellent. I highly recommend it!			"

								Right now, it is def a Early Access Game with many features locked up until further development, but I think it will be great when it is completed B-)One big nag I have is you can select ""Small Office"" which I think would be a great start for new players like myself, but it is not in the game yet so you are forced to move straight in to a big office with very little tutorial help :-\ but I bet a better tutorial will come when ""Small Office"" is added to the game			"

Early Access Review
								If you’ve played previously games like Game Dev Tycoon or GamersGoMakers then you already know what to expect.  If you haven’t, then this puts you as a game developer, starting out in the early 1980’s.  You begin small, producing small, simple games, from small, simple premises with appropriately early gaming technology.  As time goes on (assuming you don’t go bankrupt) you have the opportunity to expand, by hiring more people, researching new technology and moving into bigger premises.Visually, Mad Games Tycoon is better looking than those other games.  Another area where this differs from the aforementioned games is that with Mad Games Tycoon, you have to manually create each room and place the appropriate furniture in it.  Over time, your staff will complain about wanting things, like plants or heating, which you’ll have to place in the room, so you’ll need to make sure you create a room big enough.  Not too big, though, because in the early stages, you only have limited space for your rooms.Eventually, you’ll have the opportunity to produce and distribute your own games instead of going through a publisher, as well as creating MMO’s hosted on your own servers.This game is still in early access, and while it should be obvious what that means, it’s apparently not obvious to some.  Early access means the game is still in active development.  So, new features will be added and existing ones may be altered or even removed.  You might even find your save games get ruined sometimes, forcing you to start again.  The game is NOT a finished product, which is why it’s in early access.  You’ll almost certainly run into bugs from time to time, and features that aren’t available or aren’t working as intended.  The most important thing to know about early access games is this: are the developers actively working on it?  The answer for Mad Games Tycoon is definitely ‘yes’.  Updates are regularly being released, which are usually both fix bugs as well as adding new features.  This is important, because I’ve seen early access games where the updates concentrate on one but not the other, causing the game to suffer as a result.The game is still very much playable in its current state, but it’s by no means finished, and nor is it perfect as yet.  It would be really good, for example, to have better feedback as to why your game was terrible, or indeed why it was so good.  It’s not necessarily easy to work out exactly why your previous game did as well, or as badly, as it did.  Hopefully that aspect of the game will get worked on in time to come.  I know too many early access games have died or taken forever to do anything, but I’ve seen nothing so far to suggest that this game will be the same; on the contrary, I’m confident that we will indeed see a finished product in time, and a damn good one.  But please keep in mind, if you buy a game in early access then you’re paying money for something which may or may not actually get finished, or finished in the way you were expecting.  It’s always going to be a gamble, but in this instance, it’s one I was happy to make.			"

												UPDATED REVIEWAfter two years of owning this game I can't uninstall it from my laptop. I only have a 256GB hard drive, so at most I have four games at once on it. Literally always there, waiting for me to return. I'm writing this updated now because I'm about to be sucked back in...OLD REVIEWLove this game. Easy is too easy though, and the game lacks substance once you reach a certain level. Its tough at the beginning of the game and gets inceasingly easier as your progress. For the price, I recommend it.			"

I've made game companies that have awesome quality control and only release AA or AAA titles with no bugs and I've also made an EA replica that gives no f***s about quality control or bugs and only releases sports sequels. This games is awesome. Give it a try and help this game become the best game developing sim!			"

Although I will say that this game is quite easy once you get the hang of it, even on hard I wasn't having any difficulties once I sold my first critical acclaimed game. It is a great time killer.

												i don't usually bother with reviews so don't bite my head off for this. the game is pretty well made for an early access and considering how far along it has come already, my only hope is that by the time it releases, it becomes a true masterpiece. the achievements alone are hard enough for you to actually need to play for about 20-30h and the replayability factor is big enough. unlike gamedev tycoon, the game still has room to improve so that's a pro. can't really think of a con unless you hate this type of game (in which case, there's no point in you reading this).EDIT:been playing this one for a while now so I'd like to think I'm somewhat wise now. yea, the graphics are ancient, the game feels repetitive (once you're at your 25th or so run), the game looks like it was modeled after the hobbits themselves (""you can learn all there is to know about them in 2 weeks yet after a life time, they can still surprise you"") but there's something that just keeps begining you back. i don't know what it is, still trying to figure that part out. don't expect great graphics, expect a level of complexity on par with the C&C franchise (pre RA3) that makes your head spin.if you're expecting pros and cons, read other comments. if you're expecting the ""wisdom"" of an old RTS player, here it is: in the past 10 or so years, this is just about the best strategy you'll find out there (and yes, I do mean strategy game), unless you feel like picking up a game made before 2006 (and trying to make it work). and i hope that the devs either let the community mod it or keep those content updates coming (or both).

								Until now this game may be the best game to build a game company.  But there is still two big problems for me . 1. the marketing departement finish thier jobs too quick when we have more then 5 people working here,  especially when you move into the biggest office all you need to do is re-do marketing again and again,  I really think that marketing should be automatically re-do until we cancel the mission or choose another mission.2. I want to say that game speed is obiously slower when your company become bigger and bigger, but I know this problem hard to fix so .. I think if people can have characters will be the grestest improment I can expect			"

Don't get me wrong, I *LOVE* Game Dev Tycoon, but this is a whole new level of complicated and fun. You have to make sure you lay out the rooms perfectly, so that people don't waste precious work time trying to find toilets, rec rooms and food. Definately recommend this.			"

There is a lot of content already for an early game making this game much more enjoyable.

								So far, it's the best tycoon game about the video gaming industry. Personally have tried three of them (including Game Dev Tycoon & Game Corp DX) but this one has the most customisation options available which is the reason why it's superior. The Layout is very simple, however to make a successful game takes a lot more practise than in the other two, which should be well accepted by gamers that are looking for a challenge. If you want to get one of the best tycoon games in recent years, look no further.			"

A cross between game ev tycoon and Theme hospital.  Totally worth the price tag. Learning curve is just right, along with difficulty - though I would wish for extra content, as once you have the top engines, consoles with major market share and all the money you need, there is little else to do. This would be great if opened up for steam workshop - it would easily add and 20, 40, 60 hours of game play.			"

								TLDR AT THE BOTTOMFirst off I want to say that I think this is what Game Dev Tycoon should have been (mostly), and that it is THE best game tycoon to date. Pros: Nice aesthetics for a tycoon game, no lens flares and motion blur to be seen hereWhile it is simplified, it is a realistic simulation of the game industry as a whole.Wide variety of developers and publishersAt the moment , the price point feels very appropriate (£10.99)You can import your own logos, in the game files, look for a folder with lots of PNG files, and then download your own PNG files (not sure if other formats work) Cons: At the moment, there is no modding community, I am not sure if it is that there is no mod support at all or if the community is not big enough, but as someone who loves to mess around with game files, this is very disappointing to me.At the moment, the end game is very lacking  and it is way too easy at the end. In my main save, it is 2006, I am sitting at about 2.5 billion dollars, 1.2 million fans and all of my games have been 90% or better for about 18 years, and this is at the hardest difficulty. The game is really unoptomized at the moment, my computer can run simcity on high settings at 1080p at 60fps but it cant run this at ""fast"" settings at 1336x768 and stay at 60, which really killed my experience.In conclusion I think that this is the best game studio simulator at the moment, but it does still need some work on expanding the content.TL:DR Buy it, its pretty good.

								If you are a fan of tycoon games, this is a must!Pros: - Console development- Great development team who updates the game regularly- Good sense of replayability - Ability to branch out into many different aspects of the video game industry- The many rooms such as marketing, customer support, quality assurance, research, motion capturing, + more, immerces you into feeling like you're running an actual games company- It is more friendly and easy to beautify your company- the game is easy to pick up and well worth the money - You can find yourself playing way more than intended- You can train employees in the skills that matter to their job- You can make MMOs and addons- You can patch your game after release as well as develop updatesIt's safe to say there are many positives, it is well worth a purchase and the development team deserve a thumbs up, there are many more aspects of the game I have not listed. It seems that the little features that you notice go a long way. Final review: The game is worth the money, and cannot be compared to game dev tycoon as Mad Games Tycoon is something unique in itself that allows you to branch into many different aspects of the gaming industry. Conclusion - WORTH BUYING			"

								Its 3am. I've been playing since 8am. Third day straight. My latest MMO has 15M subscribers. $4B in the bank. Sales progressing well at 1.5M copies a week on latest expansion. My army of workers can't make a dent in the cash flow from engine sales and all my subsiduaries. My production lines are churning out millions of copies of games a day.This game is very complete for an Alpha version. Well worth the money. A few minor bugs with the display and some performance issues in the endgame but nothing major at all. No crashes, freezes or breaking problems at all.			"

								TLDR AT THE BOTTOMFirst off I want to say that I think this is what Game Dev Tycoon should have been (mostly), and that it is THE best game tycoon to date. Pros: Nice aesthetics for a tycoon game, no lens flares and motion blur to be seen hereWhile it is simplified, it is a realistic simulation of the game industry as a whole.Wide variety of developers and publishersAt the moment , the price point feels very appropriate (£10.99)You can import your own logos, in the game files, look for a folder with lots of PNG files, and then download your own PNG files (not sure if other formats work) Cons: At the moment, there is no modding community, I am not sure if it is that there is no mod support at all or if the community is not big enough, but as someone who loves to mess around with game files, this is very disappointing to me.At the moment, the end game is very lacking  and it is way too easy at the end. In my main save, it is 2006, I am sitting at about 2.5 billion dollars, 1.2 million fans and all of my games have been 90% or better for about 18 years, and this is at the hardest difficulty. The game is really unoptomized at the moment, my computer can run simcity on high settings at 1080p at 60fps but it cant run this at ""fast"" settings at 1336x768 and stay at 60, which really killed my experience.In conclusion I think that this is the best game studio simulator at the moment, but it does still need some work on expanding the content.TL:DR Buy it, its pretty good.

								I'm on my first playthrough of this game and I love it!It probably helps if you're a game nerd and a lover of tycoon games, like me.You start of in your (parents?) garage and work your way up from there.The controls are very easy. And there are lots of thing to develop.You can take contracts and produce games for others, but also release games and consoles yourself.Hire the best staff and train them to become your masterminds. Make sure the right person is in the right place.I find this game very satisfying and I have a hard time closing down my laptop and going to bed haha.Pros:*Easy to learn the basics.*Many different games to develop.*Lots of hardware and software to research.*Easy to get ""caught up"" and play for to long.Cons:*With a huge company it tends to get a bit messy on the screen.*Quite hard to master the development strategies for high selling games.*Some graphic glitches where staff teleport through walls, but no big deals.*Easy to get ""caught up"" and play for to long.Overall:I give this game a score of 7.67 / 10 for being very fun.

								Fun, but only for a very short time...It's 2015. Every game I release that does not sell 100 Mio. Copies in the first year is considered a failure. But that's still ok, since my studio hasn't released a game with a rating less than 90% since the early 80's. Unfortunately, I can't releaser any more games, even in the biggest office and though I demolished almost all other rooms, I can't build any more servers for my subscription sheeple. And since I closed down all the other studios early on, there hasn't been a game of the year in...years, really. So I guess, I'd be a little more fun if there was something to discover after 2001, a way to improve something instead of just repeating what you just did, like dismissing a marketing campaign every 5 seconds. But you get to develop something like 75 games before you figure out the perfect settings, and for that time, it was great fun.The bad: * the default speed is way to fast, and space does not pause the game (hint: '1'does, though)* assigning people to rooms is hell* re-assigning people to rooms after some training comes down to 'who are you and where did you work before'* no work queueing. (actually, that is not true. Almost no work queueing)* after a while, it get's repetetive as .... * appearently, the world of video games has not made any advancements after 2001.Still, you get almost 30 (simulated :) years, in which teh game is great fun.Last's about a weekend.

								If you like Game Dev Tycoon, you will probably like this more. It isn't the same as GDT, there's a lot more management. You build your rooms add desks, hire staff etc. You can buy or make your own game engines, with the option to sell the engine and get a percentage of the AI developers games. There is more control over the games you create - you can buy licenses to increase the appeal of the game.Currently the game is Early Access, and will probably stay that way for a long time although the devs do dish out updates often. With that MGT has a lot of problems:- looks like English isn't the devs native language, you can understand the messages just about though- massive amount of annoying messages that pop up, whenever your staff complete any project or training, any new research available, when a console is going to be released, has been released is going to be taken off the market, when it has been taken off the market, when your games get taken off the market, when your engines sell, each time your game stops until you click ok (and project/training messages require 2 ok's) - research technology isn't consistent, particularly early on. By the time you finished your research and created an engine for it at the beginning it is already obsolete, but after year ~2000 there's hardly anything new that comes out. -theres currently no point in doing AAA games as there is only 20 different end game technologies available. -they recently added new consoles and stuff, which doesn't do anything for you other than more annoying messages.-Easy and normal have no challenge to them whatsoever, and there's no end game score like in GDT. If you haven't made 200 mil by 2005 you probably wanna check your pulse. Legendary mode is rediculous, although I've only had 1 good go at it. You can make games without engines and sell them for a profit so long as your staff are fully trained, you can do contracts and make engines to sell for like 5% profit at the beginning, but everything else fails. After my best go i made a few mil, made the best engine, fully trained my staff and made a AA game with everything in it and it failed and I went bankrupt. In Easy it's the opposite, no matter what you do you will still make a profit.-when you get a larger building and fill it with stuff the game's performance drops through the floor. To summarise, this game is worth it if you are into sim/tycoon games. The devs do update the game often, but in it's current state only die hard tycoon game fans will clock anywhere near as many hours as i have put into this game.			"

 I want to say one thing before you read this. This is still in Early Access, they are still making the game. Don't forget to post bugs and stuff you see. Now that that has been said, continue reading.I highly recommend this game. Not only is it a better version (and more updated) of Game Dev Tycoon, but it adds the element of how it is like to acutally create the game. This game does have some downsides, but other than that it is a really good game. I think this game will bring alot of people into the game making community! Now, I have personally tried using the unity engine, and I know Basic C#, and I could create nothing like this. I also have about like 79 games in my library, so this should make an impact. If you want to see this, hover over it! First off, this game is amazing. Not only will you spend the time to get started, you have $500,000 dollars into the hole while playing. I have gone into the negitives a couple times, but I have always gotten out. This game should really have a modding community, or at least mod support, because this could be imporved by adding things by mods.There are a couple downsides to this game as well though. If you want realism might wanna play Game Dev Tycoon. If you want fun, might wanna play this game. I say that because the ecomony is not the best. I will usually get about 500,000$ on a really sh*tty game. A second thing is that, sometimes when I launch the game, it will crash when it is done loading the ""Egg"" screen. I don't know if this is just me but I have to relaunch the game to get it to work. After I re-launch it seems to work fine though, so yes, this game is amazing. Another thing I really hope they work out is the ""No Deleting Saves"" thing. I feel every Game Dev game is missing a delete save. What are the odds ;)?Other than the couple of bugs, I highly reccommmend this game, because I have played it for hours now, and already almost reached a day. This is going to be an amazing game when it comes out of Early Access, and I wonder what the price will be when it does. Thank you for making this game, and thank you for making everything about it.			"

												Plays just like game dev tycoon but has a lot more depth and options.Graphics are also slightly less cartoony.If you enjoyed GDT or simulation type games. This ones good.At £11, the price is a bit steep however.			"

								I grew up on Tycoon games.  All of them.  This scratches an itch I've had for years.It sort of feels like a mix between Buisness Tycoon and The Sims.  Also, as a game developer myself, this keeps me motivated.I'm excited to see where this goes!			"

								This is by far the best game dev simulator out there. the sheer number of things you can do is incredible. and unlike other ones ive played this really makes you feel like your a specialised company. it can take over a year somtimes to make a huge game with a small team and when its finished it really feels like an accomplishment instead of grinding sliders and seeing results.This game is fantastic, the devs are amazing and incredibly active, why are you even still reading this you should be at the payment screen by now.

								I've booted this game up once only so far, and have 13 hours in game. That should tell you quite a lot.This game is quite similar to Game Dev Tycoon except has a whole lot more. The rooms are customisable and your staff will require different furniture and working conditions to keep them happy. It has quite a steep learning curve at first and I failed miserably with my first 3 games. As the game progresses and as you hire more staff, you'll need to be ontop of several different tasks at once, all with time limits. Games that have been released will need advertising and game updates to keep them in the market. If you publish your own games you'll need to keep an eye on how many are being made, if you have enough stock etc. The game will pull you in, and has a lot of replayability. Finally making a smash hit game was hard to do but felt so damn good.Definately worth the money.			"

								As an aspiring game designer I find this game to be an inspiration. What better type of game to make than one about making games? Besides, I find this very type of game interesting as it allows me to simulate my dreams. This game is very much for the players as well, as any ideas or suggestions are considered by the development team. Although simple I feel as though it is the perfect game to begin your—Eggcode’s—development experience with. Mad Games Tycoon starts you off in a garage in the 1980s where you must claw your way up through the game industry by starting your own company and making history. Creating revolutionary games is all the fun with this game. Being able to create a legacy for others to be inspired by as well as making the games which changed the industry in your own way are the reasons this game is so addictive. The game is quite easy as well, making all of the complex tasks very easy for beginners; of course there are exceptions further along in the game whereby the expansion of your company requires more elements to be available. The ability to unlock more aspects of the game in a more controlled manner by forcing players to earn money and play for lengths of time before they can move onto more complex tasks creates a buffer for new players to understand the mechanics of the game industry better. I did find however that when I began first creating my games they would usually go bust and I would have to rework contracts to regain money, I now realise that this game utilises the term you need to spend money to make money, and it works.Their depiction of the tools available is quite well done in fact, it excites me. Being able to change and modify so many details such as the toilets for example captures the side of me that loves management games. The ability to develop patches, updates, language packs, sequels, as well as undertaking contracts tugs on my perfectionist personality when it comes to games, so making sure they’re ‘up-to-date’ creates the atmosphere of me almost being there. The endless immensity of content in this game leaves me wanting more, and the actual experience far outweighs the realistic visual quality some of today’s games may offer, especially for such a low price. This game honestly propels my excitement for my own career through the roof. Being able to tell stories and make so many people happy in such an interactive way is thrilling. Mad Games Tycoon gives me encouragement to create games which can redefine gaming; a big dream yes, but at least I’m aiming somewhere. This experience provides me with insight into what can be done with a little work: being able to create worlds, or go back to different times, it’s all merely based on imagination and creativity and this game shows me that Eggcode has created a very tantalising experience—one that shows they create promising hope of future games as alluring as this one.

								Played for a bit here, very solid game, enjoyable and well worth the price.The developers need to do something about changing the mechanics of how game engine grene affects its popularity. Right now you can just make enough money from contract to hire a few person and just make game engine that undercuts your competitors in terms of royalty and up front payment. You will always be able to make profit if you do this no matter what you do, and making the game progress a bit linear for me.			"

								So, I'll be honest, after the great game that was ""Game Dev Tycoon"" (GDT) scratching an itch to be a game developer that I didn't know I had, I ended up talking and making mods with an associate of mine, and eventually ended up looking for games that came close to what we wanted to turn GDT into. The only thing that was 1) available, and 2) came anywhere close was a title called ""Mad Games Tycoon"" by Eggcode.But it's not a title that appeals to just one type of simulation gamer, but multiple types. It aims not only at those aiming for perfection, but aiming for an experience that isn't easy.True, you could take notes on things between games on where different sliders for game customization should be for different genres but to me that seems to lessen the experience a bit. This is a game where you start out in the early days of video game development. The first systems are a Personal Computer (PC) and an early Atari-type system. And it goes from there, with new consoles being released, competitors making their games and engines, liscensing your engines, and the reviewers being as critical as they ever were!It comes in four difficulty levels and options to randomize the console popularities, and so many little intricacies that you can use to affect your scores on different titles that you can never be quite certain how things will turn out.Oh, did I mention it's still early access? Yeah, it is. This game isn't even officially ""launched"" yet, and it's my benchmark for any title that wants to be a business simulator--yes, not just a game development simulation, but business simulators in general.If you've not picked up Mad Games Tycoon, you should. Surely you can spare $15 for this gem of an early access title.			"

								This is a more realistic take on game development simulation than what was seen in Game Dev Story or Game Dev Tycoon. I played the hell out of both games, but both games lack the amount of depth Mad Games Tycoon brings to the table. It combines the core aspects of Game Dev Story/Tycoon and adds in the ability to manage different divisions of your studio. It also adds the ability to publish games, market them, sell game engines, and a lot more. It takes sometime to grasp everything, but if you stick with it you become addicted. Mad Games Tycoon can use a couple more points in the visuals department, particularly with its UI. The graphics are actually pretty good. The main menu is fugly though and the game menus are a little cluttered and not totally polished. It's early access though and this is just nitpicking. I'm just glad this game exists; it’s totally what I was looking for. If you liked Game Dev Story/Tycoon and would like something more in depth then try out Mad Games Tycoon.			"

								It's a somewhat hesitant yes. I certainly had great fun with the game for a few hours, but I wont be coming back to it.I mean for long stretches the games was fun, but in the end when I got MMO's it went downhill. MMO's are simply too overpowered. My world of warcraft-ripoff made well over 800 million for me and all I had to do was open more develoing rooms so I could develop several consecutive MMO:s and develop expansions for them and the money just kept rolling in. Across all my active MMO:s I had well over 15 million subscribers so it kind of feels like I cant really lose at this game now.But up until that point it was a fun, albeit somewhat unpolished, game. Maybe I'll revisit in a year or so when maybe things have changed.			"

								I'm having a lot of fun with this game. This game adds more depth than previously released games about running a game development company. In addition to developing games, performing research, and developing game engines, you also can (optionally) produce the games for retail sale yourself. Releasing good games will help increase the market share of any device they're released on, including your own console if you create one. If you have production facilities, you will also be able to publish games made by other game companies. Probably the biggest difference in this game is that you create your own floorplan by drawing rooms and placing furniture in them. Creating an efficien layout is very important. This is the only game development game I've seen that has this.- If you've played Game Dev Tycoon and enjoyed it, then you should enjoy this game.- Vastly superior to Game Dev Story (mobile game).- Haven't compared it with Game Tycoon Studio (mobile game) yet.

								One of the best management simulations on steam right now IMO. If you've ever played Game Dev Tycoon but wanted more depth, you can stop reading and buy this. If you haven't, Mad Games Tycoon is a management simulation about starting a game development studio. You decide what genre(s), topic(s), target audience, game engine etc etc, the game is going to have/use. You oversee the development deciding whether to go more heavily into one catergory (like gameplay) over another. But you don't have to actually make games, I mean at the start yeah but not after you get established. You can make an awesome engine and sell it and make a good bit off of it. Or you can just publish games and try to turn a profit. Many different avenues can be taken to make a fortune.Pros:- Deep gameplay, with many options- Graphics are pleasing. Not amazing, but they work and add to the charm- I like the music.- Addictive- Adjustable pace.- A few different starting points (1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 IIRC. Only looked at it once)- You can set trends and be a hipster- You need to attend to people's needs. No being a slave driver.- With the sheer amount of topics (something like 300 i think), you can get some hilarious games made that'll sell well. Imagine that's a big plus for streamers/Youtuber people.Cons(minor):- The UI can be frustrating/clunky. (have to click like 3-4 Xs to leave a build menu)- The amount of sounds from completing research/parts of games etc can become constant in a big office. (thank big gunz upstairs for volume control)- Have to rebuild the entire office after each move. Understandable from a realism perspective, just sometimes can be an annoyance if you don't want to do that for 50+ people.- Have to be smart. If you have a dumb-dumb moment and move into a bigger building just because you have the cash to buy it, well read the point above again. You'll have to take out a loan, possibly at 200% the normal interest rate. In other words, a small tooltip there would be handy.- No way of grouping people into ""teams"" that i've seen. After a move, or a big class session, it's a pain to sift through your people to find the ones you had developing, researching, doing the graphics etc. Would be amazing if that little nuisance was plucked in the butt.- Addictive.- Nothing to really indicate when a new console is coming/when it's going to be taken off the market. No/not much historical news either. I'm in '94 right now, and haven't seen one yet.Overall, the game is very good as it is. The cons are just minor frustrations that will probably be dealt with before full release (or it's my own ignorance/dumb-dumb moments that made the cons). This is defintely worthy of a pick up if you're into management style games. If you're looking to start playing management games, this ain't a bad place to start. I'd give it a solid  8/10  "

								The game is a lot of fun and the Devs are doing an amazing job. Updates and fixes continue to come for this game at a much higher pace than most games. I come back to this game every few months and it just keeps getting better and better. It also does a great job of letting your run your company in different ways and still be successful.			"

								I'm having a lot of fun with this game. This game adds more depth than previously released games about running a game development company. In addition to developing games, performing research, and developing game engines, you also can (optionally) produce the games for retail sale yourself. Releasing good games will help increase the market share of any device they're released on, including your own console if you create one. If you have production facilities, you will also be able to publish games made by other game companies. Probably the biggest difference in this game is that you create your own floorplan by drawing rooms and placing furniture in them. Creating an efficien layout is very important. This is the only game development game I've seen that has this.- If you've played Game Dev Tycoon and enjoyed it, then you should enjoy this game.- Vastly superior to Game Dev Story (mobile game).- Haven't compared it with Game Tycoon Studio (mobile game) yet.

								One of the best management simulations on steam right now IMO. If you've ever played Game Dev Tycoon but wanted more depth, you can stop reading and buy this. If you haven't, Mad Games Tycoon is a management simulation about starting a game development studio. You decide what genre(s), topic(s), target audience, game engine etc etc, the game is going to have/use. You oversee the development deciding whether to go more heavily into one catergory (like gameplay) over another. But you don't have to actually make games, I mean at the start yeah but not after you get established. You can make an awesome engine and sell it and make a good bit off of it. Or you can just publish games and try to turn a profit. Many different avenues can be taken to make a fortune.Pros:- Deep gameplay, with many options- Graphics are pleasing. Not amazing, but they work and add to the charm- I like the music.- Addictive- Adjustable pace.- A few different starting points (1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 IIRC. Only looked at it once)- You can set trends and be a hipster- You need to attend to people's needs. No being a slave driver.- With the sheer amount of topics (something like 300 i think), you can get some hilarious games made that'll sell well. Imagine that's a big plus for streamers/Youtuber people.Cons(minor):- The UI can be frustrating/clunky. (have to click like 3-4 Xs to leave a build menu)- The amount of sounds from completing research/parts of games etc can become constant in a big office. (thank big gunz upstairs for volume control)- Have to rebuild the entire office after each move. Understandable from a realism perspective, just sometimes can be an annoyance if you don't want to do that for 50+ people.- Have to be smart. If you have a dumb-dumb moment and move into a bigger building just because you have the cash to buy it, well read the point above again. You'll have to take out a loan, possibly at 200% the normal interest rate. In other words, a small tooltip there would be handy.- No way of grouping people into ""teams"" that i've seen. After a move, or a big class session, it's a pain to sift through your people to find the ones you had developing, researching, doing the graphics etc. Would be amazing if that little nuisance was plucked in the butt.- Addictive.- Nothing to really indicate when a new console is coming/when it's going to be taken off the market. No/not much historical news either. I'm in '94 right now, and haven't seen one yet.Overall, the game is very good as it is. The cons are just minor frustrations that will probably be dealt with before full release (or it's my own ignorance/dumb-dumb moments that made the cons). This is defintely worthy of a pick up if you're into management style games. If you're looking to start playing management games, this ain't a bad place to start. I'd give it a solid  8/10  "

								I like this a lot better than Game Dev Tycoon, the only other game of the same subgenre I've played.  My reasons for that are that there is more to do / care about, more ways you can influence your game releases, much, much more with company management, it's still under development (and thus getting more content than it has already), and has more overall depth.Fun to play while you're doing other things, but I'll admit I end up being too focused on the game to function elsewhere.  Well done, devs; you've already made a decent game, but I'm looking forward to the next patch!			"

Although it's pretty early, I haven't encounter anything bugging me :)About a month ago, I played similar game and thought it was great value for money ($1 game!) and although this game costed me almost 10x the price, I still think Mad Games Tycoon beats that game for value for money!PRO:- In Depth- You can beat the game in many different ways/strategies (I focus a lot on investing on other companies even earlier years)- High replayability, I am going to try Hardcore once I beat my playthrough for sure- Lots of updates from the developer (even quite polished already when I first bought it)CONS:- Could be too complex for a beginner who first play this- Music coud be improved a bit, now I am mostly just play other music from youtube :)			"

								Become the elite game designer you knew your were destined to be. Flog your name as the ultimate game brand and rake in the millions.This is a real gamer's game that puts you at the helm of a fledgling game company at the beginning of the industry and let's you try to do better than the big names (with a little help from mods). It's a fun experience that gets a lot of things right ...but - so far the simulation levels behind the game systems are quite shallow, and being shallow are quite exploitable and break the mood a little. If you are willing to self impose a few ground rules then these can be overlooked and ignored for the most part. And this being an EA title we can hope that the devs will flesh out some concepts and polish up the edges.My prediction is Mad Games Tycoon 2 will be a classic, this game is worth supporting to get us there.

												I bought this having already bought and played Game Corp DX and of the two I would say this is the better.Game Corp is much simpler and less detailed whereas this can get rather complicated with the different rooms and their processes. Unfortunately the tutorial is rather basic and will still leave you wondering what the different skills significances are, how you unlock new stuff to research, etc..., as such you'll need to do a bit of research on your own to figure out all that.As long as you're a fan of this style of game you could easily get a few days of entertainment out of this and then nip back to it every so often when you feel like a bit of casual play. At the same time though, the full price of €15 seems a bit steep so I'd suggest holding off for a sale.			"

								This game is awesome! I haven't been addicted to a game like this in a while. I played GameDev Tycoon when it came out and loved that one as well. Always hoped for a sequel to it. Well, Mad Games Tycoon is the sequel I've been waiting for! Tons of topics to use with lots of genres that you can mix, match, and blend together. The scoring of games seems to take more into account than just how much higher your score was from the last game you developed. As such I've been able to make some smaller B+ and A games that my company can release while I develop the next big AA and AAA games. The smaller games still sell well enough to keep the cashflow coming in. With several different buildings available for purchase and lots of objects to fill them with, it's easy to customize the layout to your liking. The bigger buildings give you more than enough room to make a massive gaming empire.So far I personally haven't run into any bugs. However, I would like to see more miscellaneous objects with higher ratings to decorate the office with. Also, the option to have multiple doors on a room would make designing the layout of the floor easier. Some more tooltip popups on some of the other menus would also be helpful. A brief explaination of buying and selling shares of other companies would be nice as well. Other than those things there isn't anything else I can think of at the moment that could be improved. All-in-all, this is definitely one of the more complete and polished early access games I have played. One of the better purchases I've made. The devs seem to be pretty active as well. I would totally recommend giving this game a look if you're into tycoon type games.			"

YouTube™ Video: MAKING GAMES LIKE MAD! | Mad Games Tycoon #1 

			Views: 146		

			I'm really enjoying everything Mad Games Tycoon has to offer! Part 2 ►https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyt8orDue-Y Get Mad Games Tycoon on Steam!		

What makes Mad Games Tycoon better than other game dev tycoons?In the little bit that I've played of Mad Games Tycoon, I am already really enjoying it!  It has everything that other game dev tycoons offer and even more than that.First of all, CUSTOMIZATION.  Mad Games Tycoon gives you customization opportunities out the wazoo.  It really opens up the door for extremely close and personal gameplay, so that no two players' games look the same.  Where other games have offered its players the ability to name each game, what kind of game it is, who you hire, etc., Mad Games Tycoon goes much deeper than that.  In MGT, I am given the privilege of customizing my headquarters just the way I want it, down to the foliage scattered around in my offices and even vending machines in my staff room. Customization options when making games are also pretty hefty as I am able to customize every game down to even choosing a publisher. The customization options in MGT really make me feel like I'm playing MY game and not a game that everyone else is playing.Second, REWARDS.  MGT so far has proved to be an extremely rewarding experience.  As I progress further into the game, new opportunities unlock for me (and I don't just mean new consoles and/or game genres).  The more I do in the game, the more I'm rewarded with things like new office spaces, new items, and new publishing opportunities.  The reward system of MGT takes place on a greater scale than any other game dev tycoon I've played.Lastly, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO DO. A problem I've run into with other game dev tycoons is running out of things to do once I start development on a new game.  I would always end up hitting the fast forward button to finish the game as quick as I could.  But in MGT, there's always something to do whether it's customizing your offices, hiring new people, buying licenses or whatever you want really.  The only downside of this is that as far as I can tell, when you're doing most other things while the game is being developed, I'm pretty sure that development pauses.  But I could be wrong.So far, what I've played of MGT has proved to be an immensely satisfying experience.  I wasn't sure about it at first, but the game proved me wrong.  I would suggest Mad Games Tycoon to anyone interested in this genre of game.9/10			"

								The game starts you off in the early days of computer gaming as a developer. Mad Games Tycoon takes a more realistic approach than some others in the genre as you hire far more employees, can upgrade to huge buildings and have far more options for your gaming empire. Here you can produce your own consoles, publish your own (and others) games, acquire other developers and eventually make massively multiplayer games that require a server room. Along the way you need to research features, console parts and an almost endless assortment of other things to keep on the cutting edge of gaming.The heart of the game is making games. This entails making game engines, which you can sell, choosing genres and sub-genres, optimizing settings for that genre, choosing a desired audience from kids to senior citizens and eventually having graphics, sounds and animation departments added features. Oh and you'll need a group of playtesters to stamp out bugs.At points it can all feel a bit overwhelming, but it is a vast amount of managerial fun if you like management times games and can handle some micro-management along the way. The game has constantly improved along the way as the developer is responsive to the community and updates frequently.I've played a significant number of games that are similiar and most are fairly good, but so far MGT is my favorite and it seems like everytime I figure I've played enough for a good long time, out comes an update with a new feature that I want to try. This is the good side of the sometimes problematic Ealry Access format and I commend the developer.			"

												One of the best management games available. I happen to make video games myself so I probably liked it more than your average person but I still recommend it to anyone who likes strategy management games. I have a lot of fun building game engines, have yet to try building consoles but I will try it soon! :)			"

												Hard for beginners but overall a rewarding game. A lot of fun for hours if you can get a grip of it. Tutorials are either too short (only the basics) or they just disappear after basic office building steps.Too much things to research (even genres and game-types).So overall this game is like taming a wild mustang - hard to get close and on top but rewarding once you become one with the horse.

								Finally a game that doesnt try to make a total copy of ""Game Dev Story"" (yes im looking at you Game Dev Tycoon).MGT is a really fun approach to game dev simulation games, You start on a small garage and can only build a couple different rooms, but after a while you will be managing a big office with +100 employees. You have to plan a lot of stuff into making each of your games. Early on, you will only have a small development room, with a few people that do most of the work, but as you grow, you will start getting new rooms for each specific part of development (music, graphics, gameplay, QA) working together to make the best game possible. After you grow enough, you can even start to produce the games, instead of relying on other companies to publish it for you (and you start getting publishing deals for smaller companies too).It's still on Early Access, and it's getting weekly updates for most part. It still suffers a bit on the performance side, when you start growing up and using the bigger offices, you will get huge slowdowns, it gets a bit better each patch, but it's still far from good.Pros:- Engaging gameplay (Time flies while you try to make the best game possible, or organize your newly purchased office).- Difficult early game (You're not a God sent developer, even more so in harder difficulties, this can be very frustrating or really interesting).- As of the latest patch to date, you can build your own hardware, it's still in early stages and needs some work, but its fun to dig into the hardware market and try to make your platform the nº1 in the market.- Building is not super indepth, which imo is fine, it works really well for what the game tries to accomplish.Cons:- Late game is far too easy, around year 2020, new stuff stops coming out, and by that time you start having enough money to completely monopolize the market, even in the highest difficulty.- Changing to a new Office can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when you have hundreds of employees and you have to manually assign each one to their position all over again.- HUD could use some work.- There are too many menus (e.g. To buy a chair you need to: Open the build Menu > Select the Misc sub Menu > Select the Chair you want), and while you're browsing the menus, the game completely stops, and slightly breaks the flow of the gameplay.- The Market needs a huge revamp, a finite amount of buyers, and logic consumers (I've had a game, exclusive to my own hardware, and that game sold twice as much as the console ever did in it's life time).Overall I'd say this game is a safe purchase if you're a fan of the genre :) "

								So, this is a weird one. Mad Games Tycoon is pretty much exactly what you'd expect. It's miles beyond something like Game Dev Tycoon. It's always updated. They update it constantly.But here's the problem: It's incredibly addicitive for the first 8-10 hours or so. I went to bed at 4:30am two nights in a row. Then you realize you've done everything there is to do and the game gets boring. I completely lose interest and usually stop playing after around 10-12 hours. I go awya for 6-7 months, come back and there's enough new features that I reapeat the process again.The problem with MGT is that it's going to have zero replayability after the constant updates stop, and they eventually will. You play it once, do everything you can in 8 hours, then never touch the game again. Keep in mind, I _love_ management simulations. I have hundreds of hours in Football Manager, for instance. But there's just not so much to do in this one. As I said, once the updates stop, there's no chance you'll want to replay it after you go through it once. Keep that in mind before you buy it.I do give it a conditional Yes, though, as it does have that initial 8 hours of crippling addiction.			"

								* EDIT * I did some testing and it seems like how you make the game has nothing to do with how its scored. 3 times in a row i made a game that had a terrible combinations of genre and topic, didnt touch a single slide in the next section and randomly moved the slides in the graphics/music/gameplay section.Each time my game got 91%...This is something that MUST BE FIXED. --------------------------------------------------------So I bought this game today at around 9pm... It is now 5am... I dont regret a single thing. I know this game is in early acces or whatever, but it has sooo much more than GDT in it. Some things that I didnt really like are - Buying engines... no point in making your own...- I got 9 games in a row that were rated 91% ... Thats something that needs to be changed. - I dont like creating the office space... Thats more personal preference but the whole way its done is quite bad to me..Other than this the game was worth every cent. I cant wait for what the future holds for Mad Games Tycoon.			"

								If you love game development and if you love Theme Hospital then you will love this one. Given this is early access and room for heaps of improvement is brutally obvious, the game is shaping up to a solid management simulation in the likes of Bullfrog creations. It even sprinkles some humor over the game to keep things interesting. There is depth in gameplay which is missing from Game Dev Tycoon (another good game in its own right). You need proper planning and the game, in its current state, is unforgiving. You cannot resize rooms! Choices like ""should I place that expensive one star plant or the cheap one star plant?"" become important as you grow a bond with your virtual employees. Sometimes you feel like rewarding them by throwing in an extra fan. The game follows accurate history of game development and I felt nostalgic when I could easily relate to 16-bit graphics being a selling point.

								Mad Games Tycoon is different from games like Game Dev Tycoon. It has a more realistic approach like that your employees have to use the bathroom and if they find the room/building cold then they work slower. Although I find working 24/365 unrealistic as I don't think anyone is that passionate about games where they would work without at least taking a vacation in 30 years. Mad Games Tycoon has more ways of making money for example  you can make money off of engines by setting a certain % of profit sharing if people buy your engine and use it for their games. You can also make money from subscriptions from MMO although that needs some balancing.The game is still in early access and so far I am happy with the way things are although there are some bugs and things that need balancing.Would recommend.

								After a massive timesink into this game I feel that Mad Games Tycoon makes for a signifigant updated version to Game Dev Tycoon. The consept of the two games are similar, but everything else within the game is much more complex in both tasks and mechanics. You are required to put in a lot of consistant imput, spend a lot of time thinking about growth, and for the perfectionist there is a lot of ways to micromanage, but the game is not built to require it either for the casual gamer making for a great balance.While there are flaws such as how the charachers will get themselves hung up on some objects, I hardly consider such minutia an issue due to the fact that this is an early access game (as of writing this review). For those who loved Game Dev Tycoon, this is a must buy. Just remember when you start the game, there is a sudden learning curve (due to the fact that the early access lacks a detailed tutorial at the time of this review). So for the first time player, treat the first 2-3 starts as a dry run to learn the mechanics, the objects, the rooms, etc. For early access buyers, bear with the learning curve because once you pass the turn its a massive and enjoyable timesink.

								This game is the best of the game simulation titles that I have played and while comparable to Game Dev Tycoon it is more akin to Game Dev Story on Android devices. It has more variety, it allows you to build rooms yourself, it has a wider range of training parameters, and the story is considerably longer than other tycoon games. At six hours I just encountered the release of the PS2 where in other games we'd be finished the list of events. That said the game can be much better. English is clearly not the first language of Eggcode (See event message for game release ""3th World War 2"") and there needs to be quite a few corrections. Secondly the animation and graphics of the people / employees is terrible. People barely look like people and females are only distinguishable by their names. The game allows you to succeed largely as a producer of engines if you don't have luck making games but I feel this could be expanded and improved to allow for engine marketing and support. Maybe even the design of periphreals to sell with the engine or game. Another issue is that the event messages are strictly limited to other game releases and profit reports. Eggcode should be looking at adding things like conventions, pirating issues, fan requests, and direct interaction with the publishers. The game tracks publisher relationship but that doesn't seem to extend in functionality any further than how likely they are to produce a marketing campaign for your game.			"

								Played it for the first time yesterday. Started getting frustrated at first while I was trying to figure out how to succeed, but once I figured it out I was hooked. I then realized I'd been playing for seven hours.The game has a lot of depth to it already. You can make virtually any kind of game that you could dream of. Currently, my most successful is a hunting/fighting game which for the life of me, I have no idea how that would work, but it still won Game of the Year.This game is certainly more realistic than anything else in it's catagory. Right up with the GameBiz series, but much better set out and easier for the casual gamer to pick up. With this you can actually play at your own pace (to an extent) rather than needing to have certain things at certain times.10/10 Highly recommended			"

								I've got well over 100 games in my library and this is the first one i've decided to recommend. It's a great game but perhaps more importantly in todays ""early beta"" madness this Dav really cares about the game. Constant updates and tweaks, it seems this is really a passion project and not a money making scheme. Get behind you won't regret it!			"

												I'm not sure what initially drew me to this game. I've enjoyed most game development titles but always thought that there could be more. I watched good ol' Sips play a bit but I don't think he grasped the difference between Mad Games Tycoon and other titles. What struck me was the depth available in gameplay. Sure there are some things that could be done better (upgrading location for instance should keep layout of current office; ability to simply ""move"" rooms with contents; multiple automated offices?, things like that), but the core of the game is very good. I would recommend it, especially seeing how I got stuck in for 4 hours right away, and keep coming back. I've got a few more hours to put in before I've hit everything I think I could hit, but I think I could replay this some more with various settings like events turned on, raising the difficulty, and so on.

												Backed it up when it was in early access. It was constantly changing, so I waited about a year for it to be complete. It paid off.	At first, the tutorial is kinda lame, the interface is simplistic, and some of the animations don't match the style, or they are just downright hilarious. But, after about an hour, I was completely invested in that game, and I played for about 7 hours straight, right before midnight. If you like tycoons, sims, or just wanna sit back and relax, the game is a good pickup.my only gripes with this game is that when you move from building to building to save more space, the rooms don't save, so you need to rebuild everytime you move (and you'll be moving a lot, pal.). You should group up your employees before you move, or else you'll have to carefully reorganize everything back into their original positions.\I would give this game a 9/10.I also haven't encountered any bugs yet, so if I do, I'll be sure to update this.

								So far, from what I've seen its a relatively thought out game. I've only been playing on easy mode and while I haven't lost yet (A stark difference from Game dev Tycoon) theres still plenty of entertainment value for me here. I think the major points i'd offer would be being able to Queue up projects (ESPECIALLY in Research), having to go in and research each topic one by one (same with Genres and other such things) can be a hassle. The only other major thing I'd say this game could use would be, as with GDT, the ability to make your own consoles.Having said all this? I acknowledge this game is still in Early access, I think it has potential and I'd certainly recommend it to my friends.			"

								I don't typically review a lot of games; others usually say all that needs to be said.I'm making an exception here.I saw this game and debated it, since I enjoyed 'Game Dev Tycoon' enough. One of the best purchases I've made in a long time. I don't see any cons yet, which for an Early Access game (Which I usually avoid,) is outstanding in itself. It takes a little time to completely figure out how it functions, but that's because it's FAR more complex (In a great way,) then Game Dev Tycoon.The amount and levels of control you have is great, highly useful.I build games... and did horrible at the start. Stopped, Focused on game engines instead... did well. Went back to making more games, doing better but not great. Funding came more by the money made by my game engines. After money... made money producing games, too. Still didn't make many games.Years down the road... I'm now a economic powerhouse who has the best console, best RPG games (Which is my main focus,) and best production house in the world. 11/10 would build a company from scratch again and become another powerhouse.

								Very Stable game, especially for an early access game. I'm a big fan of simulators and most of them are crap. This one is different and the Dev's have obviously made a commitment to quality versus just trying to turn a quick buck. What is lacking is an end game at this point, or true competition with other Studios in the game. Further, when you add production lines and start self producing games, it becomes a bit difficult to manage without larger buildings, or a more automated process. The Dev's at this point could release the game as a full complete addition, and it would rival many of the sim games on Steam. But they promise more, and the sky is the limit as far as how far they take this game.			"

You can even produce and sell the games you make and give people a balloon! yes.

I don't see much complexity thoughIs it better than GDT or GGM ?Dunno, haven't played eitherIs it complete?There's still a feature here and there unreleased yet, so no. But the base game is complete enough to be called ""Complete""Is it fun?Hell yes it is, though it gets boring later in the game, where you have lots of employees, and waiting for a new game to be finished. It is VERY sleep inducingThe graphic? The music? Nothing great about the aspectThe only thing I really, really hate about this game is there are no way to drag a lot of people in the same time. So you gotta drag people ONE BY ONE, this is very irritating, especially when you have 100 employees or so.			"

You hire a dude, make a room, make a game (which consists of picking a genre and then adjusting sliders). In one game I did somewhat okay, unlocked this room where I can analyze games so I can re-create their success. Got the best-seller, recreated it perfectly, got a horrible review, went bankrupt. Things that work in one game don't work in the other as far as creating games, so you're constantly trying to find what's good to make, constantly taking money from the bank, feels like you're never truly in control. Quite annoying. I hated this game.			"

But that is part of the process of an early access game untill they figure out how to update the game that does not break saved games.Features i would like to see in the game which may still even be added in the near future:1.abjustable rooms after you have already placed it and built in the room so you dont need to remove the room completely.2. when buying a new office the current buildings and funiture you had in you're old office should be able to be transfered to the new office  like maybe have blueprints you can select.3. when updating game instead of it breaking the game which it still can but leave the characters alone so when you do load your save game you are still able to continue from scratch but keep all the Characters you had and their Status Levels4. access to old updates from steam in the BETA section so if you want to continue on with ur game you should be able to revert back to the old updateBUT AWESOME BEST EVER GAME ON STEAM YOU CAN COME ACROSS IN THIS GENRE BUY IT NOW AND FOREVER HOLD YOU'RE PEACE - and enjoy			"

You hire a dude, make a room, make a game (which consists of picking a genre and then adjusting sliders). In one game I did somewhat okay, unlocked this room where I can analyze games so I can re-create their success. Got the best-seller, recreated it perfectly, got a horrible review, went bankrupt. Things that work in one game don't work in the other as far as creating games, so you're constantly trying to find what's good to make, constantly taking money from the bank, feels like you're never truly in control. Quite annoying. I hated this game.			"

												12+ hours so far, and I'm still not done playing it. 3 save files, and I'm learning more every day.I know I should make some long, drawn out reason WHY you should buy this game, or consider buying the game... You know, a legitimate review. But I won't.So quickly. For early access, this game has tons of features, and it seems to be actively worked on. If you're a fan of games like Software INC, this game is for you. While it doesn't allow for actual custom buildings like software INC, it does offer a LOT of depth, and has a decent amount of graphs, and information to offer you enough feedback so when you're doing something wrong you generally know what it is.The tutorial is lacking, severely. This game benefits from struggling, to completely failing the first time around just to get you familiar with the mechanics which are poorly explained. However, executed fairly well. The tutorial is by far the most lacking part of the game.Anyways, for $14.99, the amount of depth and the active development is enough to justify at LEAST hitting your wishlist for further consideration at a later time. Would definitely recommend, evenif this is a poorly written review. I apologize if thats the case.Still awesome! [edit 11/28/16]			"

Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women! Buy out your competition then shut them down for good, or let them make games for your profit! Build a console that breaks the mold and take control of the hardware industry! Create the perfect game, with dozens of genres and even more topics to pick from you're sure to find a winner.

								This game is shallow, poorly balanced and the UI is rudimentary and obtrusive. The concept is nice but the implementation sucks.Too little variety in all areas except game concepts. No help or explanations inside the game. A lot of ridiculous assumptions like too many types of game consoles (more than the number of games), plenty of game consoles with 0 games but 5% market share (what's the point of such a device), all employees at one level having the same salary which remains constant, people choosing a job based solely on the office furniture, people being able to work in any department (but furniture being tied to the type of room), people's skill set is extremely simplistic (game design, programming, graphics, sound, office skills - which one is useful for someone in marketing or hardware design ?). Game info is spread too thinly over a lot of hard to find places which consist of dialog boxes chains instead of having a more sensible solution. There is no progress indication for projects that aren't games (research projects, console development, marketing campaigns) not even a list of current projects. Now you manage that! After a certain point this game gets too annoying "

								After playing Game Dev Tycoon years ago, I always desired a successor that had more depth and options in how you can progress in the game. This game is everything I asked for, with the replayability being helped by the constant updates to the game. My one gripe with the game is that once you have the formula for success in your games, not making a profitable game, nevermind failing, is a non issue. This issue seems to have already started to be addressed with the addition of negative trends, so I have full faith that the game will be balanced further as it is developed. This game is worth every penny it is sold for.UPDATE (6/17/16): The developers have updated the game constantly (three in the past 10 days by the looks of it) and the balance in difficulty has definitely started to be addessed. With the consistent updating of the game. The additions the developers have made have also given this game a lot of replayability (as can be seen by my curent playtime) so I recommend it now even more.			"

								Take Game Dev Tycoon and Rollercoaster Tycoon, now put them together. You take the idea of developing games from Game Dev Tycoon, and you take the strategic building elements from Rollercoaster Tycoon.I really liked Game Dev Tycoon, but it was lacking something. For instance, you cannot design your building in Game Dev Tycoon. The strategy was there, but there just wasn't enoughMad Games Tycoon fixes this. The game is deep, and it can take awhile to learn how to play the best. This game is well worth it at full price, and if you find it on sale, grab it right away! This one is great!8.5/10			"

								I know this game is early-access but it does not free a game from judgment.This game is a step up from the game Mad Games Tycoon, though sadly it does not contain the ability to create your own console/computer.  But still, I did not and will not judge a game by it lokking or just is a copy of another game, it is content and the way that content is distributed throughout the game by it's engine.  The blend, in my view, is perfect.  However the following are the major flaws I have found to be quite irritating; you must be carefull when selecting options for what you want to be accomplished in a certain room, by opening that menu it pauses the game, but, it does not prevent you from picking up an object/staff member.  Then there is the lag generated by the moving boxes on the pressing machines, tha particle effects of a pressing machine, and from the progress/money icons generated from the staff/machines from progress/up-keep cost, respectivelly.  Next, the way pop-ups are handled in the way that the releases of consoles and the generation of money from a competitor.  I know that you can turn these off, but I belive that they could have added in, say, a ticker bar at the bottom that would not cause the game to pause during me looking up achievements or hurrying to a room to order a contract to be completed in order to avoid bankrupsty.  Finally, the way that games are created are based off of an irratating back/next button desicion screens, I sometimes miscount the number of features, or realise that the game I wanted was either to be market release only or MMO.  It would kinder that they replace the button system with a tab system.  But with the enjoyment/satisfaction I feel I would have to say 8.5 out of 10.			"

								If you like the whole tycoon style of gaming, this isn't one to be overlooked!Basic outline of the game:The game has you start in your garage, you work for free (because you're that kind of guy!) and you possibly hire a few guys to help you out.  You research new graphical and sound techniques to keep up with the trends and work your way up in to a gaming powerhouse with your own motion capture studios and graphical studios, even being your own production company!The similarities between this and other games of this genre such as Game Dev Tycoon and Game Dev Story are many, the mechanics are the same, the goals are the same and you research the same sort of technology, genres etc.  The difference comes in that it feels a bit more in depth, it isn't just 3 sliders to determine what goes in to the game, there are a few more sliders, but the same sort of thing! Of course it does look a bit prettier as well, less like a Windows 8 store game and more like a real game, so it has eye candy going in its favour too.Being early access it still has room for improvement and I'm sure it will come. Is it worth £10.99? At the moment, probably not, I don't feel it has enough ""pull"" to keep me going for a long time, but £5.99 sure, I couild see that being a reasonable price in the current position (at time of review).As this is steam, I should probably give it a rough score with a funny magazine style quote.7/10 - Would fail to finish MMO expansion in time again.

								Take Game Dev Tycoon and Rollercoaster Tycoon, now put them together. You take the idea of developing games from Game Dev Tycoon, and you take the strategic building elements from Rollercoaster Tycoon.I really liked Game Dev Tycoon, but it was lacking something. For instance, you cannot design your building in Game Dev Tycoon. The strategy was there, but there just wasn't enoughMad Games Tycoon fixes this. The game is deep, and it can take awhile to learn how to play the best. This game is well worth it at full price, and if you find it on sale, grab it right away! This one is great!8.5/10			"

								I know this game is early-access but it does not free a game from judgment.This game is a step up from the game Mad Games Tycoon, though sadly it does not contain the ability to create your own console/computer.  But still, I did not and will not judge a game by it lokking or just is a copy of another game, it is content and the way that content is distributed throughout the game by it's engine.  The blend, in my view, is perfect.  However the following are the major flaws I have found to be quite irritating; you must be carefull when selecting options for what you want to be accomplished in a certain room, by opening that menu it pauses the game, but, it does not prevent you from picking up an object/staff member.  Then there is the lag generated by the moving boxes on the pressing machines, tha particle effects of a pressing machine, and from the progress/money icons generated from the staff/machines from progress/up-keep cost, respectivelly.  Next, the way pop-ups are handled in the way that the releases of consoles and the generation of money from a competitor.  I know that you can turn these off, but I belive that they could have added in, say, a ticker bar at the bottom that would not cause the game to pause during me looking up achievements or hurrying to a room to order a contract to be completed in order to avoid bankrupsty.  Finally, the way that games are created are based off of an irratating back/next button desicion screens, I sometimes miscount the number of features, or realise that the game I wanted was either to be market release only or MMO.  It would kinder that they replace the button system with a tab system.  But with the enjoyment/satisfaction I feel I would have to say 8.5 out of 10.			"

								If you like the whole tycoon style of gaming, this isn't one to be overlooked!Basic outline of the game:The game has you start in your garage, you work for free (because you're that kind of guy!) and you possibly hire a few guys to help you out.  You research new graphical and sound techniques to keep up with the trends and work your way up in to a gaming powerhouse with your own motion capture studios and graphical studios, even being your own production company!The similarities between this and other games of this genre such as Game Dev Tycoon and Game Dev Story are many, the mechanics are the same, the goals are the same and you research the same sort of technology, genres etc.  The difference comes in that it feels a bit more in depth, it isn't just 3 sliders to determine what goes in to the game, there are a few more sliders, but the same sort of thing! Of course it does look a bit prettier as well, less like a Windows 8 store game and more like a real game, so it has eye candy going in its favour too.Being early access it still has room for improvement and I'm sure it will come. Is it worth £10.99? At the moment, probably not, I don't feel it has enough ""pull"" to keep me going for a long time, but £5.99 sure, I couild see that being a reasonable price in the current position (at time of review).As this is steam, I should probably give it a rough score with a funny magazine style quote.7/10 - Would fail to finish MMO expansion in time again.

Early Access Review
								I'm a firm believer in that when it comes to Early Access, a review has to be about where the game is going, not where it's at.Because it's early access, it's STILL in development.But this is one of those games that I can review both sides of itWhere is it going:This game is showing the potential to be an insanely great Tycoon game, with massive amounts of depth, intended more for a seasoned Tycoon player.And if the developers listen to their community, it'll be a truly community shaped Tycoon game, with massive amounts of depth and features that the gamers want. (which is really what Early Access is all about, unfortunately, not every developer gets this)Where it's at:The game is rather stable, my computer can play it without crashing, or encountering many bugs at all (my computer is a 2013 high ender, it's due for an upgrade, but it's still really powerful) this is rare for a game so early in Alpha.The game already has some really great things to play with, the core mechanics seem to all be present to my knowledge.Where the game stands now, you can purchase it and have a lot of fun with it.The game however has one downside that I personally hope gets addressed, progress on games, research, engines, general progression even progression relating to skills, is really slow, and this means that after finishing a game, you don't really get any real benefit from it in the skill department, your developers do get better at certain genres though, which is a separate system from the skill system.And to add to that, you are often put in the situation of ""I have nothing to do and I'm bored, because I'm just watching things happen"" while you wait for a game to complete or an engine to be fully coded, or research to be completed, etc.and there needs to be things implemented so you the player have something to do while you wait (maybe a mini game, or just general things to do, click this, this happens kinda thing, for example watering plants, collecting mail, something to keep you occupied) The visuals are good enough, but I personally believe they should upgrade the graphics if the developers get the chance, and aren't bogged down with everything else. I'd also like to be able to zoom in further.Where is it going scoreboard:Has the potential to be:Visuals 8/10Gameplay: 10/10Depth and scope: 10/10replayability: 9/10Where it's currently at scoreboard:Visuals 6.5/10Gameplay 7.5/10 - (affected mostly by what I discussed above about there being nothing to do during certain parts)Depth and Scope: 8.5/10replayability: 8/10Overall (currently): 8/10Verdict:Do you like tycoon games? do you like money? do you like video games and challenges and management?!Then why are you not supporting this?!If you like all of those things, buy this game, support the developers, play the game now and have a good time!

								This game is by far the best game-dev simulator on steam. And it just came out on Early Access! I have play Game-Dev Tycoon for over 50 hours so I know this game is better. This goes way more in-depth with being able to sell things like posters with your games and being able to customize the price of the game. There is relatively no limit to the workers and you can have teams of people Researching, Marketing, and many more. I look forward to putting much more hours into this game.           11/10			"

Early Access Review
True story:- Founded a company called Electronic Farts- Became ridiculously rich- Acquired all of the promising developers- Used all the manpower to create shallow successors to what once were great games on a yearly basis- Ruled the market- Got even richer- Gave♥♥♥♥♥♥about my fans10/10 best real life simulator everActual ReviewThe game is great, it's much more in-depth than other game tycoon games. Mad Games Tycoon actually feels and plays like a true business simulation. You can do so much stuff which you can't do in all the other games, so this one should be a no-brainer if you are looking for a more complex game. You can do so much more than just develop games. My first games all got bad ratings, so I decided to screw game development for now and became specialized in game engine development. You can sell the engines you develop to other studios and you also get a cut of their profit for games based on your engines. Don't like this approach? Go into production, produce games for other developers or take it one step further and become a publisher.It's true that there is quite a bit of micromanagement involved, but it's not a problem. At least you got things to do in this game. Besides, that's the way things work - as a boss you got to tell your people what to do - you delegate (unless you have some sort of middle management that does it for you, which you simply do not have in this game). That is exactly what you do in this game too. Edit: After 45 hrs. I just found out that you can queue orders for most of your departments. Graphics, audio and gameplay improvements (6 in each department) can all be selected at once and will then be completed automatically. This greatly reduces the micro management criticized by most of the negative reviews.The developer is great, he is very active in the forums and not only listens to suggestions from the community, but actually implements them. The game itself already feels very complete, this is not one of those barely playable early alpha titles. The only downside I noticed is that the performance suffers a bit as your studio grows. Not a game breaking issue though, so definitely recommended. Well worth the full price.			"

Early Access Review
								It's been a while since I wanted to try a good Game development simulator. After reading the reviews and watching let's plays of Game Dev tycoon and Game Dev Story, I came to the conclusion that they both were lacking of deep gameplay and customization mechanics. On the contrary it seemed to be one of the strenght of Mad Games Tycoon which is exactly what convinced me to give it a try....and I do not regret it so far:  this game is already very good even on EA. There are flaws and annoying issues of course but also great gameplay mechanics and very good ideas in this game. Pro's:-Dozens of game genres (Rpg, RTS, FPS, TPS, Sim, MMO, Arcade, Sport, Fantasy, Strategy....) which can be mixed together with a subgenre AND one of the hundred of themes (SuperHeroes, WW2, Pirates, Mafia, Space, Wizards, Planes, Tanks...). This system allows you to make very unique and customized games following (or not) the public current expectations.-Office configuration: You create the rooms where your developpers will work, allowing more space and more workforce to key sectors (Research, Development, Support, Server Rooms, Marketing...) This system reminds very much of Theme Hospital and Prison Architect. -Characters levelling: Your developpers gain experience in different skills when making games or following courses on specific aspects. You can train a ""Sound and music effect"" expert team working specifically on music-based game for example, the possibilities are huge.-Ability to create your own game engines: Another gameplay approach is the engine development. Bad at game development? You can create games dedicated engines (customizable with a lot of functionnalities) and sell them to the competitors that will send you royalties when they make games with your engines. This alternate gameplay is one of the examples of the game's depth.Con's:-The current major issue to me is balance: For my first game in normal difficulty, without knowing anything of the gameplay mechanics, I ended up with 360M$ in about 20 years, leader on the market, releasing only major hits (90%+, 3 MMO's and 50 games overall) with my own high end game engines, with nothing to fear from the competitors (top 20 games were mines).-Lack of interaction between us and the competitors: we don't know much about them (stats, strength and weaknesses, no possibility to hire their developpers or see ours being recruted by them). I'd like to see major game companies leading the market with AAA titles like in real life, and struggling to get market shares on their lands. Currently this is simply not the case.-Not enough building and rooms objects ATM, and more than half of them are useless (why buying cheap desks when you can have the best for almost nothing). -Not enough control on the work force and the budget in general (you can't adjust the wages, no taxes, no charges...) I understand this would make the game a little more complicated but that's what economic simulations are for IMO.-Other balance issues: Marketing is basically useless (the publishers do a great job at it and releasing the games on your own (game possibility) is not financially very interesting (you earn millions even without it). Fan mechanics is not developped at all (what do they want? ATM they are only a Score System, sort of...). Some game consoles or computers are not interesting, their market share is too low (why not make unique specificities for them to give them more attractivness: A company focused on casual gaming and movment recognition could target the wii or kinect for example and become one of the leader for these consoles or on this game trend. Or aim at a niche market on another one which would be the best at one type of game.... just toughts. -Graphics and Music are poor at the moment, but that's not a major concern for me. -No tutorial (I put it here because I saw a lot of negatives comments about that, but that will change for sure).Overall this is a very good game but it seriously lacks balance at the moment. If the devs manage to balance all this and keep adding features to it, it will be one of the best economic simulator on the market.6/10 for the current state of the game, but It has the potential to reach 8/10 easily.

												I really hate to do this, but I'm changing my positive review of this game to a negative one.I first reviewed this game about a year before it left Early Access, and at the time the game was fun. But since then the game's mechanics have changed, to the point where every game I create usually loses money, or at best breaks even. Seriously, I make more money doing contract work and licensing engines than I do making games.The main problem here is that there are very few in-game cues to indicate to the player the correct settings for creating a successful game, and even these are vague. Add the fact that even if you use the perfect settings, your game might still fail depending on other variables such as the skills of your employees.For example, in my last (and probably final) game, after creating ten failed games in a row, I checked out one of the community guides to find the perfect settings for  an RPG (leaving any game to check out a guide or wiki, just to progress normally in the game, is something that no player should ever have to do). Looking forward to a quick influx of cash to save my company from bankruptcy, I was dismayed to find that my game received a review score of 42% (only marginally better than before) and ended up losing over $50k.Was it because of the skills of my employees? Was the failure of the game caused by something else? I have no way of knowing, and no way of finding out.I'm sure that there are people who have the mechanics of this game all figured out, and I'm sure that many of them are willing to pass along their knowledge in guides and in the forums. But to me, not being able to figure these things out by myself (within the game) simply is not fun. And if I'm having these kinds of problems, with a couple years' worth of experience with the game, I can only imagine how frustrating it would be to a brand-new player.This major, game-breaking problem (to me), is not likely to ever be fixed, as the game is finished and the dev has moved on.TIP: If you do decide to buy this game, and if you happen to be a Game Dev Tycoon player, don't expect your knowledge of that game to have any bearing whatsoever on this one. The mechanics of these two games are completely different.			"

								A fun game developing game in which you are not just making video games but are actually runing a full fledged game development studio.In that effect it's gameplay is more of the mix beetween games like hospital or rolecoaster tycoon and recent Game Development tycoon and Gamer's go.Micromanagment might seem a bit putting off in the begining but it will soon be barely noticable.You are also no longer weighted down by being able to develop only one game at the time. You can have multiple teams working on different projects.Aside from Micromanaging and some complaigns in regards to balancing and graphics looking like Sims, I have realy had not seen anyone bring up any other issues. And depending on how you feel about them, you might not even have problems with this things.Game is far enough in the Beta that it's playable without any major problems thought some might still occur based on how unlucky you might get. But dev's seem to be nice and are genually trying to fix what they can.Would I advise this game anyone looking for Game designer tycoon? Obviously yes, but do be prepared to be a bit more involved with your studio this time around.			"

												The game doesnt explain itself all that well. You need to google a lot of stuff. It makes you feel that you have to flowchart everything and i miss the intuitivity (that a word?) of Game Def. Tycoon in this game. The visuals are too much mod-like for a standalone game. Pathing is weird and building the office is not the crispest. (-> Doors have to be in certain places, some furniture has to be put in ccertain places, officespace is largely too small etc.) Gameplaywise there are 5/10s all around. Gameplay where you're like ""welp i CAN work with it but it doesnt feel great"". Tl:Dr -> Its a little more expansive but worse Game Def. Tycoon. This game makes me wish GDT would have the added ideas of this game			"

												Mad Game Toocon хорошая игра .Сравниая её с её главным конкурентом Game dev Toocon она получилась более широкой по контенту .В игре почти есть всё ,что было  Game dev toocon ,но всё же хочется отметить, что случайные события скучные ,хотелось поинтересние  и выпуск игр на других платформах(переиздания).При создание своего персонажа хочеться выбирать вид персонажа, а не только пол.  Что касается технической строны этого тварения ,хотелось видить игру на других платформах(Linux,Mac,WiiU),с учётом что движок Unity это позволяет.Больше моделей персонажей .Также хотелось бы поддержка модов, что разнообразило игру.При желании создателей сделайте необычный стиль игры ,а на данный момент игра смотрится блекло .  Игра получается хорошей .Рекомедую к покупке .Пока игра в в бето версии ,ставлю временную оценку 9,9/10. Mad Game Toocon good game. Comparing it to her principal competitor of Game dev Toocon it turned out wider according to content. In a game there is almost everything that there was Game dev toocon, but nevertheless there is a wish to mark that accidental events boring, there was a wish more interestingly and release of games on other platforms (republishing). In case of creation of the character there is a wish to select a type of the character, and not just a floor.As for the technical side of this creation, there was a wish to see a game on other platforms (Linux, Mac, WiiU) taking into account what Unity engine it allows. Large models of characters. Also it would be desirable support of spendthrifts that diversified a game. In case of desire of creators make unusual style of play, and at the moment a game looks blankly.Game turns out good. Rekomedy to purchase. So far a game in in a beta, I give a temporal mark 9,9/10  Mad Game Toocon das gute Spiel.Сравнивая sie mit ihrem Hauptkonkurrenten Game dev Toocon hat sie sich breiter nach контенту.В dem Spiel fast ergeben es gibt allen, was Game dev toocon war, aber doch will man bemerken, dass die zufälligen Ereignisse langweilig, интересние und die Ausgabe der Spiele auf anderen Bahnsteigen (der Neuausgabe).При die Bildung der handelnden Person хочеться wünschenswert war, die Art der handelnden Person, und nicht nur den Fußboden zu wählen.Betreffs technisch строны seiner тварения wünschenswert, wäre es видить das Spiel auf anderen Bahnsteigen (Linux, Mac, WiiU), mit der Berücksichtigung dass erlaubt es den Motor Unity. Es gibt als mehrere Modelle der handelnden Personen.Также es war die Unterstützung модов wünschenswert, was ins Spiel Abwechslung brachte. Auf Wunsch machen Sie die Schöpfer den ungewöhnlichen Stil des Spieles, und zur Zeit wird das Spiel fahl gesehen.Das Spiel wird gut.Рекомедую zum Kauf.Пока das Spiel in in бето die Versionen erhalten, ich stelle die vorübergehende Einschätzung 9,9/10			"

								Although I put a not recommended vote, ""Mad Games Tycoon"" is NOT a bad game.I wish there was a neutral judgement, because as it is, the game would deserve it.Unfortunately there are still too many issues, in this early game access, to vouch for this game.There are issues with UI :  interfaces that should be together are separated, especially when self-publishing games.Game creation, is, in fact, way too easy : making a ""Henry Patter"" licensed game as a Post-apocalyptic city builder? no problem!Craming 10 employees in 30 square meters garage ? no problem.Pros : the game is stable and doesn't lag at any stage.Sometime, less is more in game design. Game Dev Tycoon and Game Dev Story both do it better, yet.I will nonetheless continue to watch this game, and change my vote once I feel it has improved enough.			"

My computer can run games like Tomb Raider, Warframe and Game Dev Tycoon without crashing so i don't know why this is a problem.

								I've played Game Dev Tycoon before and found it very satisfying to play. I hoped that MGT would be even better, however it turned out quite ... bad. It's just a bad experience.The theme / genre combinations just don't matter as much as they do in GDT - and as they should. Too little of the review score depends on them. It appears that much more of the outcome (review score) is related to the stars you get from going for the same themes/genres/platforms and your workers' experience. It might seem logical but comparing to GDT ir ends up unpredictable, sometimes counter-intuitive and in the end unsatisfying. You might think you have all the aspects of the game set correctly, just to find out that you made a trash-game in the end.This way in the beginning - when you have no cash, no workers, and no experience - the game is really difficult and on High or Extreme difficulty - unbeatable. Later, after 15-20 years, when you have all that you want, it's just too easy - you produce succesful games no matter what.There is much more - many functions that seem to not have been thought through long enough but were added to the game anyway. Still it gave me some fun and I'll probably be back to it. But with all its flaws, to me it's just not good game even though it is very convincing otherwise.			"

												Copies its gameplay substantially from other ""game development sim"" games. Lacks a lot of ""why can't I just do that options"", e.g. you can delay a release but while it's delayed developers can't work on known bugs - you can only develop a patch to fix the bugs after you ship the game off to the publisher. Also, how the heck can I publish a patch so cheaply in 1980?? This is just one example - the interactions are not very carefully thought out.Edit: Some commenters have pointed out that known bugs can be fixed in the QA room. But that's not what QA does - QA discovers bugs, it doesn't fix them, nor is there any reason it should be impossible to fix bugs on an unreleased game without a dedicated QA staff. I consider it a vindication, not a refutation, of the above point about things not being thought out.			"

								Well, I really wish I could select something in between thumbs up and thumbs down here. I love management / business sim games and this one has some really good innovations. The developers did a good job trying to display all aspects of the gaming industry into this game, from the simple stand-alone game productions up to MMOs which you can host on your own servers.What breaks the game, is the balancing. The game is way too easy and is getting repetitive quite soon, despite all the different rooms and options. After you have survived the initial period you need to research the first available techs by doint contract work and developing crappy engines which you sell ridiculously overprized without a problem, you are done. Every following game will be a hit with 90% + ratings. It's hard to impossible to go broke then and the remaining 80% of game time is just doing the same over and over again. + a must for business sim fans + nice innovations and ideas in the game+ good presentation for a business sim- way too easy- gets boring quickly3/10			"

								I purchased this game because I read some reviews that said ""If you like games like Game Dev Story and Game Dev Tycoon, then you'll love this game. Its like them, but better!"" Go watch any Youtube video and you'll see, its basically a knock off of either one of those games with really clunky controls, and very vanilla scripted events. Your first handful of games will perform terribly, of course, and each one of these Game Dev simulators follows the exact same predictable storyline. Overall, theres nothing really new with this game, its definitely not worth $15 in its current state... it might be worth $3, but only when its on your phone and maybe when all of the bugs are worked out.TLDR: go watch a youtube video, then go play GameDevStory on your phone. You'll thank me later.			"

								I played about 2 hours and ""Refunded"".There's too few help or tip in game, so I can't find how commands work and how to improve ingame review rating.In this game, we should set some parameters (develop for Core-Gamer or Casual-Gamer etc.) properly.Even if this is Early Access game, the feedback for my choice is poor.Unlike Game Dev Tycoon, Generating Report feature is not usable at the early stage of game.Therefore it's so difficult to find suitable parameter by myself.However, all appropriate parameters are shown in Steam Guide. And it's not a hint but ""Correct Answer""  because they are constants by genre.In other words, start of learning curve is cliff , and very gentle afterwards (there is the elevator near the cliff).

								This is an early access game, but the issues listed below should have been taken care of pre-early-access-release.- Tool tips are missing in a majority of places,- English is quite obviously NOT the primary language of the developers,- Staff needs are not apparent until they become an issue,- Creating a game is not intuitive (beyond the most very basic game).These items need to be tweaked:- Staff pathing is horrific,- Not being able to hire a staffer until he gets a pop machine?  Dumb.,- Room sizes are a bit out of proportion (bathrooms must be built quite a bit bigger than a single stall would require),- Understanding WHAT all the sliders are, and why, when developing games is a head-scratcher,- When an item is locked for some reason it would be nice to know what you need to do to unlock it (more tool tips...)The game isn't totally broken, and I'm hoping in a few months it's actually more playable.  My bet is that the reviews listed in Steam are mostly the developers faking the game's reviews so people buy it.  Shame on them.			"

								Like most people looking to buy this game, I came in hoping for a version of Game Dev Tycoon with an expanded feature set. While that is true, this game is severely lacks polish. There seems to be little rhyme or reason as to why games succeed or do not. Though I did not play for long, a basic explanation of the mechanics would go a long way to increasing my enjoyment. When the core gameplay loop is resource management but the only source of information is trial & error, you have a problem.This game also sorely lacks professional localization. Sometimes translation errors are funny, but when your command of english is so bad that your tutorial only half-communicates the message it's time to bring in a native speaker of the language. The entire time I was playing I kept thinking, ""Just let me go through all this text and fix it, my god.""I know that this is a small project, but one tweet from the dev for crowd sourced english corrections would solve the problem.Lastly, the sound effects in this game seem to be intentionally annoying. There are numerous threads on the internet complaining about this. Sound assets do not cost much, and there are even free sound effect packages out there that would be much more pleasing.I did want to love this game, the way I love Game Dev Tycoon. Unfortunately, the developer seems to lack the experience or resources to grind away at the very, very rough edges. I have refunded this game.			"

								im being ""hard"" on the game by giving it a negative review because i like this game and want it to succeed.i wont say this game is a bad one. in fact i'll say the opposite i love this game and enjoy playing it for an hour every other day. it is a good game. it is also hard to play but not unfair, i stongly recomend getting a side office built just to complete the side projects you get periodically. these will keep you afloat in the early game and add a good boost to your income.buuuut i will say it is not done yet and with each update has gotten better then before. i can see this game going far.currently the game focuses around building games around a game engine that you can make or buy and packing the right features together as you work your way up to become an evil corporation and knock EA out of it's throne chop its head off and drink wine with its skull. then you will make the same rehashed game every year making some serious profit from each release until you become unbeatable! oh and at some point you produce your own games... that's cool too i guess.you can also decorate your office and custmize it the way you want and hire your own staff. though i can say i wish the various rooms interacted a bit more then they do currently.also i wish the game had better models over all as that would make the game look a bit more intresting to look at.another thing that would be nice would be when you click and drag someone elsewhere they would kick and struggle as though you litterally picked them up. really not important but i think it would add some humor to the game.if the game reviews were a bit better or if you had more control over what the game becomes would be cool too. such as writing the plot or creating your own custom features that make you stand out from the AI.so i give this game a rating of 7 out of 11 an average game but not easily forgetable. buy it when it is on sale for now, but keep it on your wish list for the future. the devs deserve the money.

While I'm quite content to bumble along and fail in my first few productions, Mad Games Tycoon aggravates even the early learning curve by giving me very little feedback on why something failed or what went wrong. My games just get terrible scores and the reviews shout ""worst game ever!"" and I don't understand why.			"

												Update: Many of the tedious tasks have either been temporarily removed or possible to automate now. Achievements don't entirely seem to be working. I can now see potential in the game as it isn't so obfuscated by somewhat broken and unbalanced mechanics. Real challenge now exists at higher difficulties. I still can't say I recommend it as it currently is, but you might find it a worthy investment.  Older:This game is early access, but even I can't recommend it... and I'm really sorry about that. I don't see much potential. There is very little depth to the building your office. In some way it adds some more expanse to the game, with the ability to make multiple games, but managements quickly becomes unruly, especially when working with the graphics studio, sound studio, and etc. If you develop your own engine, then your game will often be interupted by other studios releasing crap. Icons also sometimes additionally get in the way of what you want to work at. The game doesn't give the player much feedback and so it is difficult to judge how to improve things. Actions seem to have no consequence whatsover. There is absolutely no challenge to this game. It doesn't take long to simply run out of things to do.			"

Early Access Review
								This may be early access material, but it feels like very early access. More troubling is the fact that the developer suffers from a complete lack of focus on so many areas of the game (as others have mentioned).Here's an example:I get that toilets is a part of every day life, but when your little worker ants go potty as the game speeds forward at a pace where weeks are seconds, I see no reason why I should be treated to the view said ants taking a 15 second potty break, and then don't even wash their hands. That's right. After 15 weeks spent on a potty break (don't ask me what they ate), don't even wash their hands. Filthy animals!I'm not saying I want the developer to add a new animation just to show me that my employees are wasting another couple of weeks washing their hands, I'm saying we're getting distracted by this whole potty nonsense to begin with! Just like the developer! There's no reason to even show such behavior at all, unless we're moving at a real time pace, in which case, those filty animals better wash up! A simple complaint notification about there not being a proper bathroom with a toilet and sink would be more than enough.In Game Dev Tycoon, the employees need vacations now and again. That's fine. Perfect, in fact... because this isn't a real time kinda game. Focus on the big stuff, and not the potty. Please.Another example of the developer wasting time:There's no need for 3D models just to make a thumbnail representation of each individual worker ant. The 3D models currently in use are so badly made, I can't even tell race or gender most the time. I was playing the game, and it suddenly struck me that I only looked at the stats when hiring people. Go figure! My brain told me to hire the most skilled worker ants over the rest. I forgot all about being ""politically correct"" and trying to ""diversify"" my staff, so I decided - because I'm a perfectionist (and an idiot) - that I would make an effort to make sure my staff was in fact diverse.That's where I ran into said problem, not being able to tell the one from the other. But it doesn't really matter. This isn't real life and I don't live in a country that's run amok with politically correctness. It's not even a feature in the game. I'm honstly just wasting your time with this rant, just like the developer is wasting their time making 3D models that suck, instead of making simple 2D graphics and focus their efforts on what this game is really about! Managing a game company! You'd think a game company would grasp this inescapable revelation.The ""tutorial guy"" that pops up and tells you what to do talks too much, and doesn't really help that much. I was better off just clicking around and figuring things out on my own. There's no mention of how big a room should be in comparison to other rooms, or how many desks you would need to get a balanced workload.In the smaller buildings, you'll want to maximize on what little space there is, but you can't create wall to wall rooms in certain scenarios because you're only allowed to have one door! That means you have to waste space on hallways, which really feel like undeveloped, empty space.The gamebreaking fault with this game:I spend hours and hours in my very first garage, slowly figuring out what was important and what wasn't. I ended up with a simple one desk office, a one desk research pit of despair, a bathroom which I'm having some kind of problem with (apparently), and I think that was about it. From these humble beginnings went from struggling to survive, to making millions of dollars! Then I bought a gigantic office space, spent half the day drawing up rooms and adding props. A few hours later I had 1500 Mill $ in the bank, a thriving MMO and the ability to produce and store millions of copies of my own games. That is to say: I was done. No new consoles coming out anymore. Nothing more to aspire to. Game Over!It's like the game doesn't have proper stages for advancement. At one point, my worker ants were making a AA game. I clearly didn't have the staff for it, because it took about 20 years to finish, and every year I'd show up with a booth at the convention just to pick up more fans along the way. The fans stayed true and loyal for 20 years as I was promising to deliver. That aspect is something Game Dev Tycoon did really well. If you didn't publish within a certain timeframe after marketing your game, you'd lose fans so fast it looked like a snowball rolling downhill, heading straight for your office.If I had to do it all again, I'm pretty sure I could reach the same level of success in half a day, and that's not a game worth money to me. There's not much replayability here. I know, because I don't want to go through this circus again. Besides, games like this are only really fun before you graduate to the big leagues, at which point it becomes a managing nightmare. This is why in real life we delegate! I don't want to have to tell that guy to do these same six things with every game I make! He should learn to do this automatically, because that's what I'd tell him to do if this was real life! I'm the boss! I don't wanna deal with all the little things. I have minions for that! I just wanna make the big decisions! There's management, and then there's micro-management.When all is said and done, this game goes a smidge deeper than Game Dev Tycoon, but there are simply too many faults, missing pieces and lack of focus for me to think that Mad Games Tycoon will ever match the geniusly simplistic, polished marvel that is Game Dev Tycoon. Scrap this one. Start over. As for my recommendation: Don't buy! I want my money back, and this tragic game off my games list. "

								This game definitely has potential. I like the idea of a tycoon game where you can make your own video games and such. However, I am having a hard time adapting to the game. It's best you start on EASY so you can get used to the game and understand how it works. It doesn't seem to have a tutorial. So you're stuck with trying to figure out most of it on your own.  If you go with easy, it won't be as harsh. You start off on NORMAL, then you mind as well consider yourself bankrupt. So basically, I think this game would be a good game if it had some sort of tutorial. Since you're stuck with figuring out what makes a game good, you can't fully enjoy the contents this game has to offer.			"

Early Access Review
								I've only played this game around an hour but that's long enough I reckon to give me the feeling that I don't care for it overly much. I'm not saying it's bad, but I couldn't get straight into it like I did Game Dev Tycoon, which I think is better. There's just something about it - it seems to be missing something, soul, atmosphere, appropriate sound effects and game feedback. I don't feel immersed and I don't care about my character. Everything happens so damn fast, too.There are other issues, like lack of a tutorial or help, so you have to figure it out for yourself. Personally I also find many of the sound effects annoying (and the music) so I turn them down (many sound like something out of the early 90s). I don't much care for the UI either - too much clicking and mousing around for buttons. Another thing that annoys me is that my character is always followed/surrounded by icons and other info graphics, especially when he is at the desk working. It seems cluttered and looks ugly.On the plus side, the graphics are otherwise generally nice and the devs seems to have put quite a lot of thought into the game dev world elements (but it doesn't work as well as Game Dev Tycoon). And to their credit the devs seem to be very active in developing and updating the game.But I just can't get excited about it, it leaves me cold, and somewhat irritated. If they halved the price, I might say it was worth a buy, but at present, I regret my purchase decision.			"

								30 hours in, early access review.Thumbs down because it's in Early Access, it needs a lot of balancing, and some of the current implementation seems baked in that I don't like. However...The game gives good process, in a Civilization-like manner. You have a couple desks, you release a game, make money, buy more desks, add more rooms, sell more copies, buy a bigger place etc etc etc. This part is very addictive since there really is a ton of stuff (9 different desks, 20-some different rooms, 100+ game subjects etc) to build and set up. However...Balance: Easy is a walk in the park, while Normal suddenly becomes practically impossible to make money, unless you just concentrate on making game engines and doing contract work. I can't imagine this being what the develoers had in mind. You can release a game that gets good reviews, and release a game with the same staff and setup 6 months later and get Worst Game Of The Year award.Design decisions: You start in a garage with not much space, but enough for a small dev space, research center, toilet, and perhaps a marketing office. All this needs to be outfitted a la The Sims. Desks over there, plants over here, lighting, heating, ceiling fans, first aid kid, and on and on. Quite fun in fact. But then you make enough money to move to a bigger place. The game sells all your stuff and plops you down in an empty room where you have to do the whole thing over again. This is less fun. And there are TWELVE different building sizes, and each time you have to put the rooms, desks, plants, lights... This appears baked into the design. It would be so much better to add onto existing space, so you could have fun designing the more exotic rooms you didn't have access to before, because you didn't have the space.There are other balance issues, like getting access to console research when you barely have enough money to buy toilet paper, the bank's suicidal-like willingness to continue to loan you ever increasing amounts of money, despite never having made a successful game (Normal difficulty), but this is EA, so we'll see.Steam forums are dead, but perhaps discussion of this game takes place on another forum.Which raises the question: How do you make a 'deep' game with this subject matter? As a gamer, you have foreknowledge of the history of games. Adventure games were really big for a while, but now they're not. The Dreamcast flopped. The PS is gonna be big. If you know all that, the game should be easy. If you don't know that (or set the game to random trends) then the winning and losing will appear arbitrary.I'll be back for 1.0.			"

								This game is ok, but never reached the quality of old games like mad tv. It was ok to play it once, see the evolve of different technologies - but that it. No difficult simulation, no real challenges. Feels a little bit too casual for me. And there is nothing mad about it - its not really funny or entertaining, its just a sim about game industry.Nevertheless, it was a bit fun to play once (there is no reason to play it a 2nd time) - so here my suggestion: Buy it on steamsale for 5 euro/dollar so you dont be angry later, that you bought it.

								I have played both Mad Games Tyccon and Game Dev Tycoon.. both are pretty similar. I first played Game Dev Tycoon and loved it, so then I got Mad Games Tycoon.... here are some irritating gameplay aspects.... poor controls. You have to arrow key around the map of your building, no mouse control watsoever. No tutorial. Nonexistent. Poor design on how to build various rooms. Poor gameplay in general.... you work to level up your employees, go to the develop a game and still are only limited by 100% with four  slider bars broken down into four categories, gameplay technology sound and controls. You try to balance them all max is 25% for each category, You would think you would be able to allocate more points towards a specific category once your staff levels up, but no, the best you can do is 40 points and sacrifice something in one of the other categories.  You try your best to get a good score on a game , spend lots of money researching , leveling staff and it really doesnt seem to pay off since this game seems to consistently give out bad reviews, much like game dev tycoon, where they'll tell u suck, but not really the reasons why. ... I was interested in this game because it looked alot like sims of the past, like sim theme hospital... but alas, it is not.... i really wish someone would make a fun sim on here.			"

								I have one comprehensive criticism with this game. I don't think this will change, at all, although it's just in pre-alpha. And, that is, that they have this pop-up boxes PLUS they animate the entire screen once the pop up boxes are clicked off.Why is this a problem? It is an epilepsy hazzard. Even though, I don't think I have it, I am very sensitive to screens flashing all over the place.For instance, WoW had an animation whereupon if you were in a vehicle and you were taking damage, they made a red vignette flash around the screen. When I contacted Blizzard about it, they had already provided to completely remove it.I understand that the pop-ups are there to create interest in the game, but literally, they could provide a side icon that is permanent, that could light up when whatever state is ready, lights it up.I notice that if something small is on the screen, permanently there, and if it simply lights up, it doesn't cause so much eye stress.Secondly, losing control of the game is terribly annoying to me. And, this is the 2nd complaint about these pop-ups.Let's think about this for a second. If I am the executive director of a company, no one is going to send me a pop-up to tell me they are done with their poster marketing campaign. In fact, I find it highly juvenile that you don't have a queue of tasks for all departments.Also, you have no feedback, nor projections of what tasks are hoped to accomplish by their monetary expenditure.You've flushed out the other Game Tycoon games, but have left out the key components of why the successsful tycoons were so successful, feedback.You can't have a game with the detail of self production and self publication and leave out any feedback of what you're going to get from spending any money or contracts, or campaigns.

								I can't really recommend a game that's unplayable. How is it unplayable? Well, the game's purpose is the simulate a game development studio. The main mechanic of the game is the allotment of resources to the different aspects of a game. Should you focus more on game depth or beginner friendliness? What percentage of the budget should you devote to graphics vs. sound? etc. Apparently, the game favors particular combinations of the sliders which represent these values. Thus, to create a successful game, you need to randomly guess what would make a game of that genre and of that topic successful. Good luck with that, as after an hour of trial and error I have yet to come up with anything. There isn't even a good wiki or forum to reference (although I am a big believer that a game should never require you to utilize outside resources in order for you to play it). I honestly don't know how there are any positive reviews, as I don't know how anyone could figure out how to do well in this game. Of course, I could be completely wrong about all of this, as there is no tutorial yet. So for all I know, I may have completely misinterpreted everything. I might try this game again after I watch some Let's Plays and they release a tutorial.			"

												I do not legitimately review games on steam very oftenI also do not try to say that another game was trying desperately and failing to be another game, I'm not that black and white about games.But boy, I only had 30 minutes with this game and requested a refund asap because gOD THIS GAME!Since I'm a lazy frick tho, I'm gonna just post the notes I wrote down while playing and then expand on themlets begin*I expected a GDT wannabe*Read good reviewsI saw this game and the first thing I thought was ""why would I buy this if I already have Game Dev Tycoon"" BUT saw so many people say ""but it's better than GDT tho"" and said ""aww what the heck"" and wanted to try it out*I'm not impressed yet*THIS GAME LOOKS UGLY!*AAAAAAAAAAAAOkay, listen here, I'm not that dweeb that judges a game by how it looks, I could name so many games I like that don't look that good. However, the freaking MAIN MENU just looked SO gross. Not only that but I looked through the logos for a company and found issue with this too.You see, the custom logos are full of parody companies, which are chuckle worthy, but if you want a custom name it generally wouldn't match up with the logo. Now, some people could ignore this, it's small I understand, but for someone like me that would...NOT want a mismatched name and logo (I'm weird okay?) I have to go with the generic logos. Which would be fine (again I know my issue can be considered a personal problem) but the generic logos look...dumb, like they put so little effort into them because they were just SO PROUD of they're funny parody logos (The EA parody logo isn't even a parody...it's just a blunt EA).On top of all this, when I finally pick a logo and a name, it shows me the portrait of our player characterit literally looks like some garbage I'd see in a low budget game from the early 2000s......or a no budget game indie game with 0 effort or soul behind itI just got annoyed looking at everything.*Starts new game*The graphics look even grosser when you start playingRefer back to what I said about how the game looks like low/no budget garbage and double itI hate it.Now before someone brings it up, I wanna go back to Game Dev Tycoon, the game I can't help but say this game is trying to beI like Game Dev Tycoon's graphics because it has a style, it's cartoony and even tho it's not amazing, it works for what it is. Mad Game Tycoon's graphics look like a game with an identity crisisand a brain tumor...*This perspective bugs meIdk how to explain this, I genuinely don't, but the camera angle just...pisses me off to look at, feel free to ignore this point if you want to, but mixed with the ugly visuals the camera just makes me angry.*I'm so boredThis kinda speaks for itself*Try to make first game*Um*Did I mess it up?*I had to restart the game cuz it glitchedThis is when the game 100% lost me, the game was teaching me how to play, I placed down desks in my office and the game told me to start development on a game. I grabbed my guy, dragged him over to the leftand...he got stuck, I don't exactly know what happened but he just kinda got stuck. I didn't know what to do so I just started clicking things, I clicked the desks and they...disappeared, like entirely, they were removed for no reason and guess what?My guy was still frozen.So I basically had to restart the entire game because the gamestoppedworking.Like...was this just me? I wasn't trying at all to break it and it just...broke.*Try to make game again*Religion!?*Idk if the tutorial stopped becuz my game glitched but I have no idea what the heck any of this meansI was going through the menus and stuff and I saw what it was trying to do, it was the same concept of GDT's game development menu, with just a little more added in. Thing is, I didn't get to figure out what half of it meant, because the game broke and when I restarted the tutorial just didn't turn oneven tho I did not disable the tutorial before starting up the second game.A lot of the options on the second page were just labeled ""My Games:"", didn't know what they meant, never found out cuz I stopped caring before I found out, whatever.*I um...started development but...nothings happening*My guy's just walking around*OH! OK! I HAD TO DRAG MY EMPLOYEE TO HIS DESK!Nothing conveyed this to me...Nothing...Unless the tutorial said to do this but...FRICK man I wouldn't have been able to know...*H O W  I S  TH I S   BE  T  T E R  T  H A N   G A ME   D E V   T Y  C OOON!?*GDT worked becuz it was simple and straight to the pointThis game, from what I saw (including the reviews too), obviously wanted to have a hand over Game Dev Tycoon by adding more stuff, but I think this actually huurrrrttt the game more. Going back to my previous problem, I genuinely think the idea of having to drag the employee to the desk to make him to work, while not being a big problem, is just an inconvenience that I don't see the point in. Game Dev Tycoon was straight to the point with every thing, it was simple and because of that I didn't have to think as much about all the little things, which made it FUN TO PLAY! Now I'm not gonna say that adding more ruined it, it's just how it was done, I didn't care for any of what they tried to addit was just all...meh.*I'm still boredSee I had this idea for a big point I had against the game to put here, but I actually forgot it once I got to this part of my notes.So...oh well!*Everything moves so slow*Idk why the sales thingy is moving so slow and nothing is being conveyed to me, I can't even see the ratings*Everything keeps moving and releasing before I even have time to reactWhen I released my game, I saw the sales thing pop up, but um...it just kinda moved really slowly...it didn't even give me the number rating for my game, one of the things that made Game Dev Tycoon fun to me. On top of this it kept saying consoles and games were being released before I even had the chance to figure out what was going onmix this with the other frustrations I had with this game and all I was left wonder was...*What is this game and why did I waste 14 bucks on this?This is the last time I trust steam reviews, even if they are considered ""Most helpful"", it tries so hard to be Game Dev Tycoon but is too busy with it's♥♥♥♥♥♥in a blender to actually be worth the money. Want my advice? Stay with Game Dev Tycoon and save your money for something more worth it.			"

												I had high hopes for this game, but ended up getting really dissapointed.To make a good game you need to know what topics work well with the gentre and what age rating it should have. Then you need to know PRECISELY how much points you should put on two different kinds of sliders, because if you are too far away from the amounts the devs intended you to put for that specific kind of game, the reviewers are going to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it. And the worst part  is that you can't really find out what went wrong, the game just tells you what direction you should go on one kind of sliders and THAT'S IT. It's just like ""yeah you should go to the right side with this one"" but you don't know if you need to go ALL THE WAY to the right or just a little bit.The good thing about Game Dev Tycoon is that you could learn how to make a good game just by playing and analysing your games to find out how to make a game that sells well.But there when you start you are expected to figure out the perfect way to make a game all by yourself. but before you actually do that you will go bankrupt!Seriously, the only real way to play this game is by having a guide that tells you what you need to do to make a good game because the game doesn't give you any hint about it and straight up mocks you if you mess up!It tried to be a more ""serious"" tycoon game than Game Dev Tycoon, but it was nothing but frustration for me.Wish I could just get a refund, but I wasted too much time trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong.To quote one of the reviews in this game:""Stay away.""

								The game is definitely early access. If you are looking for a similar game to Game Dev Tycoon, you will find it here but it is not built as well.To start, the game, while offering more options then GDT, does not have the same feeling of ""doneness"" as GDT does. Again, this is Early Access, so that is a given. However, even being Early Access, one can say this feels more like an alpha then anything else. The game lacks a tutorial, has bad spelling (I assume the developers are German) and over all, the design is somewhat low-budget. I would recommend waiting out the game to start. Watch it from afar to see if the developers are able to piece the game together. If they do, then this will be a game worth talking about.			"

												I have no idea how someone can love this game.You have way to much money, you can nothing about improve you game and you can not remove the bugs from your game in a QA phase.Would never buy it again.			"

												This game really lacks a tutorial. It give you the basics, but after that you have to figure alot out for yourself. In turn wasting money and time. It throws you in the deep end and says ""swim or die"" basically as you try to figure out some of the more complex game mechanics and why your graphics studio can't do anything. Also any games I seem to develop are a flop. It didn't matter what categorey or genre I picked I never seemed to make back what I spend producing the game. If you're looking for a fun game development tycoon, go for Game Dev Tycoon, it's much more user friendly.			"

								I am a lover of all tycoon games, and have played hundreds of hours of GDS and GDT but..... this game just does not live up to them at the moment. Of course it is early access, but there are just countless bugs, the game reviews and creation systems seem flawed.  I cannot find anything, besides the building your own studio part, to be any fun.			"

												I have more than 100 games on steam and its the fiirst time I applied for a refund. There is a good game called Game Dev Tycoon that I love. I belived this game will take the best from it and add some features to make gameplay even deeper and more interesting. However this is not the case. There are a lot of useless features, like furniture, toilets and so on. Why are they in game? Its not a office design simulator! There are a lot of wierd statistics in stats menu wich is mostly completely useless. It feels like developers didnt put any affort into the game. They were like ""hey, lets copy this game and add some random stuff. Graphics? Lets take prerendered low quality cheap stuff from different dev kits and throw it in our product."" Why there are so many upvotes for this game? There is nothing to pay for. I feel I've been cheated and I want a refund.			"

								This game is full of bugs and I played it for 10 minutes clicked on everything and could not even make 1 game, no tutorial.Tried this game again May 29th/16 hoping all the updates have made it better. Game has a small tutorial now, but it only guides you through one game and does not tell you what the majority of the options still do. Still no good, the devs are trying but it is to complex, and you run out of money way to fast. Still a thumbs down for me!			"

												To start off, I enjoy this quite a bit.  It's surprising how easily you can get sucked in. That said, there is one problem. The tutorial/help dialog is so small you can't really read it. Also, to switch to Full Screen you have to enable this in the options menu then restart the game. Unfortunately when you shut down the game all options return to the default setting, including resetting it back to windowed mode. The stratagy elements though are where it shines in my opinion. Do you focus on making and improving game engines which you license out, or purchese the right to use game engines from other companies? Do you specialize in making games, or focus on hardware. Do you create your own properties, or hire your studio out to make games for others? Do you keep your staff small, or expand to create multiple games/consoles at once?These decisions can make an impact. And I enjoy figuring out the best way to advance.			"

								I have seen alot of games in my life, from Rollercoaster Tycoon to Call of Duty and Fifa to The Sims. I can enjoy all sorts of games, so i am open for new things, and this one got me hooked for now xD so why not give my opinion on what seems to be a promesing game.Brings back memories, when i start playing and find myself still playing 4-5 hrs later.For me its the best 15€ i spend this year (i know, 2015 just started, but worth mentioning imo) and to be honest, i didnt expected that! It looked like an ok game to me, but its way better then i imagined.If you like tycoon games, are willing to put some hours into the game to get to learn it, and are a game-fan just like me, i would not hesitate and spend those 15€ on this game.Remember its early acces, it needs more fine-tuning, but no game-breaking problems encountered yet! (Seen ohter Early-Acces games doing much MUCH worse!)Developer is active on Steam forum, listening to their customers, something i can only praise!Game gets regular updates, adding content, so they are working on it! (i was very pleased to see an even larger company building after a certain update this week, no such thing as to much space :)All those who complaign its the same as game dev tycoon: 1) du-uh, they are both game dev tycoon games, and from what i hear (dont have game dev) there are plenty of differences....2)The more choices we have, the better! Healty competition is good for us, cusomers :)I really recommend this game to every game-fan!Thanks Eggcode for making this game, and keep up the good work and im sure this will become (already is) a game that will steal alot of free time hours!+Gameplay I like the Sims Style - build and decorate - ur company (More objects are always welcome)+Graphics are not SUPER but deff ok+Start small - Grow big+Deff worth its money-Sounds are getting enoying very quickly :/-Some important things should be added later (maybe u guys are already working on this)*A pause / speed up button. (while still being able to give commands PLZ :) )*Being able to adjust room sizes by dragging the walls? its a pain to have to sell the whole room and everything in it (and loosing alot of money in the process) because it should be 1 square larger to fit in what u want to fit in*Pauze development / research / ....*Simple tutorial!Learhing curves can be steep at the beginning! so why not start a tutorial in the smallest garage building, where u show ppl how to get set up right?...*More in-depth info on all sorts of stuff*More ways to spend ur money mid-late game*Why can other developers build their consoles, and not us? *More content, more objects, more more more xD "

												The developers continue to improve this fun business simulation of the electronic gaming industry by adding new gameplay features, enhancing graphics, and polishing the business model. Of course, these are all things you can do, too, after you release your own game in the game! You can play as a developer who focuses on creating games and then signing contracts with publishers to sell your games. Once you’ve saved or borrowed enough money, you can play as a publisher who manufactures and distributes games from other companies. You could also go the route of investing in technology to develop and market your own living room consoles and handheld systems, too.

If you enjoy economic sims and Game Dev story clones, you'll enjoy this game. It's very fleshed out and a lot of content.It seems to run well when I have a very large end-game company with a few hundred employees. Many other smaller games somehow don't manage to pull this off.However, I do have a few suggestions to improve this game which I will add to a post in the community.			"

They need to figure out like other publishers, how not to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the players. I don't know when this game will be finished but I keep going back to see if it is.  It is still hard to play a few hours, walk away, and come back later to find a small patch has vaporized your efforts. Nearly two years on they claim it's finished. It isn't.  A new game is a few days away from Greenheart games, the makers of Game Dev T^ycoon. Spend your money on that instead.			"

												Of all the games in my library that I keep coming back to, Mad Games Tycoon is one of the most enjoyable to replay. These sessions don't last too long but a game like MGT is best served, IMO, in a 5 hour stint on a lazy weekend, greatly enjoying the gameplay, reaching a level of completion that releases the desired amount of dopamine and then not touched for a few months so you forget the mechanics and have a pile of updates to come back to.With the constant updates, coming back to the game is just as enjoyable as the first time around. One build had an absolutely unplayable and quite frankly dangerous for my PC god tier memory leak, but that was fixed in a timely manner.If you're actively reading reviews for this game, chances are you'll enjoy it. I have absolutely gotten my money's worth out of it and it's likely you will as well.Mad Game Tycoon delivers the experience I paid for.			"

I don't feel the game is over-priced at all, as the effort involved in making it is clearly obvious.Well done.			"

												I am conflicted about this game on one hand It is fun but on the other there are alot of issues I have with the game. I am too lazy to write them all down so I'll sum it up as the game has a lot on the surface that you can do but they're all hollow on the inside. after 3 and a half hours (which is enough time to get a billion dollars) you just feel how much is still missing from the game. I still recommend the game though because it scratches that tycoon itch. A real plus is the developers are constantly updating the game so new content does come out. Its just not enough at the moment.			"

												Got this on a sale. It provided a lot of enjoyment for what it is, and it gave me a good days worth of entertainment, which is all I can ask for for its price point. If you enjoy economic sims and Game Dev story clones, you'll enjoy this game. It's very fleshed out and a lot of content.It seems to run well when I have a very large end-game company with a few hundred employees. Many other smaller games somehow don't manage to pull this off.However, I do have a few suggestions to improve this game which I will add to a post in the community.			"

												It's a good game BUT the Devs are so concerned with making players happy they crank out updats almost daily which DESTROY YOUR SAVE GAMES and all of your effort. They need to figure out like other publishers, how not to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the players. I don't know when this game will be finished but I keep going back to see if it is.  It is still hard to play a few hours, walk away, and come back later to find a small patch has vaporized your efforts. Nearly two years on they claim it's finished. It isn't.  A new game is a few days away from Greenheart games, the makers of Game Dev T^ycoon. Spend your money on that instead.			"

												This one is truly awesome.Every gamer should play this at least once.It can give you the insight of how the gaming industry works.Updating, making sequels, choosing what genre to specialize in, estimating how many products I should make, determining which part to sacrifice while developing every genre, etc.After this, every time I get news about newly publised games, I can understand unseen decision makings done by the gamemakers during development.

												This game is very  similar to Game Dev Tycoon, but SO MUCH better! Game dev tycoon tries to follow the real trends of the industry from the 80s till present and the game then ends. Mad games tycoon keeps on going. There is a lot more option and ways to make great games and mint money. I have played this for hours and hours... having said that... the game is abit rought around the edges, the UI and menus is not polisted or intuitive, it feels more like a game made in the 1990s like Transport Tycoon. the staaf sorting system and how to deploy people leaves a lot to be desired. But I wholly recommend this game, it is a lot of fun to make a MMO game, then make addons and then make it Free to Play and see the moolah roll in!			"

												I had so many hopes for this games but no matters how many hours and effort I put into liking this game, I still cannot: it's boring and frustrating. The boring part comes from all the calculations you have to do to get the sliders balanced right and that are supposed to add realism to the game reminds me of a math class at school. The frustration part comes all from the reviews of the games you produce: no matter which topics/audience/genre you choose, or how you set the sliders or the percentage, the reviews tell you always the same (which is: graphics are the best, sound is ok, gameplay and controls are below average).. there is no clue about what went wrong and after so many hours thrown away on this game I'm starting thinking that: 1) either the game is broken 2) or there is no mechanics involved at all, it randomly choose a review to display. The only way I found this game enjoyable is not producing any game at all and focusing on contracts, that's the only thing that seems to work.. unluckly, there aren't contracts enough to keep a large staff so you're stuck with a small bunch of employers for the rest of the game, which is not that bad at start but after a while it becomes boring..A quick advice? Don't buy this game, it's not worth it.  "

												Early access done right and great game, if you like management games then this is for you, of all the ""game tycoon"" games this is the most complete and one of the best in the genre.The only thing this game misses? The possibility to create a platform like steam to sell digital games.For the rest you have pretty much everything: you can create your console, your mmo, your f2p, you can publish games for others if you don't want to develop anymore, you can buy other companies, print your own physical copies and decide what to put in the box, make bundles, the list can keep going for a long while but one thing is sure: it's one of the most complete business management games EVER made.Don't mistake this game for a bland pc version of game dev story, it's not quite complex as Capitalism but it's much more closer to it than it is to game dev story.

												Get this if you liked Game Dev Tycoon but want something deeper and more varied. I'll warn you that it's also quite a bit harder, and it takes some time to learn how it works. Once you do, though, you'll get into a groove where you can have a lot of fun.			"

												I really like this a lot! Game Dev Tycoon was what got me into playing games like these, but this game on the other hand makes GDT look shallow (not that it was bad for Ireally enjoy GDT). There's a whole lot you do in this game, from producing copies of games, to improving various aspects of games such as music, graphics, and game design. It's a more complex kind of tycoon game that gives you a lot to do so if you enjoy some complexity, this is the game you should play!			"

												Mad Games Tycoon is one of the few indie games that is actually good and has one of the few indie developers who used Early Access for it's proper intention, instead of trying to run off with the money after selling an unfinished product.The developer listened to a lot of feedback and suggestions on the forum and put them in the game and created a fun tycoon game that is both addicting and fun.Fully recommended buy.

												Another game that I can't recommend even through I played allot of it. But if I was not into development it would be boring and since I am it is kinda boring. You never design anything, you just have to do the perfect even I just like to do some werid stuff which is fun. And also sometimes it doesn't make sense.Sometimes you seem to get good scores and sometimes bad, and once you got under 40% you get the worst game of the year award, like there are no games of like 20% score. I mean for higher dificulty I see it but for easy? I mean you loose more fans than you would gain for any other award. I mean the award thing is just a gameplay device since noone really cares about awards. Are there even real game awards who knows? I would even just put an Oscar into the trash can because it means nothing, totaly worthlose piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Also I put in that the platform popularity should be random and it was like ever. Also how can PCs from the beginning on play AAA titles and why are there so many players on this platforms? If you think about it for a main part of the 80s it was only business people and school. So you don't get as many player as like with the Atari or NES. If you make popular games for console it doesn't change a thing of the popularity. Also if you get enoug money to make a console and selfproduce games than you make way to much money.But yeah this game is just boring. Game Dev Tycoon was boring and this is boring and the Game Tycoon of android was kinda fun. Because it was silly and you could play it on the go. It was a good idea for those concepts and from what I can tell the game never really changed so get the android game it is not wasting your time.			"
