This is a long review so if you want just a brief summary of why I recommend Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior skip to Results and read from there.RuneStorm brings to life all of our dreams by finally making a title where you get to see what happens after you play a game. After playing Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior you’ll learn that maybe you should reconsider before you go out of your way to break everything in a room.Story:Lo Wang got in a devastating battle at a temple nearby destroying everything in sight. You are hired as a janitor to clean up a terrible mess. Bodies are everywhere, art is destroyed, and you’re the only man for the job. Campaign:There is one level; it’s the same as the first level in the new Shadow Warrior game. It’s your job to clean it up with a mop and your hands. You must deposit the debris into various incinerators, mop up blood, and grab all the cash you can find. The campaign only has two achievements, clean up everything and grab all the money. If you can do this you’ve proven that “you’re the best around and nothing’s ever gonna to keep you down.”Gameplay:This game plays similar to an FPS. The camera is always in first person and your two weapons are a mop and your hands. You must pick up garbage with your hands and throw it into incinerators while mopping up gallons of blood. You better keep your mop clean, but beware for some odd reason the machines that provide water can shoot out an organ. Similar to a normal janitor after you are done you must clock out.Results:If you have always wondered what happens after a game, wonder what life as a janitor for crime scenes would be like, or even just want to play a game that doesn’t push your wits then Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is for you. This brilliant game is hilarious to play if you just beat the first level of Shadow Warrior. For some odd reason the character sounds exactly like Lo Wang, which makes me wonder if after he saved the universe he decided to give up fighting and clean up his messes. Pros:+You get to experience Shadow Warrior through a whole new light.+You get to clean up bodies, mop up blood, and steal money… how many games offer that?+Good graphics+Easy gameplay, with simple controls.+Funny dialogue+Two straightforward achievements+Its free if you already own Shadow Warrior (2013)+YOU GET TO BE A JANITORCons:-Cleaning up everything achievement can be really annoying as a single bullet shell could be the culprit.-There is only one level (why can’t we clean more)			"

												Just got hired as a janitor. Doesn't sound like the most appealing job, but i heard this one pays big. After all i need the money. DAY 1:  -- First day on the job. Iv'e got my mop, radar, and rubber gloves. Ready to take on this bloody mess of a temple. Here we go!DAY 5: -- So I have swabbed and muscled my way through the first room. Iv'e encountered various body parts, and an aray of shurikens. Iv'e still got another room ahead of me though, wish me luck.DAY 15: -- Finnaly Iv'e sanitized and purged the final room of the temple. This took way longer than i thought. Time to clock out, and go home. Can't wait to see my wife and beautiful children, god i miss them...DAY 16: -- So after attempting to clock off and leave, I have been notified that there is still a mess somewhere. Ther're not letting me leave. Not until I clean every bit of this temple. I have to finish what I started.DAY 32: -- Wow, its been a long time, I'm getting very hungry, my supply is starting to run out. But i found a bullet shell in the corner on the room. Hopefully thats my exit ticket. Hopefully I can finally get out of here.DAY 58: -- Turns out theres more to be cleaned. I havent seen my family in so long. I wonder if they think im dead. Nontheless I still need to clean.DAY 94: -- I..I don't know..I don't know where it is. Iv'e searched every nook and crany in this entire temple. I just can't find it. I've ran out of my food supply, I'm beginning to shake. I need to get out. I need to leave. I need to clean.DAY 149: -- Please if you are reading this send help, I swear on my life I've searched this place...Iv'e searched everywhere please save me.DAY 200: -- I give up, Iv'e lost it. I'm now mopping even places there could never be blood or dirt. I'm mopping the ceiling, or maybe it's on this hanging lamp...nope..maybe it's in this plant...nope..maybe it's on the very top of this pillar, there's no way anything could be up he...NO...NO ♥♥♥♥ING WAY...NO MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING WAY.... I FOUND IT...IT'S HERE...ITS ALL OVER...I DID IT....I CAN LEAVE....*Sorry, the temple is still filthy, you don't want to leave this mess behind you, do you.*			"

												While this is a quite small crossover promotion game it works great as ""proof-of-concept"" and Shadow Warrior was the ideal crossover for this. Greatly enjoyed the idea and can only see the ideas being even more polished and developed for the coming full stand-alone title. You'd be surprised how addicting it can be to work as a janitor; having OCD tendencies helps a fair bit ;)Only two achievements and both are fairly time consuming. I personally felt it was easier to do them seperatly to avoid having one mess up the other.Time to 100%: 2-3 hours			"

I wont cover shadow warrior, just the clean up.It's a clever little time waster themed around the other viscera detail games, of cleaning up after 'successful' video game slaughter.  It has a little tea party or amputee or surgery sim, but with far less frustration.It's free (if you own SW), and is 7/10 for play value.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail; known for it's aliens, blood, guts and gore is now filled with NO aliens, MORE blood, MORE guts and MORE gore in this very well made spin off combined with Shadow Warrior. You play as the janitor that has to come in and clean up everything after the main character in Shadow Warrior does his thing and leaves the dead bodies, guns, bullets, ninja stars and MONEY all over the place. I'm a huge fan of Viscera Cleanup Detail to being with as I have almost 24 hours on the game but this spin off is simply GREAT. The way you can get ahold of a copy of Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is by either buying Viscera Cleanup Detail which will include the Shadow Warrior and Santa's Rampage spin offs or you can purchase Shadow Warrior and it will include a copy of Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior. Pros:- More Blood- More Guns- More Ninja Stars- More Dead Bodies- Tons of Money Laying Around- Multiplayer/Co-opCons:- Short Game- No AliensAll in all VCD:SW is a great game and if you enjoy simulators you should definitely pick it up.Final Verdict;10/10			"

												I really like Viscera Cleanup Detail. There is something about that makes it so addictive to play. I personally recommend Santa's Rampage to anyone. Actually, why don't you read my review on it first to get a better understanding of what the game is about.https://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/265210Now onto Shadow Warrior.The game itself is just a free demo, that you can get by buying Shadow Warrior. That said it doesn't quite do it for me, compared to other games of the series.There is only one level, which is the first level of the Shadow Warrior remake, and it only consists of 2 areas to clean. Mainly, only the floor is messed up in this one, so it really doesn’t offer much. There are no explosives to play around with. In Santa’s rampage you could find letters directed to Santa which can possibly explain his outrage. Again, little things in Santa's Rampage made the game for me - it was as if you were trying to revive Christmas.Again, this demo is missing most of that and for the most part feels hollow. The only real feature is that they copied the character of Wang from the game, but alas, the amount of lines he says is really limited.Unlike ""Santa's Rampage"" version, this game is missing that sense of completion feeling. If you were to put the clean and bloody versions of that level side by side, you will see that they barely differ from each other, compared to Santa’s Rampage. I suppose it is something to do with the lighting.In the end, the game feels very hollow. That said, the game comes free for all Shadow Warrior owners. I suppose the game can be considered as a little bonus. But you know, i still recommend you to try out Santa's Rampage.			"

												Pros for VCD Shadow Warrior:Can pick up money lying around a bloody temple.Throwing heads into furnaces makes for great fun.Good game for killing time.Somehow picking up flayed torsos, mopping bloody floors and collecting discarded weapons is relaxing.Main character makes pop culture references and has lines, unlike the other two games in this series.Visually pleasing map.Comes with either Shadow Warrior or Viscera Cleanup Detail.Soothing music in the game, really helps you deal with the mentality of what went down in the temple.Cons:Not much replayability.The character's lines eventually get boring as he starts to repeat them.It is unfortunately a short game.It's only Single-player, it would've been more fun with someone else.The game only has one map, which was disappointing and made for a short experienceGame Score: 9/10 Complete it!

												Viscera is a funny little game where you play as a janitor and you have to clean up the mess caused by Lo Wang in Shadow Warrior. You get to see the building where some part of the prologue of SW took place. Two main halls littered with spliced up bodies and, of course blood, is everywhere. Not only bodies but bullet casings, pieces of glass and other trash await to be picked up.There is an incinerator where you need to take everything. Buckets are available full of water so that you can clean your mop and you can get cases where you can collect all the stuff so that you can dispose of them at the incinerator at once. There is a radio in the 1st hall where the music of SW is being played and the janitor guy tries to act like Lo Wang by saying one-liners regularly. Also, you can collect money rolls and there is a special case where you can collect all these.This is a no brainer but a good pastime. The original Viscera Cleanup Detail (available separately via Steam Store) has nothing to do with SW but has its own theme. I might just pick it up after finishing this one!			"

Viscera Cleanup Detail meets Shadow Warrior in this map thats one member in the Viscera Cleanup Detail family.For those of that have played ""Shadow Warrior"" this game is for you. In the aftermath of the slaughter in the temple level, a cleaning team arrives to pick up the pieces and restore the temple to its former glory (kinda).Pros- Very nice map to clean up- As far as i know, some voice acting of the janitor for the first time. (Sounds like the guy in ""Shadow Warrior""- Ninja Radio availableCons- Small to medium map (Goes pretty quick to clean up)Other than that, none.I really enjoyed this map.

												Hmm.. I needed something to cheer me up.. This interesting little piece just did that. You are the cleansweep after Shadow warrior temple level by moping the blood and not just moping blood. You also need to burn up everything. Guns, body part, Statue, bullet shells. Quite a cleaning job you will have to do!It's a really short game. I probably spent around 2 hours of actual play time to finish this and get both achievements. You can probably do it quicker if you focus.The graphics are pretty basic shadow warrior style and there is no music only sound effect that you need to locate items.  The main character does making some intesesting and smart ♥♥♥ remarks. IT is great to walk into a mess and after you done and look back at the cleaned up temple. You will be so amazed at your self!8/10			"

April 1, 2016Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is an interesting crossover, but quickly runs out of content. Gameplay is just menial tasks of moving objects and mopping blood. This could be a nice game to relax, but the repetitive tasks and spread of blood means you will be working harder and longer if you don't pay attention.As most people have mentioned, the mini-game has a few hours of content, mostly walking and backtracking. The character comments are funny at times, but quickly get recycled. If you picked up Shadow Warrior, this mini-game can be a good way to see if you are interested in Viscera Cleanup Detail. Chances are, you will be quickly bored and never come back after finishing everything.			"

Probably 1-3 hours of gameplay.

""After the battle is before the janitor job""This little Minigame included for free in Shadow Warrior 2013 (don't buy it alone) is funny.Collect all distributed body parts together and burn them in the oven. Even bloody waterbuckets and Ninja Swords will gone in flames ...Enjoy the nice comments of your Character during his hard job.In the end you will be rewarded with the clean job done and 2 Mio dollars bloody money.Not bad for an ordinary janitor job, isn't it?

												You know, it seems silly to review a game about a janitor (or perhaps, it's even more silly that I played in the first place, right?) but I figure I ought to at least mention how suprisingly fun the experience was!So, I think this game came bundled with Shadow Warrior, which I haven't played yet, but that I know to be a particularly gorey first person shooter. And in a hilarious twist, this game is about the janitor who has to work the next day, after the place has been shot to pieces by the main protagonist! LOL. The absolute absurdity of the situation made me laugh... not just because of what the janitor says while going through the levels, marveling and agonizing over the complete gore-fest that awaits him, but also because it added a surreal sense of realism to all the FPS games I'd ever played and never thought twice about. It made me ask those mystifying, philosophical questions... who were these people? Who has to clean up their remains? What kind of 401k do they have?I think game play could arguably be called dull, but it was weirdly soothing to me. There was definitely something zen about going into an Eastern Temple covered in gore, making slow, but steady progress as you cleaned it top to bottom, and then stood spotlessly victorious. Call me OCD, I liked it. That said, I think 2.5 hours is the PERFECT length of time to finish the two levels given to you in the game. Anymore and I think I would have lost my freakin' mind to boredom.			"

												Game is great and unexpectedly fun. Yeah, i mean it - being janitor is fun in this game.So, you killed a lot of yakuza members in your quest for an ancient magical blade. Great work. Now someone has to clear up this mess you made along the way!Game is really fun and engaging, and have a surprising amount of depth and strategy. Oh, and did i mention the co-op?The only minus is game is ridiculously short - you can 100% complete it in an hour and there is only one mission. But you did get that game for free didn't ya? If you want more levels, more freedom and more toys - buy the original VCD which have all of it in spades.			"

												11/10 would clean again.No, just kidding:This is a classic clean up game. There are more like this on steam, but the connection with Shadow Warrior is just a nice idea! :DI played Shadow Warrior before and recognize the place immediately. A nice Idea, because in games you kill and die and do sh*t without thinking who have to clean it up after again! :o ;)A funny Minigame with 3 Rooms and 2 Floors to clean up. If you miss a spot or an organe you can use radars so there shouldnt be the situation that you missed a liitle not even visible spot.While you clean up you have to collect 2 million $ in some bundles all around the rooms. If you can't find any of the money, there is a usefull guide.Funny little game! :)			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior... OOOHH YOU WANNA CLEANUP SOME WANG?This game does something I thought nothing could ever do... It made cleaning your mess up fun. So as an employee of Zilla Corp. You are assigned to clean up the temple that was trashed in the beginning of Shadow Warrior, all the bodies, blood, and damn broken glass. You use your mop to clean up blood, the incinerator to burn the little bits, and the hazmat bins for the bigger stuff. Find some bloody money? Put it in the suitcase for an extra reward when you clock out... and maybe put a few priceless artifacts in there too. And why not use that dinky little device you received to make sure you didn’t miss anything? And remember, clean with honor. Wow, was it difficult to decide if I recommend this or not. It’s a cleaning game, so there’s defiantly going to be mixed opinions, for example a friend and I LOVE these Cleanup Detail games, while two of my other friends hate them, and I recommend on if I like a game or not, not if it's good or bad. So there were two ways I could review this, as a good game or as a bad game. I decided I’ll do it as a good game, because I sure as hell liked it.This, for being a cleaning game, is amazing. Somehow it makes cleaning addicting, I spent an hour just burning stuff and another cleaning up the blood... and I was okay with that!The visuals, as with Shadow Warrior’s, aren’t too great, but defiantly get the job done. Dialog is amazing with Wang’s witty comments as you burn stuff and find money.But this game is riddled with bugs and glitches. Sometimes when picking up an object, it sporadically flies through the air, or when you move the suitcase all the money gets throw across the room, and the worst, disappearing objects. After three hours of cleaning and burning, I had found all the money and was getting ready to clock out, but I bumped the suitcase, causing it to glitch out and send one of the rolls of bills flying. Luckily, I watched where it landed. Unluckily, I also watched it fall out of the map through the floor. OCD people will love/hate this game, and so will anybody with addictive natures. But I doubt any 'hardcore' Call of Duty players will enjoy this for more than ten minutes. Pros:Lo Wang's witty commentsrevolutionizes cleaningaddictive gameplayinteresting and original mechanics (using incinerator, buckets spilling, Etc.)Cons:it’s a cleaning game... Enough saidbugs, glitches, etc.8/10Curator page:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/ "

Your typical Viscera Cleanup Detail gameTo begin with, you're getting this game free with the purchase of Shadow Warrior. This Shadow Warrior crossover is special, since the Janitor is making comments while picking up objects, or mopping up the blood. The game itself is short, the map is not that big but hey, you're getting this game for free with Shadow Warrior, which is pretty worth buying, especially on sale. "

												I had a blast playing this version of Viscera Cleanup Detail. I liked how the main character made several quips as I cleaned up the temple, though a lot of them became grunts after a while. I didn't stop playing till I had the entire level spotless, but that didn't seem to unlock the achivement listed for this game, nor did colecting all the money seem to do anything for the achivements either.  I don't know what to say about that, other than maybe it was a bug? The game may seem a little short in hind sight, but it took hours to finish it. I'd give it 5/5 stars, but i am a little annoyed that the achivements didn't work, so only four. Also, i can't help but wonder what's beyond the doors at the top of the second main area.  I probably would know if i got the ""shadow warriors"" game. but i don't real have the money for that right now.UPDATE: so I just realized i was playing the game on host, as i was orginaly going to play it with a friend of mine. I'm not sure, but it might be that the achivements didn't activate because i wasn't in single player.It's also possible that they didn't activate because i don't own a copy of shadow warrior			"

PROS:+ free if you purchased Shadow Warrior+ just what OCD types like myself need+ relaxing+ two easy achievementsCONS:- short game time- not that big of an area- very simple gameplayComment:I got this game for free because I own Shadow Warrior so it is hard to point out the bad stuff about this game. You basically are a janitor tasked to clean up blood, body parts & weapons throughout 2 halls and some corridors in a temple. Just take your mop, your blood/garbage sniffer and your hands to get rid of all the filth you find. It took me 3 hours and was a strangely satisfying experience. It is nothing special and rather short but kinda fun. My own room in real life is still a mess but at least one digital temple is clean and I received 2 achievements. Recommended to anyone who is either OCD and/or an achievement hunter.			"

												I have no idea why I love VCD so much, there's something awfully brilliant about cleaning up after Wang over and over, I found myself reviewing my life; my current health. I decided I would put more effort into the gym. I found myself planning small trips. Deciding to finally read a new book. Get my roof fixed maybe. I stopped about 30 minutes in to have a cup of tea which was well deserved. I decided (Between corpse handlings) I would at least try with a girl a liked, I mean what do I have to lose? And then, whilst mopping up my own bloody footprints for the millionth time I realised it was 2am. Ever wanted to know what being on the lowest rong of the employment ladder is like? Play this game, It will fix your life. This is the best councellour ever and its much cheaper.			"

												Well - as you probably know from other reviews, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is a free gift for users who purchase Shadow Warrior, so in this case we can't talk about price-value ratio.This leaves us with enjoyment-time ratio - it was free, but does it worth the time to play?The game is really simple: clean up the temple. You have your trustworthy mop (press 1) your hands, trained on numerous temples you cleaned before (press 2) and ""The Sniffer"" (press 3) which can detect blood and clutter around you (left click to turn on/off, right click to change mode)The game mechanically both simple and great. You need to clean the place up - get shurikens, katanas, guns and smashed statues to the incinerator, as well as mop up the blood and clean up the severed torsos, limbs, internal organs (Hey, they had a wild party previously!) The little trick is in the later items - bumping into objects, kicking body parts will splatter blood around, and if you step into a blood puddle, you'll leave nice bloodie footprints for a while. You don't need to take every single item to the incinerator - there are yellow crates in which you can dump items, then bring them in one turn. Basically this is the most intresting part of the game.  It's because the game is kinda more physics-simulator than a real game. You can actually throw/put items into the crates, and you can shake them out of it. Tip it over. Collide with a wall and drop it.The game's physics great, and actually somehow the theme also fares really well.  I was mainly playing this when I was too sleepy to play with anything that requires thinking, and actually this was quite a good game for that purpose - I finished it in about 3 hours.Sadly I can't tell anything from the multiplayer options, I haven't tried it out yet.I don't know if there is any point of writing this review as currently the game isn't sold separately but at this point I think I summed the game up quite nicely, maybe some of you will find it useful eventually :)I liked the game, it's really like a good old household chores - while you do the cleaning and menial work, you don't really need to pay attention,  you can think about everything you want. It was a great experience from a free gift game.			"

												You've killed them all.Bloodied corpses, dropped swords and deadly shuriken lie in your wake, blood sprayed all over the walls.Who better to clean it up than the janitor, who now has the right to take the dropped objects and sell them later on?You play the cleaner. There's no swordplay. You pick it up, put it in a bucket, and burn it. No questions asked. Your mop gets dirty with the amount of gore you've cleaned up, you go to a bucket and dip it in. A very linear game, until you figure out you're allowed to start playing with EVERYTHING the Yakuza dropped; swords, wads of money, guns, and, most importantly, limbs. You can move these around into stupid positions, usually making all the cleaning you did absolutely redundant as you spatter blood everywhere the limbs touch.All in all, slow-paced, but highly addictive.

I got all the achievements in less than 3 hours, pretty nice. Never forget the power of fire. What is this? I do not know, but I'll throw it in the incinerator anyways! Both achievements can be easily acquired if you pay attention. I only had to use the Snooper to find a small shuriken stuck in a corner and a barely visible piece of glass. The money was a bit harder to collect, but if you do it part by part you'll make it.>I'd give it a 9/10>Pros: Amusing, OCD Friendly, comical reactions by the janitor itself, free addition to Shadow Warrior, has MP, 2 neat achievements to show off.>Cons: From time to time there will be some annoying bugs due to the physics.

												Shadow Warrior is another installment to the Viscera Cleanup Detail series and by far the funniest.Pros:- Funny interjections by the player- Very easy to get achievments- Nice time waster- Good introduction into the VCD seriesCons:- Too short- Only two achievmentsI would absolutely reccomend this game, it's hilarious and almost as good as the original VCD game. 9/10			"

												""Tossed a bloody butt into a fire."" 7/10This is the perfect game for clean freaks and the obsessive compulsive alike. They should probably look into using it as possible treatment for OCD and maybe even ADD patients. But I digress, I never thought in a million, billion, trillion years that I would play several hours of what is essentially just a cleaning simulator, but here we are in the year 2015 where people like 'PewDewPie' are popular, so I guess anything goes now. Like taking a level from 'Shadow Warrior' and having the poor janitor clean up the aftermath. Spoiler alert: it all works out for him in the end. If you manage to complete the game, that is. It's a test of will.Initially this game can be pretty frustrating to play. The learning curve is short, but the first ten or twenty minutes will most likely be very aggravating, at least for me they were. And this is mostly due to the fact that it's super easy to track blood literally anywhere. Oh! Don't step into those tracks of blood or you'll create new fresh tracks. Oh! Don' t smack that severed head into anything or you'll leave a brand new blood splatter all over it. Oh! Don't knock over those incredibly not sturdy disposal units or you'll reek havoc on the squeaky clean floor. Seriously, why are they so easy to spill over, even when they're full?!			"

												A fun little bonus for any OCD fans of the new Shadow Warrior game.  Sure, Lo Wang can cut a swath through an army of men, but can he clean up after himself?Like many who have played any of the Viscera Cleanup Detail games, I have to say that this game is surprisingly fun for essentially being a housecleaning simulator.  Yeah, on the one hand it's not an adrenaline rush where you feel like a badass for fighting of armies of dudes left and right.  On the other hand though, it's relaxing and pleasant.  Here is a goal, here are your tools, complete as you will.  No time limit, no rush, no one else mucking it up.This particular iteration gets a little bit of a comedic boost by putting you in the shoes of Lo Wang himself, who is none too shy about voicing his opinions on the entire process.  While none of the lines were laugh out loud material, the commentary still brought a smile to my face, making an already enjoyable experience that much better.There are some flaws with this particular version of Viscera Cleanup Detail though.  For one, there are exactly zero instructions available through the game itself.  No way to see controls, no explanation of the objects in the game, no explanation of how to gather money, dispose of remains, or even how to clean your mop.  Most of the game's mechanics I figured out just by poking around, but quite a few I didn't understand until late in my playthrough, things like disposing of items in the Incinerator or how I could get fresh buckets of water from a machine that literally makes buckets of water.  It made me feel a bit cheated in some ways, and certainly undermined a bit of my enjoyment of the game.There is an argument that could be made for game mechanics not being directly explained, since they are relatively simple and not too difficult to figure out.  However, I can really think of no excuse for why there's no way to display the game's controls, much less any way to rebind them.  I will admit that this is not a title where keybindings can make the difference between success and failure, but at the same time the Unreal engine is hardly a difficult engine to add a keybind menu to.  At the very least having an option to display the keybindings would be trivial, and the fact that there's no option to show them is almost unforgivable.  Really, what were the devs thinking?Now, that said, the instructional issues are not a dealbreaker, not for a relatively low-key game such as this.  I still had a surprisingly good time guiding Lo Wang as he cleaned up his own trail of blood, gore, and dismemberment.  As long as you're comfortable with the bog-standard WASD control setup and are willing to look up instructions elsewhere, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is a fun little diversion worth spending a few hours on.

'Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior' is an 'unique' game, where you will clean the mess you have created yourself in the main game Shadow Warrior.If you're only interested in the cleaning part without killing I would recommend you to play Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage instead.Desc:You have a wet mop, your hands and a tracing system (like the scanner in Alien) to detect missed blurs or objects. With the mop you will clean the floor/walls/roof from blood. After some blurs the mop will be full of blood and needs to be cleaned, otherwise you will mess up your cleaned placed. There is a station where you can get a new bucket full of fresh water to clean the mop. After some cleanings the water of the bucket will be deep red and needs to be changed too. You have to burn it in a furnace like all other things you will find: cartridge cases, weapons, money and lot of body parts. Your boots will suck full of blood and leave bloody footsteps if you're walking through pools of blood. To finish your cleaning you have to go to a console to check out. The system will inform you about your current progress, if you want to leave and the system is telling you to 'leave the place in shame' then you know you're not done.Pros:+ 'unique' idea for a game+ concept works+ funny comments to certain body partsexample: picking up a heart and he is saying: 'died because of a broken heart' ^^+ funny placed bodiesexample: a person hanging at a wall pierced with a blade will tear apart by picking it up+ no fall damage+ multiplayer(!)Cons:- radio can't be turned on to have music (means no music at all -.-)- less variety in cleaning- only one static level- too few achievements (compared to VCD: Santa's Rampage)- main game will have no effect to the level structureSuggestions:~ add music and cleaning will be more fun~ more achievements (for example 'Lower Ear': Finding the ear of the Boss, 'Gun Connector': Collect all gun types, ..)~ connect the main game with the cleaner (save the slaughter in a DB and load it with the cleaner to have an awesome vice versa gameplay of your own barbarities)Recommended, but only if it's on sale, because it has a short play time and less variety in cleaning.6/10 "

												Never has there been a more accurate navy life simulator on the market. In this highly educational game you learn all about the basic seamanship fundamentals such as: swabbing, cleaning, removing gear adrift, human waste disposal, and swabbing.This game fails to mention more advanced navy core values such as: brass polishing, tracking your chain of command down to the smoke pit for important signatures on paperwork, working for alcoholic LPOS, chiefs, and divisional officers, command and fleet wide punishment because someone on another ship broke the law out in town while drunk, and doing circles in the ocean so that the command can use up the fuel budget for the year. This game captures the core aspects of a deployment at sea, but without being on the ocean or with the four to six year contractual obligation.  "

												Also known as....Janitor Simulator 2013.But really, this is a simple, short game about cleaning the gore from floors, walls, display cases...the list goes on. As someone prone to rage-quitting (or really, prone to rage in general), this game forced me to slow down, take deep breaths, and not freak out. Because if you do, the mop bucket flips over and suddenly you have bloody water everywhere. The store page doesn't quite mention this, but the most difficult bits to find and pick up are definitely the bullet casings and broken glass. Additionally, the physics are sometimes a bit glitchy, which at one point caused my box of collected money stacks to go flying up toward the ceiling until the game was literally ""makin it rain"".

												Basically a violent and explicit OCD simulator. Only play this if you're interested in spending about 2 hours cleaning up blood, body parts, weapons, and other random items in a Japanese temple. It definitely adds some more character to the Shadow Warrior game itself, as you have to clean up the mess left by Lo Wang in the first level of the game.I enjoyed it. Others might not. Kind of an odd genre.			"

												This game is based on the ""what if"" scenario in which some poor individual is tasked with cleaning up the messes the protagonist of a violent FPS or fighter game leaves behind. In Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior, it is your job to clean up the spilled blood as well as to incinerate the left-over body parts, weapons, and debris, from a previous battle whilst searching for wads of cash amongst the carnage. This game is good for a quick laugh if you can tolerate the game's gore-saturated humor, and the two achievements the game offers are very challenging. As the game exists primarily as a joke, it is quite shallow; there is only one level to play, and there is little replay value. Overall, I believe the game is enjoyable and accomplishes what it set out to do.			"

												This game came bundled with Shadow Warrior and I played it through and got 100 % achievements in two hours of playtime. So, what can you write about a game after 2 hours of perfect completition?Probably you already know the point of this game: you need to clean up the place with a mop and water. You incinerate the objects you find on the floor and you collect money to get the two million dollar achievement and make sure you don't incinerate the money in the process.So, the idea is nice, but I'll be honest: collecting and washing up for two hours is perfectly enough. It was fun for free, but I'd not really wished to pay for this (the same stands for the another Viscera spinoff: Santa's Rampage... maybe I'll get that once, but not sure).The physics sometimes a little weird, but it's acceptable. The only thing which really bothered me was when I put objects into the biohazard bucket then tried to bring the bucket to the incinerator, the objects inside were jumping annoyingly. This usually made me just bring the objects one by one to the incinerator instead of putting them into the bucket.So yeah: wouldn't really buy it for over a dollar but it's fine in a bundle. I had some fun for free and we owe a huge 'thank you' for the developers to provide this game for us. If you have one or two free hours and you want to have two extra achievements, play this, it's a nice little game. Otherwise just stick with Shadow Warrior and do the cleaning in real life between levels. :)			"

Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is an interesting exploration into the realities of what would happen after a typical video game murder rampage. Did you ever consider how the mess you made got dealt with? Well, now you will.You are not a soldier, an assassin, a gangster, or any sort of typical hero or villain. You are instead a janitor with a bad work assignment: Clean up the mess Lo Wang left behind in the temple. How did you get that job, and what sort of cleaning company handles these sorts of massacres? No one knows.You are armed with a mop, some gloves, and a janitorial radar and must scrub every inch of the temple and remove all of the body parts and other junk, all while looking out for cash (a fair bonus!). Blood is wiped away with a mop and some water, while everything else can be incinerated. When you have had enough, you punch out and go home.The GoodAn amusing premise that makes you look at your heroic rampage in a new lightFree with Shadow WarriorThe BadQuite monotonousYou will question why you are not spending the time cleaning your own homeThe Bottom LineViscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is an amusing bonus game that takes a fun look at the consequences of a video game bloodbath. It is not for everyone, but with the right sense of humour it can be fun for a short while.			"

												This game is oddly satisfying to play right after playing Shadow Warrior, and I think to really enjoy it you need to aim for the achievements for the game and clear house. It may not be for the impatient gamer but it certainly is worth it for achievement hunters and those with a decent amount of time. Would really like it if Runestorm teamed up with other developers to tie in with their games (I'm thinking The Witcher, Sleeping Dogs, Serious Sam or the Metro series but if you think about it, it could work with most games).

												This is a fun and humorous spin-off of Viscera Cleanup Detail. It's comparatively short, but it features distinct voice acting and set pieces. I wouldn't expect a spin-off of an early access game to be this polished, but it sure is. I enjoyed cleaning up and nabbing the achievements for this one. There is something very zen about the Viscera Cleanup Detail games. The clever voice acting made this all the more enjoyable, and it's a feature I think would make the main game feel more complete.

												It's sort of ok, fun at first but becomes tedious after you've cleaned nearly everything. It looks like you've cleaned everything, but you miss tiny bits and it's frustrating trying to find the last bits of blood left. The last spots of blood were on stupid places like on lights above and ceilings so if you can't find it look up. Doesn't have any replayability. But that said I'd rather have played this game then not have played it. And even though I found it annoying I want to play more areas, but this game only has one area.

												I was fortunate enough to win the entire Viscera package in a giveaway, and I'm really happy to own this game. I started with Santa's Rampage, then moved on to this one (will be doing the actual Viscera game soon). I have already reviewed Santa's Rampage, and these two games are very similar. The link to SR has been provided above.If you like the Shadow Warrior theme, cleaning, and relaxing, casual gameplay, then you will enjoy this game.Since I have already provided the link to SR, I will be commenting on the differences between the two games (SR and Shadow Warrior).The aesthetics in Shadow Warrior are very, very good. The building you are in is nicely detailed with different museum pieces, and the variety of things to clean up is good. Like SR, there is a radio you can pick up and carry around if you want some music while you play. The music is very good and matches the theme appropriately - the menu screen music is also really nice. I have noticed that your character actually speaks and makes comments during gameplay - usually when you pick up stuff. The level is also fairly larger than SR, but a lot more symmetrical.Thus far, I have found no way to kill yourself, so I do not think this is possible in SW. There are only two achievements - completely cleaning the building and amassing 2 million dollars in your trunk. I was unable to find the last bit of mess to cleanup - I scoured the ENTIRE building with my sniffer and just could not find any blood splatters =(. I also ended with 1,875,000 dollars (so close!). I am unsure whether or not the museum pieces are worth money (I had thrown all of them into the furnace), so that might contribute to the final count when you punch out.The game is still fairly buggy at times - in particular with the ridiculous collision mechanics. Sometimes pieces can just randomly go flying, and I've also noticed that some of the doors will swing around violently. As in SR, the collision mechanics between objects are EXTREMELY sensitive, so consider walking (hold CTRL) whenever you are carrying water buckets and the hazardous waste containers. Overall, this game is very fun, and you should check it out if you are interested in this concept.Definitely recommend!If you like this review, please consider checking out DJSF's Rogue Reviews Steam Group for more in-depth reviews "

												If mundane tasks were transformed into enjoyable video games, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior would be a result.  Not only is this a very fun time waster, but it's also a relaxing experience and an overall good demonstration of the main game.This game was included in the Special Edition of Shadow Warrior.  It wasn't a game I bought by itself, but I'm glad I was able to obtain it in some way.  The graphics are beautiful, the ambiance is soothing and it controls like it's supposed to.The only problem I had was that it was sometimes a little too hard to see the blood.  I'd imagine that in the main game, you would be working with surfaces that are mostly made up of dark colors (black, grey, etc.), but here, you're working with surfaces that are very abundant in bright reds.I would go so far as to say that this is a good gateway to buying Viscera Cleanup Detail.  For the price I paid for Shadow Warrior: Special Edition ($3.99), this bonus minigame was definitely worth it.  If you're a stickler for absolute cleanliness or just have a few hours you want to kill, then this is worth a play.			"

												For a free game that was bundled with Shadow Warrior, I wasn't expecting much besides an extra title for my game count, but I must say it was totally worth my time in playing it through.If you have any experience with the original Viscera Cleanup Detail, the gameplay is very similar but a bit dumb down on the side. You'll see the same ""Xtreme"" mopping, bucket kicking and carcass throwing as before, but you won't be fixing or reattaching things per say. As a free game though, this is more than what I would have asked for.There is only a single stage in this whole thing and it takes about an hour or two to complete, three if you're completely new to the setting. I will recommend people to go through Shadow Warrior first before attempting this, so as to enjoy the map more.			"

												This mini-game currently cannot be bought as a standalone title, so it make it hard to ""recommend"" this game or not.  However, if it's a matter of your precious time I would say there are more entertaining activities to engage in.  Compared to the other Viscera titles this one has very little variety.  Probably within about 10 minutes you've seen every texture and every mesh.  The number of achievements is also very limited as well, so for the completionist it still doesn't pose much of a challenge.Now if you've never played a Viscera game before you might find this to be a good introduction to the mechanics and work on some strategy to help in the other titles.  Having played the other Viscera titles first, I don't feel any more complete by playing this one.  In short: skip it.			"

Did a alt+delete after my money chest lifted me 10 feet of the ground and rained cash over the room. The blood/debris scouter is a little tricky.It's a gag DLC. Picking up single shells and mopping up blood. It's not stupidly long, but loses any charm after half of an hour. I didn't try the multiplayer. I like the idea, and I can't really fault the execution to much. Just, how much fun do you find sanitizing after a massacre?			"

												Game is self explanatory.I cleaned the entire level from top to bottom, picking up severed limbs and bullet casings along the way. I enjoyed some of the voice acting but it got tiresome fast, it is humorous but needs a lot more or you will get sick of hearing the same lines over and over.The main reason I don't recommend this game is because I didn't get what I bought this game for, completing the two achievements.I clocked out with a trunk full of $2,000,000 (in 22 pieces) and a temple fully cleaned and was commended on the clock out screen for my efforts yet I didn't unlock either of the achievements.Secondly on the main menu they've got a host/join option presumably for multiplayer/coop janitorial duties that does not work at all. I've followed many guides and read developers comments on this and they say it works but it doesn't. I've tried the hosting a dedicated server method, I've opened all of the necessary ports but my friends are unable to join my server, nor am I able to join a friends server.If it was just the latter problem I would still recommend this game as it doesn't say multiplayer/coop on the store page, but it certainly advertises achievements which I still don't have.

												This has to be the STUPIDEST idea I've EVER seen for a video-game. And somehow, it works wonders. What you see here, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is the Beta of a game that's out already. I got it when I bought Shadow Warrior as everybody else who has this and told myself at some point: The name sounds stupid enough, let's give it a try. And oh man, I was right.The game goes arround on this concept: Have you ever though what happend after your character utterly DESTROYS everything on a level, leaving pools of blood, unloaded weapons and mags, and also piles and piles of limps arround it? This is what happens, a random, nameless dude who works for some weird company is send to clean it up before the next player arrives. Now, have you heard that right? You're here to clean. CLEAN. SOME PEOPLE REFUSE TO DO IT IN REAL LIFE, WHY IN THE MOTHER OF ♥♥♥♥ WOULD THEY DO IT ON A GAME!? Funny enough, I actually did. I cleaned everything. And I also stole all the money. Two hours of my life wasted, and I don't regret anything.You see, this game is extremely relaxing. REALLY, REALLY RELAXING. The only thing that doesn't need though, are the dumb comments of your character: Luckily they got taken out on the final release of the game. It also has coop, so you can relax WITH FRIENDS! AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN BETTER THAN RELAXING WITH FRIENDS?! TALKING USING MICROSOFT SAM, HOLY MOTHER OF ANAL EVACUATIONS, NOW THAT'S CLASSY! So yeah, you can enable the old but classic Microsoft Sam voice to read every priceless piece of art that everyone speaks. Which is funnier than it might look like.Do I recommend the Shadow Warrior version? Well, you can't even buy it on it's own, really. It's a gift from one of the editions. Do I recommend the full game, though? YES. ♥♥♥♥ YES. But wait for a sale. As fun as it might look like, 10€ is TOO MUCH. If you buy it, make sure you have at least another poor excuse of a friend to play it with.			"

												I booted this one up right after beating the Shadow Warrior campaign for the first time.  I'm familiar with the full Viscera Cleanup Detail and the Santa's Workshop stand-alone, but had yet to play either of those, so I was going into this experience with fresh eyes.  Boy, what an experience it turned out to be.  I had seen the trailers, the screenshots, but actually walking into Zilla's dojo to pick up the mess left by Lo Wang was somehow, as boring as the idea of janitorial labor may sound, so cathartic and entertaining.  I'm not sure if the assets were reused ad-naseum from Shadow Warrior, but this stand alone still looks as gorgeous as the base game.  The new parts added in specifically for VCD have just a vaguely more cartoonish style to them than the rest of the game, but it isn't jarring, and just makes things easier to play as you can easily, visually, distinguish what is part of the map, and what is a tool to help you clean it.  In my playthrough, I spent HOURS scrubbing the hell out of the floor, the walls, and burning any body part, organ, or piece of shrapnel that didn't belong.  The tasks were reptitive, but not in annoying way, it felt a lot more like playing something that keeps you coming back despite staying the same mechanically, like Tetris, than it did actually doing a chore like mowing the lawn or shoveling the sidewalk.  Despite all of this, the punchout machine still gave me flak for not completing the job properly, for someone with severe OCD this could probably be maddening, as I walked around the map for a good ten minutes looking for anything I had forgotten to clean up.  I guess even in the virtual space, perfection isn't easily obtained.  This nice little freebie (yes,it comes free with the base Shadow Warrior purchase) has me sold on the main Viscera Cleanup Detail game, and I'm looking forward to seeing how RuneStorm expands upon the concept for a full-blown title of their own design.

												Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is of course, more of a joke at the expense of Shadow Warrior's own retro gorefest gameplay than it's own game. The underlying gag of this minigame is how in video games the protagonist always goes out of their way to gut enemies like fish and behead them like shrimp, but who does the cleaning? The answer is a faceless janitor armed with a mop who grunts and groans about the mess he has to clean up and makes a few thousand dollars on the side by smuggling out bloodstained cash, all the while making charming, smile-earning wisecracks at the nature of the battle and the remaining fallout. So yes, it is a joke, but it has earned more than it's fair share of warm-hearted chuckles and is definately worth the time to look into if you enjoyed Shadow Warrior.So get off your tush and get to work, you bum.

												I received this when I bought Shadow Warrior on sale.... I didn't realise it would download and was pleasently surprised as I had always been intruiged by Viscera Cleanup Detail games but never thought them worht the money..... How wrong I was!!!The execution of this game is 'squeeky clean', it just 'gleams' with class, and is a real 'polished' experience all round.... It is really good fun, character vocals are entertaining and the games is just long enough for them not to get repetitive... there was a small bug where I had to use the console at the end to overcome a glitch with an invisible blood stain but it solved it nicely.May even fork out for the full VCD now....!!WARNING: OCD Will kick in....

												Fun, but unpolished compared to ""normal"" game. Shurikens are very hard to spot, and everything is covered in red rugs that make detecting blood difficult.Also, no matter what we did, we weren't able to get coop to work. Not FAQs, guides, port opening or using hamachi helped. Coop in full game works just fine though.This spin-off lacks most of original Viscera Cleanup Detail features and gets old long before you're done cleaning.Better play original game.			"

												In this game you are thrust flush into a level from the new Shadow Warrior where Lo Wang has laid waste to everything around him. The first thing you'll notice is that your GTX780 seems to be struggling with the game so you dial down the settings a notch. After a couple of minutes you realize that the enemy in this game is devious enough that you can't really fight it, just try to cricumvent or work with the shoddily-coded physics engine.I honestly wouldn't play this game even if it was free ... which it was.

												3/10 - Great Idea, Worth playing once.. If free.I love the idea, you are a ""cleaner"". There was a wild party/blood bath last night, you are in charge of removing the bodies and cleaning up the mess.This could be an all-star game, however it takes some serious time to accomplish anything  in the game. After the initial movie, they drop you in a huge ♥♥♥ building with only a mop. I cleaned a few rooms (5%), but without any tasks or completion it quickly turned into a snooze fest.Worth nothing, came free with shadow warrior, Just a cool idea worth playing once.

												Preface: Read the comments!Literally one of the most stupid game ideas ever - and I mean that starting with the original game. I never bought that game because I found it very stupid and knew I would not enjoy it. This one came for free with Shadow Warrior for some reason.The premise of these ""Cleanup"" games is funny, but NOT fun. It is literally the most repetitive, boring, pointless ""gameplay"" of all time. Sure, that's the general idea or joke of these ""games"", is that you are willing to play something so silly and simulate doing a menial job from your computer.But that's why I find it entirely stupid - and also don't understand why people are willing to spend their time doing something like this simulation. Go do something more interesting and useful with your time.(P.S. This ""game"" is one of very few that I am so easily enraged about. Seriously, people, why would you think pretending to be a futuristic janitor is fun?)			"

Viscera is a great game for listening to music, podcasts, and audiobooks but all of that goes out the window when every tenth body part you pick up causes your janitor to comment about it.

												I got this for free when I bought the game „Shadow Warrior“ and I think it is a nice gimmick. I also have the real/full Viscera Cleanup Detail game so this is more like a free DLC for me. The mini game contain only one map which is designed like the first level from „Shadow Warrior“ and I think they did a pretty decent job. The map is relatively easy and you can do it in 1 – 1.5 hours.There is not much more to say about it. If you like the Cleanup Detail series than you most likely also like this one.			"

												This game is essentially a janitor simulator, where you have to cleanup after one of Lo Wang's violent and gore-filled rampages in Shadow Warrior. While it sounds like an interesting and amusing idea (and for the first 5-10 minutes it is), once the novelty wears off the game becomes very tedious and boring. I beat the game and got both the achievements in under 2 hours and I have no intention of playing it again.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow WarriorPositives:+ Excellent cleaning simulator, those looking for a career in cleaning, this is a good start. The game has real life applicability, since the tasks are so simple and boring it pretty much prepares you for your upcoming cleaning career.+ Free game (included when purchasing Shadow Warrior).+ Game lasts 1-2 hours, so thankfully the pain of playing is short-lived.Negatives:- Horrificly monotonous. This entire game consists of using your mop and bucket to clean blood from the temple floors and then you're expected to dispose of guns, shell casings, katanas, shurikens and severed body parts by placing them in the biohazard bins.- Experience the sheer frustration and tedium of a cleaner, as you'll regularly mop up your own bloody footprints and walk back and forth to refill mop buckets with water, or get new biohazard bins.Overall Score 1/10For anyone aspiring to be a janitor, I really do recommend this incredibly repetitive, dull game. As for the rest of us, avoid. I got it for free with Shadow Warrior, so it didn't cost me a cent. But that still doesn't mean it's good, in fact it's downright bad.			"

												Having read several articles about the full game, I knew what to expect and lo and behold cleaning up blood and gore was the order of the day. The game is hugely let down by the slipperiness of your characters movement and his inability to be halted by scenery.The lack of any kind of tutorial as to how its mechanics work or instructions past ""clean up this mess"" are also to the games detriment and perhaps would have made me stick with it longer. But consequently it's a massive pain to even begin play. Generally the former point wouldn't be a problem, but with this being such a unique type of game, failure to explain its mechanics seems foolish and almost arrogant on the part of the developer.I applaud the attempt to try something new in terms of gameplay, but in this state the game is almost immediately frustrating and for that fact alone I can't in good faith recommend it.

			This is about the most pointless piece of software I've ever seen, lol. I played for nearly 20 minutes, because that's as long as I could take it. I kept waiting for something funny...		

Honestly, I just can't figure out how this game is supposed to be fun. As a janitor simulator it does an excellent job. It looks good, and it achieves its aim. But... it's a janitor simulator. Wanna know what it's like to be a janitor? Volunteer at the YMCA, at least then maybe you'll meet someone who will save you from whatever it is that makes your life so boring that you would rather pretend to be a janitor than encounter sunlight.I have no complaints, it was free, so I'll give it that. If you are addicted to free achievements then this game may be for you, but I'd rather make the mess versus clean it up.			"

												Why would anyone want to play this tedious game? You mop up blood, then very quickly your mop gets full of blood and spreads it instead of soaking it up. Move a body piece by accident? It just created more mess. Each body chunk must also be picked up and moved by hand.And there is a sniffer thing that beeps in both green or purple screen settings.Less fun than actual cleaning. Seriously, just go clean your ♥♥♥♥ing house instead. Or pick up trash outside on the street, outside garbage features fresh air and cleans up your town a bit.			"

												Atleast it was free with a good game.See, the cleanup guy thing is a good joke, but it just isn't fun or funny to actually do it. Its boring and tedious.The player quips get annoying after a while, and so does the fact your mop only has like ten wipes before its totally soaked and starts making an even bigger mess.Its really tedious to clean up a large mess only to find you left a trail of bloody fooprints that you have to clean up. And your mop is making them worse, and your bucket is mostly blood.So no. Buy Shadow Warrior,  just don't waste hard drive space or bandwidth with this pointless tag along.			"

												I got this for free with some other game I bought (I think it was Shadow Warrior.) It was not even worth that. Maybe there are people out there who enjoy playing a game about mopping up and cleaning up after a grisly murder, but i'm not one of them. I don't care about the blood and gore-I just don't understand why anyone would want to play a game about cleaning. I dislike cleaning in real life and I would never want to do it in a video game. I play video games for fun or to be entertained. This was neither fun, nor entertaining for me. If it sounds fun to you, don't let my opinion sway you. Just don't get it expecting it to be a real game and something more than just a crappy cleaning simulator. (Sorry-I can't stress enough how much I don't understand why a game like this would exist.)			"

Playing anything, and I mean anything, even playing tag by yourself is more worthwhile than playing this waste of life. And it isn't funny at all and I know that is what they were going for. It isn't fun and it sure as hell isn't funny. It is just pointless in every possible sense of the word.And ♥♥♥♥ no I didn't buy this. I could see how pointless it was by the $3 price tag and the name. However I do not think you can buy this by itself anymore, I think it only comes with Shadow Warrior which is how I unfortunately got it. It isn't sold seperately anymore because everyone saw it and saw what garbage it is. It isn't a actual game, it is a joke parody of video games that is not funny at all.I would rather lay down and let massive airliners use my face as a runway than ever play this again, -900/10. 900 being the amount of times I literally said out loud ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is this, what the ♥♥♥♥ am I doing wasting my life with this?""

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is a game you will either love or hate, and this little gem serves as a great introduction to the main game of VCD. You are a janitor; and in this case you clean for the Zilla Corporation, making the temple that serves as the prologue for Flying Wild Hog's Shadow Warrior squeaky clean. For best results, play this after you finish the prologue; then you will either be in awe or upset at the mess you made.Like in the main VCD game, you're a janitor armed with only a mop, a 'sniffer', endless supplies of water buckets and biohazard crates, incinerators, and your own two hands to clean up the messes made by gore and gib happy protagonists like Lo Wang. The cleaning action that you find in the main game is found alive and well here. Even though most of the rooms are red, it is remarkably easy to locate blood and mop it up. Smaller items like tiny gibs and shell casings are kept to a minimum, sure to please longtime players of VCD who routinely come across piles of spent shells. Finally, in a move sure to make this an easy cleanup, you're given two incinerators and two mop bucket generators which will make the job go faster, not to mention that the game generously has spawned a number of buckets and biohazard crates waiting for fresh new janitors to utilize.So while you are cursing Lo Wang for making your life hard, this level adds a few new things to entertain you while you clean. First off, your janitor has a voice who comments on the messes and whistles to himself. He adds some character to the game (""Dammit, they used an automatic!). He lapses into repeats after some time but they never wear out their welcome. A radio in the first hall blasts the soundtrack to Shadow Warrior. Finally, SPOILER FOR SHADOW WARRIOR: remember how in the prologue Lo Wang walks into the hall with two million dollars? A side goal to cleaning up the temple is to collect all of the cash you find and toss it into the janitor's private trunk. It adds some variety to the clean-all-the-things formula that VCD is known for.  END SPOILERThe game is still not without its glitches, and the sniffer for finding missed debris or gibs is still hit or miss, but it's nice to see that the improvements developer RuneStorm have made to the VCD experience has created a fun little companion game to Shadow Warrior. For VCD veterans, it's another level to test their ability to clean.			"

												The game comes with Shadow Warrior which is a game that is already worth it's price point with how fun it is but this is one of those games that for some reason held my attention for the whole time I was playing it. I just had to clean up everything. It's oddly entertaining for a game that is basically about janitorial duties. There are a few problems like the fact that all buckets, waste baskets and the money basket are a chore to carry around and sometimes get stuck in the floor causing either you or the object your carrying to be propelled along. It's kind of annoying yet somewhat charming. You pick up limbs and giblets of the enemy combatants in the game Shadow Warrior and have to incinerate them by either carrying them into the waste baskets or just throwing them in yourself. Carrying the small items in your hands like the body parts works much better than the baskets so I just took them individually unless I there was small items on the floor like bullets which I would collect in the baskets. The second part of you job is to mop up blood and this can be made hard because sometimes the blood can be very faded. Luckily there is a tracker which both tells you when your near blood and near body parts depending on which mouse button you click to turn it on. I personally like the fact that the tracker is not just a GPS that leads you to the exact location next bloodstain but instead a object that beeps faster the closer you are. Some may find it annoying in a world where games always tell us where to go even for the secrets but like Shadow Warrior, Viscera Cleanup Deatail has a feeling of less hand holding even while in an area that is less open than most games. For achievements there is of course the achievement for cleaning up the whole place and the achievement for getting all the hidden money in the game. There are 20 stacks of cash in the game that are usually in piles of body parts that you must put in a cash box iin order to unlock the achievement. While both of these achievements seem missable they are actually very easy to track. Just go to the door that has the device that asks you if you want to leave and push the button to activate and to leave. It will then tell you how much money you have and whether the rooms are all clear. If it says you have less than 2 million dollars and you left the room unclean than you simply push the button that you actually want to stay. Then just go through the rooms again once with the giblets tracker and then again with the blood tracker to find what you have missed. It's actually a very simple yet oddly entertaining game. For a free add-on to a game that I would say is worth it's price point it is an oddly entertaining experience that I oddly wrote a lot about in this review. You don't need to pick up Shadow Warrior to play this game but I highly suggest it since Shadow Warrior itself is a refreshing and gory FPS that actually has a fun sword mechanic.			"

												What do I think of this game, its an interesting take on the behind the scenes of a awesome FPS but with the twist of having to clean up after yourself.Now I know that the concept of this game will most assuredly turn some people off from the whole concept of cleaning up a FPS level maticiously sounds boring as anything.

												For a minigame that's a bonus for a FPS, it's pretty good. Not just pretty good, its good clean fun! But although it's fun it's really hard. Cleaning up after Wang Wei it's HARD! you have to go around and BURN EVERYTHING, expect the cash. You put that in the chest to get a achievement. Fun.			"

												Way more satisfying than it should be. It's kinda like being The Wolf from Pulp Fiction, but on a bigger scale and without any of the respect.It taps into the same instinct that has your jonesing for studs in Lego games and before you know it hunting down dismembered body parts and slinging them into a roaring furnace becomes an uncontrollable compulsion. Add to that a themed radio that you can carry from room to room and occasional humorous quips about whatever you're jabbing at with your mop and tidying up has never been so much fun. Can't wait for the full version.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior has the same gameplay as the Santa's Rampage version(with the very welcome exception of no dynamite, and a save option); you're cleaning up body parts and bloodstains and have to leave the environment pristine. It takes about 1-2 hours to clean everything up to the satisfaction of the game. Who would have thought cleaning could be an actually enjoyable video game experience?			"

												Before playing this, if you had told me there was a game where you play as the person that comes in behind the main character to do the clean up job, I would have said it sounded like a boring game. But then I played the game. This and Santa's rampage that is. It is so strange just how much fun I had with these title (Still digging into the main game itself for now) just from tossing bodies into the furnace, mopping up the blood and then taking one last look at the now squeaky clean area that used to be soaked in blood and corpses.My only real criticism is that the buckets and bins really don't like the stairs so if you don't lift them up high enough then prepare to go flinging through the air. That's about it though. Wonky bin physics aside, this was worth every bit of money I paid for it. I actually got this and Santa's rampae when I bought the main Viscera Cleanup Detail game so  money well spentI'd actually love to see more done with this kind of thing. There are several characters out there that leave quite a mess behind them like Kratos fron God of war, Frank, Chuck and whatshisfacefromthebadone from the Dead rising games, Any of the Spawn games etc. All of these could be turned into this type of game. Oh and one of the main ones that I'd love to see and would actually work quite well.. Ninja gaiden. I could definitely see Viscera Cleanup Detail: Ninja Gaiden being a thingBetter wrap this up. As for the main game and Santa's rampage, just take what I said here and apply it to those but the main game is way longer with different maps, other objective to complete, lots of achievements and so much more.Get these games if it sounds even slightly appealing to you. You won't regret it.			"

												While it may be considered cheating, this is actually by far the easiest 100% achievements of any game on Steam. All of the cash was acquired with 5-10 minutes using screenshots, and then the mess was all cleaned up within 30 seconds using console commands. 10/10 would walk around for 10 minutes, type two lines into the console and scroll up and down on my mouse for a few seconds again.Seriously though, it's a chill way to pass the time if you just want to relax and do something relatively tedious for an hour. 100% accuracy should really only be the goal for the achievements though. The game doesn't stay fun for long enough in one go to really aim for a complete clean every go-around. All in all, it's an interesting concept, and I can't really give it a thumbs down, because it's free with a game that I also would recommend. Worst case scenario, Shadow Warrior is really fun, so buy that game and give this a once over to boost your overall profile percentage by a point.			"

												The premise, the mechanics, the tools and the humor are exceptionally silly.  The game lasts only a couple of hours and you will likely never play it again – and that’s perfectly fine.  It’s a short break from the norm.  A bite size piece of relaxation and corpse incineration that impressively replicates the satisfaction and dopamine hit recieved from systematically completeling a task.

												Never did I think that being a janitor could be that much fun. Lo Wang's hilarious comments make it even better than the other viscera games. No bugs at all, which is fantastic, since bugs and glitches can hinder your progress in other viscera titles. The only thing that made it kind of annoying is that after you clean up all the blood, body parts etc. you need to search the room from top to bottom to find that last bloodstain that your radar detects but you can't see. This can take at least a half hour, even more if the stain is on the roof or somewhere difficult to reach. Don't expect replay value. I have only played it start to finish 2 times. If you want to do more cleaning, try Viscera Cleanup Detail. It has a variety of maps. 8/10			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is a stand-alone one-level spin-off of a VCD game. In that game you play as Janitor who has to clean up mess after alien movies massacres. Casual fun and jokish simulator, but amusing. This one came out before main game was even finished in 2013 as free offer to owners of Shadow Warrior. They say that they will merge this one into main game soon.Oh, and it kinda has multiplayer too.So, to enjoy the game to the fullest, first you should load up Shadow Warrior and start up new game. Maybe even pick the highest difficulty. Then get into the first fight and take your sweet time slashing people with katana and throwing shurikens randomly at things. Enjoy the blood and massacre. Then once you beat the chapter 0, close the game and load this one up.Bloody hell, Lo Wang! Just look at all the mess that my alter-ego left!(No, don't want to say that VCD:SW copies massacre from main game, albeit it would have been awesome)Then classic gameplay of VCD goes on, cleaning stuff and then running around with beeper to find that last patch of blood that you would in the end fail to see and you will just mop up the spot around.It shows that this one is the earliest VCD on Steam. Unlike Santa's Workshop, there is almost nothing that can go wrong, no dynamite, no way to kill yourself. Some surface, mostly ceiling, thankfully are mess-proof, otherwise you would have never reached blood on the roof. So you can just move on and slowly clean it up for giggles after main game. Hm, main hero alo throws one-liners, not something I seen in other VCDs. They sound quite familar, albeit get old.Quite amusing. All yay for this free offer.			"

												Time to completion - about 2.5 hours. Mom I can't clean my room right now! I am busy cleaning!It sounds wierd (and it is) but this is a game spin-off of Shadow Warrior and Viscera Cleanup detail (which i didnt know about until now) where by you are tasked with cleaning up the guts and gore from a fight from Shadow Warrior. You do this (in short) by literally picking up every gore soaked piece of flesh, broken furnature and glass, and then wiping it all up in a blood soaked mop. Then by disposing of the remains in an incenerator. You must get is good enough to eat off of.It is a weirdly cathertic experience similar to Euro Truck simulator where you dont feel like you are doing anything but for some reason you keep playing it. Play it. If not for anything else, it was free with Shadow Warrior.			"

												While it may be considered cheating, this is actually by far the easiest 100% achievements of any game on Steam. All of the cash was acquired with 5-10 minutes using screenshots, and then the mess was all cleaned up within 30 seconds using console commands. 10/10 would walk around for 10 minutes, type two lines into the console and scroll up and down on my mouse for a few seconds again.Seriously though, it's a chill way to pass the time if you just want to relax and do something relatively tedious for an hour. 100% accuracy should really only be the goal for the achievements though. The game doesn't stay fun for long enough in one go to really aim for a complete clean every go-around. All in all, it's an interesting concept, and I can't really give it a thumbs down, because it's free with a game that I also would recommend. Worst case scenario, Shadow Warrior is really fun, so buy that game and give this a once over to boost your overall profile percentage by a point.			"

												This review is more meant for the actual Viscera Cleanup Detail, as this game is basically demo of it.I like that i got this with Shadow Warrior for free, but this game is very boring. The original Viscera Cleanup Detail is also very boring in my opinion. The game feels like an actual chore, and no game should feel like that. This is the kind of game that is meant for youtubers to play and promote the game so they can make more money sitting on their asses. I can't complain much because it was free, but this review is meant for the actual Viscera Cleanup Detail. Seriously, don't waste your time on this.			"

												Very calming game. Only issue with it is that sometimes the physics bug out, and that can get you blood in unreachable places. For these you can use <`> to open te console, and <fly> and <ghost>, to well, fly and be able to go though walls (<walk> makes you return to the floor). Chances are big without those, you'll never clean the temple since some places are just unreachable, even with stacking of wastebins.

Kinda hard to figure out at first but you get used to it. Definitely encourages me to play the original game. My only issue is that I wish it had a score system or percentage as its hard to figure out 100% when it doesn't give that in the first place.

												Can't complain too much since this came free with shadow warrior.  The idea is funny and this is nice to play if you're multitasking with something else or listening to a podcast.Something that would make this game a lot better would be to have a score screen after you finish beyond the money count.  Percentage of blood cleaned up, x/y items incinerated, % money found.   Stuff like that.  As it is now, it is frustrating to clean all you can see and not get an indication of how close you got.There is an item that acts like sonar for blood and items so you can listen to if you are close to something that needs cleaning but it's still searching for a needle in a haystack.  A visual guide would really help.  Even if it was just Aliens scanner style.I recommend cleaning just the first main room.  Cleaning the whole place isn't really satisfying because you'll still come up short.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is a funny concept for a game but boring as HELL after just a little while.The games mechanics sound funny, there has been a brutal battle with blood spilled everywhere... And you're the janitor, so clean it up!Ha! A game where you just clean up? That sounds ridiculous! *buys*Here's the thing, that's all the game is.You clean.That's it. There is literally nothing other than that. You mop, pick up some parts, throw them away, repeat.It would be okay if it was quick and easy to do, but it isn't. I spent an hour cleaning the first area (other than the spawn). The gameplay is INCREDIBLY tedious, there is only one place to throw away body parts in each room, which means going back and forth back and forth and back and forth. It gets annoying very fast.And after I was done, I walked into the next room and it was the same thing. Blood, body parts, cleaning tools. There was nothing diffrent, except that there was a staircase and a new small balcony upstairs.There were no new concepts, materials, tools, it was the same tedious gameplay, except there was more.Do not let these ""comedians"" who say thing such as ""mopping sim 2014 10/10"" convince you to buy this game. Yes, it is a mopping sim. That's all it is. And it's not fun.Overall - 3/10Do not buy this game, it is a huge waste of your time and money. "

												The game is pretty straighforward in its zen-like simplicity, just clean everything up.Before long you'll either find an effective method or rage-quit after having knocked your bucket over for the third time in the same corner.Considering the game is a freebie with Shadow Warrior, you have no excuse not to put a couple of hours into it.Just watch out for the shurikens; they're tough to spot.

Well, walked away is a bit of Miss Gnomer as she instead got on the bus and headed to somewhere else. Sadly the drink I drank that day keeps me from knowing if she went to West LA, New York, or Santa Fe.

												This was included with the Shadow Warrior game, almost didn't even notice it.. the idea of cleaning up the mess is great; however as a game it really doesn't do much after the first minute or so... made me motion sick a bit which is something quite rare for me as this is only the second game out of my 23 year FPS history that this has happened....I think the camera movement is too fast and too edgy or jerky, even dialing down mouse sensitivity and playing around with other settings didn't help much... all in all nice DLC to try out, but I wouldn't recommend buying it or playing it for long....

												The game comes with Shadow Warrior which is a game that is already worth it's price point with how fun it is but this is one of those games that for some reason held my attention for the whole time I was playing it. I just had to clean up everything. It's oddly entertaining for a game that is basically about janitorial duties. There are a few problems like the fact that all buckets, waste baskets and the money basket are a chore to carry around and sometimes get stuck in the floor causing either you or the object your carrying to be propelled along. It's kind of annoying yet somewhat charming. You pick up limbs and giblets of the enemy combatants in the game Shadow Warrior and have to incinerate them by either carrying them into the waste baskets or just throwing them in yourself. Carrying the small items in your hands like the body parts works much better than the baskets so I just took them individually unless I there was small items on the floor like bullets which I would collect in the baskets. The second part of you job is to mop up blood and this can be made hard because sometimes the blood can be very faded. Luckily there is a tracker which both tells you when your near blood and near body parts depending on which mouse button you click to turn it on. I personally like the fact that the tracker is not just a GPS that leads you to the exact location next bloodstain but instead a object that beeps faster the closer you are. Some may find it annoying in a world where games always tell us where to go even for the secrets but like Shadow Warrior, Viscera Cleanup Deatail has a feeling of less hand holding even while in an area that is less open than most games. For achievements there is of course the achievement for cleaning up the whole place and the achievement for getting all the hidden money in the game. There are 20 stacks of cash in the game that are usually in piles of body parts that you must put in a cash box iin order to unlock the achievement. While both of these achievements seem missable they are actually very easy to track. Just go to the door that has the device that asks you if you want to leave and push the button to activate and to leave. It will then tell you how much money you have and whether the rooms are all clear. If it says you have less than 2 million dollars and you left the room unclean than you simply push the button that you actually want to stay. Then just go through the rooms again once with the giblets tracker and then again with the blood tracker to find what you have missed. It's actually a very simple yet oddly entertaining game. For a free add-on to a game that I would say is worth it's price point it is an oddly entertaining experience that I oddly wrote a lot about in this review. You don't need to pick up Shadow Warrior to play this game but I highly suggest it since Shadow Warrior itself is a refreshing and gory FPS that actually has a fun sword mechanic.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is a game you will either love or hate, and this little gem serves as a great introduction to the main game of VCD. You are a janitor; and in this case you clean for the Zilla Corporation, making the temple that serves as the prologue for Flying Wild Hog's Shadow Warrior squeaky clean. For best results, play this after you finish the prologue; then you will either be in awe or upset at the mess you made.Like in the main VCD game, you're a janitor armed with only a mop, a 'sniffer', endless supplies of water buckets and biohazard crates, incinerators, and your own two hands to clean up the messes made by gore and gib happy protagonists like Lo Wang. The cleaning action that you find in the main game is found alive and well here. Even though most of the rooms are red, it is remarkably easy to locate blood and mop it up. Smaller items like tiny gibs and shell casings are kept to a minimum, sure to please longtime players of VCD who routinely come across piles of spent shells. Finally, in a move sure to make this an easy cleanup, you're given two incinerators and two mop bucket generators which will make the job go faster, not to mention that the game generously has spawned a number of buckets and biohazard crates waiting for fresh new janitors to utilize.So while you are cursing Lo Wang for making your life hard, this level adds a few new things to entertain you while you clean. First off, your janitor has a voice who comments on the messes and whistles to himself. He adds some character to the game (""Dammit, they used an automatic!). He lapses into repeats after some time but they never wear out their welcome. A radio in the first hall blasts the soundtrack to Shadow Warrior. Finally, SPOILER FOR SHADOW WARRIOR: remember how in the prologue Lo Wang walks into the hall with two million dollars? A side goal to cleaning up the temple is to collect all of the cash you find and toss it into the janitor's private trunk. It adds some variety to the clean-all-the-things formula that VCD is known for.  END SPOILERThe game is still not without its glitches, and the sniffer for finding missed debris or gibs is still hit or miss, but it's nice to see that the improvements developer RuneStorm have made to the VCD experience has created a fun little companion game to Shadow Warrior. For VCD veterans, it's another level to test their ability to clean.			"

												Can't complain too much since this came free with shadow warrior.  The idea is funny and this is nice to play if you're multitasking with something else or listening to a podcast.Something that would make this game a lot better would be to have a score screen after you finish beyond the money count.  Percentage of blood cleaned up, x/y items incinerated, % money found.   Stuff like that.  As it is now, it is frustrating to clean all you can see and not get an indication of how close you got.There is an item that acts like sonar for blood and items so you can listen to if you are close to something that needs cleaning but it's still searching for a needle in a haystack.  A visual guide would really help.  Even if it was just Aliens scanner style.I recommend cleaning just the first main room.  Cleaning the whole place isn't really satisfying because you'll still come up short.			"

												VCD: Shadow Warrior somehow makes cleaning up after Lo Wang fun. This is a supplemental game to go with Shadow Warrior that comes from the creators of the interestingly unfinished original game Viscera Cleanup Detail - learn about that game and you know what to expect here. You're a janitor tasked with cleaning up a location early from the Shadow Warrior game. The Physics can be a pain to deal with, making it hard to get items into buckets or furnaces, gibs flying around during clean up to make your job harder, and the worst are objects or blood spatters that end up in such awkward locations that you need to resort to cheating to find them. The devs should find a way to mitigate this necessity. That said this stupid but enjoyable experience can be finished in about an hour or two and while the game has an intentionally annoying factor to it, it feels strangely satisfying to do something so mundane in a video game world. I definitely recommend playing this or Santa's Rampage for some laughs.			"

												I initially thought this was some kind of DLC for Shadow Warrior. So, completely unaware, I booted up this little game. A half hour later my husband asks what I am doing, and I can only reply ""As far as I can tell, I'm cleaning up the bloody mess I made slaughtering all those people in Shadow Warrior!"" It reeled me in immediately. The game play is monotonous, but in a good way. Somehow it is completely satisfying to get every last ounce of blood, every random chooped off head, and every discarded katana into the incinerator. I will say there was one negative, and that is on my first play-through, a sword got stuck in the incinerator (like between the pixels in the side of it) and no matter how much jabbing with my mop, it wouldn't dislodge. It counted as an unfinished piece, and I was bummed out that even though I cleaned everything and found everything, I wasn't able to get credit for finishing.9/10 Would play again.... and again.

												While it may be considered cheating, this is actually by far the easiest 100% achievements of any game on Steam. All of the cash was acquired with 5-10 minutes using screenshots, and then the mess was all cleaned up within 30 seconds using console commands. 10/10 would walk around for 10 minutes, type two lines into the console and scroll up and down on my mouse for a few seconds again.Seriously though, it's a chill way to pass the time if you just want to relax and do something relatively tedious for an hour. 100% accuracy should really only be the goal for the achievements though. The game doesn't stay fun for long enough in one go to really aim for a complete clean every go-around. All in all, it's an interesting concept, and I can't really give it a thumbs down, because it's free with a game that I also would recommend. Worst case scenario, Shadow Warrior is really fun, so buy that game and give this a once over to boost your overall profile percentage by a point.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is a stand-alone one-level spin-off of a VCD game. In that game you play as Janitor who has to clean up mess after alien movies massacres. Casual fun and jokish simulator, but amusing. This one came out before main game was even finished in 2013 as free offer to owners of Shadow Warrior. They say that they will merge this one into main game soon.Oh, and it kinda has multiplayer too.So, to enjoy the game to the fullest, first you should load up Shadow Warrior and start up new game. Maybe even pick the highest difficulty. Then get into the first fight and take your sweet time slashing people with katana and throwing shurikens randomly at things. Enjoy the blood and massacre. Then once you beat the chapter 0, close the game and load this one up.Bloody hell, Lo Wang! Just look at all the mess that my alter-ego left!(No, don't want to say that VCD:SW copies massacre from main game, albeit it would have been awesome)Then classic gameplay of VCD goes on, cleaning stuff and then running around with beeper to find that last patch of blood that you would in the end fail to see and you will just mop up the spot around.It shows that this one is the earliest VCD on Steam. Unlike Santa's Workshop, there is almost nothing that can go wrong, no dynamite, no way to kill yourself. Some surface, mostly ceiling, thankfully are mess-proof, otherwise you would have never reached blood on the roof. So you can just move on and slowly clean it up for giggles after main game. Hm, main hero alo throws one-liners, not something I seen in other VCDs. They sound quite familar, albeit get old.Quite amusing. All yay for this free offer.			"

												What I like+the Janitor has a voice(!) and it's actually quite listenable+contains most of  the stuff you know and love about classic VCD+zilla doesn't need to know about his missing two million dollarsWhat I don't like-only one map, so you can't feed your inner kleptomaniac like the first game-desperately needs the updates from the first game (JHARM, slower object realigning), in case any potential physics SNAFU causes gibs to fly to the celing. THEN you'd have to end up finding the mystery stain and cleaning it up, bonus points if you can't find it with the sniffer.what I wish it had=the update from the first gamein conclusionbuy shadow warrior, you get this game free with it.

												Never did I think that being a janitor could be that much fun. Lo Wang's hilarious comments make it even better than the other viscera games. No bugs at all, which is fantastic, since bugs and glitches can hinder your progress in other viscera titles. The only thing that made it kind of annoying is that after you clean up all the blood, body parts etc. you need to search the room from top to bottom to find that last bloodstain that your radar detects but you can't see. This can take at least a half hour, even more if the stain is on the roof or somewhere difficult to reach. Don't expect replay value. I have only played it start to finish 2 times. If you want to do more cleaning, try Viscera Cleanup Detail. It has a variety of maps. 8/10			"

												If somebody came up to me and said: ""Hey, did you know cleaning up a mess can be fun?"" I wouldn't believe them. As short as this game is it's weirdly relaxing. The only thing that is annoying is that blood detecting radar - if you don't clean certain bloodstain completely and it's no longer visible right away the radar's beeping is not all that helpful. I spent 5 to 10 minutes trying to find it only to come across said stain upstairs of the spot I was in previously. But other than that spending a few dozens of minutes cleaning up mess that you, for a change, didn't create in-game is quite nice. Go play it, be the Mop Hero!			"

												Would have liked to play this honestly but it causes a VERY serious error in the system upon installation. At the end of the process it shows a message saying ""Your installation could not be complete. Same or higher version of.NET framework has already been installed on this computer."" and upon closing the message I get another saying :You are about to be logged off. Windows will shut down in 1 miinute."" All the programs shut down and windows reboots withen 10 seconds of the message. Upon restart the message pops up again and restarts again, and again and again. The only way I have found to fix this was control+alt+delete, going to Services and ending the Unreal engine one in task manager. VERY irritating as I thought that I had some kind of incurable virus and ran checkdisk twice before figuring out the solution on my own wits. And I STILL cant play the game. whether its Unreal or Framework thats causing the issue this needs to be fixed.			"

Swords, guns, ninja stars and punchy one-linersViscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is a 1 hour level themed about the newer Shadow Warrior game released in 2013. Though I never played Shadow Warrior I say others play it and it’s your typical Hack and Slash shoot em' up type of deal with lots of one-liners, loads of guys with swords, guns and excessive amounts of blood. How is this relevant to this game you might be wondering? Well it was produced as a Pre-Order Bonus for buying Shadow Warrior back when it released then given to Viscera Cleanup Detail buyers as well which as a fan of the game I great for us to get a little more content out of the game like they did with Santa's Rampage. Only this time there is only 2 achievements, both of which are very easy to get and leaves you with the rewarding 100% completion if you've completed the level and collected all the cash. The level itself is pretty simple, 2 large rooms with small connecting corridors connecting them as well as stairs to the upper part of each room which only have a little to clean up. Majority of the mess is in the large room and they provide you with 2 furnaces, 1 in each room so you don't have to keep running back which is nice!The cleaner takes the role as if he is connected to the Shadow Warrior game with one-liners such as ""Hey, I know this guy... Who's laughing now!"" when you pick up a head or ""I hope these gloves are thick enough"" when you pick up glass shards etc. This makes the level really stand out from the others and adds a little fun to the mix. He does whistle every now and then which get annoying because of the high pitch but its fine. 8/10Enjoyable 1 hour map, funny dialogue and easy 100% achievements "
