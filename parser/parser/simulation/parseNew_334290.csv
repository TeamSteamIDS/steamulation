												Initital thoughts:Ok.  This is my opinion of the game as of this very early stage.Pro:No sub feesFleets of ships on one account.Cons:Poorly balanced. Horrible sound / depth of musicHorrible UI.Nearly impossible to actually play the game and participate in chat.The closest existing game is Eve Online.  With that said, you figure that they would have gotten a 3 month sub to Eve and discovered what works and, more importantly, what doesn't work in a space MMO.  Over a decade of live and learn in Eve Online, and they have foolishly ignored those lessons and are repeating the EXACT SAME problems that CCP is trying like hell to work their way out of right now.The music is VERY repetitive and the SFX are Casio...  I shut both of them off in the first 5 hours just to save my sanity.There are numerous areas where the mechanics do nothing to drive the game.    There seems to be lots of grind just for the sake of grinding.The UI does nothing to improve the sense of community in the game.  Which is bad, because the community is the only content the game currently has other than mining or shooting NPCs.I have 70+ hours in it and I could (barely) fly the middle tier of ships.  Bear in mind that it would be horribly slow, but I could take a cruiser somewhere.I see potential, but there is a lot of work to be done before that is realized.  I'm bored already, which means that I'll probably go back to another game in the library.  This will removed a bit of content from the game.  I have serious doubts about the long term viability of this game unless they make some quick and effective improvements in the UI, leveling / balance mechanics and other items.The Dev team should sit down and do a marathon session of Extra Credits and then take a look at what they have crafted.I'd love to love Gates of Horizon, but it just isn't there.  (Sadly)Edit:  1/3/2015 2110hrs.  Yep.  Logged in and looked at the fleet of ships and just couldn't bring myself  undock and grind mining  so I could grind refining or grind NPCs...GoH uses type dependant XP.  So, you earn XP of a certain type by doing that activity.  Trading stuff gets you trading XP.  Making items gets you crafting XP.  Resource gatherng and refining get you resource XP.  COmbat gets you warfare XP.There is one (1) skill to to spend trading XP on.  Three to spend Resource XP on.  Like 5 to spend crafting XP on and a whopping 7 or 8 to spend combat XP on.In order to fly a cruiser, the mechanics of the game dictatat that I have Piloting LVL 10.  Which means I would have to grind another ~80k of skill points that I can only gain in combat missions and only at 100 ponts at a time.  Bear in mind that the fleet commands can go wonky, and if that happens your ship(s) die.  Quickly.  Since combat grinding doesn't net any considerable amount of money, if a ship dies, you have to go mining to earn the $ to buy another combat hull.To add to the fustration, the piloting aspect of the game mechanics in mining are the EXACT same as the piloting mechanics of combat in the game.  Orbit a rock and shoot mining lasers at it until it pops / the cargo holds are full or orbit a NPC and shoot combat lasers at it until it pops / you blow up.  The former nets you NO improvement to your piloting skill.  The latter nets you MINIMAL improvement to your combat skills, of which the piloting skill is one of like 8 skills that require combat XP points.End result for today after logging into GoH.  I just can't do it tonight.  I'd rather clean up gecko crap than grind more rocks or slowly warp between combat grinds.  So, for tonight at least, gecko $h!t wins over GoH...  I can't wait for an update.			"

												I've been playing GoH for the last day or so, and thought I'd compile my thoughts for anyone considering dropping a tenner on this little game.Let's start with the cons, I always want to know the bad thing about a game first so they don't surprise me.CONS:-Graphics: Not a lot to say here. The graphics are VERY simplistic. The nature of the game and the ease of projecting starfields sort of makes up for this. Personally, I don't find it a bother, but it's worth noting.-GUI: The GUI has some definite weaknesses. For instance, the chatbox is tiny, only shows a few messages at a time, and automatically fades out. This renders meaningful communication difficult at best. If I had one priority target for the developer, it would be the chatbox and community interaction UI. NOTE: there IS a full-screen chat option that works well but... it's full screen. Tough to play AND chat.-Sound effects: This one stood out to me. The music is all pretty good, but then I fired a laser at someone and thought I had just cruised into a disco. PEW PEW PEW go the beams in one of the cheapest sci-fi sound effects I've heard in some time. Oh well, turn the SFX volume down until they get updated. Minor problem.-Missions: There aren't really any that I've found. The game expects you to head off into space and start making your way with comparatively little direction. While I enjoy the ""make your own story"" approach to gameplay, a LITTLE bit of handholding as far as where to get blueprints, how to explore, where to look for new ships would have been nice.-Beginning: In the beginning you have one ship and one agent. The game is fairly boring as you let him auto-combat or auto-mine everything, watching him orbit. Once you unlock a second agent/ship, the game starts to open up more, but the first hour or so is definitely underwhelming.-Explanation: How does giving ships orders work? Why is the ""patrol"" option greyed out? Why can't I order a ship  to auto harvest without micromanaging? All of these are answers new players could use.Whew... still with me? It's time to talk about the good stuff:-Concept: I LOVE the concept of this game. Rather that playing a single pilot who flies around, you are a ""corporation"". You hire agents, select their abilities, send them on missions, level them up, change their loadouts, etc. It plays more like an RTS than any sort of simulator, so don't expect careful maneuvering.-Depth of skill trees: There are enough skills with tangible benefits that leveling up your agents becomes quite involved. You want to plan which agent will specialize where and make sure he is getting the right sort of experience. Agents can both pilot ships and man guns or other modules on board ships piloted by other agents so... do you want three light ships, or one big ship with a gunner and a shield operator? This is where the game really shows its potential.-Community Quality: The chat may not be the best, but those pilots out there that ARE chatting are extremely helpful if you just ask. Many of the game's shortcomings as far as GUI and explanation have been answered for me almost immediately using in-system chat.-Potential: I know, saying ""It COULD be so much!"" sounds like wishful thinking, and maybe it is, but this game has IMMENSE potential if you look at it as a sort of ""starter version"".BOTTOM LINE:At $10, Gates of Horizon is worth every single penny.It's not without it's flaws, but virtually all of those are easily fixed, and the fundamental core of the game works... if not beautifully, at least compellingly.Today I'm bouncing back and forth between GoH and Elite:Dangerous to get both my command AND my pilot fix.

												I'm only few hours into the game but it looks really promising. The game is a MMO Space Sim with a rts combat. Similar to Eve Online.The difference is that here, you're not only a pilot, you're a corporation. Of course you start with only one agents, but you can reach a maximum of 20, with the possibility to command a fleet of seven ships at the same time. The experience is totally sandbox, your objective is only to expand and gather power. Hunt pirates, mine ores, trade, explore, buy new ships, improve the equipments, find new agents, choose role and skills of your agent, you can do whatever you want.i'd like to play some more hours before writing a complete review, i'll update it when ready.Edit: I forgot. This game is not only on Steam, so the ""Steam population"" it's not the game population.			"

												I really like this game.For a beginner the game could be difficult to understand and it explains some of the negative reviews but I definitely recommend to have some patience and play a couple of hours to get into the game and appreciate it. In few words, you manage a space corporation with different agents and spaceships and you are completely free to do whatever you want: exploring star systems, mining asteroids, trading resources and fighting aliens or other players... and so on.Developers are doing a great work. They are improving the game month by month (and even more often) and they are ready to personally respond to players problems or requests.I really enjoy the gameplay and the micromanaging and the complexity of the strategies that can be implemented. You can choose a lot of details and completely customize each agent and spaceship (with an incredibly large skills tree and a huge amount of spaceship components sets). At the end, it is definitely a more complex game than it seems at the first peak. Funny and very promising.			"

												This game is more complex than it appears, and while the graphics might look minimal it seems to have a level of customization and depth that require time to master. Definitely not a casual game, with more in common with a roguelike than, let's say, Eve online or Starcraft.I tried the beta having fun with my friends and voted for it once it reached Greenlight and now I hope it reaches critical mass to express its potential.I see some negative reviews and I understand this game might be not for everyone, but I feel like recommending it to everyone that loves to micromanage and has fond memories of games like Syndicate.

												I've played almost 8 hours so far and this game is very cool.If you like spaceships, space, level ups, having multiple spaceships at the same time formed up together, and a friendly helpful community of people in game-- then this game is for you! There's some bugs here and there I've heard people talk about and one happened to me where I've been stuck but they'll get you out of it just write to the developers and wait a few hours if even that. It'l get better. 9.4/10 for me. And like someone in the game I saw said, this game isn't exactly for instant-gratification people. It's for people with strategy, focus, and people who like to chill and explore and work on their ship and make connections with people and go from there to get into some real good epic action. Sorry if this wasn't the most eloquent review but I think it's worth throwing in there. You play it yourself or research it more if you want to get better idea of what it's about.// Update 8/30/2015, 9 months later after writing this review //I've taken a few breaks from this game here and there, but always come back to it and get immersed again. It's the best spent $10 on a game I've ever spent.In-game my corp name is Knight Of Zero.We need more players but it's not a complete desert, and there are events and things to do. There's a consistent dozen or so of us at minimum every week all year so far. I mostly play on the .exe client and not through steam, so my real hours played is way higher than this. Probably in the thousands of hours. There's at least a few people that know most all the ins and outs of this game that will answer any questions you have about it in-game, me being one of them.			"

												Most important first, this game is fun to play!At the first glance, the game might seem simple, but it really is not. This does not mean that the game is hard to play, but that it is very diverse. You can play multiple roles, and since you are managing a whole corporation with many agents, you don’t have to limit yourself to just one.You automatically gain experience in those areas you play. If you mine, you get experiences in mining, if you craft you get experiences in crafting and if you fight you get experiences for fighting…This system of leveling, combined with playing multiple agents at the same time, gives you the opportunity to switch between different types of gameplay.The game is still heavily developed, in an agile type of process. All basic features have already been implemented and are of good software quality. New releases with new features are released several times a month! The support is very active, personally responding within hours, and really trying to help you with your individual problem and not putting you off with a prepared statement. Often you will find developers in the common chat channel, ready for discussions with you.So to sum it up, for a small amount of money you get a very good game, which might not be 100% feature complete, but is constantly improved and ready to play.

												The game is closer to an EVE / X3 type space sim than I first thought. I wouldn't call this a space sim actually, but its very addictive, for the price you really can't go wrong with this one, Watch some YouTube videos first to see if its got the kind of gameplay you like.I really like the skill progression tree, the fact there are numerious ship upgrades and the whole trading system. Haven't done any PvP yet, and I'm glad I wont be forced into it as there are neutral zones I can hang out in and mine in peace.			"

												The game is worth ten dollars, especially seeing as how it doesn't have any microtransactions.When you first start playing the game you might be disappointed because the interface appears to be very basic, but as you gain experience points and gain new agents (individual characters that you can hire each time you level and can fly independently or in a fleet) you will begin to see more depth in the game.There are three factions and three ship classes - scout, cruiser, battleship. Each faction only offers two ships for each class, but some of the ships do have some cool equipment slots and you can 'mount' agents to a equipment module so it's recommended to look at the Community Hub for a player guide so you can specialize your agents' attributes for fighting, trading, crafting or mining.I think I have seen up to 20 active players at a time, but players don't really interact with each other much. One of the pitfalls of this game is that there's not much to do outside of grinding levels and experience for new agents. Players can join groups known as 'holdings' and it's basically a guild system where you can own starbases and customize them. I think you can even get ore from planets in your zone of control. But there's not really that much to do with other players so it's kind of a singleplayer experience...The crafting isn't really deep enough to make you want to do it, though it is more effective to craft your items than it is to buy them. Game might get better, but you could easily squeeze 100 hours or more out of this game so it's worth ten bucks even if it never recieves any other updates. You should buy it.			"

												Fun game. Playing it with a few friends. It would be frustrating without friends to play with or someone to help you rebuild equipment when you die as you learn how much firepower and defensive recovery you need to kill certain enemies and lose ships in the process through trial and error. Some people seem pretty friendly and helpful in the chat. I enjoy automining. It lets me be productive, gain experience, and hoard ore while I'm doing something else or am offline and away from keyboard completely. Can't wait until they implement autohunting. I just wish there were more players to interact with.Ah so about the game. Basically it's an RPG real time strategy game.You are the Corporation. You start at level 1 leadership. Leadership level is your 'main level'.You then get 1 agent from the start and you go and do tasks that accumulate experience. There are 4 skill trees of experience.Crafting- Trading- Resource- and Warfare.Doing crafting tasks gets you craft exp which I think it's about 10% of it goes towards Leadership exp, and then you use your crafting exp to level up the crafting skills you want. Same goes for trading tasks, mining and refining tasks, and combat tasks. All of them raise towards Leadership exp but at a small fraction. Get enough exp for a leadership level up and then you can hire another agent. This means now you can fly 2 ships! You'll hit this point like 5-20mins within starting the game if you follow the tutorial guidelines. You can 'fleet' them together so that they attack the same target and stick together. What's really unique and cool about this game is exactly that, the fleets and multiple ship ownership.Fleets are also 'parties' as you know from other MMO RPGs. Your ships share experience in a fleet. The ships with the most Skill Points from Agents [and I think the more advanced ones hold weighter exp-extract power too than say an equal amount of SP of standard skills] pull in the most experience and then splits that amongst the agents on that ship even further. You can form a guild, in this game it's called a Holding. I'm in one called The Death Penalty with a few of my friends.We're training up quite nicely. The leader can command 2 battleships. So far I can only command a Cruiser and 2 scouts.And while there are some very nice people, there are some smug bullies too that pretend to be your friend or friendly.Try not to let them drive you off the game. I hear a few groups like that have driven off a hundred plus new and intermediate players. There are a lot of constructive things you can do for leveling up and bettering your economy and skills while not entering into Red space where you can be hunted down.7.8/10, would be higher rating if there were like a minimum of 10x more systems and players. There's only like 60 systems and like 30 active players per week?I'm still new but my couple friends who have played about 2 months now say it's been like this since they've started.I don't know what gives, more players get in here lol.:-)			"

												    new space mmo sandbox. slow paced at start but in this game progression gets faster the more you play.For instance the faster you mine the more xp you get so as you go the better mining skill and mining drill you have on your ship the faster you level.I would think that would work in combat situations as well the faster and more difficult things you kill the faster you level.    the game is still in early stages but there is trading and an economy combat and pvp in certain areas still needs some more work on content and still need to add things in the game.But for an indie game this is good space mmo.

												After 2000 hours in star Conflict I was burned out on that game and was looking for an alternative. GoH seemed like a possibility.But:- Micromanagement- Indirect Ship Control- Sub-par Graphics and graphical effectsYou don't directly fly/control your ship, as in most other space combat game, you just tell it what to do, just like in Eve (or maybe, to a lesser extend, Starpoint Gemini 2). Thing is: if you don't like Eve, you wouldn't like this either. If you like Eve, why would you consider playing GoH instead? And the player base seems to reflect that. 15 players on in 24h? This indicates that this game is dead.If you are looking for a space combat game, where you control your ship yourself in combat (like Wing Commander, Freelancer, etc.) you won't like this. If you want just pure Space Combat, Star Conflict may be more your thing, and if you want Trade etc. mixed in, possibly Elite:Dangerous.What I liked: the tutorial seems pretty good, without it you'd be completely lost.

												I really want to like this game but, in the current state, I can't. As many others have said, this game is all about grinding. A lot. And some more. I wouldn't mind to grind for experience and money if there were many different ways to do so but at the moment there are just a few options and after a week doing that, it just a chore, not a pleasure to play this game. There is a dire need of more content.Add that the AI and controls are not good... pilot would auto-hunt to their demise, there's no threshold setting to play around to ensure they flee back to base on time. Even more, once engaged in combat, they keep fighting no matter what, even after you order them to fly back to base (they completely ignore the order).So yeah... I'm going to uninstall it and hope that a year or two from now it will be better.Still, my respect and kudos for making a SteamOS executable. That makes me happy to have paid for this game despite it not being something good yet at this stage of development.			"

												I wasn't sure about this game because the graphics look simple and well they are simple, and i have been sucked into playing many crappy space games just because i really like those sort of games.  But after the purchase and some time playing this game im really hooked.  I would pay 10 bucks a month to play this game let alone its entirely free after the first purchase.  A unique game simple but gives you everything you need in a space mmo without the waste.  The devs are active and continuely fine tuning stuff while planning to add more.  You can control multiple ships at the same time in different systems.  You can be fighting with group while mining with another.  The menus and controls need a little work but with each patch the devs prove they are working on it.  This is a great game. There is some grind to it but it is fun because you can do many diff things at the same time and the community is very helpful.  Its  great buy worth every penny!!			"

												this game is alot like EVE but still don't compare GOH whit eve aldo they look very much the same eve exist longer EVE is sub based and as a damm long learning curve i hated that btw i just wanned to play and not read all day also difrent companny note that! so here is the point GOH is space sim where you don't control 1 but 20 pilots(agents) at the same time and the name that people who see when you talk to them its not the name of an pilot but the name YOU GAVE YOUR COMPANY AT THE START OF THE GAME.  this game is still yong so give it time they are updating it lots of times and as for the tutorial you get all the basic information you need from this tutorial in abaut 20 to 30 min and if you still have qeustions don't mind asking the community of this game is very helpfull so yea this is like a baby EVE but don't compare it to EVE ITS NOT EVE (divrent companny!) this is a yong space sim whit so much potential because people keep bringig up EVE the are exspeting to much from this wonderfull child give it time and atention and toghether as a community we will raise this child to the top. Couse seriously 10$ only and no sub what more are you asking for as of now the the game is very unstable and communaty slowly rissing again but as more people take intrest we can fix this have fare honest and logical trades on the market and recreate the feeling we all had in EVE like having huge fights over systems becoming fames traders or pirates, smugelers and afcourse you can rp SO HELP RASE THE BAR FOR GATES OF HORIZON also i'm a space freak just saying. OH AND DID I MANGEN THAT YOU CAN ONW MULTIBLE PLANETS AND BUILD STATIONS IN THIS GAME! if you like this review and wanne try see ye in space!			"

												(HOPEFULLY I CAN IMPROVE THIS IN THE FUTURE)at the rate the so called ""updates"" are going for in-game/gameplay improvements are going coupled with the fact there are STILL no missions/quest (for a half way decient XP and $ rates), boring npc fights, stupidly expinsive weapon/armor/shield and ship cost being way under the effort getting the money it cost to even buy the items,NO PvP (ive actually asked in game about   making a pirate type/pvp corp/guild like in EVE ansd was actuall told that some people have tried that and all the ""carebears"" in the game actully hunted those players down and basiclly ganked them over and over forcing them to log out),  honestly ive been playing this game on and off (tho mostly off) for a few months now, and the XP rates for the npc battles is AWFUL, the loot drops? HAHAHAHA ive seen better drop rates in a TEXT BASED mmo, the fact that npc ships drop ZERO $$ is just stupid, yeah theyve added a so called ""Alien Encounter"" but guess what, if you dont have a end game ship your boned...on everything, its like this game is only geared  for end game players only or people who spend REAL $$$ for in game $$$, there is ZERO content for new players in this game, a fact ive pointed out several times in chat, only to be told they'll get around to it... WTF?!?!?!  seriously?? yeah i know this games still fairly new but come on! Even WOW had STARTING CONTENT in its beta!!!! EVERY MMO has some sort of starting content!! DEVS PLEASE step it up! stop thinking only of the kickstart backers (if you had one) and think of the NEW PLAYERS! I like the idea of a free to play EvE style game but come on, we all know you can step up your game and start adding some REAL In-game content, add missions,better loot drop, maybe shields,armor,$ insted of just ore, now yes theres prob some of this in the End Game/high level encounters but theres NONE for new players. How is it possible to invest so many hours into testings, graphics, design and completely forget about gameplay? Multiplayer is absolutely dead and I can tell you why: game become boring after playing just few hours. Beauteful background, smooth animations and.. there is nothing to do. Yes, you do quests, you get levels and money, but it feels pointless.As for guilds/corps? yeah theres a few but theres ZERO any reason to really be in one unles they give you stuff, theres ZERO Corp/guild PVP content all the corps ive seen all just mine and kill npcs.Basiclly unless you buy in game $ for real $, know the Devs and are best friends (which is how it  seems every high level player is) or are friends with the highe level players, your basically boned. if you want to solo this ISNT the game for you, as i said ive been playing this awhile and soloing is HELL, it will take you MONTHS if not YEARS to get anything good if you solo. my rating 4 (just for the good controlls and the graphics) out of 10pros--Good Graphics that any laptop or PC can run-Easy to use interface-Friendly CommunityCons--No in game content (quest/missions)-low loot drops-you have kill npcs or mine, transport the ore to a station that will actually buy or refine it and find a place to sell that OR craft just to get $-stupidly expinsive ships/gear that far outweight the effort it takes to get $-All current encounters are for High level/End Game players-Its a MASSIVE grind/effort for VERY LITTLE reword AI is too primitive, Ship's design.. kek.. I have no idea what guys were thinking, best trading/mining ship hes such an ugly weapon placement, I wish designer to have a car with 5 wheels.. one at place of driver. Weapon selection is not that broad. Loot is pretty generic, from start of game you can get right into best tech sector.. where is slow exponentional progression???Not recommededi had high hopes but at this rate, im glad i got this game as a present, because i would never pay for this in it current form. :steamsad:			"

												WARNING! IT'S AN EARLY ACCESS GAME!Don't be fooled - this game is in ALPHA. Means early development phase with lots of features missing and lots of bugs.At first glance it looks very attractive. It looks simple enough. First achievements are rewarding and pretty fast to get. It only becomes obvious that this game is shallow and empty when you try to delve deeper. Suddenly you realize that you can't use better ships and components even if you can afford them. You can't craft anything decent yourself without putting couple of weeks effort into grind.And most of the time you will spend grinding. Grind, grind, grind. You'll waste huge amounts of time developing skills of your agents only to relize that you've done it wrong. Every new agent will become a pain in the bottom instead of a reward.User interface is awful. It makes you feel like a cripple when trying to manage more than one agent. Combat control interface is so limited you can't even designate roles for ships in your fleet. Switching between your ships is very slow and requires several clicks.PvP is non-existant. Everyone can escape a battle with a double-click. The only chance is jumping in on a single ship which is just out of a gate and it will take some time for him to accelerate or ganking AFKs.The gap between high level players and low level players is tremendous. And there is no any migration mechanism for high levels. You all boil in a single and very small pot. Universe is very small. Occasionally you'll be ganked by high levels (just out of boredom), occasionally high levels will wipe all asteroids right in front of you in a matter of seconds.Everything in this game is raw and undeveloped. Give it a year than come back.			"

												This game just simply isn't there yet to make it worth playing.  The ship mechanics and build strategies are extremely simplistic, the different faction ships are carbon copies mechanically with only cosmetic differences and there is simply not enough to do to make this even a sandbox.The only reason why I put in for this was the concept of operating multiple ship crew/ships on a single account as a gameplay feature.  Unfortunately this great idea is completely overshadowed by the game simply not being worth the time to play it yet.A lot of people compare this to that Darwinian experience, EvE Online.  If you want to play space battleship simulator (and don't mind paying a sub to do it) that is the place to do it.  Gates of Horizon is not worth your time just yet.			"

												IMO, Has a long way to go, but tons of potential.Bought this because cheaper than EvE and hoped the labor margin was much less for a good ship.I was wrong, still on the starter ship after afk mining for more than my 4hr playtime.Not much you can do until you can upgrade, and those upgrades are kind of minimal until you get a good ship.Micromanagement is also quite bad, as the whole interface was optimized for touch, as the devs are planning to release for mobile as well. The whole docking, disembarking, refining, selling, embarking, and departing process for a single ship takes at least 3 minutes as each process is on a single screen involving multiple clicks, and god bless if you have multiple ships to manage.Still a cool game, just wanted to give my 2 cents.

Too late! you forgot why you tried to take control of it in the 1st place!Stopped playing this game years ago when I bought it, now I remember why!Do yourselves a favour and spend the £7 on something useful like a diploma for designing a simple interface coz these guys obviously spent that on a couple of bottles of cheap ""make me blind"" Vodka!

												This game is Amazing! We just need more active players, but even if you play it like a singleplayer console game that has occassional co-op matchmaking teamplay or deathmatch, it's still great. This is effectively an RTS style MMO RPG. There are ""leadership"" level ups as well as agent level ups, and as you raise your economy and fighting strength you raise your access to higher tier weapons, armor, regen, engines, etc, and become more and more able to fight the couple quests/events for rare 'hybrid' gear that is elite equipment for near-maxed out agents in certain skill points.Like any RTS style game, the more familiar you are with everything in game and the quicker your muscle memory is to keep Every agent active and productive all the time in the most efficient and helpful ways possible, you will soar to the top fast and stay there and pick yourself back up after every disaster or loss. There are some great players here that provide great resources in tutorials and tips and even ship-building simulators to make designing the specs of your corp as easy and knowledgeable as possible without grievous weeks of totally unnecessary trial-and-error. The coolest part about this game is the diversity of spaceship builds and commanding a fleet [or 2, or 3!].The trailer video was well-done and I can tell this game is working it's way up there.Get in early so you can max out and bully the rush of new players while all the good grind spots are pretty open LOL...

They are still activly changing the game.  So far they have only changed things pertaining to PvE the developers seem to ignore the PvP side of things and focus on pleasing the carebares.  they have expanded the universe 3 times and all 3 times it has been ""safe space"".  When ""PvPers"" ask the developers about anything that has to do with PvP they are quickly dismissed and ignored.  If they were intending on working on PvP later they could atleast say as mutch.  The unwillingness to even say this leads to the belief that this will be a game like eve with no pvp.  for a game the almost completly emulates EVE why would they try to phase out the one thing that makes it so fun(PvP).therefore i have to change my recommendation from yes to a big fat NO!

There is a sonar submarine sound beeepingevery few seconds that drives you crazy- GUI is confusing. After hours playing I still had to keep clicking until I found what I want- I wasnt expecting 400 mill systems as Elite Dangerous (silly for me) and not more than 1 thousand for EVE, but 20-30systems really???????? A player said to me in the chat that it was according to the ppl base. So did they sell 300? Cause that would do 10 people on each system......is that right? You would expect more in Steam.....- After you done the tutorial, the complex GUI and the lack of missions, just leave you alone......Some people like....I dont.... "

												Edit 7/14/2016: This game is dead.  There have been no patches released in five months.  No more than ten simultaneous logins per month last I checked, probably around 5 now.  Since I wrote my original review they added some high-end PVE content and automated pretty much all PVE content, which officially made this game a login-and-minimize MMO.  So far as I know the staff has all left the company and the game is up on Steam for the purposes of generating a few bucks a month for the creator.  Original post:A lot of people will jump into this game thinking it's something like EVE Online, but with a one-time payment instead of a subscription fee (like Perpetuum but cheaper and actually space-based).  And initially, it feels much the same: You undock your ship and do things in space like shoot rocks and pirates.The similarities end there, however.  Understandably, as a very early MMO, there's a lot to be improved upon and mechanics that don't exactly work yet.  PVP is trash as there's neither aggression mechanics nor warp disruption, so catching somebody who either doesn't want to fight or wants to fight until it's clear that they're losing is impossible.  I've exploded at least a hundred ships in this game, and all of them were AFK or butterfingering their warp button.I understand that a small sandbox MMO doesn't need to have the same PVP mechanics as one of the largest, and GoH is doing a lot of things right (for example, you control a fleet of 1-7 ships instead of a single ship, which is a fun deviation from typical MMO design).  The main reason why I have to give this game a No recommendation, from the perspective of somebody who is primarily motivated by PVP, is that the Dev team simply refuses to answer questions about when or how they plan to make PVP feasible.  They are available around the clock, answering questions related to PVE topics, but when a PVP topic comes up, they are mute.  This lack of transparency is disturbing.Further, those who do PVP are treated with scorn by the overwhelmingly larger PVE community, who will chant ""Go back to EVE"" at any suggestion that the current PVP mechanics might be added or improved.  At first I thought it was funny, being an EVE veteran, and had heard much of the same whining from the EVE playerbase.  The difference here is that the ""powers that be"" - the few players who already own Battleships, which are a hard-counter to literally everything in the game - are themselves strongly against the improvement or addition of PVP features.  So it could be that you're looking for a game in which you mine, build, mine, build, mine, and build some more, and don't do much else.  Gates of Horizon would be your game.  If you are looking for a game with decent space combat, you're out of luck, and probably will be for the near, if not distant, future.			"

												Sounds like a good game..till you get into it and see it is just a EVE wanna be. With less of everything. Except the people that will make it their jobs to harrass you if you try to go into the red zones to mine and make more cash.Why a Dev thinks we needed a mini EVE i have no idea.  Adding the red zones and PVP to a small game like this just strikes me as a waste of so much effort to copy what is avaliable in a much grander and prettier fashion now, in EVE, if we want more of that.The only thing this mini Eve has going for it is no subscription fee. If you want a mini Eve with no sub and mini just about every thing Eve has then sure go ahead and get this.TLDR: You want Eve? go play Eve. This is NOT it. You want a nice relaxing non PVP game where you can mine and do your own thing? This is also NOT it i am sorry to say. "

												Sorry, but the game really isn't much at this point. The tutorial was very straight forward, but ship combat and mining are very basic. Pretty much just say attack or mine and it's automatic. I only played about an hour or so and jumped to another system to mine - but the asteroids wouldn't mine in a regular system with my starter ship (don't know why). I docked tried to sell some refined ore I had from the tutorial system,  but couldn't find a way to sell it from the market menu. A lot of hitting a back button to get around menus, not really well thought out... an after thought type of programming.It plays like an Early Alpha of a some home built game, not a real company released product.Pass... although it was cheap, it really doesn't do anything interesting.

												I was playing to Eve Online 5 days ago, and I didnt like too much, even I already uninstalled it. But finally I have found a fun space MMORPG game with no montly fees, where you can trade/combat/mining, and you can have various agents to do whatever you want, so you arent limited to only one character. I only have played a few hours and I find it very fun and addictive game. And this game was released a few days ago, so Its very nice start playing to a game since beginningIm editing it, because game looks dead now, no more updates in almost a year.			"
