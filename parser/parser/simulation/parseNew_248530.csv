												After reading what this game is about, I was disappointed in what I've played and not because the game is bad in any way or form. It was just plain boring in terms of gameplay mechanic, and the simulation aspect of it all. Yes I actually just beaten this game and I banged my head against my bathtub wishing this was a more complex simulator but instead is an arcadey, tedious, and casual game that needs way more work If you're wondering why I am not playing anymore of this game, This is how long it takes to beat the entire campaign. I think this game can be better than what it is and heres why. The game starts off with you looking at the map and seeing that there are 3 Large areas you can explore in the game, You'll start in Thailand then go to South Africa reefs, the last and final reef is the Bahamas all of which is decently sized and looks great.The gameplay is about spearfishing, Aim your speargun at a fish, shoot, and watch it automatically get reeled in with camera gameplay and treasure hunting thrown in.The missions consist of the player searching for treasures around the area, look around and shoot fish or find treasures for 5-10 mins, find specific fish, or take pictures of fish. These missions will repeat most of the time. You can kill so many fish but when it comes to sharks, turtles, jellyfish, morays, stingrays and so on the game will have a don't shoot box over them. When you do try to shoot them you'll shoot AIR. EMPTY AIR, even if the game says don't shoot I SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SPEAR THEM FOR THE HELL OF IT. If I do so I should also be punished for it instead such as being fined, or sharks coming back to bite me off. Something instead of empty air.The graphics to this game is quite nice and there is a good amount of fish to see and capture, the open area in the water and the underwatercave are pretty nicely done also and each of the maps are a decent size. The sound and music to this game is also nicely done HOWEVERThe mechanic and gameplay to this game is absolutely boring and unimmersive and also very arcadelike. It is very fun during the beginning of the game for about 30 mins then it just became repetitive and boring. Whenever you shoot a fish you'll acquire xp and gold which makes this annoying coin sound as if you're playing a slot game ruining the immersion of the game completely. After earning enough gold which takes about 5 mins or less of you swimming around shooting every fish you see in sight, you can then spend to upgrade 4 different things, your camera, more usb slots to take picture of fish, speargun accuracy and length, and your swim fins, once you fully upgrade all this. You'll swim at a really fast speed and any fishy you see  can easily be minced meat  basically because you'll become the son of poseidon himself. You're basically done and gold will completely become  useless except for spending on more usb slots to take pictures of fish. Hell even the picture taking mechanic is  pretty drysince all you need to do is point it as close to the fish as possible to take a picture as long as they are in the frame, the numbers also have to be 100% or you cant get points for taking thier pictures. Theres nothing in this game that can kill you except make you lose oxygen and there is nothing challenging about the breathing in this game at all, just swim to top and your oxygen can be filled fully without a single struggle, the only way you lose is when you forget that you're not diving but snorkeling.I think the game could do much better than this in future sequel. I want to be able to control the pulling of the fish in, Taking the spear out the fish or cutting the lines once I hunt them, drag them back to the boat feeling the weight of hunting. Instead of just picking up treasures from the ground with one button players should be forced to brush off the sand and figure out how to extact the treasure out carefully. Also the fact that I should be able to shoot any animal I want and in doing so will have a consequence on my gold or what not instead. If you're going to give players levels and XP in a game it should have a reason except that it was completely pointless. Right now this game has an awsome concept, but it needs to build on that concept and make itself AMAZING. I am not easily impressed because it was downright too simple, super casual.If you think I am lieing Go download the game and play it, Congratulations you've basically played 80% of the game for free.I also want to warn you guys of the dev pulling a fast one on bundle buyers which someone has come to my attention about.http://www.reddit.com/r/GameDealsMeta/comments/2e9yqd/depth_hunter_2_has_been_greenlit_get_your_steam/http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=saxg1h&s=8Long story short? Dev promised to try to get keys for people on desura etc, then turned around and rebundled game into a different name and in turn changed thier tune after getting greenlight. He didn't make a different game but took the same game and change its name so he doesn't have to give them keys. I would look up more about this company before you make your purchase in the future. This is something I do not condone from developers of breaking promises. Will not be buying anymore products in the future hell don't even send it to me for free.+Great Graphics+Good sized open area+Shooting fish is satisfying +Great amount of fish to shoot at+Sport is Extreme- Gameplay mechanic too simple, gets SUPER tedious- Can't shoot jellyfish, turtles, sharks, morays, dolphins, crabs, urchins, reefs, sponges and the list goes on- No multiplayer of any kind or score comparisons- Missions are downright tedious and boring, Find treasure, shoot a certain fish, or search out a fish with waypoints showing you directly where the fish is. Sometimes the treasure quest tells you to search in a 40km area then becomes boring as sin searching 30 mins on the ground clicking.My advice is to shelf out 10 more dollars, head to early access and get world of diving.

												There is not that much to tell about this game: it's a very casual fishing/diving simulator, in which you spend all of your time underwater, swimming gently along some nice (sub-)tropical settings, mostly reefs. The gameplay consists of either catching the required fish, or of exploring the surroundings - either by taking ""perfect"" photographs of several fish, or by searching for lost treasures. There is a small element of advancing through the game, since you gather experience and money with every catch or find with which you can buy better equipment.The main game consists of three diving locations, to which several can be added by buying the different dlc's. Every location can either be completed by fulfilling the different ""mission goals"" (which are mostly very basic), or can be just enjoyed swimming along in a free mode. This swimming, looking around and catching fish definitely has something very relaxing about it - this is the perfect game to play after a stressful day at work.But the game does lack some features which would make it more attractive - I'd love to get some more information on the different fish swimming around me, and the diving-simulator part really is extremely basic. Everything is being handled automatically, which in a real-world dive surely would not be the case. Some element of action or even tension would have been incorporated here.All in all, this is a game which offers just what it aims to do: a relaxing, nice experiencing, without any difficulty whatsoever. The Steam achievements are mostly easy to get, except for some overtly grinding ones (I don't expect too many people to spend 24 real-time hours underwater in this game).Recommended to anyone looking for a casual, relaxing experience.

												Got this as a mystery steam code expecting a big title but got this and you know what? This is kind of a personal little gem of mine now. I'm not going to praise it to be the perfect game, it's JUST a game you can sit down and relax to.Yeah, it hasn't got ""Ryse: Son of Rome"" graphics.It's not a massive blockbuster story like the ""Batman: Arkham"" series.It's not the generic fast action gameplay you get in first person shooters.It's just a beautiful game for you to explore.I highly recommend this			"

												Great game if you want to just kill some time and relax. Music is soothing, game play is simple. If you want to take pictures, hunt for treasure and just enjoy swimming around with the creatures of the sea then, this is a good game. However, maps are small and more maps are in the version of DLCs. You have limited underwater wildlife you can hunt for and sharks don't attack. In game upgrades are all purchased with the gold you find and the credits you earn while playing the game by hunting the fish and the like. I really can't give this a rating because, this is the first underwater game I've played of this type that I can remember. I'd have to play more of them before doing so. All-in-all, I'd say it's worth the time and money if you like these type of games. It does have a few missions in the game for you to accomplish so, it's not all just swimming around in the beginning. The missions don't seem to be mandatory but, completing them allows you to unlock more upgrades.Edit: As for more maps, I have 3 maps plus 2 after buying one DLC. Not sure how many maps there are in all though? 5 maps are a lot of exploring.  So, from what I can tell so far is, 3 of the maps are mission maps, the first three. The DLC maps are for exploration. 2 more maps come with this DLC: http://store.steampowered.com/dlc/248530/I would also like to add that, all the pictures you take in game with the camera, it has a feature in your menu to view them and/or, make the as desktop wallpaper. That's cool. :)			"

												A very relaxing game where you are given various ""missions"" in each of the deep water areas of the world. Upgrades are available and, if you perform well on the missions (or catch enough fish or find treasure) then you can afford new things like longer spools for your spear, more accuracy, longer diving times, etc.The diversity of the things you can do (from photographing reefs and specific fish to a ""catch as many as you can"" timed mission) the game keeps you stocked with things to do as you listen to relaxing music and explore the ocean's depths.Definitely recommend, especially if you're looking for a relaxing game.

Pretty diving game without long-term motivation First I tried to play this game in German, but there are sooooo many translation mistakes - partly hilarious, but I switched to English. As I said the graphics are pretty. The controls are ""okay"". You can try to play this game with your controller, but this is hard. The assignment of keys is unintuitive. You pick up things with the same key, which you use to take photos or shoot your harpoon. The length of the story is 3-4 hours. I got nearly all achievements within 3 hours, but all Trading cards dropped after 4,3 hours.Overall this game is way too easy. There is no challenge. I want a game which is more like the diving sessions in Assassins Creed IV (+ hunting fish). This would be a great diving Simulator. I will NOT spend my time to collect 500 coins or 100 treasures, hidden somewhere on each map in this game. Same with my 2 remaining achievements: ""Spend 24 hours under water"" WHAT THE F*CK! ""Swim underwater for 100km"" NOPE!This is an entertaining Diving Simulator (for 3 hours!) Don't try to get all achievements. This is frustrating.Buy it in a bundle, or while it's cheap.6/10			"

												Should be titled ""Being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to fish simulator""Swim around and spear fish in a little reef. Hunt for treasure. ""We've got no idea what artifacts could be down there but here's 10 very specific items you need to find, oh yeah one of them looks exactly like the foliage. No, we don't care if you pick up fifteen other artifacts, we want this one"" and generally faff about.You can't shoot crabs but they insta-aggro the moment you come around. You can take pictures of stuff but the game had no regards for composition of the photos. Just ram the camera into them and snap.Probably the biggest sin of them all though. MOUSE ACCELERATION.It's unable to turn off and it's spastic. Also, sometimes you'll run low on oxygen (The game doesn't tell you that you can surface to get more air but you can) and if the game wants to it'll insta-fail the mission but other times it'll just hover a 1% and allow you to swim underwater forever.Yeah, Don't get it. I'm glad I got a Greenlight Bundle key.			"

												This is a very pleasing game. As casual as can be...nothing really attacks you or anything (except for those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crabs, but whatevr, lol). Basically, you swim around catching fish, finding treasure, and taking pictures. You can automatically turn those pictures into screen savers if you like, which is a nice feature. You can upgrade your various gear as you gain cash via all the aforementioned activities. There are also quests which are basically catch x amount of this type of fish, find this many treasure in an area, etc...Essentially, the game just gives you a nice relaxing experience with soothing music and beautiful visuals, with some stuff to do to ehance the experience. You can unlock free roam via completing areas, which then gives you total freedom to just check stuff out.At this point, I have finished all the area quests, and probably will get the 95% accuracy achievemnt in my next playthrough. That said, I'll probably keep this one downloaded for those times where I really dont know what I want to play or just want to unwind a bit.Very much recommended. Probably 8 speared fishies out of 10 with a photo of a blue whale mixed in.			"

												This game is very beautiful! It's not very hard (which I enjoy), it's fun and has easy gameplay. It's relaxing and a great time killer.You have missions to do, like hunting specific fish, taking pictures and looking for treasures. You get 3 maps. They are short though. Played for almost 3 hours and already finished 2 maps. Got this game on a bundle and no, it was not the reason I bought the bundle. But I'm really enjoying it and I'm glad it was part of that bundle. It's not worth the full price (at least in my currency - I believe), but it's worth on sale.I added the DLC to my wishlist. Even tought I wanted to buy it right now, I won't. It's really expensive (again, at least in my currency). Will wait for a sale. Will buy this and all future DLC's for sure.Do hope they add more DLC's and achievements. Suggest you watch gameplay videos before buying. This game is not for everyone.I'm really having fun so I recommend it!			"

												First-person underwater fish-stabbing simulator Depth Hunter 2 by indie developer Biart recently jumped off the deep end over Steam. The game offers players a chance to hunt for sunken treasures, swim with fishes, take pictures with fishes and, if they are not careful enough, sleep with fishes after forgetting to check the oxygen supply due to being mezmerized by the scenery.Now, if your idea of a fun underwater hunting simulator includes the incessant micromanagement of equipment and inventory coupled with graphic depiction of harpoons being torn out of the fishes' bodies, then you'll be disappointed by Depth Hunter 2.The game is definitely not a hardcore simulation, which is a good thing if you want to enjoy the underwater view, relax, and go for some carefree treasure hunting or a fish murdering spree without bothering yourself with the fact that you can't see your body or legs. The easiest way for you to see if you'd want to immerse yourself in Depth Hunter 2 is to download the demo. Go on, dive in, get in the swim of things and see for yourself if this game is worth your time and money.			"

												This game is nice, when you're aware of what the features are. Maybe I should start with describing what this game is NOT:- It is NOT a realistic diving simulator.- It is NOT story-rich.- It is NOT challenging.So, what is Depth Hunter 2 then? It is perfect to relax. You start your tour on your boat, you get a short mission briefing and then you start to dive. You take a harpoon, a radar and a camera with you. To be successful, you have to catch some special types of fishes, find loot on the ground of the sea or take high-quality photos of reefs or animals. That's all. When you have finished all missions in one location, you unlock the next. There are 5 locations in general which vary slightly one from another. The surroundings are nice to watch, but could have been detailed more. The underwater world looks vivid, though.As I mentioned before, the game isn't challenging - you should not expect too much; The price of 15 bucks is way too high, wait until it is on sale and you can grab the complete bundle including all DLCs for around 5 €/$.As a result I can say, this game is perfect to relax and to bowl down some simple quests while you're enjoying some nice underwater-surroundings.

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss"" PROS:- Not many diving games out there so offers something different- Casual game which is rather relaxing- Lots of trading cards if your into that type of thing.- Almost a sort of hidden object game- Has DLC to expand your experienceCONS:- Poor animations, reeling in a fish is just laughable considering its the main mechanic- Frustrating to catch some fish, this provides the only challenge of the game but it proves annoying rather than enjoyable- Overly simplistic, from the menus to the difficulty, nothing attacks you either.- Its very monotonous and boring, you catch fish and take pictures with very little variety.VERDICT? Its an okay game but I can't recommend it, its just a bland game which fails to do anything well so its not worth your money.			"

												Depth Hunter 2 is a relaxing game where you explore the fishy depths. Its like a walking simulator only for diving. Instead of just swimming around, there is treasure to find, or take pictures, and catching fish is fun too. The world feels very alive, the way the fish move seems very well done. Taking pictures is very rewarding there is an excellent feature of being able to make them your desktop as well. There are multiple places to visit for diving that have many attractions under water from ships, to planes, all kinds of things that make exploring fun. I rate this 9/10. But to be realistic, the game's price is about 8,99$/eur "

												It's not easy for me to write this review. If that game didn't have such beautiful underwater world, I would say that is nothing more than crap. But it has so stunning graphics and everything looks and move so natural, that I couldn't stop just looking around. This is definitely the nicest underwater world I've ever seen in video game. But this is still a game. So what can you do as a gamer? You can catch fishes, take photos and look for treasures. All three just suck. Gaming part is boring and there is no challenge at all. And because we are all gamers and we expect good games, I can't evaluate this game in different way.Why do I have so many hours in that game? Because to get last achievement, I had to turn it on for 2 bloody nights - that's ridiculous!VERDICT:If you are a real gamer and you are in a mood to play something challenging, avoid this title for all cost.But if you are a fan of sea diving or just want to enjoy really beautiful nature and make some cool screenshots, think of thumb down you see, as thumb up and take it without question, you won't regret that.Like this review?

												I am not sure whether this game is underrated or misunderstood and misrepresented.  If you think of it as a game it is probably 7/10 due mainly to its great graphics.  If you think of it as a casual diving simulator it is, in my opinion at least a 9/10.  The gameplay sends you on quests that you must finish to unlock other diving areas.  The quests include spearfishing, photography, and treasure hunting in open ocean and caves.  You also gather coins from the ocean floor as well as from the quest rewards in order to upgrade your speargun, camera, fins etc.  In my opinion the neatest part of the game is the photography.  It is fun swimming around trying to get a great pic of a beautiful fish with a background of a wreck or coral reef.  Then later you can go through your album and make them your pc background.  One of the main cons I see to this game is working towards a perfect game.  Three of the achieves are going to be a grind now that I have run out of quests and new dive spots to unlock.  Though living as far from the ocean as I am I will probably never go scuba diving.  So for 15 bucks this was a very fun experience for me.The graphics are lovely.  The music is a bit repetitive but peaceful and pleasant.  It is a great option for those who do not want their children playing shoot em ups and don't mind if they spear fish.  It is not gruesome.  The sharks don't bite.  So if you are looking for a fun dive experience I would give it a try.			"

												It's basically an aquatic themed hidden objects game in 3D.Story / missions are trivial. Don't upgrade your radar, so that the locations of treasure items don't get spoiled. Prolongs gameplay.Tricky end-game+ is finding all the coins which don't show on the radar.In the end it's like watching fish in an aquarium (in a positve calming way).Has nice underwater locations to discover/explore (coral reefs, caves, wrecks, ruins etc.)All in all nice little game. Perfect for 15min zen meditation chill out before going to bed.Buy when on sale. Only two DLCs give you additional 3d locations.			"

												Missions can be easily bugged and you might have to waste another 30 minutes to find things which are not there. For example, there's a quest which tells you to find a unique fish and catch it, which there's only ONE of it. If you have caught it already before the quest is active, during former quests, you will never be able to catch that ♥♥♥♥ing fish. Also, there's another quite similar example which can occur while finding 10 treasures quest. You'll never be able to do that quest either if you get one of those treasures before the quest is active.About rest of things, graphics are fine for indie game and gameplay might have been better but it's okay too. Story NONE.Edited for correcting grammar mistakes and mispellings.			"

												Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive is a rather interesting game. It is meant to be a diving simulator, but is more of an underwater fishing, treasure-hunting, and exploration game. The landscapes are absolutely beautiful, there are Three major locations around the world for you to explore and each has various missions you can complete. I spent the majority of my time playing, scouting for gold coins on the ocean floor and looking for relics. The music is relaxing, the scenery is calming and peaceful, this was a very enjoyable game to play. The underwater hunting aspect of the game, or spearfishing, is overly simplified I think. I would like for this to have been more difficult. Killing so many fish in one area should attract predators, but in this game there are none, taking away a lot of the challenge. The closest thing to predators the game offers are crabs. Still, it has it's positive qualities, the underwater scenery being the biggest one. You can take pictures underwater and just explore if you are so inclined. Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive was worth picking up.			"

												I've played for two hours straight. It was overall pretty fun, but I felt that there were a few things that were a bit tedious or would be better if they were different.- The game is more arcade like than a simulation, you can continuously spear fish rapidly without running out of spears or space to keep fish- At one stage I spent 20-30 minutes unable to find required objects which was tedious, but otherwise I didn't really have a negative experience.

So you start in the first of free diving regions, Thailand. Each region is an large open underwater area. Within each region you will be given one specific objective after another as you complete them e.g. spear specified fish, photograph seabed, find treasure and so on. You are free to undertake these activities even if the aren't specified in your current objectives e.g. you can take photos and find treasure freely even if your supposed to be hunting.-----You have limited oxygen, running out will cause you to fail your current objective and have to restart it. That can be annoying if it was a long task, oxygen levels are easily resupplied by returning to the surface briefly. While no creatures will hunt you down and attack you, having contact with certain creatures will reduce your supply of oxygen e.g. spiky sea urchins, crabs and jellyfish. You can stay down for quite a long time i.e. 8 minutes underwater without breathing so it feel's more like you have a small oxygen tank that you can magically refill in a matter of seconds at the surface. I'm not sure that real divers would stay down for more than a few seconds or minutes especially if they are making such frequent dives. There really wasn't any challenge to managing your air supply.-----I found that I didn't really have to carefully stalk and take aim at fish while hunting. So this activity wasn't really satisfying in this way. You can pretty much spear the next fish the moment after you hit the last one and you have unlimited spears. Speared fish will be pulled towards you by the line of your speargun or vice versa depending and how big they and they will disappear when you have contact with them. There is also no limit to the amount of fish you can take and you don't need to return to your boat or anything to offload your catch. Their are certain creatures which you are unable to spear such as manta rays, sharks and those little Nemo clowns. But I basically swam around and slaughtered hundreds of fishes. Which was fun but didn't really offer any challenge.-----When I found my first gold coin I was very excited. I couldn't find anymore than that for while. So at first I thought it would have been challenging to find gold coins. However I soon found that there a actually many areas which have a fairly lot of gold coins scattered on the seabed. So I think it was actually too easy to find them and it was no longer satisfying. Also there aren't piles of coins. You have pick up each one individually and they didn't reward me with much cash or experience. Spearing fish provide with dramatically more experience and cash and it was very easy. So there wasn't actually a lot of point in finding the coins other than the possibility of completing an achievement.-----Aside from coins there are also artifacts and other valuables to find. I think the first thing I found was the 'Goblet of Doom'. I thought the idea of finding uniquely named objects was kind of cool. Unfortunately most most of the objects I came across afterwards only had generic titles. At one stage I had an objective to find 10 items of treasure around a certain location. The last items took me a long time to find and I was swimming around the same spots again and again. This became tedious, I think that task needed a time limit as some of the other missions do.-----You switch between your spear-gun and the camera using the mouse scroll wheel. I had to work this out myself. I don't remember an receiving an instruction from the game. A successful photograph requires 100% quality, which is achieved by swimming close to sea creatures at the right angle.-----Spearing, finding treasure and photographing rewards experience points and cash. Reaching higher experience levels rewards coins and at higher experience levels you seem to be rewarded increasingly more cash and experience for spearing or photographing fish and finding treasure. If you return to your boat you can purchase upgrades for your flippers/movement speed, spear gun, camera and oxygen supply. There isn't a huge selection and I basically acquired the best gear after playing for around an hour and a half.-----In main menu you can access a page that details all the fish that you have speared with kill count. Average weight and length of each fish is also listed even though they all look the same.Overall the graphics look good. I think effects used to make it feel undersea were adequate. There was a reasonable variety of sea creatures. The seascape look's nice and there you will occasionally come across sunken ship wrecks, planes etc. These don't really tend to have a lot detail when it comes to interiors. I was hoping that there would be an underwater cavern system and towards the end of my two hours game-play I found one. It appeared to be fairly extensive and maze-like which was cool.So a lot of the activities would probably be more satisfying if they were more challenging or just a bit more interesting. It's too easy to kill fish, resupply your oxygen and find coins. The greatest danger in this game for me so far was getting distracted and forgetting to take ten seconds to go up for air. If you didn't have an excessive oxygen supply every task in the game could be much more challenging. Simply giving all artifacts you find unique names and maybe some as well as making gold coins less common and more valuable would be an improvement. Overall this game was reasonable but I think it could be changed to be better.Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			"

												Super relaxing underwater hunting game.Beautiful graphics and soothing sound. Splash around hunting fish, seeking treasures and taking photographs in several nicely themed locations. That is very much all there is to the game. Air level warnings give you ample time to reach the surface and beyond a couple of barely damaging and easy to avoid hazards, you may swim and explore at your leisure.Achievements are very easy to collect with just one taking some time to acquire, though you may also pick that one up if you take your time with all the others.Recommend for crayon eaters, fish haters/lovers and those wanting a little Zen between games.

												Depth Hunter 2 was a surprising game that I was not expecting to enjoy. I'll admit it looked really boring and in a sense it was as there is not much variety in the actual gameplay - you catch fish, hunt treasures, take photographs, solve a couple of very basic puzzles and explore the ocean floor and that's it.However, saying that, it was SO relaxing! The scenery was beautiful, the background music was lovely and it was just a nice way to chill out for an hour or so after lots of shooting people in the head in other games!I got it in a bundle so only paid pennies for it and I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I'd recommend it to anyone who can pick it up cheaply and wants a nice relaxing break from all the hectic games out there.

												Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive is a very fun game in my opinion. This is a lower budget indie game, but the simplicity of the gameplay coupled with the good graphics engine, makes this a decent experience.Essentially you hunt fish and collect gold/treasures from the ocean floor. You can also explore wrecks throughout the 3 fair sized levels. You can spend gold to upgrade your character’s equipment. Faster fins, a better camera, more accurate spear gun etc. Nothing too “deep” here, but it still adds to the gameplay. There are several fish types and other hazards to avoid. It’s just a shame that only a handful are capable of being hunted. I was really hoping to hunt a giant sea turtle or Mako Shark :(  Lastly, I really enjoyed the ambient music. It gave me a relaxing escape from the usual shooter games I play. You could call this game a snorkeling simulator because that’s essentially what it is (and I’m perfectly fine with that). "

												""Shot a turtle in the face with a spear."" 10/10Being a huge fan of water in video games, this game immediately appealed to me. Water can be quite impressive when rendered correctly and seeing how new games handle it always seems to interest me; something that began ever since I first laid eyes on the 'Nintendo 64' version of 'Wave Race'. Then I came to realize that the 'Depth Hunter' series were originally mobile games with micro-transactions up the wazoo and I was immediately turned off. Surprisingly enough however, this game is actually quite enjoyable if you're in the mood for a serene experience with a minimal challenge, and don't worry, none of those pesky micro-transactions made their way into the PC version, either.The atmospheres in 'Depth Hunter 2' are gorgeous, the music is relaxing, the game  works with a gamepad, and the controls and character animations are quite realistic in feel. There are five areas to hunt within and challenges range from snapping photographs of creatures and shipwreck, to hunting fish and collecting treasure at the bottom of the ocean. An XP system is in place as well, although I'm not quite sure what it does, but it's always nice to see a character leveling up. Purchases can also be made to upgrade equipment, such as a larger USB stick to hold more pictures, a longer spear, bigger oxygen tank, etc. So there is some depth to the game, although minimal, no pun intended.The two downsides to this game are the fact that the campaign is short and can be beaten in a few hours, and the lack of any story whatsoever. Personally, the lack of story didn't bother me at all though, as I don't really see how the game would benefit from one. In conclusion, I can definitely see why people don't like this game, but for me, sometimes it's fun to just turn on a game and admire the atmosphere. So if you're looking for something with some action or a challenge, look elsewhere. The price-tag is a bit high, so I would wait until this game goes on sale to pick it up, but other than that 'Depth Hunter 2' is quite enjoyable after a long day with a nice cold beer.			"

												Unless you are specifically looking for a game that is very casual, relaxing, and underwater, I see no reason why anyone would or should purposefully buy this.  I got this as an addition to a Bundle Stars pack and figured I try it out since I like games like Subnautica and Farsky.  This game is not like those at all.  It's more like Cabela's hunting games without the excitement.There are only three maps and you get missions to accomplish in each one.  They basically boil down to 'kill X number of fish' and 'find X number of treasures'.  There's no challenge to the game at all except your own patience with it.  There's sharks, and they swim away from you in fear.  The doesn't allow you to shoot anything besides specific fish also.			"

												The write up of the game implies more than the game offers.  I figured the sharks would be predators.  Biggest predator in the game were the crabs where if you get near them they drain your O2 making you surface more often.    I thought the first level was just ""intro"" and as the game went on it'd get tougher - nope.  It's extremely casual.  Swim around, shoot fish, collect gold coins off the ground and look for lost pieces of artwork, take a few pictures of fish.  I personally didn't mind it, kill 10-15 min a day every few days, but definitely wouldn't pay more than a 1$ or 2$ and I could definitely see many people disliking the game especially if they got it thinking it was going to be adventure based.

												The short of it... I love this game! It's the first one in a while that I didn't quit after 12 minutes to hopefully get the first card drop. I have never gone snorkeling or diving so this is a new experience for me. The scenery is beautiful although I think it could use a little more color. I wasn't crazy about the spear fishing but the photography is fun once you learn how to do it (a little instruction would be helpful) but the best part for me was the treasure hunting. Picking up gold coins and treasures is great fun for me! The only issues I have with the game so far are that: 1. the mouse is hard-coded for right-handed people which makes it awkward for anyone who has the mouse buttons switched around and2. running out of air causes a level failure and the whole level must be repeated.#2 is an issue for me because I get so engrossed in the game that I forget to surface for air. For anyone trying this for the frist time... P is for photography (camera) and H is for harpoon (spear gun).  If there is a sequel, I hope the devs will consider us lefties in the next one. But, all in all, a great game!			"

												I went into this game with mixed expectations. On the one hand I utterly adore underwater games and their setting, on the other I hate hunting in every way, shape or form.What I figured would happen is that there would be the fun underwater exploration and swimming around competing with the actively hurting fish aspect and that depending on which part was more prominent I'd give it a positive or a negative review...Turns out it went a different way.There are three locales in the game, which you'll go through in order. Each has a variety of missions... which you'll go through in order. They range from catching specific fish, to catching as many fish as you can in a specific amount of time (no minimum amount for success) to finding treasures or taking pictures.To summarize, these are... lacklustre. At no point did I feel challenged, engaged or even relaxed by these missions.The hunting aspect of the game is present, but forgiveable as there is no blood, no real skill involved and as long as you're super close to the fish not even any animations... I'm not sure that's a good thing in general, but for me it was.Progression through the missions as well as capturing / photographing fish and finding coins and treasures give you money and EXP. Money is used for upgrades which make you swim a bit faster, require you to go up for a air less and to make the fishing and photographing slightly easier.I will always approve of an upgrade system, and I'm glad it's there... but I wish it would do a bit more. It's easy to get everything and the levels you gain do little more than unlock a few of the upgrades and then just give you bonus coins, and if I were to play a level on somebody else's profile and then be asked if he or she had all of the upgrades or none of them I wouldn't be able to tell.Lacklustre is the name of the game here, and I can't say I recommend it.It's better to just wait until World of Diving makes it out of early access.---I did not factor this into the review, but I felt it was relevant to point out that there has been some criticism towards the developer regarding some of their business decisions.Depth Hunter 1 was part of several game bundles and had promised Steam keys once the game made it here, instead it hasn't and we get Depth Hunter 2 instead which is supposedly practically identical.Seemingly critical updates (like adding a radar for finding treasure that is strewn about) and more than the original 3 levels are locked away in DLC (review of that here).I'm not saying you shouldn't buy the game because any of that, but be mindful of it.

												Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive is a very calm and ambient spearfishing game. Its very straighforward, you get 5 areas to hunt (without dlc) with objectives (find and spear this species, find these treasures in this area, take a photograph of this species or location) and you scuba into the depths of the ocean that your in to complete the objectives. A very enjoyable game if your looking for a serene experience with small challenge. The controls are very tight, where you aim is where the spear goes and the swimming is surprisingly easy to control.The visuals in the game are very pretty with the changing landscape, the different species of fish and the occasional wreckage here and there which adds greatly to the feeling that your actually in the ocean. The soundtrack and the ambient noise in the game is incorporated very nicely that they complement each other, but if your in the mood to only hear the ocean you can change the preset. The sounds do immerse you into the atmosphere of the ocean, which is a good bonus for me. Pros: Beautiful game, great atmosphere, different locations and challenges. Cons: A little on the short side, but you can replay the levels and complete the achievements which adds to the total time played. DLC add more locations and species. If price is a turn off, you can complete the base game with 100% achievements and buy when its on sale.9/10 If you've been scuba diving this will bring back memories of that experience. Great atmospheric game.			"

												Bought this on sale for about 3 pounds, had fun for 3 hours. That's less than I'd pay to watch a movie or go to the pub for 3 hours so I'm not complaining.After 3 hours I'd got full upgrades (in fact I got most of them after the first mission after spending time collecting coins) and had played all the modes the game had - fishing, treasure hunting, taking photo's. Past that, other than more of the same on different maps the game was done for me. I guess it's possible there was a whole different game waiting to be unlocked after another hours worth of play but I doubt it.I think the main draw with this is the novelty of playing underwater (seems to be one of the next big things from what I can see). If that's what interests you then I'd try Subnautica instead. Otherwise, at sale prices this relieves a boring weekend afternoon - If I'd paid full price this would have been a negative review.			"

												Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive is a casual and relaxing first-person diving/snorkling game where you explore 3 different locations (Thailand, South Africa and the Bahamas) to search for gold and treasures, hunt fish or take photos of the underwater life.StoryThere's no story present at all. From the main menu you pick the first of the 3 locations and then start on a boat where you receive your first task. Once you accept it, you spawn underwater and have to complete the task in order to get the next one. Quite frankly, not every game needs a deep and meaningful story, but at least some sort of introduction or explanation who you are, why you're there and what you do there would have been nice.VisualsThe game was originally developed for iOS and the PC version is pretty much just a port with a couple graphics settings (brightness, resolution, fullscreen, image quality, sun shadows, SSAO, water reflection and vsync) added to it. Personally, though, I have not much to complain about the graphics. You surely can't expect next-gen visuals, but there are quite a lot native/PC-exclusive games that look much, much worse than DH2:DD. Especially the lighting works really great in the underwater scenario and some areas, such as the underwater caves with sunrays shining through cave openings, look outright beautiful.AudioThe music is really good and perfectly fits the relaxing underwater atmosphere, however, the tracks tend to abruptly end when the next track starts playing, so this can be a bit annoying at times, but it's not much of a big deal. What's a real immersion killer, though, are all the other sounds such as the chime when you catch a fish or the coin sound when you pick up treasures or coins. They're way too loud compared to the music and the enviromental sounds and become extremely annoying after a while - especially, when you're on a hunting spree.GameplayThe gameplay is fairly simple and easy to get into. Since this is more of an arcade-y game rather than an actual simulation, you don't have to worry about anything else other than your oxygen level, which can be replenished by simply swimming to the surface and taking a deep breath.There are basically 3 different 'categories' of tasks in different variations: Hunt species, collect treasures and photograph species or the enviroment. The hunting and collecting tasks sometimes come with a time limit where you have to hunt as many fish or collect as many treasures as possible within 5 or 10 minutes, however, since the game rewards you for the task itself only and doesn't take into consideration how many fish you have hunted or how many treasures you have collected, you might as well just hunt 1 fish or collect 1 treasure and let the time run out while you do something else. Since there aren't any highscores or leaderboards, you don't know how you did compared to your previous timed (treasure) hunt, so there's absolutely no point in trying because there's really nothing to win here.For every action (hunting, collecting, photographing) you earn XP and money. While you can waste your time and search the ground for coins or treasures, hunting fish is by far the easiest, fastest and most profitable way of earning both XP and cash and if you do nothing but hunting for the first couple minutes of the game, you will have amassed enough money to completely upgrade your fins, spear, oxygen and your camera, so you don't need to worry about them later on. So much for long-term motivation.The XP, though, is entirely meaningless and might as well not be there at all. When you level up, you get a small cash bonus as a reward, which isn't more than a nice gesture because you can easily get that amount of money by hunting 2 or 3 fish in a couple of seconds. Since you don't have any stats that could increase when you level up, this feature probably just got implemented to give the player the illusion of progress but ultimately fails to.While the tasks are fun in the first location, you quickly notice that you're really doing nothing else than the same things over and over again across all 3 locations, so this can get a bit boring after a while. Swimming around to look for interesting stuff is rather pointless, too. The locations aren't really big and apart from a plane or a ship wreck, there's really not much to see or explore on any of the 3 locations.The game does feature a nice amount of species (various fish, crabs, dolphins, sharks, manta rays, ...), though, so it's probably a nice thing for sealife lovers to swim around and identify the different species or just look at them. It really does have a mesmerizing effect to see a gigantice blue whale swim around in the Bahamas.Note, though, that if you want to troll around and try to hunt a shark - you can't. Nothing else other than regular fish can be hunted. If you aim at a shark, dolphin, manta ray or such, your crosshair will turn red and a red 'Don't shoot!' note will pop up above it. It's nice that the developers obviously cared about wildlife conservation, but come on... this is a chance wasted for another set of tasks that could've enhanced the gameplay a bit.Playtime & ReplayabilityIt took me roughly 3.5 hours to beat the game, however, I was also going for the achievements since they seemed rather easy to obtain (more on that below), but if you don't care about them and just rush from task to task, you can probably beat the game in 2 hours or less.Achievements15 of the 17 achievements are indeed easy to unlock, however, there are 2 extremely grindy ones: 'Captain Nemo' - Spend 24 hours underwater and 'Pro Swimmer' - Swim underwater for 100km. Upon completion of the last location, I was at about 33km/100km, so that means that I would have to spend another 7 hours or so just swimming around aimlessly. And another 14 hours to get the 'Captain Nemo' achievement. Uh.... nope.I wish that developers in general would finally understand that such achievements aren't funny or fun to obtain. They're plain annoying and dumb - especially in a game that doesn't even remotely provide enough content to keep the player busy for such a long time. What's worse: you can't even let the game running in the background because a fully upgraded oxygen will only let you stay underwater for around 15 minutes until you drown, so you would have to get back into the game ever so often to catch a breath.ConclusionWhile the tasks are pretty uninspired, I actually enjoyed just swimming around and doing them because the enviroment paired with the music really produce an extremely relaxing atmosphere, so I would tend towards a thumb up if you're looking for a way to unwind after a hard day of work or before going to bed.However, the more time you spend in the game, the more you notice that it feels like a game where the developer had quite a couple of good ideas but ultimately failed to work them out properly and just left them in the game in an unfinished state. If you let the players earn cash, don't make the equipment so cheap that it becomes entirely useless to amass even more money once you have fully upgraded it. If you let the players earn XP, reward them with something that makes a difference to the gameplay. If you don't let the players hunt certain species and thus limit the interaction with the enviroment, at least tell them why...I definitely can't recommend the game at its full price. It simply doesn't have enough gameplay, content and polish to justify the pricing. I probably wouldn't even recommend it at anything below 75% off due to this. Seeing that the game has already been bundled 3 times, it's probably better to wait until it shows up in another bundle if you really want to get it for cheap.			"

												The graphics are fine, cool seeing the underwater life. Creates nice relaxing ambiance. Problems :Only 3 levels, takes like 2-3 hours to beat. Most of the fish look the same. You can't do anything with the other cool animals. You use the same gun the whole game, and do the same 3 things (catch fish, take pic, collect meaningless similar looking treasures) every level. No story, you just randomly do missions at the few spots. The upgrades are uninteresting and not that helpful (besides longer breath holding). Your sprint runs out in 3 seconds, takes 30 seconds to refill, and doesn't move you much faster. Then there is a terrible part of the final level where you have to collect 10 different fish, but you don't know what you've collected, and what you have left to collect, which doesn't help since all the fish look identical. Having a list for you to see would have worked, but instead they inflate game length by having you swim around continuously looking for that single last fish, of which you're not sure which it is, while you catch more of the same fish you already have. Other pointless tasks like (collect fish for 5 min) are obvious grabs for increased game length and lack of creativity, especially since it doesn't matter how much you catch. Your levels stop mattering after like 10, but they go up to 30. I have tons of gold but had already bought the 4 possible upgrades. Just a boring repetitive game with nice atmosphere and a stupid final mission. 4.5/10.			"

												Go fish!Now this game is about cahing fish, and finding tressure. What could be bad about that? well I am going to tell you!First of, I am not going to give this game a thumps down, it is playable, and there are some good elements to it. The only problem is there also are some shining bad elements, that nearly blinded me enough to give this game a thumps down. Now let`s get to it and say what`s good and bad.The music and over all gameplay is good in this game. You really fell the underwater atmospher, and the grapics looks ok too. There are a series of missions you can do, but you can also just swim around with no goal, other then your own. You have to pay attention to your breath meter, and there are also a swim meter, that will show you, if you can swim fast. There are three kinds of missions, there are cath fish, find treassure and take photos. The only problem with these games is, it`s so damn easy, all of them can be done without any sweat, and there is no challenge in the game. This is what stands out to me why did they not make the game harder? I don`t know, but the game is still decent enough.Buy this game if you are looking for a game, that is not hard, but simply is a time killer, if you want a game that challenge you in any way, look elsewhere. 4 outt of 10			"

												This game looks great, plays great and it's quite relaxing. You collect treasures, shoot fish with a spear gun and take photos. Everything you do gains you XP and money to upgrade abilities such as being able to swim faster, hold your breathe for longer and aim straighter. The game is very short, you can beat the game in 2.5 hours, but considering it is an indie game and there aren't many others like it I would recommend picking it up if you find it on sale.Swimming and exploring and watching all the fish swimming is nice and soothing. There needs to be more games where you can explore under the ocean.			"

												Picked this up in a bundle with a few other games for about $4.  It is easily worth that by itself.  It is a nice change in genre and while not super challenging, not quite a casual game.  I wish the missions were a bit more diverse, but it kept my interest with decent steam achievements, though not a fan of the endurance achievements (swim 100km and 24h underwater), as they are too far beyond what is needed to finish the game and will be somewhat tedious for most people to go for.That all said, I give the game a 7/10 and recommend it in a bundle or when on sale for about $5, as that is the price point for games of similar ability to keep me interested like this one.

												Now, I just want to start off by saying that I don't recommend this game, but that doesn't mean it's a BAD game.  Honestly, I think it's a very good example of what it is ... that's just not a genre I like too much.Back in the 90s, there was a popular screensaver that was just a bunch of fish swimming around.  This game puts you in the role of a hunter/photographer/treasure hunter in that screensaver.  It's pretty enough, if not spectacular; it just doesn't have a whole lot of point.  Like the screensaver, it's more there just to help you relax, with small goals and incremental upgrades to make you feel like you're accomplishing something.If you want to tool around and chill in a pseudo-underwater environment, get this game.  If you want to play a game, look elsewhere.			"

												This game is far better than I expected it to be. The graphics are not  top notch, but they get the job done pretty well I think.I like the fact that you can progress at your own pace and if you want you can just swim around the area you are in for as long as you want collectin treasure and fish and taking pictures. Doing these things gets you money, XP, and eventually unlocks equipment to buy for your diver.Depth Hunter 2 is a very chill game that you can relax with and treasure hunt and spearfish at your leasure. The only thing you have to watch out for is some hostile animals like crabs and eventually sharks and so on. The first area so far only seems to have crabs as aggressive critters. If you don't shoot the manta's and other larger docile creatures they will leave you alone.Again, I was pleasantly suprised by Depth Hunter 2. I got it cheap in the newest FPS bundle from Bundle Stars so can't complain about the price.Depth Hunter also provides a catalogue of fish and  basic information about each species.I would highly recommend this game. Giving this one a solid 7/10.			"

												Depth Hunter 2 is a relaxing game where you explore the fishy depths.  Its like a walking simulator only for diving.  Instead of just swimming around, there is treasure to find, or take pictures, and catching fish is fun too.  The world feels very alive, the way the fish move seems very well done.  Taking pictures is very rewarding there is an excellent feature of being able to make them your desktop as well.  There are multiple places to visit for diving that have many attractions under water from ships, to planes, all kinds of things that make exploring fun.  The dev is active in the steam community, if encountering a bug or making a suggestion the dev is quick to respond.  The music is perfect for the game, gives it a feeling of isolation like being on a real dive.  Missions are as short or long except a couple timed objectives to mix it up.  Great summer game to spend time swimming around exploring the oceans.  *This is a snorkel game so be sure to go to the surface when air is low. Rating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99			"

												How to start. I understand why this game has bad ratings. Somebody may be dissapointed by the lenght of the game. Aaand it's extremely easy.On the other hand, this game wasn't supposed to be hard. You should get yourself a coffee, start the game and just chill out. Enjoy the ocean, the graphics are decent. Take some pics, catch some fish. There is a nice variety of treasures, but coins are just useless.   This game had a great potential. I don't understand why is it called ""depth"" hunter. You are always few meters below. At least it seems and feels like it. Character developement is pointless. Completely. Most of the archievements are extremely ease to accomplish as well (15/17). You will accomplish them in about 2-3 hours. The 16th archievement is to be 24 hours underwater and the 17th is to swim 100km underwater. Well.. are you f.... kidding me?			"

												Recommended.One of the very few underwater games.IMHO, better than subnautica. While subnautica has a heavy engine, really difficult to have smooth graphics, the engine of Depth Hunter 2 is way more optimized and, the diving experience is smoother.In the same way, subnautica's missions are boring as hell and, scenarios lack life and interest.Maps in Depth Hunter 2 are closer to the real thing, as well as fishes.But to be honest, this game has very little comparison to the real thing.Behavior of fishes is very dummy. Real spearfishing is way difficulter. Here you have very little chances to miss a shot.Air is other thing that's weird. Advanced spearfishmen go around 2 minutes 30 seconds, here you have time to build a house.It lacks some other things: stealth, camuflage, fish in holes, etc. and the proper reactions of the fishes to your own movements but, ok, this is a game and, no fishment, no joy.Overall, an interesting game if you love underwater.

												A fun little game, probably not worth full price i'd say since it doesn't have alot of things to do unless you buy the DLCs that add a bit more things to do. The overall gameplays, looks and feels of the game are nice though, it just centers around exploring around in an area, finding treasure, coins, catching fish and taking photos of sea creatures. Though, the game is certainly not flawless, it has some mistakes that i've certainly noticed.-The text is weird.This is a bit nippicky, but when a mission for me is ""Make a photo of 5 fish"" then i begin to question wherther or not the person that wrote that is a person who has good experience with the english language, and this is not just one typo mistake. It says ""Make a _____"" on just about every quest.-Small mapsLike it says, the maps are not really that big, they are certainly good looking and a bit interesting to explore, but there isn't much map to it. The standard game comes with 3 maps which can easily be fully explored in a matter of hours. -Uninteresting treasuresOne of the things you can do in this game is collect treasure on the sea bottom, things like ancient swords, shields helmets and stuff like that. But it's really just the same stuff scattered around randomly and with no history or story about them, i would have appreciated if the loot was unique for the map you were on and if they were real salvaged artifacts that had been re-created in the game and with a bit of history to read about them. But it's not like that, they also got silly names like ""Sword of justice"" like it's some sort of enchanted thing from a fantasy RPG.Overall it's a decent game to get on a sale if you enjoy underwater exploration games, but don't expect to get a whole lot of hours on it, because it's quite easily completed.

												Depth Hunter 2 is a decent little indie game about snorkeling under the water. Its a ok game for being a underway swimming game and some nice touches here and there. The graphics in the game are nice and like the little details they do here and there. There’s plenty of fish swimming around ranging from so reef fish all the way up to sharks and a Blue Whale on one mission. Mission wise the game is kinda short on that. Most of the missions, including the DLC's, are basicly all the same. You either hunt for a certain fish or spear as many as you can, look for treasure, or take pictures. On all the 3 base maps and the 2 DLC's that’s basicly what you do. There will be a 2-4 missions that will have you stump for a bit on what you need to find but once you get it done, its a cake walk after that. If you do all the missions and don't do free dives, you'll have the game done in hour and a half to two hours. You can upgrade your character, which is a balded head man with no option to change your character, and have him swim better, spear better, and take a lot of pics. Once you done all the missions you can tackle the achievements and with the recent update, makes one of the achievements, Sharpshooter, basicly easy to get since you can hardly miss now. The maps are really detailed with you able to swim around a downed plane, a couple of ships, a sunken city, and a underwater trench. You can swim around as long as your oxygen holds out, which doubles as your health. You can swim right up to any fish and sharks and don't have to worry about getting attacked by any of them. So in short the game is fun and relaxing but gets very tedious and repetitive with the missions.			"

												Overall:* 3/10* Casual spearfishing game (Supposed to be.. Its not really)* Frickin Child-proof* VERY Pricey. 2,5$ for a DLC for this game.. Give me a break..Pros:* Good graphics* Good & needed idea/concept* Plenty of fish typesCons:* 2 hrs of gameplay.. Thats what you get at most.. And thats because I went around aimlessly.* So easy to play you can hardly say there is a game here.. You cant miss.. While spearfishing???!!! You can be shootin at an angel fish at 15 mt and still you will hit %100 and reel in.. There is absolutely ZERO difficulty.. No challanges.* Game is by default child-proof.. You cant shoot at anything you want. Its so stupid.. You cant fire your speargun in water. Has to be a target.. You cant shoot any target... Ridiculous..* Sound effects are like a casino game.. You get a slot machine sound everytime you catch fish or pick up something from ocean floor.. Its Vegas spearfishing..* No realistic animal behavior.. You can head-butt a shark.. And it just stays there.. No reaction. Nothing..* One of additional equipment in game is ""extra 6 MINUTES oxygen"".. You become a submarine.. What kind of free diving world do you live in that I hold my breath additional 6 minutes and exert myself swimming around full speed with a speargun..* The lousy trick that the developer pulled to some people who bought his greenlight bundle.. (+++Rep to Kenuty being the only person in Negative reviews mentioning it)Conclusion:There is no game here.. This is not even arcade. No content. Spend your money on real games. There are great games for the same amount of money where Devs really develop a REAL game... I didnt know about the scam they pulled before I bought the game. If I knew, I wouldnt buy it. They promised people keys while in Greenlight, in a bundle and when they get Greenlit, they changed the name of the game, made some tweaks and didnt give out their keys.. TL; DR: What a WASTE OF MONEY... Do not buy.. Look elsewhere "

												I bought this game after a stressful day to relax to.I must say that it did the job.The game lacks game play mechanics and is really easy.But the thing that makes it all better is the environment's.There is just something nice about swimming underwater and looking at everything.Quite short but pretty looking game.

KAMGUSTA's mini ReviewAn immersive (LOL) and relaxing dive hunting game... In the first mission I killed 65 fishes with a 95% precision in just 5 minutes. And that's without the advanced gear. Yup, it's that easy. An Unreal Tournament in the ocean with harmless mobs!! Nice try, but it's a no.Score 5/10 "

												Graphics are great. The ocean environment feels alive and beautiful. Gameplay however is just.. meh. Spear fishing is too easy that I managed to get 100% accuracy in all campaign missions. All you have to do to get 100% accuracy is to get close enough to the target until the reticle is green, and then left click it. The target will be reeled in automatically. This makes missions just too ridiculously easy.Other gameplay elements such as camera photography is also added, but the gameplay is still similar to spear fishing: go near until the quality is 100%, then take the snapshot.Environmental hazards are simply sea urchins and crabs, which will only decrease your oxygen, which can be regained easily.Overall, beautifully done ocean graphics, gameplay needs tons of improvements.

												A very bland and boring ""shoot fish and pick stuff up"" simulator. Not much depth, and not much to see. The controls are extremely awkward, as you can only move back and forth in the direction you're facing with a little bit of strafing, no ""up"" key. Combined with needing to pick items up off the ground, and there being dangerous stuff placed haphazardly on the ground, a decent amount of time is spent rubbing your face on the ground and trying to back away from the ocean floor.If the game concept seems really interesting to you, maybe get it on sale, but otherwise this really isn't worth it.

												Very boring, skilless game. Fish don't swim away until you're about to touch them, and you can't shoot until you're on a fish, so you can just spam shoot while swimming up to them and you'll always catch one. The missions are bland and tedious, and exploration is pointless considering how easy it is to get all of the upgrades. I got this game in a bundle, so its not a big deal to me, but I would nver reccommend that someone pay full price for it. All this game has going for it is okay graphics. 3/10			"

												Serene, Enjoyable, immersive first person casual diving sim.  Makes you feel like you're actually under the sea.  That's the point.   Not many ways to fail... it just encourages good vibes. The graphics are a little rough around the edges, and the spear fishing is a little twitchy, but overall it's enjoyable.  I got this as part of an indie bundle, and I think it's above average for the discount price.

Underwater world is done pretty well, it's a hard thing to master but I think they did a good job. There are a plethora of missions ranging from treasure hunting to fish spearing.This is a really casual game.

												Depth Hunter 2: Deep Dive is an underwater exploration game.The review is presented in a simplistic ""Pros/Neutral/Cons"" format.Pros:* Cheap as all hell thanks to the bundles and the lowering value.* 13 out of the 17 achievements are fairly simple to obtain.* While the graphics aren't something to boast about, the visuals still look beautiful.* No need to focus on the game too much.* 3 different regions.* Upgrade system (Simple, but made the game more fast paced and fun).* Leveling system (Fairly pointless, some bonuses. Still a good addition).* Runs fairly ok.Neutral* Short. Can be finished in 2 hours or so.* Floaty mouse controls (Felt good for me, since being underwater literally is floaty, plus it added some cinematic quality that I just can't explain)Cons:* 100% the achievements are almost impossible to get, since one of them requires you to be active underwater for 24hrs.* Missions are extremely simplistic. (Collect 10 things, kill 10 fish and so on)* Can't kill some fish. (WHY AREN'T SHARKS KILLABLE??!?!?!?!?!?!)* Photography feature has literally no point and it's unrewarding as all hell.Overall:6/10			"

												Interactive Screen Saver.I wasn't expecting a lot of depth in this game. It's pretty much what I figured it would be. So, if you ever thought it would be cool to have a more interactive aquarium screensaver this should do the trick.It's just a shame the soundtrack is lazy and basically two tracks per level.Future diving games should consider adding real diving threats and challenges. Currents, predators (it's not just sharks in the ocean that can get you...), actual swimming physics, etc. etc. The genre is ripe for plucking but everyone seems to fail at capitalizing it.Still, if you want a popcorn game and can get this at 75% off, it may be worth it for the purty.

												What I likeThe water effects and underwater graphicsWhat I don't likeEverything elseThe game gets boring in about an hour. After 3 hours you simply can't stand to look for brown treasure on a brown ocean bottom any longer without simply going insane. I have to say that the absolute worst part is the lack of any attention in fish AI. The fish just clip through you and pay absolutely no mind to you slaughtering their fishy friends in front of their very eyes. In fact they will continue moving towards you!I didn't get through the entire game to see if sharks/sea/turtles/everything else that would be even remotely entertaining to spear was even possible. Yes, they simply just won't let you spear anything except like 10 fish.  Game dev. PLEASE ADD/Change-Blood and Gore-Let me kill whatever I want-Remove the treasure/coins (I’d rather count dots on a ceiling)-Add fish AI "

												Part of me wants to recommend the game because it's the only one of its kind on Steam, and it is functional, but unless you *need* a game where you can swim around and look at fish, it's just not worth it. Graphics are the main selling point, they're not spectacular, but good enough. The mission structure is annoying, but unfortunately the only way to unlock the free dive mode for each area. Playing with a controller is a struggle, because the trigger for both the speargun and the camera is mapped to the A button, which makes it very difficult to aim and shoot, and there's currently no way to remap the controls. Also be aware that spearing fish is necessary to complete missions and unlock the free dive mode, so if you're completely against killing of any kind (as has come up in the discussions section) this is not the game for you.

												Did you love those old ""Dream Aquarium"" screensavers but thought that their gameplay were just a little bit too exciting and complex?Do you love hidden object games but thought that merely clicking the objects simply wasn't slow and tedious enough?Do you love hunting simulators but think that their AI is simply too clever for you and that they would be a lot more fun if simply very slowly walking up to your prey until your crosshair turns green would be a lot more fun than aiming and shooting?Then Depth Hunter (2) is the game for you. It's slow, tedious, dull and boring all wrapped into what looks like a half-decent aquarium screensaver.And if you were wondering why Depth Hunter 1 can't be found on Steam: It's essentially the exact same game with a few features missing. The only reason this is called Depth Hunter 2 is so that the developers could avoid giving out the promised Steam keys after Depth Hunter (not 2) had been greenlit.			"

												Depth Hunter 2, the Name says it all.Basically you swim around and cowboy your way through the Areas, the only thing that can stop you are some red warning Lables that tell you not to kill Turtles, Manta Rays, Crabs and some other Species.You can also collect Gold Coins and Treasures, for my taste there are ""a little"" too many of them. You can earn Gold with hunting, completing challenges or taking Pictures of the Lifeforms and use it to buy upgrades for your Camera, Harpoon or your Oxygen supply so you dont have to swim to the Surface every few Minutes.You cant die, when you run out of Oxygen, you will just be ""teleportet"" to the Water Surface. Some Positive and Negative things short: + The Game has easy Controls and is easy to understand.+ As mentioned, you can upgrade Weapon, Oxygen Supply and Camera.+ The Water looks good+ You can hunt some of the Species+ Only a small downloadsize of ~500Megabytes- No Multiplayer- Sealife animation looks weird, almost like on rails.- Annoying and Facebookgame like Music and Sounds.- Overall the Engine and Textures, beside the Water itself, look really dated and ugly.- Rather small gaming Areas- The Mouse movement and acceleration... oh well... Not sure what to say as closing word. Lets say its fun for a little while, but you will forget about it really fast.Also if you really, really want it, i would wait for a ~75% sale!  its not worth the current price of 14,99€.			"

												This game. It's really hard to determine what I feel about this game. First I'll start with the graphics. Is it the most beautiful game you'll ever find? Most likely not. Is it beautiful? In my opinion, yes.Essentially what you do in this game is you get sent on a mission, whether it is collect a certain amount or kind of fish, or find specific amounts/types of treasure hidden somewhere at the bottom of the sea.For what this game sets out to accomplish, I feel it accomplishes it well. This game is very peaceful, I really like exploring the ocean, I have something to do while I explore (whether its shoot fish, take pictures, or find treasure) and you get rewarded with money for collecting things and completing missions so that you can buy upgrades so you can collect things and complete missions more efficiently.This isn't a game I would buy to blow my mind, but this game has satisfied me enough that I don't really need ABZU in my life (though they are very different kinds of games).I like playing this game before I go to sleep. I don't really get bored with this game, though for some treasure hunting missions I do get tired of searching (because it can be hard and time consuming at times).Overall, I definitely recommend at least trying this game out. I bought this game in a bundle from another website, and honestly this is the only one I play.			"

												This was my ""happy place"" for hours. Unfortunately it didn't last for as long as I would have wished. The game start you off very easy, catch some fish then find some treasure. After that you get to take photos of the beautiful underwater world that Depth Hunter offers. With the xp you earn from catching fish, photographing and collecting treasure you unlock upgraded equipment that make your harpoon line longer, better accuracy, zoom for the camera and bigger oxygen tanks so you can be in teh water for longer periods of time before surfacing. There are 3 beautiful locations you can dive in: Thailand, South Africe and the Bahamas. They come (of course) with different species to hunt and photograph and new missions in each location. The down side to this is that the missions involve either photographing, hunting or looking for treasure, which makes it feel a little same same. I still like this game alot, I just wished there were more to do, if you want to find every treasure in the game you have many hours here, but if you like me got tired after awhile, then it's just to do the missions or ""free roam"" left. To summarize, a beautiful game to do little in but swim peacefully among the nice fishes and coral reefs. With a lack of longevity it's still a really peaceful and beautiful place to go to. 7.1/10			"

												If you hate fish, then this is the game for you. You swim around and shoot a speargun at fish. You can take pictures too, but what fun is that? As basic as this game is, the price is shocking. There isn't a lot of depth in this game, it's just going around shooting fish and doing missions. It's a good game to just pick up and play for a few minutes at a time.			"

Product received for free
												I'm pretty disapointed in this game.  Three maps in the core game.  -There's no variety in the fish from map to map, except that they add a couple new species each map. -All the coral reefs look the same.  The wrecks aren't really explorable. -I was disapointed that I could go into the plane in the first map.  -The upgrade system is dirt easy to push through.   You'll level up and recieve some kind of upgrade available.  But everything is already available, and the icons they show, most of them don't exist in the upgrade window (like scuba tanks).-Once you get the highest hold our breath underwater upgrade, you wont have to go up for air again.  You'll get it around the second map.  -In the third map, there's a mission to catch as many fish as you can within 5 dives.  So you have stupid amounts of air to catch all the fish in the ocean.  But you can just catch 1 fish and then dive up and down five times to complete the mission and move on.   To be clear, one mission in the first map has you catch as many as possible in 10 minutes.  I caught 130 fish.  so yeah...Just dissapointed.  Was expecting more to it is all. Glad I won it in a giveaway.			"

												A relaxing underwater diving simulator game wich is pretty fun. You get various missions to complete while you can also just swim around and take photos or kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ Or die to crabs.. :(There's 3 ""maps"" to complete and did the first one in an hour so assuming this is a fairly short game. However can't really say the full price is that expensive either so up to the gamer if it's worth the money or not!Graphic wise.. Not sure. It looks damn good but it still has some mayor graphic issuses since most fishies looks derpy up close.UPDATE AFTER COMPLETED THE GAME:Best feature must be the ""set to background"" button in your fish gallery. Amazing to see the cute turtle everytime I start my computer. :^3			"

												It makes sense for this game to exist; deep sea hunting is a cool idea. The game itself fell very short of the what I feel it set out to do. Bad controls, bad mechanics and bad interface design meant this game didn't make me feel immersed at all. Also  it's very disconcerting to enter a nice casual, relazing game only to find the only thing you do in the game is harpoon cute little well-rendered fish. You can't seem to harpoon the more endagered looking animals so I guess that's okay. I got this game as part of a not-great bundle and I still don't feel like it was worth it. 15 mins of gameplay max... unless you really like to click on fish under a time limit.			"

												Even though I’ve never even played the first Depth Hunter I only recently had the opportunity to play the sequel anyway. Depth Hunter 2 is a beautiful, relaxing game that pretty much anyone who’s remotely interested in oceans and fish can enjoy. It’s simple in its setup, but it keeps you hooked by letting you hunt and photograph tons of different fish, while also letting you find lost treasures scattered at the bottom of the ocean.Unfortunately there is a serious lack of diving games on Steam. I tried to find some games similar to this game, but World Of Diving was about the only other thing I could find.  That’s both a good and bad thing. Good as in: ‘oh, this will feel fresh to new players’, and bad as in: ‘I wish I could play more games like that’. Fortunately for us Depth Hunter 2 has just enough content to keep us occupied until the next diving game comes out.The game is easy to get into. You have your basic movement controls (WASD keys) and the mouse can be used to pick up treasures and shoot your speargun. Spears are unlimited by the way so no need to worry about missing a fish (unless the objective tells you otherwise). Then there’s also a key for the map and for your camera and that’s it. No rocket science needed here.There are several oceans to be explored.  Each level has a set of missions that you have to complete in order to unlock the next area. These consist of finding treasures, hunting fish and making photographs. Each fish you kill, treasure you find or photo that you make gives you experience points and coins. Level up and you’ll unlock even more coins and stuff to buy in the store, like extra oxygen, faster/better flippers or a better gun. Leveling happens fast, however, and after 1 hour of playtime you’re probably already able to buy all the available equipment, which is a shame.The missions are short and there’s usually no time limit so it’s a relaxing game where you can just take your time doing stuff, even if there isn’t all that much to do when you truly think about it. You can run out of oxygen which will return you to your boat, but if you get some air before it runs out you’ll be perfectly fine and you’ll be able to continue your trip without any problems.The graphics are beautiful. The sea is nicely captured with fish swimming everywhere, caves and sunlight shining through the water. It looks really pretty. But sometimes objects just pop up out of nowhere, and it seems the draw distance is rather limited. I have no idea why, really, because the game doesn’t demand a high-end PC. A minor complaint that the developers might even be able to fix by adjusting some settings, I think.The sounds are limited because, well, you’re in the water but the gun makes a good sound, and the level up sound you hear when you level up makes you want to keep going. That something so simple makes the game that more fun is weird, but, in a way, also brilliant. But Depth Hunter is definitely not the first game to do this. There are tons more out there. But as you can see; it works.The music is subtle and soothing and it fits the game’s atmosphere. It makes you relax and stop thinking about your daily chores, if only for a couple of minutes. I appreciated it, at least.The missions aren’t long and can be completed within minutes most of the time. And after finishing the first mission and you’ll unlock a mode where you can dive and swim around at your own leisure. There are 3 maps and the first two will take about 30-60 minutes to complete, after that you have the third map. I assumed the last one would have just as many missions as the previous ones but no, there are only two of them and, like that, the game is over before you know it. I managed to finish it in roughly 2 hours which is short. I wish there were more missions and more objectives to complete. Dynamic events would’ve fit this game perfectly. Depth Hunter 2 surprised me with its casual and, dare I say, shallow gameplay. It’s fun, pretty and addictive all at once but unfortunately the journey ends way too soon and the last part of the game even felt rushed to me.  My extremely positive opinion of the game changed just because of that. I don’t think it’s a rip-off as there’s some content in it that could keep you busy for longer than the 1,5-2 hours that the story will take you to complete but I do think that the current price is too steep. So my advice to you is to grab it when it’s on sale, or at least costs €10 or less.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												The game looks outrageously good. The whole vast underwater sea setting is so good to look at that it feels very serene. I guess it is easier to make a beautiful game when it is underwater. The problem however comes from the gameplay. The only challenge comes from trying to stay awake while playing. This shouldn't be a game on steam, it should just be something that you do on your ipad/iphone while you wait at the doctor's office. There really is no gameplay to speak of. You swim around endlessly underwater while harpooning countless fish with a hand held harpoon gun (lol) while finding treasure items on the seafloor. It's like one of those point-and-click treasure finder games where you have to click around screen and find all the items, but instead of still images you actually get to do something, albeit not much. I was blown away by how beautiful everything looks. I've never seen underwater graphics in a game look better. It might have even been better had they not included the horrible treasure finding part. It isn't good when you are alt+tabbing out to the game's store page on steam to see if the game has any real objectives or other things to actually do that are fun. It also might be the smoothest running game ever. It's too bad there is really nothing fun to do, just swim around and fight off the sandman.Mr. Sandman, bring me a treat. Engaging gameplay with fun objectives can't be beat. Both of which this game has none of.			"

I have to confess I've never heard or even played 'Depth Hunter 1' so this release was a bolt out of the blue for me. OMG it looks so real! My wife came into the room as I was playing it and she thought it was a documentary on TV. This game looks and feels so good, I actually feet like I was exploring the ocean floor.... it's just fantastic. For all the haters I just have to say ""Seriously.... are you guys for real????"" I found it relaxing, cool, atmospheric and very magical. I could have explored the ocean floor and coral reefs all day. As for the additional quests and challenges, WOW what an added bonus! - Superb, Highly Recommended and worth the experience.  People shouldn't complain about games like this, they should appreciate them for the technology they have achieved in gaming!			"

												Awesome game, and the ambiance is spot on, HOWEVER, this might seem like a minor complaint, but to those of us that use ""flight controls"", it DOES NOT have inverted camera controls.......which, as you know, is VERY frustrating in a game that use 360 degree movement.  Please patch this Biart!  Otherwise, great game and a job well done!  :)			"

												Depth Hunter 2 is very similar to the first one in that you'll be tasked with completing a series of underwater missions while managing your oxygen reserves.  DH2 introduces an XP and coin system, allowing you to level up and buy new equipment.  There isn't a lot to purchase mind you, but at least it (combined with the XP system) gives you a feeling of progression.  You also don't need to manually reel in the fish this time around (DH1 featured an annoying mini-game when you speared a fish).  Rather, the game reels the fish in for you automatically.  Folks who wanted or expected a hardcore diving sim won't find it here, but it's perfect for casual players who just want to enjoy the ambience, take pictures, and relax a bit.  Easy to recommend given the current price tag.

												I have no idea how this game made it into my steam library, but it did, and I am happy.I came in expecting pretty scenery (while not expecting the best graphics, the set peices looked pretty well designed) and probably something photo-taking, doing some nice undersea photography.Instead I became a fish-slaughtering Rambo-esque diver murdering everything I could which came my way with speed and precision never before seen by my hapless prey.And I found it a bit weird that undersea treasure and gold coins were worth less than a single fish. It lead me to the conclusion this must be set in the future where fish hunting is banned, and I am an illegal fish-poacher.So, highly recommended if you happen to like undersea exploration, fish murder, or both.

												Super relaxing underwater hunting game.Beautiful graphics and soothing sound. Splash around hunting fish, seeking treasures and taking photographs in several nicely themed locations. That is very much all there is to the game. Air level warnings give you ample time to reach the surface and beyond a couple of barely damaging and easy to avoid hazards, you may swim and explore at your leisure.Achievements are very easy to collect with just one taking some time to acquire, though you may also pick that one up if you take your time with all the others.Recommend for, fish lovers and haters and those wanting a little Zen between games.

												I've been wondering for a while if there was a game that could replace my love for Endless Ocean, and Endless Ocean 2 failed miserably so I was a little surprised to come across Depth Hunter 2. This game is pretty basic; the manus are primitive and don't highlight when you hover them with your mouse, the tutorials and missions come on too fast and are extremely repetitive, and there's not a lot to catch once you've seen the 10 or so fish in each area relatively small area. Still, the oceans look great and there is definitely an exploration feel to this, although once you upgrade your speed to max the world feels extremely small.I wouldn't have minded some sort of a story, however basic, but this was a fun run through anyway. I have a feeling this might be a fun experiement with VR coming out shortly and think for the right price (on sale) Depth Hunter is a great casual game for those nights when you're bored with nothing else to do.

												This game delivers exactly on the premise - it's an environment simulator.   Graphics are quite nice, there's lots of fish, works very stable and smooth in 4K.  The environments and soundtrack are very relaxing, giving a nice simulated environment for recreational spearfishing.You play the role of an ocean-based Pacman if he took too many power pills and became an environmental vandal.  Your missions are generally to swim around underwater, kill fish with spears (and gobble them up or something), and loot the place of gold coins and artifacts.  ""That belongs in a museum!"" - Indiana Jones, 1939.I probably killed around 50 fish on my first outing.So, gameplay is limited, expectations should also be limited for this kind of game.  Complexity is on the same level as the Euro Truck and Warehouse Logistics simulators.   However, delivery is solid, although ultimately beyond the simulation, there's not much long term interest.

												A pretty decent competitor to my #1 & 2 favourites of this ilk, Endless Ocean 1 & 2 on Nintendo Wii.Depth Hunter 2 has many missions of salvage and photography, and the level-up system is neat, if almost useless.The upgrade system is much more steamlined than Endless Ocean too.It comes up a bit short compared to EO though in that there is fairly minimal educational content, and content in general.In Endless Ocean I was free to explore the depths and learn about the wondrous creatures that dwell there. In this game, well, I guess I get to spear some of them.Only buy the DLC if you really love this game as they're very short and boring. I found the Scuba Kids - Hidden Treasures almost unplayable, literally. Ocean Mysteries adds the shipwreck and ruins maps with about a dozen mission between them. If I buy Treasure Hunter I will update this review.5/10			"

												I can't recommend this game for a few reasons.1. It's way to simple, Even for a casual relaxing game, it's just way to simple2. It get's boring very fast, after about 10 minutes I stopped playing, but I'm more of a FPS gamer than Casual anyway so I guess it depends on what you like.3. There are hardly any fish, They all look the same as well, you would expect for a diving fish spearing game there would be a lot of this but unfourtantley that is not the case.4. Now this is really stupid, They added DLC for thing's what should already be in the game like the treasure hunting radar, that really should be a upgradable item.While the game had them problems it had a lot of good parts to it as well for exaple the graphic's are decent, it's really relaxing and would be a great game for a man who is married and is suffering from blue balls, and it's would be a good game for a child, no violence, no bad language.Overall I would say it's a great game for it's price, but the DLC just kind of ruined it for me, but hey, it's still better than Call Of Duty: Ghosts fish AI "

												Well, it is pretty and a really zen game that you can have some fun with. At first it is hard to aim and catch the fishes, so it is really recommended to buy the upgrades to the shooter as early as possible. The most interesting part is the photographies that you can take of everything in the game and it count as a screenshot, giving you the option to also use the images as wallpaper for your desktop.The places are cool and the scenery is pretty, with Bahamas having a freaking Blue Whale in all its splendor. You can be pretty fablergasted by the looks of the game.Two achievements can be pretty tiring, since you have to grind hours and swim distance for them, but, of course, you're not supposed to do those unless you really want to 100% the achievements.

												First off, don't expect any action game or that much actually happening. This games is pure relaxation. With that said, the price is a bit high for the content. Only three small levels and barely any upgrades to speak off.You are going to spend most of your time staring at fish. If that sounds boring you probably should not get this.			"

												This Game has poorly designed controls and a bad ocean/diving simulation. all in all, this game gives you a feel of ""you are moving in outer space"", rather than swimming/diving underwater, where ocean waves and the sea water would give some sort of friction and ocean waving motion. this Game does not capture the ""Feels"" of diving/swimming, its unrealistic and simply not worth the money.The Sea Evironment in this game is way too ""dumbed down"", it does not contain much of any sea creatures and underwater landscapes to be seen, it provides the worst kind of lazy evironmental design, the fishes looks unrealistic, the other sea creatures behave strangely and have bad bodily motion.This Game lacks depth and has no player game play progression for the players to enjoy, explore and achieve.

												Super relaxing underwater hunting game.Beautiful graphics and soothing sound. Splash around hunting fish, seeking treasures and taking photographs in several nicely themed locations. That is very much all there is to the game. Air level warnings give you ample time to reach the surface and beyond a couple of barely damaging and easy to avoid hazards, you may swim and explore at your leisure.Achievements are very easy to collect with just one taking some time to acquire, though you may also pick that one up if you take your time with all the others.Recommend for, fish lovers and haters and those wanting a little Zen between games.

												I have no idea how this game made it into my steam library, but it did, and I am happy.I came in expecting pretty scenery (while not expecting the best graphics, the set peices looked pretty well designed) and probably something photo-taking, doing some nice undersea photography.Instead I became a fish-slaughtering Rambo-esque diver murdering everything I could which came my way with speed and precision never before seen by my hapless prey.And I found it a bit weird that undersea treasure and gold coins were worth less than a single fish. It lead me to the conclusion this must be set in the future where fish hunting is banned, and I am an illegal fish-poacher.So, highly recommended if you happen to like undersea exploration, fish murder, or both.

												[6.5/10]The graphics and sound are nice. The gameplay is relaxing, but repetitive. There isn't much content. I had most of the achievements before all of my card drops. There isn't much replay value unless you happen to regularly be looking for a relaxing game with extremely casual gameplay.I would like to give it a neutral review or a 3/5. Maybe someday Valve will give us something better than the primitive thumbs up/thumbs down.Depth Hunter 2 is [ossibly worth buying if it is deeply discounted and you are looking for a casual game or if you find it in a bundle that is worth buying for the other games in the bundle.tl;dr: +Relaxing gameplay, nice graphics and sound. -Repetitive gameplay without much content or challenge.

												A quite boring game about destroying the underwater ecosystem of third world countries. You literally kill 100 fish in ten minutes, that is more than one person needs in a day. Also the treasures are lacking in diversity and not enough gold is represented in this game. Don't tell PETA but killing fish is probably the most fun part of the game.			"

												It's a good game for three bucks.   Very relaxing.  Basically you swim around and either A) go harpoon fishing, where you single-handedly reduce the Pacific ocean's fish stocks by 50% with a speargun, B) Look for treasure, which is floating around the reef floor and pick up ancient plates and statues and such, or C) take photographs of various underwater attractions, like sunken planes and ships, coral reefs and other fauna, and underwater ruins.  All three are fairly relaxing, though fishing becomes tedious quickly because of the relatively small number of fish you're allowed to spear (no dolphins or sharks or sea turtles, I'm afraid).   Trying to find every piece of treasure in a given area can get a bit tedious as well, so I would say photography mode is my favorite.  Exploring the wrecks is especially interesting.  I wish it were possible to turn off the navigation points within them though (maybe it is but I didn't see the option).Along the way you'll gain experience and money that can be used to unlock levels and purchase new gear, like flippers that let you swim faster and a camera with better zoom or more storage, or let you go longer between surfacing for air (because apparently you aren't SCUBA diving, but are in fact a snorkler with the world's greatest lung capacity).  It's all pretty easy to do and there isn't much in the way of grinding involved. So, yeah for three bucks it's a fun little diving game.  It's a genre that's been underserved for a long time but now there are a few games for it, the other main one being Subnautica.  That's much more of a tense survival game, but there's much more to it than Deep Hunter 2.  Then again, that one takes place on a fictional planet so you won't see real-world animals in it, and it isn't three dollars either.			"

												I've been wondering for a while if there was a game that could replace my love for Endless Ocean, and Endless Ocean 2 failed miserably so I was a little surprised to come across Depth Hunter 2. This game is pretty basic; the manus are primitive and don't highlight when you hover them with your mouse, the tutorials and missions come on too fast and are extremely repetitive, and there's not a lot to catch once you've seen the 10 or so fish in each area relatively small area. Still, the oceans look great and there is definitely an exploration feel to this, although once you upgrade your speed to max the world feels extremely small.I wouldn't have minded some sort of a story, however basic, but this was a fun run through anyway. I have a feeling this might be a fun experiement with VR coming out shortly and think for the right price (on sale) Depth Hunter is a great casual game for those nights when you're bored with nothing else to do.

												This game is not worth $15, so I recommend it if you can get it in a bundle. Within 45 minutes you can unlock all the upgrades and at that point there's not much reason to keep playing. The three environments all have mostly the same fish, with one or two changes, and though you can explore there's not much reason to do so. You'll just come across the same fish and reefs over and over and maybe a wreck you already explored in a previous mission (which try to lengthen the game by adding objectives where you just do whatever until the timer runs out, with no way to lose). All in all this game is fun if you can get it for a couple bucks, it's just an extremely shallow experience.			"

												NIce little game, very peacefull and zen atmosphere, not very difficult, but attractive.Gamepad is supported, but default settings are not optimal, and the game does not include a gamepad settings menu, you need to edit a text file to change those if you want. Eventually, playing with keyboard and mouse is easier, espacially for hunting fish. Getting the game + DLCs during a sale is a good deal, for a few euros, the game is worth it. Underwater graphics are stunning, and fish are nice are pretty realistic, although the game itself is not a real diving simulator. Good overall immersion, positive feedback.			"
