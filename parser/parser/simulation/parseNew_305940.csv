								Banished in Sci-Fi is a good comparison. Beta 2 is a great city builder/economy simulation. Beta 3 will add research, putting even more emphasis on production optimization, in a resource scarce environment. This is an Early Release Game, so it's not fully balanced yet, and some of the UI is awkward still. There is no combat, which is something I appreciate. As an old gamer, I'm tired of having enemies, there are so many other ways to make games challenging and interesting.			"

								This game is fun. I have never written a review before, but I had to just say that the bad rep this game has gotten is unfair. Mainly this game is INCREDIBLY difficult, but if you keep that in mind then you're fine. This issue becomes when you want a simple game that you can check out of quickly. This game makes you micro-manage, you have to understand what things build into, and more than anything else you have to pay attention and READ THE FREAKING DESCRIPTIONS. (I enjoy this game way too much).			"

								Do you like watching lots of arrows advance along tracks that feed into other arrow tracks that then also advance but more slowly? Do you crave punishing difficulty and a fastidious attention to even the most minor detail? Wish EVE: Online was a little more like a spreadsheet? Then Project Aura is for you! You'll spend your first 40 hours in game constantly restarting while learning to farm your colony's poop for enough fertilizer to grow tomatoes in, and if you're lucky, your larder inventory WON'T randomly disappear! All the fun of Hermes Conrad's job- even watching 8 level 1 Recyclers all become level 2! Watch your citizens' morale drop when they realize you haven't stored enough food for them to eat tomorrow, and set yourself the lofty goal of producing a bread- there's like 7 different kinds of grain!(I know, it's a beta. Be prepared to make your own fun, though, at least for now.)			"

								I have read most of the reviews of this game before I bought it, both positive and negative and must say I was expecting a very unplayable game because of the number of negetive reviews and their vehemence. So I have been most pleasently surprise by the depth and complexity of this game, which is still in it's infancy. If you want a complete game then buy a complete game, this is not, as it says it is an alpha or beta if you prefer and many things don't exist yet. But if you are a patient gamer who likes to see a game grow and want to support a really good City Builder game in a futuristic setting, than this is the game for you. It is my considered opinion that those who have written the negetive reviews don't understand early access and have bad mouthed this game out of fustration, they are entitled to thier opinions but other then the ones who readily admit it is not far along as they though this game is playable and interesting and I would suggests the nay sayers give it another try "

								I typically do not write reviews for Early Access titles because so much can change between when the review is written and when the game is actually declared ""finished,"" but I am totally willing to make an exception here.If you like citybuilders, this game is right up your alley.  At the time of this writing, the devs have a very strong skeleton in place and are working hard to flesh things out and balance the different systems.  There currently is a lot of guesswork involved because the tutorials don't teach you everything you need to know to get a city up and running, but once I finally got the hang of things and watched some Let's Plays to better fine tune my colony, I became addicted.

								    Try to raise population morale by better food.    Decide to treat your population with tomato juice, as juices have very good morale bonus.    Find out that it requires quintupling production of tomato to maintain the same population.    Switch over to having multiple kinds of food instead.    Fail to produce enough fertilizer.    Fail to extract enough raw organics to produce enough fertilizer.    Realize you hit population limit.    Spend time gathering materials for extra housing.    Try producing better trasport ship to extract raw organics with.    Spend time gathering money to build and equip a ship factory.    Redesign part of the base to fit in new larger hangar for the ship, losing a workshop in the process.    Build a better ship.    Realize that equipment from your old ship doesn’t fit.    Spend time building new equipment for the ship.    Realize that because of the lost workshop your maintenance crews can’t keep up with the speed ship wears out.    Build additional equipment to reduce wear on the ship.    Search all over the place for the very best maintenance technicians and put them onto ship maintenance.    Calculate production her hour to make sure new crews can keep it up.    Hire more people to produce fertilizer faster.    Spend time balancing out seed extraction and making sure your seed stocks are coming up.    Finally build up food reserves and introduce new menu.    Realize that you had several other morale bonuses you forgot about, so the above was completely unnecessary.10/10, would lose four hours playing again.			"

								This is a unique game. It has a lot going for it, but bare in mind that this is not a game for everybody. What you get here is a vary deep production-chain and population manager. It has long production chains like in the Settler series. For instance just to produce the most basic food product- the seaweed portion you need a ship to bring in the raw sea weed. The♥♥♥♥♥♥needs a hangar, and a pilot. The hangar needs a director and a technican to maintain it. Then the seaweed needs to be processed. First you need to fatten the seaweed- for that you need a bioreactor plus a farmer of two. Once the seaweed is fattened you need to dry it, that needs another facility and a operator or two. And then you get the most basic food type. Don't get me even started on bread. And the game is a grind. And that can be disheartening at times. You need to invest a lot time into the game to get anything done. And there is a lot of micromanaging. This game is a micromanagers wet dream. You control everything, every individuals workplace, job, diet. The game is also very atmospheric- if you are into chillout music Stellardrone plays in the soundtrack. I'm having a lot of fun here. It is a breathe of fresh air after simple economic games like Anno. So if you are into micromanagment, complex production chains and you are not pulled off by grinding- thant this is a game for you. If you are looking for a quick, easy game- maybe not so much. There is still much that needs to be implemented to the game for it to truly shine- like disasters or research. But it is already playable and enjoyable and you can see where it is going. I think it is worth supporting in early access.			"

								Great game! Coming from an avid city builder fan, this game is great and cannot wait to see whats coming next! Of course there a a few bugs and what not but you have to expect that with early access. The tutorials lack a few things but thanks to DLCoates1 and his video on youtube, the game made sense. Looks like it will have a bit of a learning curve to it but i think thats what makes it great. Also it seems like anno 2070 and banished had a baby and this is what came out. I definately recommend this game if you are into city building games + city management. This game has some serious potential, cant wait to see whats coming. Keep it up Devs!!!!!!!			"

								This is like the city builders that hits just the RIGHT spot. No random citazens joining or problems with educating citazens. You can keep a tight control over everyone while slowly getting past the point of just feeding your citazens to slowly and exponentially growing your city. Buildings are customizable to a certain degree to be able to fit within your plots as needed but also function how you need them to be. Grouping parts up in one big plot costs less in the long term, but take up all that space. How are you going to customize anything at any particular point is up to your design? Only downside but also an upside is the slow speed of the game. While it's tougher to snail along at times, you don't have to worry about missing much and have plenty of time to get each thing done. Still a work in progress game, but I'm enjoying it MUCH more than any other city builder I've played. Steep learning curve so check out other reviews and steam guides for better insight on how to start. F2 is extremely important to help learn how to make stuff you need.			"

								I've been playing Project Aura for about a year or so now, and this game is a unique game. The goal of Project Aura is to create a self-sustaining city for survivors of a global climate change disaster. Unlike other city-building games, PA emphasizes the administrative side of running a city - foodstocks, medicines, production of fabrication materials to construct buildings, technology to support said buildings, and the logistical planning for put a functional colony together. As far as city-builders are concerned, PA is a unique experience. The administrative aspect of running a self-sustaining city requires much planning, critical awareness of systems and supplies, and expanding when the need or ability arises to combat various challenges facing the colony. In my opinion, PA provides a futuristic image of the post-human era, with the last vestiges of humanity attempting to survive on a now-hostile planet. I would whole-heartedly endorse Project Aura, as it provides hours of entertainment and challenge. The developers have worked hard at creating a cohesive, complex, and creative world respelndant with motifs of crisis, resilience, and survival. If you want something different from shooters, rogue-like clones, flights sims, or an RPG, check out Project Aura. There's a great community of people playing this game, so you'll join a corps of colonial directors determined to save humanity!			"

								Great game, HUGE learning curve highly suggest looking stuff up on WIKI. You will spend hours just learning to survive, but go slow learn how to make money then expand.(Build a bunch of water makers and seaweed farm + Alpha ship for Organic waste and recycle to grind them)Build enough to earn atleast 5k every couple of minutes then expand, early on nothing else matters but money and food.

								I'm a big fan of city building games and recently there haven't been a lot of them that have been done very well. Project Aura seems to be in the process of becoming one of the greats in the genre.It's still fairly raw and has issues, both minor and major, but overall it's been very enjoyable. The current tutorials do a good job of showing how to do things, but not what to do or when so the learning curve is a bit steep. I trashed my first 2 attempts to play the game when I realized some assumptions I'd made were wrong. So be prepared to learn as you go and make some mistakes along the way.Thankfully you don't get punished much for making mistakes, buildings can be demolished and 100% of the materials used to build them reclaimed. So if you position something incorrectly or realize the building you built isn't what you needed you can just knock it down and you lose nothing but time.Your citizens require food and water, but it's no real loss if they go without for a while. The worst that can happen is they leave your city and you just have to wake up some replacements. In fact the only current way to really lose the game as far as I can tell is to never feed your people until they all leave and you don't have enough credits to wake up replacements. There are UI elements for hazard warnings and weather disasters, but currently they don't seem to be implemented so the game world appears to be danger free for the moment.I can't be sure, but it looks like all the buildings are available from the start and I haven't found any use for a couple of the items you can have your citizens construct. I'm guessing they'll be used in the Technology Research part of the game once that's implemented. The quest system also isn't active so there are no objectives to complete other than seeing how big you can build your city and I haven't found any sort of 'endgame' either.Most of the materials you need to build things can be purchased using the ingame currency, which is how you'll start out building your city. But once you get some basic infrastructure built you can start collecting resources and making those materials yourself. It can take a while, but that's what x8 speed is for (shift/+ for increasing speed, shift/- for reducing speed).At the moment I have 2 key gripes about the game:1. There are some UI sound effects that aren't controlled by the ingame  volume sliders and will always play at maximum volume...it's extremely annoying2. There's no way to tell your food producing buildings to deliver their goods directly to the Larder so you're constantly having to manually refill it. It's not a big deal for basic food/water because you can produce them far faster than you'll consume them. But it's a major hassle with the special foods because unless you're devoting a large portion of your population to farming there's no real way to keep up with the demand so you're constantly draging and dropping food items like tomatoes and baked goods from your inventory to the larder.These 2 issues combine to make the experience just as annoying for your housemates and neighbors as it is for you unless you turn off your sound, which isn't a real loss considering there aren't any warning sirens or voice acting outside the tutorials atm. But the music is nice and the sound effects are good and I hate playing games without sound :(At the end of it all though I still recommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone that's a fan of city building and micromanagement games like SimCity, Banished, and Prison Architect. 4/5 stars from me on this and it clearly has potential to become a 5/5 game if they finish it well.

								This game has great potential.  It's tricky to work out what to do at the start as the tutorial gives you quite a few things that aren't available at the game start and you have to work out how to get them.  Just working out what you need for basic food takes a while and if you want to start creating the mats for your own buildings...it's not simple.  But then, I like a challenge!Played for 60 days in game time, built everything there is to build and kinda ran out of things to do.  Made enough money to buy everything and expand to the max ... so... waiting for more content I guess.  Only takes a couple of days (IRL) to run out of stuff to do so only buy this if you're in for a long dev lead time.One thing the game really needs - the ability to queue jobs.  Sending your spaceship out on a particular recovery mission is great and you can rinse and repeat this as many times as you like but if you want your ship to vary what it does you have to set each task manually.  This becomes a bit of a pain after a while - would be great to be able to queue up 'get seaweed' followed by 'get flora' and 'then go get me some metal waste' etc etc..Other thing I don't like is when you un-assign a worker you can't remove him from the org window.  Not a stopper but not great either.Like I said at the start...great potential... :)			"

								Project Aura is great, but not for the impatient. As of Beta 2, your main goal is to funnel your limited resources into creating a self-sufficient ocean-based colony. There's not a whole lot of bredth to the game yet, but there are still a whole lot of places for you to mess up your resource chains, run out of money, and inevitably sit in your seat watching as your citizens starve.If you want a city builder game that holds your hand while you set everthing up- come back later. This game is complicated, the UI is obtuse, and there's very little information on how to play thus far. The tutorials in the game barely touch upon production of necessary resources (fertilizer is the main thing they skip over), and don't cover anything more than how to grow seaweed and allocate workers.That said, with a little bit of trial-and-error, most of the core mechanics of the game become obvious, and it isn't terribly hard to set up a fairly self-sufficient farming community. Once you understand how to navigate the UI, everything gets a lot easier really quickly.Unfortunately, the endgame features are a little sparse, as colony expansion and research are locked off for the time being- but they look like they have a lot of potential. Their planned features page for Beta 3 is pretty encouraging, and I really hope they release a much larger roadmap of what they hope to accomplish with Project Aura, as I'd like to see even more depth to this game.The visuals are great (nicely modeled/textured with a very sleek sci-fi aesthetic), but suffers from weird blurring around the edges of various structures (especially the tutorial bot). This will likely be fixed by the final version though, but is a current issue in Beta 2.The music is fairly good, but ultimately forgettable. Which honestly is better than an extremely noticeable one, as players will likely sink dozens of hours into this game- and a noticeable soundtrack can quickly become an obnoxious one after a while.Also, while not really a review, if you want to see some basic gameplay/how to play, I made a video of Project Aura:

								Had a really positive experience with this game,  especially after I jumped into the forum and saw how responsive the developers were.   The game is in a good shape for a beta,  but it's missing quite a lot of the challenges that are planned in the future and therefore there is the complete absence of threat.  However you get to see the workflow/blueprinting,  and you get a taste of how the game shapes up.   It's pretty much a bug free environment too,  I was able to play for many hours without any issue.There are going to be a lot of risks/challenges when the game is launched,   so it's not your average city-builder at all.   You'll be managing a sinking ship almost,  keeping it afloat through micro-management,  resource management and thinking ahead.  When you take into account the road map for what's coming,  then this is a very exciting development,   especially when you consider how alert the developers are,  and how open they are for feedback.   I do recommend others to buy in now and support the game.  It's well priced for what it currently is,  and I would not be surprised if they put the price up further down the road,  as it becomes a lot more functional. "

								Despite being still under development, Project Aura has a lot of potential to make stratey videogames take a humble step forward. Specially for hardcore players.It's slightly more slow paced and deep than most of the strategy games in the market, but if you give it a try and get used to it, it has a great charm. First it seems to have subtle layers of depth, then, after a few hours you discover more layers, and then more, and more... limiteless posibilities to customize your colony open up before you: food management, waste management, what to develop, how, what are your priorities, what do you want to produce to survive, what to sell... Still, since it's not a 100% finished game, there are things that are missing, little tweaks to make here and there. But, overall, a game I'm expecting to see what can bring to the strategy game fans.			"

								Been playing this for 6 hours now and it's not bad. Not bad at all... It took a while to get into and there are some VERY lengthy processes to make things along with very little in game help... (There is some, just not as much as I would like. Perhaps a process tree which shows you what you need in order to get what you want. Select the item from a very long list and the tree would come up beside it)I think the tutorials need a revamp to better explain things as the 4 available were very short indeed and the last one which shows you how to feed your colony didn't really cover all the bases. The resources needed were handed to you rather than explaining the very lengthy process of obtaining them without buying from the market.As an example, to get food being produced, you need to gather organic waste using an aircraft hanger, process it into seaweed and fertiliser in the recycling plant, feed the seaweed with the fertiliser to get fed seaweed which can then be dried to give you seaweed portions and water. A total of 4 processes, spread across 3 buildings... Google had to help me with that and it was the very first thing you need to produce to support your colony!  In the tutorial, you get given seaweed and fertiliser (IIRC). Jump to the main game and lo and behold, no fertiliser available in the market place. Hurumph. GOOGLE!It is an early access game though so it will improve... probably.That being said, I can see myself throwing a lot of hours at it. It is relatively slow paced (nothing has come along to disrupt my steady growh yet) and so long as you have food production giving you more than you need for your colonists, you have a (somewhat slow) income from selling it off.The water is very pretty.

								A game that has its surprises. First the interface and controls feels clumsy, but once you get the hang of it and discover more and more about the very complex resource management it becomes very addictive. + Addictive complex gameplay+ Orgchart is just amazing (global view would be really good where the entire supply chain would be shown)+ Graphics is generally ok, but could do with a bit of more movement and livelyness- It is very laborous to do practically anything on the ui (Perhaps drag and drop sell to market in the inventory, citizen summoning can be simpler, resource stack split is a nightmare)- It feels deserted without traffic and people wandering around- bugs ""here and there"" (anomalies, build tab keeps disappearing or has to be double clicked on)Definitely worth the money, but it's still a bit raw...

								So far I would recommend this game.  It has all the elements a city builder micromanagement player could ask for without the clutter of extreme warfare.  Think sci-fi Banished on water, but more complicated.  So many games these days have great developement in city/colony management but you are either put under time constraints or you whole city is devoted to weaponary because you are in a warzone.  Also, so far, there aren't any lame need to pay real dollars for contiued play elements.  It is early access but I hope these money grab elements remain not included - there is a member screen within the game so I'm wary.  If you pay for the game, that should be it unless it's a DLC where you get more game for your money.  Not seeds or something rediculous just to play the game.  I'm assuming at some point climate will play a factor in this game.  That should be interesting.  The graphics are very pleasing and handle acceleration nicely if your system is up for it but it still looks great stripped.  I haven't hit a bug yet and it runs smooth.  So far it seems set on an individual playing field.  You seem to be the only colony.  This may change.  If you are looking for a game to play with a friend, I doubt this one will have that.  Maybe a trade element in the future, who knows.  Anyway, the game is intensly hands on, very addicting, and it isn't even done yet.  Hopefully they don't screw it up because so far I can't stop playing the unfinished version :D.			"

								Keep in mind, this is an early access game. There are going to be small hitches and glitches. It happens, and they will probably be ironed out as time goes on. That being said, a quick description of the game. You are the leader of a new colony in the future, trying to build a place for people who have been in cryo sleep to live after the global climate has deteriorated to the point where living outside a protective dome is all but impossible. This game is geared towards people who are willing to keep hundreds of things all balanced. No joke. You have to take care of your people's health, morale, and nutrition. You have to build through 5 differant tech panels. You have to build hundreds of buildings and their substructures to be completely self sufficient. This is definitely a game for people who like to micromanage, because you HAVE to micromanage to succeed. Graphics: Wonderful graphics. The creators definitely took the time to make the game worthwhile to play visually. When they buildings are working, you can see it. When you scroll to the edge of your dome, you can see the rain on it. You can see trenches underwater. This game is visually amazing. 9/10Audio:  The soundtrack is really well done. It is a bit repetitive, but at this stage in the game it is kind of expected. It is actually really beautiful music for the first couple hours. Then you either ignore or mute it. Hopefully they come out with more music to cycle through, because you will spend a lot of time working on your base. Also hoping when they bring in the multiplayer functions they will add some more tracks. 7/10Gameplay:  This is probably the most in depth resource management game I have EVER played. Seriously, you can end up totally self sufficient. Eventually. But holy cow, is there a lot. The crafting system alone is huge. I have 64.7 hours logged into the game, and I still have to buy stuff from the market. Which is all well and good right now, but gods help us if the market prices end up fluctuating based on everyone's purchases. That will end up causing some rediculously inflated prices. The only thing I have issue with is how long it will actually take to play a multiplayer game, even with the victory goals. I love this game so far though. It gives you a real idea how hard it would be to start something like this, as you have to balance so many things at once. 8/10Summary:  This is a good game so far, and I truly hope they can keep it that way. It isn't really hard right now, as much as it is a time consuming thing. If you don't mind being patient and taking the time to tweak things to run smoothly without you having to watch every little thing in case it starts to colapse, then this game is the game for you. It is a resource management game that gives you the complete freedom to build how you want, and then see what works and what doesn't. As new features are added and the game grows, I am excited to see what changes happen.Overall Rating: 8/10 "

								I can see potential in this game. It's just nowhere near ready yet.THE GOODA fresh take on allocating workers to production chains with the blueprint system.THE BADProduction chains are unneccesarily long, and there's no way to figure out what process makes what before you build the building.Updates happen verryyy slowly. For an early access game like this I would expect a weekly or fortnightly post from the devs.THE UGLYI had to look up an external guide on how to make fertilizer, which is required for pretty much everything. Turns out that fertilizer production was hidden in a sub-menu. Which was hidden in a blueprint. And the game didn't tell me what the blueprint did before I purchased it, so there was no way of knowing.Give this game another six months or so, and see how it goes.			"

								the game is cool but has a long learning curve, after you satisfy the basic levels like food recycling and water, you begin to wander what will be the next step, plastic, improved food, metal or airplane craft.There is no help on line and not a wiki help, just the basic, but the game is intriguing and the beta 3 has a lot of improvements, don't play hard the game is not implemeted for it, choose medium or better easy if you want to learn fast,I gave this game several hours and now i must choose my path for develop my colony, i think i will go for airplane craft.anyway i give atm to the game 8/10 so it will worth your money,			"

								***Early Access Review***This is probably one of those games that I least expected to get addicted to.Its a city builder that (at least for me) had a rather steep learning curve. Typicly that makes me walk away and not return, but thankfully I was persistant this time and kept doing new city after new city unitl I finally got the tech tree right. Hopefuly, the tutorials will get an overhaul and be made more compleate as the current setup is very lacking.The visuals are sub-par compared to other games within this genra and era, but the layout and mechanics does make up for it enough so as not to become a problem. I do like how that the tech tree is rather well spread out, and its made up so you are not fixed into one path, but there are certainly those that are easier to follow than others (for example, I like to make money by spamming water/seaweed. Its low value compared to others, but easy to complete and avalible at game onset). The diversity of the crew that you can recruit is also a nice touch as you need to pair up the best citizen with the job in question. A good idea is also to give the ability to shoehorn in other citizens when your optimal choice is not readily avalible so you still do get room to play if your impatient (I'm a perfectionist so I typicly wait for the right citizen to spawn)One of my favorite compontents is the blueprints for building contruction. It gives you a lot of versitility early and late game. To start you can keep things small but later on when you want to start building mega-complexes to limit staff needs (have one director instead of four, and only two workshops instead of four). Plus altering existing bluprints does not affect existing constructs which can be very handy. I would like to see the blueprint areas to expland slightly by a few more squares, but that is more of a nice touch than a requirement.Another component of the game that I very much enjoy is the recycling theme. While its a great nod to enviromentalisim, it does play in a huge part of the mechanics of the game. To start with you rely heavily on money, but once you get your infastructure up, you rely on cash less and less as your ability to produce your needs rise. Additionally, very much of what you build for your city is recyclable, allowing you to nuke-n-pave your city as you learn the game and expand without signifigant punishment as (at least in easy mode) you get 100% of your materials back.My biggest complaint, which may be fixed as the game develops, is the pacing of the game early on. It can take a large amount of patience to get your colony self-sufficent in the early stages until your able to produce food and plastic(or)metal on a sustainable scale. One reason is that your still reliant on having a cash income to which you can only gain by selling what you produce, but another hangup is being able to awaken the right staff at any given time. Right now, your randomly presented a list of staff that can be awakened to join your colony from a list of one to a dozen, and quite often I found myself waiting for a technitian or director to pop up just so I can get a building to even be funtional. Yes I could have pluged in other staff, but as I said above I am a perfectionist. What I would like to see is the ability to force-select a particular junior citizen but at a high cost so one does not have to wait for the RNG to give up your need.Overall I do belive that once polished it will be a fantasic game and for those looking for something a little different than the typical city-builder and is looking for a challenge, its a good game to pick up. I hope the makers will continue to give us updates to enjoy. Be warned, it can be quite a timesink once you get hooked into it.			"

Early Access Review
								I approve. ~11 hours in but I'd still recommend. Went to bed last night with nodes dancing in my vision...Quick list of pros/cons so far (will update as I play more)...Pro:+Cool setting+Production chains seem cool and rewarding once completed though I've seen people complain they're too long.+I have my first like 7 step production chain running and it makes me happy.+Colonists can be personalized though you barely see them...+I actually like the node system - just gotta remember to start production as buildings won't autostart. Perhaps a Preference in options to enable this by default would be good?+YOU CAN HARVEST POOP!+So many nodes.Con:-Click and drag is very laggy and unresponsive for me. Could just be my PC but the game runs fine.-Could just be my novice status so far but the Power Grid is annoying and convoluted. I figured it out but I'm still low on power. Starting ""Packs"" could royally slow your expansion down if you choose the not so ideal ones.-Info on Research seems quite scant. Wasn't in the tutorials. I think I've figured it out though. You won't be able to trade with all faction on the market without Diplomacy research - wherever that is. Again, starting affinity could slow your expansion down too.Neutral:~I'd like to be able to zoom in more.~Tutorials are good overall but I think could have used some more details (there is in-game text help)~When splitting stacks, it should just appear in your inventory instead of having to drag the stack back to the inventory from the little window. Should also be able to type in a number in this window.~Multiple windows open at a time can get annoying. Escape key will close them quickly enough and saves this from being a con.~Previous untested patches caused people to get locked out of supply chains. Was patched. Hopefully won't happen again.So, will update as I play more. I'd recommend in its current state despite only 2.7 hours of playtime :)			"

Early Access Review
								Ah, how to say the right words about this game.I've been playing for over a year now, every few months I try it out again. And every time I remember why I love it and spend the next 10+ hours playing it nonstop. This game is the pinnacle of resource management games, and will be even better when all features are implemented. But even if development stops tomorrow it'd still be a game well worth the (scrolls down) $16.99. I thought I remembered paying $20 for it, and it was worth every penny. I highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys balancing inputs and outputs of materials, building ratios, population management, and any other types of administrative gameplay. I loved Sim City (originals, not the crappy 2013 one), I love Cities Skylines, I love Factorio, and if you like those games too then you will enjoy this one.Development is continuing, and the dev(s?) is always very quick to respond to suggestions/requests on the forums, which makes me more willing to contribute.Given that it's early access, unimplemented mecanics don't really count as cons. The only real con is that there is an unusually high barrier to entry. It probably took me a good two hours to figure out all of the mechanics and UI tricks to get to the point where I didn't want to do something and have no idea how to do it. But the depth of the game is comparable to the amount of time it takes to learn. Nobody sits down and understands how to play Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II in the first two hours. This game is to city management as those games are to 4X Strategy.  In other words, the best and most in-depth.That being said, pretty much all of the keyboard shortcus that you would want are there. It's even pretty easy to figure things out once you realize that you can probably do what you want if you hold shift or ctrl while pressing the button. Lastly, one thing I love about this game (but could see being off-putting for other city builder liking types) would be that there is very little layout management. Oh, there's a lot of nit picking you can do with exactly how to shape the buildings in the plot size, but mostly the game comes down to the fact that you don't spend a lot of time designing your colony. Rather, you spend your time running it. If you love building roads then this game isn't for you. If building roads and finding the most efficient layout is a sometimes fun but mostly tedious process (as it is for me) then this is the game for you.All in all, I highly recommend it. Buy it. I hope this game gets big, because it deserves it.			"

								Very much still not a finished product, the tutorial doesn't really teach you any of the mechanics and it is very much a start a save, figure out the mechanics from screwing up, start a new save with what you learned, probably screw something else up and restart again. Only really has a sandbox mode in its current state, and even on easy mode (starting with twice as much money) the start of the game is about as interactive as a ""clicker game"" of setting up a few buildings, hireing people and appointing them jobs and then waiting ages until you can afford anything new because the start of the game you make money at a snails pace and everything is fairly expensive.Alright, with all the (important)negitives out of the way (there are a few more small negitives, but I was more concerned about the bigger things), this game is a fairly interesting game that definitly shows some depth to the management.  It's not to disimilar to factoria where at the very start you have to do everything by hand and it is very slow going but as you get more built up you can start to automate more and more things. Again biggest complaint of being how long it goes at a snails pace before you start to be able to do more interesting things.In the current state would I say the game is worth $17? For most people no, it shows promise of being a good game worth the asking price, but in its current state I would hold off on the purchase until much closer to release unless your really into seeing how games like Factoria and this progress in development over time. I personally feel like I will easily get my moneys worth in its current state, but I know that most people probably would not.Would I recomend this game? Yes, I would just say unless your really into this genre to hold off till closer to release unless you like learning game mechanics through trial and error because the tutorial doesn't even scratch the surface of what you need to learn to make it very far into the game at all, the tutorial is literitly just the base mechanics and doesn't even teach you how to make money or even sell products, I know in one save I accidently deleted stacks of things I wanted to sell because the same key to sell a stack of items is used to delete a stack of items depending on which windows are open or not.

								As of v2.11:Project AURA is an interesting take on survival city builder formula - think Banished or Anno 2070 (but more focused).It has quite fancy graphics that again remind me of Anno 2070 a lot. And I'd say that's a good thing.The number of buildings in the game is quite limited (even with more coming soon), but that's not a big problem, because all the flexibility comes from building configurations, not the building themselves.Yep, same building can do different things by swapping out Blueprints that are used for production (at the moment there's not too many alternatives for blueprints, but this is something that can and probably will be easily extended).Add here the fact that all your citizens / employees are actual NPCs with separate skills, desires and stats. Plus the fact that you need to manage power consumption / production to make sure your dom protects your from disasters.Plus the fact that you need to manage food and menus to make sure everyone has enough nutritions, etc. And you get a pretty sophisticated city builder with focus on surviving in hostile environment.I haven't encountered any serious bugs during my playtime.Most of the issues the game has are pretty minor and mostly related to UI and UX, which means they can be easily fixed.I must note that as of v2.11 only sandbox mode is available, and the time flows pretty slowly, so be prepared to spend hours upon hours in the game to achieve a nice town.If that's not your kind of gameplay - I'd wait until campaign and quests are introduced.More detailed look in the video:

								Graphics/artwork is top notch. UI and controls are complex but clean and well laid out, making it a pleasant experience to manage the finer details. Complexity of the game is high but not enough to put you off, a good balance. Generally the structure of the game is pretty awesome. Shows massive potential.Gameplay.. Currently a bit boring. However the recent patch with catastrophes etc should change things up and obviously more is planned. But, as it stands I found it too easy to quickly construct the basics and not only produce the basic food/water to sustain my citizens but a production line that quickly produced surplus. At that point it was click the time acceleration into max and sit back and sell the surplus to build the cash reserves back up. This was the point the game hit grind mode and I started to lose interest. I hadn't even touched on the advanced buildings/vehicles/citizens.Fair enough the object is to get as many citizens out of storage and find the balance to sustain the base but it was all too easy to hit the mass production to grind away for cash.I still recommend the game as it is very professionally produced and put together. It has a real tight foundation so I am expecting good things.			"

								Being in beta, it's not designed to get you into the game slowly yet. E.g. prices are not balanced (pretty much everything costs 500 coins), all buildings and advancements are available at start, etc. It takes time to figure out what exaclty you need to build to get things going. (hint: build a hanger and buy a ship to begin getting raw materials). But once you figure it out, there is not much to do in game yet. There are no quests or challanges you need to face (as of version 2.8).Also, as any early access game it has a lot of minor issues.But it sure has a great potential.I liked the level of management and manufacture chains this game brings. And a lot of other things too.All in all it's an interesting game.Still needs a lot of polishing.			"

								While Project AURA is still in it's early stages, it is a fantastic simulation of creating/running a colony after a climate disaster.  There is a ton of potential available, and by the looks of it the devs are tapping into it from the amount of commuity interaction, and updates.There is a good portion of mircomanagement, you decide which colonists you wish to awake and where to employ them.  You control the food, production, and resource gathering.  As well you contol which buildings you want operating, what the function of some of them are, maintenance management, while keeping an eye on your power requirements.Depending on start-up options, the game can be more challanging by having less startup credits.  Even on normal there is a limited amount, so funds should be managed carefully until a good balance of production is established.For people who enjoy playing a simulation that is not extremely fast paced but requires a little bit of mircomanagement, this is definitely worth playing, and supporting it's future developement!  Highly recommended!			"

But once you figure it out, It gets kind of too easy; though the colonist comming at a random paste makes it take  awhile, and I feel like some of the buildings should have offedges to the water for production. Aside from that, It's a great game, I can't wait to see this get updated more and more.DislikesThe speed up only goes to x8.The template building cannot house more than one aircraft,Odd building structures & a portel needed for EVERY building.Tutorial is a joke.. lol			"

								Silky: Complexity, depth, longevity of games, replayability.Rough: Learning curve, documentation...oo00oo..This is a good game IF you're the right kind of audience. That's probably not the most of endearing statements to make but there's a reason for it.The learning curve, given it's development state and expected evolving documentation, is steep. It took several starts to actually work out what I had to do and I'll be honest, several times I nearly wtfragequit and many times I was heard muttering ""ffs"" when the game just did not comply or didn't make sense - and I'm the gentle type. It was downright frustrating - having said that, most of the issues seemed to stem (in hindsight) from lack of good documentation for something that is not simple to play. By perservering (and you should), every new start revealed a little more and what keeps you playing is the complexity - no, it's not overwhelming but it's not a casual game either. This is an intriguing title - parroting much of the sim/build/upgrade genre - but there are some clever tech/progress gates that appear a bit blunt (almost traumatic) until you identify the ""right"" way to do it - well at least until you're ready to *really* upgrade with extra rings to increase the size of your colony. (I sincerely hope that's not too cryptic but it's the closest I could get to the inherent beauty of this title - it just sucks you into ""just one more build/fix/adjustment"" well past midnight).It will take you hours to identify those nuances embedded that make your colony shine and respond the way you hope and I found the LESS I tried to force the pace (a legacy of devs developing for the time-poor and casual audience these days) the better the game became.I mentioned the type of audience you need to be here. Let me just say you need to be borderline anal-retentive, analytical, patient, forgiving and self-deprecating (it's probably not the games fault, it's YOU) and it's really helpful if you like the type of game that encapsulates intriguing gameplay, complete with probable lore to explain your situation.As an EA title at time of writing, the active and listening devs are working on the documentation - among the frequent updates and bug report responses they address almost immediately. There are no faults in this department.For the price - an easy buy. The test to whether you will like it or not is by considering whether what I wrote made sense to you. If it did, buy it. If it didn't..... :)			"

It's just that I've had the game since like 2 weeks after it hit the store and I don't want to play it so much I get all bored with it before they even finish it. But like I said, it's progressing well enough and it's an ambitious game so I can't complain. Besides, it was very bare bones when they first started selling copies and it's development progress has surpassed by leaps and bounds other, far less complex games that have been in early access for YEARS.

								Based on what I've played with so far this game definitely has great potential. I would like to note that if and/or when this game is fully developed that the devs build more on exploration outside of the colony and maybe interacting with other colonies for trade, conquest, diplomacy, etc. This game is very similar to Anno 2047 but with its own uniqueness. I would recommend this as a buy, but for those who are wary, I would say wait for more development or the full release.			"

								Finnaly got to play game! Hotfix resolved my issues.There are some very cool managment features to this game. The organaztion chart gives you alot of control over what your colonists are doing.It is still clearly a Beta, and many features youd expect are still missing, but if they are eventualy implemented with the same level of quality the rest of it has seen so far, I expect a great game.

								Excellent concept, and hopefully heading in the right direction.If you are a fan of city building games, especialy the micromanagment aspects, then give this game a go. The price is about right for what the end result should be. The tutorial is a little bit weak so have a look for the inevitable LPs online.			"

								Very good game idea. Obviously since it is early access you should expect bugs and incomplete features. Currently the game is playable but is not near completion. The tutorial is in so you will not have to struggle to figure out the mechanics yourself. If you are not prepared to deal with bugs and changing features though i would recommend waiting until launch. As of right now the core mechanics for citizens/food/work are currently in but there are no disasters to put your city building to the test yet.			"

								Difficult to get the hang of at first and TONS to pay attention to during gameplay (often find myself pausing to check all production lines). Very much for micromanagement lovers. Expect to start new games frequently while Early Access to figure out what's new, what's broken now, and what now behaves completely differently. Watch the sun rise and find yourself saying ""but I still need just ONE more core innovation doc....""Love it! Only game I've found that can satisfy my micromanagement needs as well as the guild 2.F2 hotkey is the BEST feature of this game!!!			"

								Awesome game, just awesome ...If you are a Simcity fan but always felt like smashing your head on the wall because the game is so broken, had to mod its mother and even then after certain point the game become super laggy and slow even though your hardware is 200 times stronger then the recommended requriements, then this is the game for you!This one has EVERYTHING simcity 3 4 and 2013 had to offer and more! Without the lag, without broken machanics, It's almost flawless once you catch the drill!I have to say the game is super hard for starters and there is almsot 0 guides consider it's still early access but even though, still awesome!The closest example I can give you is the Academic and Omega expansion from Simcity 2013, just 100 times better while you have 100% control on everything!The even more fun part is, you shouldn't worry about random cash spikes that destroy your city in 10 seconds out of no where, here you can be bankrupt all day long, but! if you are careless, your whole colony would die! :DIt is harder and take some time to get to that point, however, it is a lot harder to avoid it ...I played over 12 hours on the same city and I felt like its huge, but then I realized I haven't even expanded 20% of the maximum size, too fun!:) "

								Review posted as of 14 Jan 2015. This game shows great promise in the simulation/colony-building genre. As with most early access games, this game has quite a number of features lacking and it does not have about half of its major content, which should be released soon when it hits beta 3. What hooked me into this game was the intricate economy system and the production workflows which is affected by the differing skill levels of the colonists you awake from cryosleep, which are in some ways similar to games like Anno 2070 and the likes. The game is also pretty challenging and that is where hardcore fans of this genre will not be disappointed, as the default difficulty will already present a decent challenge, not to mention that there are still 2 more difficulty levels after that.

Early Access Review
								It's another supply chain management game. It does a couple things really well (and a couple of things not-so-well), but ultimately doesn't really have any charm. There's no real objective other than ""survive"", but surviving never really feels like a struggle until you hit about 50 colonists and morale becomes a gigantic issue out of nowhere (colonists either die to poor health from not enough food/water or if you fix that problem they become rebels from poor morale due to not enough tier 2 food stuffs). The gap in difficulty between tier 1 food and tier 2 food is astoundingly high and feels like one of the biggest flaws in the design of the game's supply chain. It's way too hard to recover seeds, plant and grow said seeds, ensure you have new seeds left over from the previous crop, etc. It requires a fair amount of micromanagement, and inevitably everything goes horribly wrong while you're paying attention to one aspect of the game and another goes kerblewy. You could play the game on pause, but that would only be more tedious than the game already tends to be.Ultimately, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was on a never-ending quest to get to the next tier of item, which would require progressively more micromanagement to sustain. The game desperately needs some macromanagement capabilities. But even if that got fixed, I don't know that I'd enjoy it, because the game never really gives you a reason to care if your colonists live or die.			"

								Project Aura is a good game for being an early access title. It tends to have a high learning curve with very little in the way of actual instructions on how to do various tasks.  the tutitorial is limited in explaining the various mechanics of the game but with some trial and error and many restarts the game is enjoyable to play.  Dont expect to be going anywhere fast with this title either as the game is a bit of a grinder.  Make sure to take advantage of the automated resource gatherers AKA the Alpha ship and recycling centers. once they are set up it is possible to keep your people alive without breaking the bank buying resourcesThe Devs do need to fix some issues that they may already be aware of.  Game instability on exit and various crashes in-game to name a few.  While the beginning is rocky I look forward to the future of this title.			"

								Great game with tons of potential! This is early access so hopefully the devs will continue not only to improve but to add much more content. The game even at it's early stages will keep you captivated for hours upon hours with it's balancing of city building and population stratagies.The only downside at this point is there is very little in the way of a guide to help. Several times I found myself searching frantically to find help for gameplay. A manual or how to guide could really be useful for players on city building. For instance if I want to build a ship what do I need to reach that goal instead of searching for the information via online.A working chain guide would be helpful for mats, factories, food ext.Other than that - love it! Looking forward to updates!			"

But if you want to participate to the elaboration of a very interesting city-builder strategic game, it is the right time.

								Frankly, Project AURA is amazing. The game enough impressed me to write a real recommendation, which is a first for me.  (I think I might have written and deleted one for a badge or something). Project AURA really stands apart from other games in that it takes the player's intelligence seriously. Playing the game, you'll be tasked with managing and constructing EVERY aspect of a futuristic city on water. You might think, oh that's easy, recruit a few people, plop a few buildings, and watch them all chug along. To quote the president-elect: WRONG! You have to pay attention to every aspect of the production chain, from building maintenance for every building, to extracting the raw materials, to power production, distribution, and storage, to buying and selling the relevant components, to making sure the building have proper management and organization, to acquiring the relevant production blueprints, and designing the production facilities themselves. Oh! Also make sure everyone has food, drink, and entertainment. Marginal to moderate failure in any one of these categories, or others that I haven't listed here, can lead to catastrophic failure of your colony. If you fail, it's because YOU forgot or missed something. Use of the official wiki is recommended: http://en-wiki.projectaura.com/Main_PageAt its core, Project AURA is a surprisingly solid, yet completely unforgiving, mashup of Dwarf Fortress, Anno 2070, and Banished. If you have the patience to try, fail, and learn, you're rewarded with a pretty, futuristic, and intricate city. What more can you ask for?+Great and complicated systems take critical thinking+A good amount of discovery involved in some of the higher levels of the game+Pleasant to look at and play, once you get a handle on the UI+Still being developed: More content to come-You will not figure the game out without metagaming-Complexity is equal parts frustrating, challenging, and fun-Still being developed: Bugs and Language Issues (Like every Early Access title)TLDR: Hard, complicated, fun game that is worth $20, even in Early Access. Although, if reading a few paragraphs is too much, the game might not be for you.			"

But when i want to grow bigger i use more energy then i'm producing. I've fully upgraded the energy supply but the input from the generator is simply to low. Solarpanels or diesel / atomic generators which increase the initial input from the generator would be great. Solarpanels could be produced with some plastic and electric material and could use mainteinance. diesel or atomic generators could be a seperat building which needs diesel/uranium brought by ship and transformed by some recycling plants ;)thanks for your great work!

								It's a very fun Toy. Starting out with the game the learning curve is a bit like standing at the foot of a cliff. It took me two runs through the tutorial to get enough of a grasp to be off.While the interface surely could be easier it does have character, contributing to the games undoubted sense of atmosphere. Somehow it does feel like humankind's last momentous chance for redemption. You can't move much beyond the confines of your habitat, but that just adds to the sense of how humankind's world has shrunk. Which together with the games intricate mechanics make for a great concept with an original feel for familiar rewards.Yes there are bugs which they sorely need to fix if this game is going to appear release grade, but I have found the game quite playable already.Very enjoyable so far.----Update... actually I am loving this game at the moment! Yes it seems baffling here and there, but a little perseverence and you discover that all the tools you needed to work out how to solve your resource scaling problems are there. It is being made to work a bit to find that solution which makes the results of finding the solution extra rewarding....and the soundtrack really adds to the atmsphere. It's superb in it's own right!			"

								Overall, Project Aura is a great game concept centred around a strong environmental message. Pixel Quality Games have hit the balance of micromanagement and survival difficulty perfectly, and created and extremely addictive game. My only criticisms are that some of the mechanics are unclear, and many of the menus are difficult to navigate. However, Pixel are welcoming all player feedback and I am sure these minor issue will be finessed in later updates. I can't wait to see the final shape of this game and will continue to play along throughout its development.Project Aura is the first venture for Pixel Quality Games, and has received widespread community support through Steam Greenlight. Aura is a survival/strategy game currently in Early Access. I am a big fan of the concept behind this game. The developers are aiming to make an engaging gaming experience, while conveying a message of sustainability, and climate change awareness. In support of the message behind the game, the devs are also contributing 2% of all game earnings to environmental causes that will be selected through voting, on social networks.At sometime in the 21st century, global warming multiplied by human activities was responsible for the extinction of most of the life on Earth. Those who survived built floating cities on the ocean surface. Within each city the survivors slept in cryo-preservation, awaiting a time when they could awaken and rebuild.The player is in charge of one such floating city, and must build the structures required to house and support the newly awakened survivors. All of the building materials required can be purchased from the market or gathered and recycled through various colony structures. Players are also responsible for assigning each survivor a job in the colony, and must take into consideration the natural aptitude of each person.Food rationing must also be managed throughout the game, and players who do not construct a food production line early on, will inevitably watch as their colonists slowly starve. I had a great time building structures and gather resources, and it is very satisfying reaching the point of colony self sufficiency.Aura is in the first stages of Early Access, so making a colony self sufficient and then maintaining its population growth is all that's on offer at the moment. Even with these limited mechanics I got hooked easily on this title and I can't wait to see the inclusion of, research goals, quests, city energy shield management and many other mechanics in the final release. There is an in game tutorial included with the Beta, but it is a bit bare bones, so I recommend reading the forums before starting, as some of the key bindings are not obvious but are needed to facilitate the experience.For my full review and other delicious content see Glitch "

								First Impressions:""Project AURA"" has a ""Stargate: Atlantis"" vibe about it in that you'll be leading a colony of disaster survivors via a network of cities on the open seas.  Your goal will be to provide for their needs as well as to help them prosper...though the way you go about doing that isn't as simple as some other city management games I've played. This game can be a bit overwhelming at first as there's a bit of micromanagement involved, mainly by way of organizational charts that require you to connect vital components together.  I'm still relatively new to the game but I'm enjoying my time with it thus far and look forward to seeing what the game will ultimately allow me to do.

								This game is, at the moment, nothing more than a ""production line"" type of game. A very intricate and complicated one.Granted, a very interesting one too, given that it's still EARLY ACCESS.But I can't see the final game to be any more than this.I can't ""feel"" the background of the story. It's supposed to be about the ""survivors"" of the mother of all climate changes, but then right from the get-go, you find out that there are...corporations to trade with. Uhhhh....There goes the backstory.So apparently, human economy and industry outside your domed colony has survived all these years that the colonists spent in cryo-stasis. Would be nice if we could have a backstory to these ""corporations"" that fit in with the rest of the backstory. How the heck did they survive all these years? Who the heck were their clients that they did business with? It can't be just the survivors in Project Aura. They were all asleep until now.So, like I said, it's nothing more than a very intricate and complicated ""production line"" type of game. Your first moves would probably be to ""buy"" a cargo plane and materials to build it's hangar and awaken the right kinds of colonists to operate this facility, so you could go out of your dome to look for raw materials. Once you have food and water self-sufficiency, you'd probably aim to built some kind of industry, or expand your food production capabilities. Whichever, at this time, your concern would be to sell stuff that you acquire/manufacture. Recycling within your colony is given a premium. You even get to recycle your colonists' #1 and #2. You send out your planes to gather all sorts of garbage, and turn them into something useful.If you're into this type of games, then you'll love this game. I can't say that I am into this kind of game though. I do find it quite interesting, but sooner or later, it may just end up like how Banished ended up in my Steam Library.			"

It was kind of awesome and kind of awful ... micromanagey, and resource constrained to the point where if you couldn't find some minor trace element your colony would peter out and die. Basically, you always failed. I guess the point was that you can't create a modern technological economy / society with just a few people and a starting building, no matter how shiney that building.This game isn't quite like that. You are unlikely to actually perish, as food is readily available, and all the resources are available if you know how to get them. What is likely to happen is stagnation, as you have absolutely no idea at any stage what is needed to advance on any front. Developing any new production line or capability is onerous, and you have no idea if you'll have the requirements in place to actually use the output of your painfully constructed new production chain. The answer is probably no. You did it in the wrong order. Har har. Loser. I erase your time.How annoying. I give it multiple thumbs up.I have the free time to shrug that off and enjoy the learning process and the complexity. If you don't, buy something clickey and fast. This is unclickey, slow, and opaque.I imagine eventually they'll add a general resource flowchart so you can see what's needed for what, like a tech tree, but for stuff. Currently you can query what any particular resource is used for, and how you can produce it, but it's like examining individual leaves to figure out the shape of a tree. It doesn't really work. You just have to build up the resource flowchart in your head over time. It turns out it's not hard to advance once you know how.If you enjoy micromanagement, I say buy it. All you have to lose is your patience. and a couple of bucks I guess "

Early Access Review
								I've voted for this game on Greenlight since i like strategy games, especially ones with micro and macro management. I've also viewed a gameplay video and decided to buy it myself since its only about 6 bucks here.At the moment it appears to be in a very... very raw state indeed to the point of being barely playable.Two major issues encountered right at the main menu - title music gets so loud at some point that it almost hurts your ears while type font is pretty close to being unreadable and hurting your eyes. Assaulting a player at two fronts simultaneously in the first couple of minutes is not a good start.I've launched the tutorial and found it decent enough for an alpha. The graphics were quite pleasant, especially shield animation and rain outside said shield. I wish the were more ""elements"" outside like acid rains, snows, thunder strikes, radiation or at least a sun, but the world seems to be bare at the moment - its just ocean and rain all around you. Night and day cycle doesn't exist either though shadows appear to be moving along. At this point i've also encountered a lighting bug (everything went dark) which was fixed when i switched off anti-aliasing (its not a major issue for an early access game, just mentioning it for others who might encounter same bug).When i got to the actual game it reminded me of Capitalism and Capitalism Lab because of the constant micromanagement it involves. It also became apparent that tutorial was completely useless and did not cover even 1/10 of the information you need to start playing. If i hadn't seen the gameplay video on youtube i would not have known how to play at all. Tutorial didn't even mention how to speed up the game (shift and numpad + by the way) which is essential if you don't want to wait for hours to fabricate the stuff you need.Then there's a fabrication process itself which relies completely on your micromanagement skills - you'll have to manually start the process often since you simply won't have enough resources to put it on several cycles at ones. It would've been swell if you didn't have to wait for an essential ""fertilizer"" for several minutes to get seaweed rations and tomatos which also take quite a lot of time to make. At the very least they could've made fabrication process completely automatic so it would craft the items without needing to constantly start the process manually even if you don't have enough resources at the moment. Tutorial doesn't even explain how can you get that fertilizer by the way, so i had to search forums where you are being directed to wiki which is currently ""under works"". Even putting food inside a menu or placing buildings is a chore since sometimes your clicks do not register properly for some reason.Buildings can be made into templates, which basically consist of an entrance, main factory or house and additional modules. I like this idea i just wish that popup windows been more responsive and text more readable. Right now its incredibly frustrating to make those templates and buy needed resources on the market (also not explained in the tutorial) as you can barely see what you are doing. The last part of this game involves ""unfreezing"" colonists so you can use them as workers/directors/technicians at your plants which would've been an amazing feature if you could actually select them yourself instead of relying on a ""roulette"" style of getting them, where you get them at random and might end up with a lot of useless mouth's to feed later on. Its your colony - shouldn't you be able to select whomever you want to settle it? Perhaps making it harder and more expensive to unfreeze different skills and levels of colonists would've been a better idea.Overall - the game is pretty raw even by the early access standards. It can be compared to ""war for the overworld"" in being barely playable and not exactly fun at the moment. Slapping it with an ""alpha"" tag would've been appropriate. I really want to like this game and i hope that i will change my mind when or if this game is finished but right now i can't recommend it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So it's been more than a year and several major patches been applied to this game. I've decided t o launch it again and unfortunately found out that not much has been changed since then.Same obnoxious music in the main menu, same horrifying UI and same barely playable game which froze 15 seconds after i started while i was messing with energy settings.It feels like the developers just ""don't get"" that it's not enough to have a good idea behind a game - you also must have a proper way to relay that idea to a player. You can't make a strategy game without good UI, im sorry - but you just can't. Tiny messy windows with a lot of abbreviations and no tooltips cannot be considered a good UI. I've mentioned capitalism 2 before - it's old. It's very old. It's horrifyingly old. Yet it has better UI than this game. It's just not right.I can overlook bugs (ok, its beta, i get it). I can live with the music choice. I can eventually learn what you have to do on wiki, forums and youtube since tutorial is still lacking. But i just can't recommend a game with this UI.I don't know if it's possible to change and save this game at this stage but if it is - just play Cities Skylines, Capitalism 2 any other city building or economical sim and take some inspiration. At the very least - make UI windows bigger and more readable (start from colonist creation and color pallet), make tooltips and less abbreviations. If you can't make unique and interesting UI - at least settle for usable and readable one.Hopefully it's not the end.			"

								I bought this game 2 days ago, a little more than a quarter of that time has been spent playing this game. It is rich, complicated, and perhaps most importantly, difficult without being unforgiving. Can you mess up? Yes. Will it end your game? No. The game gives you all the information you need to be successful, but perhaps not in the most intuitive way. I'm excited to see how adverse weather changes the gameplay; and cannot wait till there's a story/campaign added.			"

This game is all about complex ideas and intricate planning.  You have to be dedicated to the cause to be-able to enjoy it.  However, if you've played Minecraft to death and would rather have something a bit more grown up, then give it a try.

								First i want to say that this game is not really in conidtion to make much fun because its a bit laggy and not optimized to work well.Pro- i like this kind of economy simlution game - big pro is i never seen this concept- currently its in a state that without the lags and stuff its really good- good system with blueprints ( you can customise your building blueprints and fit into your stuff)- it works pretty good and is still early acces if you dont look at the laggy stuff and some little issues - if you like anno and minecraft  you have here his son or daughter with more frozen people that you heat in a microwave      if you like there jobs - i love the lazyness of this game i mean you can just click buttons to buy all your stuff than you can just use a blueprint                     to build an hole complex of factory on top you can just click and get all you bodys get a job.- nice soundtrack- use the ♥♥♥♥ing F1 and F2 keys Con - Dont try the tutorial use the ♥♥♥♥ing F1 and F2 keys or better watch an lets play or something on youtube.pls remove the tutorial its more confusing than helping your F1 Toolipps are much better if you show them the player more its really much better than the tut.- yea about the laggs and stuff this killed my fun for now i will come later back and will play it again because i want to enjoy this game its much better than this current state I want to recomend  this game on your wishlist or try it and make you owen vision on this. I will wait for some months and get the full balls exploding experience.			"

Early Access Review
Please note that the current build of this game (Beta 2.11) is a sandbox and does not reflect finished game product.Not all features, gameplay, and even buildings have been implemented as of yet and this is a Beta with early access. If you never played a game that is in early access Beta and do not want to be bothered by it's ""incompleteness"", at present this game is not for you. Remember this game is an early acess Beta and not a publisher Beta. There is a difference between those two concepts.You have most likely read the other user reviews and maybe even read some of my postings about the current game build and it's balancing issues so I won't go into game specifics. I would need to highlight that there is a steep learning curve when playing this game as though there is a tutorial, it's very basic. It does not cover basic ""early game"" concepts like resource gathering, production of building materials, and energy/maintenance management. Research and tech upgrading has not been implemented as of yet, as with a host of other game features. For now the game is a sandbox where you can just really expiriment with ""Tetris"" style buiding template design, resource gathering, and resource management. This game, as of right now, requires you to micromanage your colony and it's associated resource gathering and production. Through in the fact that you will need to mind your energy reserves as each building and production of materials requires both energy points and maintenance points, which all buildings will require and fight over. It will be balanced as the game progresses towards completion.Bottom line if you are the impatient type, this game in it's current build is not for you. However if you enjoy a game and:are PATIENThave lots of time to sparewilling to play an early access builddon't mind it being in early access beta you have some $$$ to spareThis game may be for you.

								This game looks nice but after 40mns of search I do not manage to put hands on one of the main components of any good city : the fertilizert for plants... There seem be many good ideas but the tuto in 4 poor stages of 3mns each with already supplied components (without explaining how to obtain them) is very too empty to get ready for the mass of things to manage which arrives when you launch a real game. In brief a lot of good ideas but a heavy handling with very too little indication.I put 15 euros (a bit expensive for this kind of early access) in this project to encourage its development and I am going to express a favorable opinion in front of the good announced ideas, but at the moment my experience of gaming a little cooled me.

								Two thumbs up and 8/8 from me, I'm hooked on this game!! 74 hours in and counting.  I can't play any other game right now.  Innovative management game that really satifies a certain itch.  The 2.95 patch really fleshed it out to a point where you wouldnt be completely disappointed if they just stopped there, but the great news is that there is even more to come. If you love games like factorio, sim city 2013, or planetbase, and don't mind the complexity of games like eve online or distant worlds universe, then you are probably the kind of person that will enjoy this game as well.  (Although it's not really as complex as those last two).  There are elements of survival, city building, population happiness, resource management, and production chain management.  You can speed up time and pause the game to do a series of actions similar to stellaris / civ 5. This game favors giving you full control and tons of power, and is not afraid of giving you the jam packed user interface required to do so.  The tutorial is excellent in conveying the spirit of how the game is supposed to be operated.  It tells you enough to get you started but no more.  Make no mistake: You must have love figuring things out on your own, and not expecting to be handheld from the start to finish of a game.  Figuring out what to do on your own is part of the fun of the game.  Between the tutorial, the F1 help (which is actually HELPful), the F2 screen, and the tooltips, you are given enough information to figure out the rest.			"

								It's in its alpha stage. you can't really complain about the bugs, which are probably going to be fixed soon. Oh well, just have to suffer. Anyways, it's a cool game. Micromanagement and you have to really find a way to get a good profit. I like it. Hours of fun. It would be awesome if it was mulitplayer somehow! Which seems kind of hard. Find an angle on it... Maybe your cities are seperate but could interact with each other. While also selling your items to others for a good profit.OH! also if your still listening. It says ""recommended"" there is windows Vista and windows 7 are the recommended. 1) windows vista isnt even supported anymore. (being in 2015 I dont get how they have that even up anymore) 2) I guess I can kinda see windows 7 being a little more powerful seeing as how their drivers are more... optimized for gaming. but none the less, the new technology age is coming.

I couldnt figure out how to turn the game speed up either, so it was pretty slow.  Everything needs to be bought off the market, but ultimately your goal is to either buy base materials and sell finished products, or maintain self sufficieny.It seems like this game does have potential, but there isnt much to it other then the resource balancing act.   I felt more connection with Banished, when it came to resource management so far.  Im sure there are ways to make the game more appealing instead of maintaining production lines.			"

Early Access Review
								I recently purchased the game and have played it for a little while (as you can undoubtedly tell), and I thought I would add my perspective.I really enjoy city builders, and was hoping I would get that when I bought it; what I received wasn't quite what I expected, but in a good way! While it is listed as a city builder, it would be more accurate to call it a base builder (anyone familiar with Stronghold will feel at home with this one).Please bear in mind that I don't really care for the hard levels which have natural disasters, enemies, &c, preferring instead to have a leisurely and peaceful game; therefore, your experience may vary. Yes, I realise that may make me a wimp, but some of us don't enjoy getting our bases wiped out because we're terrible tacticians. :PThe positive stuff:1. Very Good: In my opinion, there are two mechanics within Project AURA which are absolutely fantastic; one of them is the item system. Each building has a blueprint that allows you to choose any additional ""modules"" (for lack of a better term) to add to the main structure, and you can also adjust where everything sits in the blueprint (a very nice feature as well, given the space constraints at the beginning). Once you have everything set up, you click on a button with the Market symbol on it and, once you confirm the purchase, all of the needed materials are bought at once. No more jumping back and forth and writing down/memorising what you need to get and in what amount; that button purchases all of the materials at once (which is extremely helpful for me because the going back and forth s*** makes me want to stab myself in the eye to experience something less agonising).2. Very Good: The second fantastic mechanic is the ability to find out what anything requires in terms of the ""recipe"" in order to make it (a la Minecraft, Subnautica, etc). F2 opens up a window that enables you to determine what you need to build something. You click and hold the object, move it over to the window and put it in the appropriate slot, and there you go.3. Good: No micromanaging!4. Good: I have a decent graphics card (GeForce GTX 960) and experienced absolutely no lag/stuttering. I have the graphics on High and it works just fine for me.5. Good: I went to the company's forum page and it would appear they are pretty good at responding to people who post messages, which is a positive sign.6. Trivial: The different occupations are indicated by different helmets. I must admit that is a new mechanic for me and I don't bother remembering which one goes to what profession, but it's actually pretty cool all the same.The negative stuff:1. Bad (conditional): The only real issue I have is the disjointedness in some aspects of the game. While there is nothing game-breaking or requiring anger management courses, some of the item/building/material descriptions can be confusing and/or lack information. By way of example, one of the power creating buildings tells you it increases power intake, but there is no indication in the power screen that it is doing so. I eventually figured out that it delivers a single packet of energy at the beginning of the day. Certain items have requirements that aren't immediately apparent, which has led to some frustration. However, these are easy things to forgive because they are still working on it (and, as mentioned before, the developers seem to be taking an active interest in hearing what players have to say on these issues, so these issues should be eliminated/corrected in a future patch).2. Trivial: The somewhat primitive camera. You can move in the usual manner with the WASD keys, and zoom in with the wheel, but that's about it. This is not a camera function I am accustomed to, so it took some getting familiar with it.3. Trivial: You'll be waiting a lot at the beginning while your ships gather items.All in all, this is your standard base builder like many others of its type, but the very useful mechanics regarding items and the ability to know what you need to build something modestly places it ahead. While it does have some issues, they are expected and/or trivial, making them reasonably negligible.Regardless, I continue to play it and look forward to seeing what the developers do with this game in the future.-S			"

								Very good game for an early access. I've been playing for a while and I love it. The gameplay is very unique on some aspects, and familiar on others.With the addition of the tutorial the gameplay is much easier to get the hold of the game. I am very excited for this big ""beta 3"" coming next month!  We are getting a lot of more features.Really looking forward to it ^^ "

Early Access Review
								Firstly, for a bit of a back story (Feel free to skip to the actual review):I originally noticed the game on steam greenlight back in February of last year. It seemed interesting enough, so I supported it. The next day, I logged on and noticed it had been fully supported. Ok, so now the wait. Pretty soon after, I noticed that about 3 minutes after I logged in one morning, an announcement was posted that their website just went up and preorders were now available. Keep in mind during the wait between, videos and such were posted as teasers. Within 3 seconds of the announcement going up, I was already on the purchase page clicking order (I was actually the first to preorder the game). After ordering, and checking the timeline, the wait was on. Then after almost a year later, the day finally came when keys were being sent out. I had a problem receiving my key at first, however it was quickly sorted out. Shortly after it came out I imediately started playing to learn as much as I could about it, and have used that knowledge to help develope the Wikia for it along with Nomeg.Now for the actual review:1:) TutorialAfter initially playing on Beta 1 (Before steam early access), I noticed the tutorials were a bit too quick. They didn't cover everything in Beta 2 (They still don't, this should be improved later on). You were able to fly though them all in about 10 minutes. The graphics are excellent, even on the lowest settings (Which I play at simply for recording purposes). It covered most of the controls in game very well, as well as a few other details which are very handy. One thing that they didn't seem to cover for the actual sandbox mode, is how to get certain objects such as fertilizer. After playing around for a bit, I was taken back to the employment tutorial, and I realized that all buildings have employment setups (This includes the residential buildings). With that in mind I was able to start production on fertilizer, however it's a slow process and the the tutorial also didn't go over how to speed the game up, and still doesn't (Again, should be updated later on). Other then the few things it doesn't show you how to do, it was an enjoyable experience.2:) Main Game (Sandbox mode)Upon the launch of the sandbox mode, You are taken into a blank ""Atlantis"" looking platform center. At this point, it's easy to become confused and make it seem like you were robbed out of about $15. However, after playing around enough, I was able to find the market place and find the objects I needed to purchase in order to start on residential housing. From there, I focused on getting a steady steam of items in work for my colony to self sustain itself. Doing this was a bit tricky, as the tutorial also doesn't go over how the production cycles work, how to maximize production cycles, or even tell you what buildings can do what. The building menu lists the name of the building, however not what it does or needs (excluding materials, it does show this, I meant as in worker types, etc.). The layout could use a bit of a change to include a description of what the building does and such in my opinion. Another thing I noticed is that sometimes the errors were a bit buggy (before the hotfix) and would show in spanish, even if the game was set to english. At points, there were also times were I was confused why there are still things in the current version that shouldn't be there (Since they aren't fully working, turns out this was to save time for the next release) and why certain things weren't working such as the shields or extra cargo storage for ships. In the current release, the risk factor tends to skyrocket at points, and will sit at 100% even though the system that's being developed for it (Can't tell you guys what it is, but you're going to like it) isn't implemented just yet. There were also a few other bugs that are there, but overall, nothing that greatly effects the gameplay itself. Now while the game does just toss you in with minimal help from the tutorial (at the time of this review), and some may give it negative reviews because of that, keep in mind there were other games that did the same thing and turned out to be highly supported. Games such as Life is Feudal and Banished do the same thing. Now, please keep in mind as an early access beta game, I am basing my review off of the gameplay itself, not anything else since this is how games at this stage should be rated.Graphics: As a laptop user, it's hard for me to play games at max settings sometimes. This game can be hard on my computer from time to time, especially while recording. That being said though, even on the lowest settings, the graphics are still very well done, clean, crisp, and smooth. I've tried changing the settings, and between High and Low settings, there is very minimal difference from what I could tell aside from the animations and extra particles. 10/10 for graphics.Sound: The sound at times can be annoying, particularly when in the main menu, or when dragging objects around from one place to another (loud annoying base sound, rip headphone users). There is also a lack of ambient sounds, however this will be added later on. For now though, there is a very nice background album, very reminiscent of kerbal space program. Given the futuristic theme to the game, the music fits in well for it. 7/10 on sound.Gameplay: The overall gameplay isn't bad. It isn't necessarily good, however it isn't bad. While it could use some improvements and will be receiving some, the current core gameplay tends to leave you feeling like it needs something more. As for what, I'm not sure, we will have to see on a future update. The gameplay is smooth, however due to the lack of what the tutorial teaches you, it's also a bit challenging. It adds a nice mix for a while, until you get the hang of the game, which then leaves you feeling empty and at times, bored. It has a nice blend of micromanagement to it, and an overall decent feel. Most of the GUI is well designed, although as I mentioned earlier, some of it could use a redesign especially when it comes to the construction menu. I will give the gameplay a 7/10 as well. As I stated, it could use some improvements and I know some are coming, however as I stated based on the current gameplay it's decent. Not bad, not good or great, but it's playable, and enjoyable for the most part.Why I recommend this game:Let me put it to you like I did for NoBull and a few others when they asked me what this game is like. If you like Banished, Anno 2070, SimCity, or X-COM, then you will like this, because the basis is like Banished, meets X-Com, meets Simcity in a sense with an Anno 2070 plot. Or as NoBull reworded it, it's like Banished and Anno 2070 had a baby and this is that baby. It currently has the potential to become a great game, given enough support and feedback. The devs are constantly talking to players, getting their opinions, and working with people when they have problems with bugs or other problems. It runs like a dream on low end machines unlike other city builders or survival simulators, yet that maintains clear, crisp HD look and feel. If you manage to brush aside the little bugs and issues with the current version, the gameplay is very enjoyable, and is easy to play for hours on end (So much so that you will probably lose track of time). Also some of you may wish to wait to purchase it until it becomes more stable, however I would like to remind you that playing with bugs may be worth it in the long run, since we all know after games come off early access you will be spending more money on it (Which for some may not be a problem, however I am addressing the ones that can't always afford to do so).Overall, I give the game a 8/10 rating.

Status;""IN PROGRESS""Slow and steady wins the race, very slow it seems and very steady?! It is like watching paint dry at times in game development, but at the end, you have beautiful color and highlights to any room when finally finished. Provided you did not have an electical fire or run out of paint, in which case Project Aura would be listed as ""Progress Inhibited"".This title has been in EA for a very long time. Over a year and half ago, and there has been very little progress, but progress none the less, so strap one on and pack a lunch! This one is in it for the very very very very... long haul.Still a two man team, with no agenda in sight or plans listed for development agenda. Oh, and thanks for responding a while ago guys, which means devs are active, but where is the major patch? Actually, what do you consider Major? We know what we consider that term to mean in the Enlgish Language :-) But keep plugging away gang... any update keeps you ""IN PROGRESS"".Give it a thumbs up for now because it is playable, and because they added spanish voiceover which was cool for their video and they havent stopped working on it even tho it has been nearly 1.5 years.Good things come to those that wait... but I dont have that long, but will keep checking like always!Discalimer; The Review Crew's evaluations are based on paying close attention to forum response and activity, system demand, fun of the game genre, position of originality in respective genre, growth of the project in its current state at time of review, graphics as a whole for end user, presentation of the game and display, replayability, patch/tweak progress, beginner friendliness & gameplay direcction, content & depth, attention to detail on small things(polish), lag and multiplayer application if applicable, badge card availability, with a minimum 8 hours of gameplay and interaction with customer base after release.

								There are problems with this game. I understand this is in beta development and all, but there are some issues that are straight up there.1) The starting play: it is the same thing no matter what. The building footprints are such that you cannot do anything with variety. There are certain things that are required and the only way to satisfy them is by getting ""cheats"" by buying them rather than earning them as part of the planning and play of the game. 2) Since the life is important, the medical stuff should not be so difficult to get to, yet one must get at things that by the time you are ready, there is not enough funds to do anything. There is no building up to anything and then the personel just start to die because you can't get the medical stuff up without spending to get there. 3) the trade system is not there at all. There has to be a way to earn the funds needed without having to always buy and sell them. The ""trade"" system is just a way to get what is there already but not available by any progression.At a price of $20, one would expect more playability and it just is not there. It is so not there that it is hard to believe that there is any development to make it there. The graphics are definately a draw. I think the devo-team should take a step back and really look at this as I see the potential that is there. But, right now, it is not worth $10.			"

								Really want to like this game. Been following for years. Purchased in order to support the vision.BUTEven for Early Access this game is pretty messed up in terms of quality. With the latest update, text doesn't appear in the right spot or doesn't register roll-over properly and disappears unless I move the mouse just so. Combined with an incredibly unfriendly UI design and that makes this game a definite NO recommendation. If you want to be an alpha tester... sure. But playing this game (for me) feels like I'm back at my old job debugging other people's crappy programs.The tutorials are ok (they take an HOUR to complete!), but what the game really needs is some kind of advisor who helps you out with the REAL colony you start by reminding you of what to do.

								Making a game complicated does not mean you made it challenging, once past the learning curve this game offers very little substance. This is a building game that offers one linear path in order to accomplish anything. There is no variation and you can customize very little, other than how things look a little bit. This is a developer in my opinion who needs to spend a little bit of time playing Banished to get an idea of how to make a game feel like you are making choices for your city building survival. The illusion that you are in control of anything is based on when you choose to implement your citizens but it ends there. This game has a long way to go in order to be a great simulation game in my view and based on how it is made, I am not sure we will see the changes necessary to make it such.			"

								I only played a little bit of this game but at the moment I don't recomend it.It has allot to do with depth vs complexity and Project Aura is very complex and thats saddly not the compliment it sounds. The tutorial was bare bones at best and hardly set me up to undestand what I needed to do when I started the game, and even after looking up external videos about the best way to start the game I was still at a loss. At the moment managing things is to much of a pain unless your really ready to dedicat yourself to it and I was not. There are a few parts I could recomend, its aesthetics for one are a very good choice and I feel limiting the space you can work with would provide a fun challenge.

Early Access Review
								This game promotes pretty good, but owning it thus far has not been entertaining at all.  Yes, I know it's early access at this point and it's not done, but I do want to make some constructive criticisms.First off, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the game concept and feel it needs some refining.  The premise behind the game is that a future society is in a cryo-stasis and is using technology to allow someone (you) from the past to restore their society and ""wake them up"" and begin the process of repopulation and restoration of life on the planet.  I don't get why only certain types of classes of personell are available at some random time.  If they're all in cryo, what's the problem with getting access to them?And what's with the stores?  If eveyone on the planet is in cryo, who am I buying from?  It would make more sense to me if there was a cache of materials and that's all there is, the rest I have to procure on my own.Thus far orders given to buildings to produce are not repeating.  The production rates are varying for each shelter so once a resource is found to be short, the building just stops.  You're constantly having to go back to buildings to check on their status...  down right annoying.And finally, the remaining aspect of the game is akin to watching paint dry.  It's nothing more than an animated spreadsheet at present and needs something more to make it entertaining to play.			"

Early Access Review
								As of today I feel I am going to change my review to a Not recommended.Its been almost a year since I bought the game, and its only gone up a few decmal points in editions.I had been helping the developer with ideas and such, getting first hand info, and was told on many occasions that edition 3.0 was going to be the start of many game fundamental things that limited the game or made many of the current mechanics broken or pointless or just lacking.I am appart of a game development team myself, so I wanted to wait to change my reivew giving them more than what should be a fair amount of time to include these features.I still think the game has promise, so I am leaving my old review under this one and will change it back to a yes once the devs start showing more effort on finishing this game.July 27 2015I think this game is worth the buy, it has very well built foundation, and only has room to grow. I have already played for 80+ hours, and the content that is meant for play time such as quests and missions are not even implimented yet.  So I hope to get my play time well over 200 hours when those hit the release shelf.The progress seems to be a bit slower than most alpha titles, but its obvious they are working hard and most of the efforts are in the tasks that we do not see as players.    I would rather have the game made on a task by task approach than just publishing stuff new every few weeks to keep the nay sayers happy about when the next update.Getting an update that is solid over how much it adds to the game seems to be the attitude of PQG.Now from personal experience you can never be satisfied with the state, so for them to pump out the updates they have put out with the massivly low amount of game bugs and glitches, I say keep on guys.The only bug I have really EVER!!! had with this game was no audio, but that has been solved, so now I really have nothing to complain about other than mabye things like I wish you did this instead type of changes.

								Mixed opinions about the game. While I do enjoy playing, it has a long ways to go and would not recommend this to the average person. Most of this review points out negative parts of this game but I will say I enjoyed it and hope the dev continues to give this gem some love it deserves.My first 5 hours of gameplay was restarting the game multiple times learning from my mistakes with the lack of information given or intuitiveness of the game. There is a voice interactive tutorial and F1 for help screen but it's not enough for you to really get started. You will need guides or to watch lets plays which means you;re going to have spoilers instead of discovering the game for yourself. I really hate it when game require a wiki. I just do.The first issue is early game every building is unlocked and are game over landmines because they are useless...I built a recycling center only to find out it had no use. Later I saw on youtube a guy bought organic waste to process so I built it again in another game and sure enough the market didn't sell it for me. Money down the drain. I built the garden thing. It wanted apple seeds yet the market only had tomato seeds. It took forever fiddling around, looking at things in the market, wondering if I had the building setup correctly to find a small gear icon to change what a building can produce. A+ tutorial. I built the lowest tier housing to find out you can't produce enough food (hard mode) but block housing does alright. So why are the basic houses even in the game?Built the medical station because all my guys were at 50% health and didn't want them to die. Turns out I didn't need one. First time I've ever played a game where if you're at 50% health don't worry about it, it's considered average health, not half way dead.Build the second type of research building. Again a waste of money because things like invention cards aren't in the game but we will let you wast money on the building itself.Next issue is things are in the game that aren't usable. I already mention the second research building being useless. At the top of the screen are research points. I'm trying to learn the ins and outs of this game I don't need to discover parts of the main UI has info of no use in the current version of the game. I click on tech button and it says coming in beta 3. Don't put this stuff in the game if it has no use whatsoever.Next issue is the start of the game is a grind and not in a fun way. The type of grind on mobile games where you come back in a few hours. Even at 8x speed getting some cash to advance takes forever. Mandatory 2 to 3 hour grind when starting a new game to even gather a pittance of cash to be able to do anything with it. I leave teh game running for 20 minute periods while I go do something else. That reminds me of mobile, not pc gaming. I like a challenge but not the wait times. Give us a x16 and x32 speed.Had game crash after 2 hours of play from my last save. Lost all progress from population 50 to 150. I'm sorry but I am done with this grind fest game. Making things take forever is not fun or challenging. Makes me not want to play again.			"

								Project AURA sure would be a nice game, if it was finished. The main current issue is that the game is pointless, just set up your base and you're done. There are no interactions with the outside, no objectives, no events so the game quickly becomes extremely boring.However, the building micromanagement system is very promising.			"

								Some aspects of the game become so weirdly complicated and technical it becomes more of a chore instead of a game. They have added a lot of features and different things, giving it a just massive collage of stuff and even harder to understand some aspects. Now some aspects are very easy! But its potential as a game is very high they just ruin it in some functions.The Graphics are great, my main criticism is it needs to not be calculator looking. It has great potential, just needs to tone down on all the technicality and make it more basic of a game, and get rid of all the calculator theme for the numbers, its ugly.Ill change my review once I see some progress.

								I've given this game most of a day, and I suspect I will give it more.  Here's my main gripe. After 6 hours, I think I finally figured out how to start a colony.  Which isn't bad; I don't mind complexity.  And AURA is definitely complex.The problem is it crashes a lot if you switch between programs (alt+tabbing).  That wouldn't be a problem, except that the four tutorials the game offers barely cover what's required.  So reading wikis and watching videos online are almost mandatory.I think this game has a lot of promise, but right now it is too raw for me to recommened.			"

								All in all a brilliant concept with good graphics and in depth colony management. The game tackles the problems of the ever changing climates of our planet by allowing you to remotely manage a colony in the future. I play quite alot of colony sims such as the old fragile allegiance to the modern banished and I do believe this game has massive potential.However.. The interface is not very intuitive alot of them are rather clunky and crude.At this moment this severely detracts from the experience and makes the game only for people withgreat patience and intuition.As it stands, I cant recommend the game quite yet. So for my own part I definitely will be looking at the updated versions from time to time to see if it's improved any as it really has great potential.			"

								There's a promising core here but as of June 2015 the game is not worth playing. The tutorials do a terrible job of explaining how the game actually plays. You'll learn what most of the buttons do but not the overall picture. They show you how to set up the *second* production step for basic food (raw seaweed+fertilizer->food rations), then dump you into the game. Good luck figuring out where you're supposed to get those ingredients to start with.The graphics are surprisingly good for this type of game, but it's only skin deep. The camera controls are finicky and won't let you zoom out enough to get a decent panorama view. Buildings look interesting and many have cool work animations, but there's almost zero information conveyed. The salvage planes flying in and out are pretty cool; now if only I could distinguish between the three types, or what materials they're carrying. Even the platforms that you expand onto lack clarity. You have to build the floor and the power system separately (again, something the tutorial and help screens fail to explain). The difference between an unpowered platform (that you can't build on) and a powered platform (that you can) is a thin line around the edge that glows red.The UI is your worst enemy. You'll find yourself clicking through the same menus over and over again because the important controls are hidden behind three layers. Meanwhile, there are eight top-level buttons that have hotkeys. These include three rarely-needed status/upgrade menus, one temperamental and out-of-theme building menu, and two menus for features that *aren't implemented yet*.There's no good overview menu. It's hard to even manage your inventory to see what items you have and what you need; forget about seeing the flow of production in your colony. You can't even see whether your buildings are working or not without carefully mouse-overing each one. And if you do see something is stopped, you'll still need to click through to figure out why. Did it run out of input materials? Did you forget to click the ""run forever"" button? Did you click that button, but not the ""restart when new materials are ready"" button? And if you forget what this building is even producing, don't worry, that's an extra click. On each production line.As previously mentioned, key game components are still missing, notably the research system. This actually wouldn't be a big deal except that the system is half-implemented. So you can building research labs and produce research tokens (color-coded science items), but then the only thing to do with those tokens is sell them on the market.			"

								I was excited about this game until it came to the organization charts management interface where you have to allocate every person to every role. And then it felt like work and it sucked the fun out of it. Org charts in the ocean basically. I personally like more autonomous agents in games like City Skylines and Planetbase rather than allocating each person to a job as in this game. It felt too micro-managey for my taste.			"

								Pros:The game seems fairly refined Cons:The UI is unecessarily complicated and obtuse. Don't get me wrong, it's understandable and not too hard to figure out, but still not pleasant to work with.Multiple menus are generally required to perform any action, and basic actions require more individual steps than required. The actions of your colony don't happen right in front of you.It seems like there's unecessary micromanagement without adding enough interesting depth - you're planning out every detail of your colonists lives and organizationThe build space is fairly inflexible and doesn't expand organicallyAn example of several of these problems happens when you need to feed people, you might need to purchase something from a market place, then drag it from inventory to a larder, then use the larder to design a meal. An alternate would just be having colonists eat what they need from inventory. But, basically every other aspect of the game suffers from this problem.Overall, if you're going to play a colony sim, try something else			"

Simply trying to re-assign a worker is a nightmare.  Some may call this fun, to me it's like another job, no fun at all, I thought that was what games were meant to be.			"

								The game starts with a tutorial of to run the colony. Upon learning this you get the chance to run and build your colony, followinging additional progressive objectives. When playing these types of survival games the priority for me is do i feel compelled to build this colony? Do I feel the game? For me it was slightly there but mostly in a curiosity capacity. The game felt clunky and I didn't get the desire to spend hours playing it. When comparing it with a game like Planet Base i feel it has a lot to improve upon. I would not suggest this game as it currently is.			"

								The game seems interesting at first but it's very disappointing once you get the whole idea. It's extremely slow and boring. It feels like nothing happens. Increasing speed doesn't help game still feels dead.In other city sims you see people, traffic, events.. here nothing happens.There is a basic tutorial but limited to essentials, after that you are on your own so you have to learn it the hard way by playing again and again until you figure out how everything works. Some of the functions are disabled for beta (e.g. research)No help, no info tips, interface is broken, several panels around screen for no apparent reason. Things that should be together are apart. Several unknown stats. Numbers and numbers..But if you want to check how much money you have, you have to open your storage panel!Colors are mostly white and grey not just the interface but the whole game..Creating a colony is a very slow process. Production is micromanagement nightmare.You start with very basic, the food, you need to buy, build, employ lots of stuff and citizens to produce the most basic food.Every building needs a director which comes from colonist pool the ""Vital Reserve"" they are random so if he is not there you wait or exchange one of the colonists for the one you want at a price.After director you need to buy blueprints for production, e.g. Seaweed fattening and Seaweed drying blueprints. And of course you need farmers and operators in each blueprint.And finally you need resources to produce which you have to buy from the market or get them from Recycler another building more blueprints, more citizens etc etc.If you need to produce something more complicate it becomes a real nightmare, you need lots more buildings, blueprints and to start producing item A, you need B and C, but for B you need D and F similarly for C.... it's just crazy. This game is no fun at all.. it's masochism...I'm very experienced in strategy and city sim games this one feels undeveloped, slow, unprofessional, boring.It could be improved a lot if production is simplified, interface redesigned, and put some spirit into it, something to keep you interested.In this state the game is terrible, I regret for buying it.

Project Aura ReviewSo I started playing this game thinking it may be a civilization kind of game or at the very least a trimmed down version of it. Sadly what I found was a game touted as Beta when the game barely qualifies as an Alpha.The first black eye comes in the tutorial system, not only is it short(which to some may be a blessing)but also entirely inadequate for teaching you the game. Some people like going in blind, but you game should at least the absolute basics, which it kinda does and doesn't.Next sucker punch is no rebindable keys or even a listing of what the keys do. I understand it's beta, but that kind of thing takes all of five minutes to do.Next up is the performance...oh my the perfromance. The game is not high activity, high resulution and could easily pass for a game made between 2005 and 2007. I know optimization is typically the last thing dev teams do, but the fact that a game as bland looking as this tanks a 980 with no problems leaves much to be desired. Also after the review I noticed the game eating up 4.3 GB of ram...I can run 4 mmos at the same time and it doesn't eat up that much(that much ram for basically ♥♥♥♥ all going on).The next problem is everything is missing, aside from the fiddly micromanagement of the colonists and the builtings, there is nothing else to do. Four different systems are missing from the game(Yes I know, Beta is beta) but, it leaves it bare bones and boring. It doesn't qualify as a beta if more than 50% of the games functionality is missing(in this case 75% or more is AWAL).Lastly, mechanics. Colinists drop jobs randomly without telling you, clicks don't register properly sometimes, stupid corperation system that makes the game feel like I'm playing some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cow clicker mobile game. The game also runs at a snails pace early on AND doesn't run in the backround at all(also windowed mode is busted slightly). Top this off with getting the right job roulette at the right time makes the game more a test of your iron patience than skill.Honestly you can get civ 3 complete for 5$ now or even get civ 4 on steam duringa sale for around 10-15$. As of now the asking price of 15$ is too much for a game that is basically a very bare Alpha.Maybe when they get some of the other systems working will it be worth taking a look at, but for now there are better things to spend your money on.﻿the video review can be found here:

								If I'm going to pay money for a supposed 'game' then it should be able to have descriptions applied along the lines of 'engrossing', 'entertaining', and 'fun'.When I gave this game a try, as of 17/3/2015, I napped half the time.Therefore 'engrossing', 'entertaining', and 'fun', cannot possibly be applied.I'm exceedingly sorry I spent money on this.I really -REALLY- hope it improves as admittedly I find the background story/concept attractive. However in it's current state I CANNOT recommend paying for it.Some feedback I would give to the dev from the time I've wasted on it so far:- ""Are you ready?"" confirmation is redundant.- If you're going to have a time scale (cycles/days), and give the ability to adjust the game speed, then the passing of time should be linked to the adjustment of game speed. It would probably have meant I wouldn'tve ended up falling asleep at the keyboard. Also, letting the player know that 'cycle' basically equals a game hour would have been a good thing. Also (again), when you do get the link between adjustment of game speed and the games actual speed fixed, I'm thinking there'll be a few players (I'm one of them) who'll want faster speeds than x4. x10 would be good. Perhaps even faster, I'll have to see what it's like at x10.- Why can't I have maintenance modules separate to other work modules and then link them so that one maintenance module can be applied to multiple work modules?- Why am I applying multiple transport modules to the same pad? Why can't one transportation module apply to all buildings on the same pad?- The degree of experience of employees affects the rate at which the module/part works, and also degrades. In which case, why can't I expand the building, after it's already been laid down, with additional module/parts for the ones that are falling behind?- If I'm told there is 6 new people available to wake, then there should be 6, not 4 or 3. And yes, I did check the different tabs for the differing experience levels.Now, hopefully the dev has plans to adjust the above in their roadmap. But above all else, until the point in time where the adjustment of game speed also affects the passing of game time, I CANNOT recommend this 'game' to anyone.Being so bored that I'm falling asleep is a sad indictment on it's current state.

However the User interface mechanics of the market and building are poorly designed, the game lacks any sense for the play & learn portion, i personally like the tutorial either built into the first save, or the play while learning, The user interface lacks intuition, i had to find videos and rewatch the tutorial cause i personally don't like the manner in which the tutorial is made. They lack the 'fun' factor of learning how to play the game and are more education demonstrations, aswell as the Bot character aid is quite obnoxious in her voice, graiding on the ears and becomes quite annoying quite quickly and too easily gives me feels of a glados rip off from portal series, i understand the game is in beta, and will watch the updates, im looking forward to the military one, but im already wishing i could get a refund for my friends 15$ gifting me this			"

								I understand the idea behind early access, I really do. But this game is almost unplayable. The tutorial doesn't teach much beyond camera movement and while the UI looks pretty and is fairly functional, it's not at all intuitive, so you are left to sort it all out on your own. This makes it a very frustrating experience overall. I really do hope it gets better, but as of now, the creators have made what looks like a great game that only they know how to play. If you want to click through screen after screen and continue to get more and more confused while accomplishing nothing, then this is the game for you.Obviously, in it's current state I cannot recommend, as there is no evidence that this will turn into a viable product, but I can hold out hope that my $15 wasn't spent in vain.If I were you, I would just hold out on this title - you're not missing anything.

								Bought it 2 days ago but tutorial is very poor and too complicated to understand. You can't just go in and play it, need a degree in science!Got a refund from Steam.Perhaps as it's early access the develpers will improve it but they should've made a good tutorial for new gamers to start with. I can't wait that long especially as I think it's been around for a while as there are lets play videos on youtube which don't help either.			"

								Lacks any kind of atmosphere or charm to draw you into the game. Systems to streamline production on the UI end of things are non existent (If you want to buy 200 of a resource, click the button 200 times), and the in-game tutorials cover just enough to let you know that the game is complex without covering all the basic information you'll need to play effectively. If you absolutely feel the need to play this game, just play around in excel. The ambiance will be better.I'm aware that this game is still in early access, but I've played plenty of early access games that were actually accessible.Interesting concept, poor execution, 2/10			"

								Game still needs lots of work.  Still crashing.But beware of posting in the Project Aura Steam forum.I called them out on putting an Autosave feature in the options and then not having it work at all. I told them it should have been left out until working or at least let us know it didn't work or even gray it out. They acknowledged it didn't work and the developer banned me for my suggestions and deleted my post. So watch out if you don't agree with what they do. Looks like we have another developer like Derek Smart or the Stardrive developer (Zero) who like to ban if they don't agree with you.PixelQuality Games you shouldn't make things up in your response just because I called you out on an integriy issue. Putting an Autosave option in the game and knowing that it won't work whether it's enabled or not is pretty deceitful. How many other features are you doing that with?Update: Too bad it took me getting banned for the devs to wake up and put the Autosave feature in. Nice way to develop your game.			"

								not a good or entertaining game by any means and just is a waste of money and i refunded it when i had the chance plyed the tutorial and a bit of the game and i was utterly unimpressed with the lackluster management and ""totally original"" building system, thats it its all thats in the game, 2 features that werent even done correctly or even playable seriously boring. the UI is completely confusing and limits your ability to do the very few things the game allows to begin with, i love indie games but not the super ♥♥♥♥ty ones. i know i havent played much but that is because it is less fun than BANGING YOUR HEAD ON THE WALL! it has less base building depth than fallout 3. which means nearly none, and sadly base building is this entire game! haha! i dont understand why people enjoy this total piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥in a doggy bag on fire. this game is less satisfying than eating the nothingness out in space and offers up as many new features as flappy bird. and with the horribly unintuitive controls, is about as frustrating as flappy bird too. this game reminds me of the stereotype for jewish people. crazy about getting your money, ugly, and hard to deal with. hey at least the soundtrack is uhh well um tolerable. PROS: it does a good jo of making you feel........... ripped off (lol kinda)soundtrack is ok i guessit has a cool.... name?im scraping the very bottom of the barrel for things that are a least halfway decent.it was an indie game atleast so we dont have another reason to hate EA or whatever other company-looking at you Ubisoft.people eating seaweed, making sure no more fish get addicted to waterjuanagraphics are good!CONS: Horrible UIBad tutorialsWTF? storyline no depth whatsoeverpeople like eating seaweed? wtf.generally not fun and for people that enjoy fun (not including hipster ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) its just not a good buy, go ahead and try it though (if you dont like it get a refund) lets see... what else is a thing in this game? oh right, a complete and utter lack of features and essential things to make any type of media bearable.missing a reason to spend more than 30 minutes of your precious time on.(will update when i think of more funny ways to convey the information that this game is horrid)			"
